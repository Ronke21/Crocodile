<text>, also known by the &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; construction , is a genre of Japanese media focusing on intimate relationships between female characters. While lesbian relationships are a commonly associated theme, the genre is also inclusive of works depicting emotional and spiritual relationships between women that are not necessarily romantic or sexual in nature. &quot;Yuri&quot; is most commonly associated with anime and manga, though the term has also been used to describe video games, light novels, and literature.

Themes associated with &quot;yuri&quot; originate from Japanese lesbian fiction of the early twentieth century, notably the writings of Nobuko Yoshiya and literature in the Class S genre. Manga depicting female homoeroticism began to appear in the 1970s in the works of artists associated with the Year 24 Group, notably Ryoko Yamagishi and Riyoko Ikeda. The genre gained wider popularity beginning in the 1990s; the founding of &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot; in 2003 as the first manga magazine devoted exclusively to &quot;yuri&quot;, followed by its successor &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; in 2005, led to the establishment of &quot;yuri&quot; as a discrete publishing genre and the creation of a &quot;yuri&quot; fan culture.

As a genre, &quot;yuri&quot; does not inherently target a single gender demographic, unlike its male homoerotic counterparts boys&#x27; love (BL, marketed towards a female audience) and gay manga (marketed towards a gay male audience). Although &quot;yuri&quot; originated as a genre targeted towards a female audience, &quot;yuri&quot; works have been produced that target a male audience, as in manga from &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot;″s male-targeted sister magazine &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot;.

==Terminology and etymology ==

===&quot;Yuri&quot;===
The word translates literally to &quot;lily&quot;, and is a relatively common Japanese feminine name. White lilies have been used since the Romantic era of Japanese literature to symbolize beauty and purity in women, and are a de facto symbol of the &quot;yuri&quot; genre.

In 1976, Ito Bungaku, editor of the gay men&#x27;s magazine , used the term in reference to female readers of the magazine in a column of letters titled . While not all women whose letters appeared in &quot;Yurizoku no Heya&quot; were lesbians, and it is unclear whether the column was the first instance of the term &quot;yuri&quot; in this context, an association of &quot;yuri&quot; with lesbianism subsequently developed. For example, the male-male romance magazine &quot;Allan&quot; began publishing in July 1983 as a personal ad column for &quot;lesbiennes&quot; to communicate.

The term came to be associated with lesbian pornographic manga beginning in the 1990s, notably through the manga magazine &quot;Lady&#x27;s Comic Misuto&quot; (1996–1999), which heavily featured symbolic lily flowers. When the term &quot;yuri&quot; began being used in the west in the 1990s, it was similarly used almost exclusively to describe pornographic manga aimed at male readers featuring lesbian couples. Over time, the term drifted from this pornographic connotation to describe the portrayal of intimate love, sex, or emotional connections between women, and became broadly recognized as a genre name for works depicting same-sex female intimacy in the mid-2000s following the founding of the specialized &quot;yuri&quot; manga magazines &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot; and &quot;Comic Yurihime&quot;. The Western use of &quot;yuri&quot; subsequently broadened beginning in the 2000s, picking up connotations from the Japanese use. American publishing companies such as ALC Publishing and Seven Seas Entertainment have also adopted the Japanese usage of the term to classify their &quot;yuri&quot; manga publications.

In Korea and China, &quot;lily&quot; is used as a semantic loan from the Japanese usage to describe female-female romance media, where each use the direct translation of the term – &quot;baekhap&quot; (백합) in Korea and &quot;bǎihé&quot; (百合) in China.

===Girls&#x27; love===
The &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; construction and its abbreviation &quot;GL&quot; were adopted by Japanese publishers in the 2000s, likely as an antonym of the male-male romance genre boys&#x27; love (BL). While the term is generally considered synonymous with &quot;yuri&quot;, in rare cases it is used to denote &quot;yuri&quot; media that is sexually explicit, following the publication of the erotic &quot;yuri&quot; manga anthology &quot;Girls Love&quot; by Ichijinsha in 2011. However, this distinction is infrequently made, and &quot;yuri&quot; and &quot;girls&#x27; love&quot; are almost always used interchangeably.

===&quot;Shōjo-ai&quot;===
In the 1990s, western fans began to use the term to describe &quot;yuri&quot; works that do not depict explicit sex. Its usage was modeled after the western appropriation of the term to describe BL works that do not feature sexually explicit content. In Japan, the term &quot;shōjo-ai&quot; is not used with this meaning, and instead denotes pedophilic relationships between adult men and girls.

==History==
===Before 1970: Class S literature===
Among the first Japanese authors to produce works about love between women was Nobuko Yoshiya, a novelist active in the Taishō and Shōwa periods. Yoshiya was a pioneer in Japanese lesbian literature, including the early twentieth century Class S genre. Her works popularized many of the ideas and tropes which drove the &quot;yuri&quot; genre for years to come. Class S stories depict lesbian attachments as emotionally intense yet platonic relationships, destined to be curtailed by graduation from school, marriage, or death. The root of this genre is in part the contemporary belief that same-sex love was a transitory and normal part of female development leading into heterosexuality and motherhood. Class S developed in the 1930s through Japanese girls&#x27; magazines, but declined as a result of state censorship brought about by the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Though homosociality between girls would re-emerge as a common theme in post-war &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (comics for girls), Class S gradually declined in popularity in favor of works focused on male-female romances.

Traditionally, Class S stories focus on strong emotional bonds between an upperclassman and an underclassman, or in rare cases, between a student and her teacher. Private all-girls schools are a common setting for Class S stories, which are depicted as an idyllic homosocial world reserved for women. Works in the genre focus heavily on the beauty and innocence of their protagonists, a theme that would recur in &quot;yuri&quot;. Critics have alternately considered Class S as a distinct genre from &quot;yuri&quot;, as a &quot;proto-&quot;yuri&quot;&quot;, and a component of &quot;yuri&quot;.

===1970s and 1980s: The &quot;dark age&quot;===
In 1970, manga artist Masako Yashiro published the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga , which focuses on a love triangle between two girls and a boy. Noted as the first non-Class S manga to depict an intimate relationship between women, &quot;Shīkuretto Rabu&quot; is regarded by some scholars as the first work in the &quot;yuri&quot; genre. As both Yashiro and &quot;Shīkuretto Rabu&quot; are relatively obscure and the work focuses in part on male-female romance, most critics identify &quot;Shiroi Heya no Futari&quot; by Ryōko Yamagishi, published in 1971, as the first &quot;yuri&quot; manga. The 1970s also saw &quot;shōjo&quot; manga that dealt with transgender characters and characters who blur gender distinctions through cross-dressing, which was inspired in part by the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female theater troupe where women play male roles. These traits are most prominent in Riyoko Ikeda&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; (1972–1973), &quot;Dear Brother&quot; (1975), and &quot;Claudine&quot; (1978). Some &quot;shōnen&quot; works of this period featured lesbian characters, though they were typically depicted as fanservice and comic relief.

Roughly a dozen &quot;yuri&quot; manga were published from the 1970s to the early 1990s, with the majority being published in the 1970s. Most of these stories are tragedies, focused on doomed relationships that end in separation or death. Owing to the small number of works published during this period and their generally tragic focus, &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot; has referred to the 1970s and 1980s as the &quot;dark age&quot; of &quot;yuri&quot;. Several theories have emerged to explain the bias towards tragic narratives present in this period. Writer and translator Frederik L. Schodt notes that the majority of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga published during this period were tragic, regardless of whether or not they were &quot;yuri&quot;. James Welker of Kanagawa University argues that these narratives represent a form of &quot;lesbian panic&quot;, where the character – and by extension, the author – refuses their own lesbian feelings and desires. Verena Maser suggests that the decline of Class S removed the only context in which intimate relationships between women were possible, while Yukari Fujimoto suggests that patriarchal forces were responsible for tragic endings in these stories.

===1990s: Mainstream popularity===
By the 1990s, tragic story formulas in manga had declined in popularity. 1992 saw the release of two major works for the development of &quot;yuri&quot;: &quot;Jukkai me no Jukkai&quot; (1992) by , which began to move the genre away from tragic outcomes and stereotyped dynamics; and the anime adaptation of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (1991–1997) by Naoko Takeuchi, the first mainstream manga and anime series to feature a &quot;positive&quot; portrayal of a lesbian relationship in the coupling of Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. The immense popularity of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; allowed the series to be adapted into anime, films, and to be exported internationally, significantly influencing the &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;yuri&quot; genres. Uranus and Neptune became popular subjects of &quot;dōjinshi&quot; (self-published manga, analogous to fan comics) and contributed to the development of &quot;yuri dōjinshi&quot; culture.

The success of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; significantly influenced the development of &quot;yuri&quot;, and by the mid-1990s, anime, and manga featuring intimate relationships between women enjoyed mainstream success and popularity. &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; director Kunihiko Ikuhara went on to create &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; (1997–1999), a &quot;shōjo&quot; anime series with female same-sex relationships as a central focus. This period also saw a revival of the Class S genre through the best-selling light novel series &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; (1998–2004) by , which by 2010 had 5.4 million copies in print. Another prominent author of this period is Kaho Nakayama, active since the early 1990s, with works involving love stories among women. The first Japanese magazines specifically targeted towards lesbians, many of which contained sections featuring &quot;yuri&quot; manga, also emerged during this period. Stories in these magazines ranged from high school romance to lesbian life and love and featured varying degrees of sexual content.

===2000s: Publishing and fan culture growth===

Faced with a proliferation of stories focused on homosociality, homoeroticism, and female homosexuality, some publishers sought to exploit the &quot;yuri&quot; market by creating manga magazines dedicated to the genre, coalescing around &quot;yuri&quot; as the preferred name for this genre in response to its popularity in &quot;dōjinshi&quot; culture. In 2003, &quot;Yuri Tengoku&quot; and &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot; launched as the first manga magazines devoted exclusively to &quot;yuri&quot;. This was followed by the female reader-oriented &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; in 2005 and the male reader-oriented &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot; in 2007; the two magazines merged under the title &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; in 2010.

Stories in these magazines dealt with a range of themes, from intense emotional connections such as those depicted in &quot;Voiceful&quot; (2004–2006), to sexually-explicit schoolgirl romances like those portrayed in &quot;First Love Sisters&quot; (2003–2008), and realistic tales about love between adult women such as those seen in &quot;The Conditions of Paradise&quot; (2007). Some of these subjects are seen in male-targeted works of this period as well, sometimes in combination with other themes, including mecha and science fiction. Examples include series such as &quot;Kannazuki no Miko&quot; (2004–2005), &quot;Blue Drop&quot; (2004–2008), and &quot;&quot; (2004–2007). In addition, male-targeted stories tend to make extensive use of &quot;moe&quot; and &quot;bishōjo&quot; characterizations.

The publication of &quot;yuri&quot; magazines had the effect of nurturing a &quot;&quot;yuri&quot; culture&quot; that influenced artists to create works depicting female same-sex relationships. Further, articles in these magazines contributed to the history of the genre by retroactively labeling certain works as &quot;yuri&quot;, thus developing &quot;a historical canon of the &quot;yuri&quot; genre.&quot; Specifically, Verena Maser notes in her analysis of issues of &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot;, &quot;Comic Yurihime&quot;, and &quot;Comic Yurihime S&quot; published from 2003 to 2012 that eight of the ten most-referenced series in the magazines predate the 2003 formalization of &quot;yuri&quot; as a publishing genre: &quot;Apurōzu - Kassai&quot; (1981–1985), &quot;Sakura no Sono&quot; (1985–1986), &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (1992–1996), &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; (1996–2000), &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot; (1998–2012), &quot;Loveless&quot; (2002–present), and &quot;Strawberry Marshmallow&quot; (2002–present).

===2010s–present: Genre diversification===

While schoolgirl romances remained popular into the 2010s and 2020s, notably &quot;Kase-san&quot; (2010–2017), &quot;Citrus&quot; (2012–2018), &quot;Bloom Into You&quot; (2015–2019), and &quot;Whisper Me a Love Song&quot; (2019–present), &quot;yuri&quot; works during this period began to incorporate new genres, themes, and subject material. The mid-2010s saw &quot;yuri&quot; works expand to genres such as science fiction and &quot;isekai&quot;, as well as the formalization of as a subgenre focused on stories involving adult women. The growth of digital platforms like Pixiv, Twitter, and Shōsetsuka ni Narō allowed for the creation and widespread distribution of &quot;yuri&quot; works outside of traditional manga magazine and &quot;dōjinshi&quot; publishing: &quot;My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness&quot; (2016) was originally published as a web comic, while the &quot;yuri&quot; fantasy works &quot;Sexiled&quot; (2018–2019), &quot;Roll Over and Die&quot; (2018–present), and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with the Villainess&quot; (2018–present) began as web novels on Shōsetsuka ni Narō before being adapted into other mediums. &quot;Yuri&quot; stories by openly lesbian creators also became more prominent, such as &quot;My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness&quot;. The genre of comic essays, stories that focus on the author&#x27;s life experiences, have also become popular, including the aforementioned &quot;My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness&quot; and Hiranishi Mieri&#x27;s &quot;The Moment I Realized I Wasn&#x27;t Straight.&quot;

==Concepts and themes==
===Intimacy between women===
&quot;Yuri&quot; as a genre depicts intimate relationships between women, a scope that is broadly defined to include romantic love, intense friendships, spiritual love, and rivalry. While lesbianism is a theme commonly associated with &quot;yuri&quot;, not all characters in &quot;yuri&quot; media are necessarily non-heterosexual; Welker states that the question whether &quot;yuri&quot; characters are lesbians is a &quot;very complicated issue.&quot; Characters in &quot;yuri&quot; works frequently do not define their sexual orientation in explicit terms, and the matter is instead left to reader interpretation.

Rica Takashima notes Western and Japanese fans often have differing expectations for the level of intimacy depicted in &quot;yuri&quot;, which she ascribes to cultural differences between the groups. She notes that &quot;yuri&quot; works that enjoy international popularity tend to be explicit and focused on &quot;cute girls making out with each other,&quot; while Japanese fans &quot;have a propensity for reading between the lines, picking up on subtle cues, and using their own imaginations to weave rich tapestries of meaning from small threads.&quot;

===Lack of genre and demographic exclusivity===
Though &quot;yuri&quot; has been historically and thematically linked to &quot;shōjo&quot; manga since its emergence in the 1970s, &quot;yuri&quot; works have been published in all demographic groups for manga – not only &quot;shōjo&quot; (girls), but also &quot;josei&quot; (adult women), &quot;shōnen&quot; (boys) and &quot;seinen&quot; (adult men). &quot;Shōjo&quot; &quot;yuri&quot; works tend to focus on fanciful and fairy tale-inspired narratives that idolize Takarazuka Revue-inspired &quot;girl prince&quot; characters, while &quot;yuri&quot; works in the &quot;josei&quot; demographic tend to depict same-sex female couples with a greater degree of realism. &quot;Shōnen&quot; and &quot;seinen&quot; manga, conversely, tend to use &quot;yuri&quot; to depict relationships between &quot;innocent schoolgirls&quot; and &quot;predatory lesbians&quot;. Manga magazines dedicated exclusively to &quot;yuri&quot; tend not to conform to any one specific demographic, and are thus inclusive of content ranging from schoolgirl romances to sexually-explicit content.

Often, works that are perceived and categorized as &quot;yuri&quot; in Japan are not regarded as such by international audiences. For example, while in the west &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; is regarded as a magical girl series with some &quot;yuri&quot; elements, in Japan the series is regarded by &quot;yuri&quot; magazines as a &quot;monumental work&quot; of the genre. The &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; example further illustrates how fans, rather than publishers or creators, often determine whether a work is &quot;yuri&quot;; &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was not conceived as a &quot;yuri&quot; manga or anime, but &quot;became a &quot;yuri&quot; text&quot; based on how the work was interpreted and consumed by &quot;yuri&quot; fans.

===Nominal sexual content===
&quot;Yuri&quot; works generally do not depict graphic sex scenes. Unlike boys&#x27; love and , where explicit depictions of sexual acts are commonplace and stories typically climax with the central couple engaging in anal intercourse, sexual acts in &quot;yuri&quot; are rarely more explicit than kissing and the caressing of breasts. Kazumi Nagaike of Oita University argues that this general avoidance of sex &quot;does not mean that female sexual desire is effaced&quot; in &quot;yuri&quot;, but rather that the absence of sex &quot;clearly derives from the importance which is placed on the spiritual female-female bond.&quot;

===&quot;Crimson Rose and Candy Girl&quot;===
The majority of &quot;yuri&quot; stories published in the 1970s and 1980s were tragedies, focused on doomed relationships that end in separation or death (see History above). Yukari Fujimoto, a manga scholar at Meiji University, notes that the tragic plot of &quot;Shiroi Heya no Futari&quot; became a common &quot;yuri&quot; story archetype that she dubs &quot;Crimson Rose and Candy Girl&quot;. These stories depict &quot;Candy&quot;, a physically smaller character with lighter hair and a naive personality, who admires &quot;Rose&quot;, who is generally taller, with long dark hair and a serious demeanor. The characters bond over a common unhappiness, usually originating from their respective home lives. The attachment between Candy and Rose becomes the subject of rumors or even blackmail, even while Candy and Rose grow to acknowledge that their relationship has become romantic. The story concludes with Rose dying in order to protect Candy from scandal. While tragic story formulas in &quot;yuri&quot; declined in popularity by the 1990s, the Rose and Candy archetypes continue to influence contemporary &quot;yuri&quot; stories, particularly those that depict &quot;senpai&quot; and &quot;kōhai&quot; relationships such as &quot;Bloom Into You&quot;.

===&quot;Tachi&quot; and &quot;neko&quot;===
In Japanese lesbian culture, the participants in a lesbian relationship are occasionally referred to as , which designates the active participant, and , which designates the submissive participant. This distinction is comparable to that of the &quot;seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot; distinction in BL, or to the butch and femme distinction in broader lesbian culture. Characters in contemporary &quot;yuri&quot; rarely conform to these dichotomies, though the dynamic of an active partner and a passive partner that the &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;neko&quot; distinction represents does recur in the genre.

==Media==
===In Japan===
In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, some Japanese lesbian lifestyle magazines contained manga sections, including the now-defunct magazines &quot;Anise&quot; (1996–97, 2001–03) and &quot;Phryné&quot; (1995). &quot;Carmilla&quot;, an erotic lesbian publication, released an anthology of lesbian manga called &quot;Girl&#x27;s Only&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Mist&quot; (1996–99), a ladies&#x27; comic manga magazine, contained sexually explicit lesbian-themed manga as part of a section dedicated to lesbian-interest topics.

The first publication marketed exclusively as &quot;yuri&quot; was Sun Magazine&#x27;s manga anthology magazine &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot;, which was released between June 2003 and November 2004 in quarterly installments, ending with only five issues. After the magazine&#x27;s discontinuation, &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; was launched by Ichijinsha in July 2005 as a revival of the magazine, containing manga by many of the authors who had had work serialized in &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot;. Like its predecessor, &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; was also published quarterly but went on to release bi-monthly on odd months from January 2011 to December 2016, after which it became monthly. A sister magazine to &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot;, named &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot;, was launched as a quarterly publication by Ichijinsha in June 2007. Unlike either &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot; or &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot;, &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot; was targeted towards a male audience. However, in 2010 it was merged with &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot;. Ichijinsha published light novel adaptations from &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; works and original &quot;yuri&quot; novels under their &quot;shōjo&quot; light novel line &quot;Ichijinsha Bunko Iris&quot; starting in July 2008.

Once &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; helped establish the market, several other &quot;yuri&quot; anthologies were released, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mebae&quot;, &quot;Yuri Drill&quot;, &quot;Yuri + Kanojo&quot;, and &quot;Eclair&quot;. Houbunsha and Shinshokan also published their own &quot;yuri&quot; magazines, &quot;Tsubomi&quot; and &quot;Hirari&quot; respectively, with &quot;Tsubomi&quot; running from February 2009 to December 2012 for a total of 21 issues, and &quot;Hirari&quot; running from April 2010 to July 2014 for a total of 14 issues. After a successful crowdfunding campaign, the creator-owned &quot;yuri&quot; anthology magazine &quot;Galette&quot; was launched in 2017.

===Outside of Japan===
The first company to release lesbian-themed manga in North America was Yuricon&#x27;s publishing arm ALC Publishing. Their works include Rica Takashima&#x27;s &quot;Rica &#x27;tte Kanji!?&quot; (1995–1996) and their annual &quot;yuri&quot; manga anthology &quot;Yuri Monogatari&quot;, both of which were published in 2003. The latter collects stories by American, European, and Japanese creators, including Akiko Morishima, Althea Keaton, Kristina Kolhi, Tomomi Nakasora, and Eriko Tadeno. These works range from fantasy stories to more realistic tales dealing with themes such as coming out and sexual orientation.

Besides ALC Publishing, the Los Angeles-based Seven Seas Entertainment has also incurred in the genre, with the English version of well known titles such as &quot;&quot; (2004–2007) and &quot;Strawberry Panic!&quot; (2003–2007). On October 24, 2006, Seven Seas announced the launch of their specialized &quot;yuri&quot; manga line, which includes titles such as &quot;Strawberry Panic!&quot;, &quot;The Last Uniform&quot; (2004–2006), and &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot;″s compilations such as &quot;Voiceful&quot; (2004–2006) and &quot;First Love Sisters&quot; (2003–2008). Between 2011 and 2013, the now-defunct JManga released several &quot;yuri&quot; titles to its digital subscription platform, before terminating service on March 13, 2013. As of 2017, Viz Media and Yen Press began publishing &quot;yuri&quot; manga, with Tokyopop following in 2018. Kodansha Comics announced its debut into publishing both &quot;yuri&quot; and BL manga in 2019, as well as Digital Manga launching a new imprint specializing in &quot;yuri&quot; &quot;dōjin&quot; manga.

As &quot;yuri&quot; gained further recognition outside Japan, some artists began creating original English-language manga that were labeled as &quot;yuri&quot; or having &quot;yuri&quot; elements and subplots. Early examples of original English-language &quot;yuri&quot; comics include &quot;Steady Beat&quot; (2003) by Rivkah LaFille and &quot;12 Days&quot; (2006) by June Kim, which were published between 2005 and 2006. Additionally, more English-developed visual novels and indie games have marketed themselves as &quot;yuri&quot; games. Some of these games include Highway Blossoms (2016) and Heart of the Woods (2019), both developed by Studio Élan. This has been aided by the &quot;Yuri Game Jam&quot;, a game jam established in 2015 that takes place annually.

By the mid-2010s, &quot;yuri&quot; video games also began to be officially translated into English. In 2015, MangaGamer announced they would be releasing &quot;A Kiss for the Petals&quot;, the first license of a &quot;yuri&quot; game to have an English translation. MangaGamer went on to publish &quot;Kindred Spirits on the Roof&quot; in 2016, which was one of the first adult visual novels to be released uncensored on the Steam store.

==Analysis==
===Demography===
While &quot;yuri&quot; originated in female-targeted (&quot;shōjo&quot;, &quot;josei&quot;) works, the genre has evolved over time to also target a male audience. Various studies have been undertaken to examine the demography of &quot;yuri&quot; fandom.

====Publisher studies====
The first magazine to study the demographics of its readers was &quot;Yuri Shimai&quot; (2003–2004), who estimated the proportion of women at almost 70%, and that the majority of them were either teenagers or women in their thirties who were already interested in &quot;shōjo&quot; and BL manga. In 2008, Ichijinsha made a demographic study for its two magazines &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; and &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot;, the first being targeted to women, the second to men. The study reveals that women accounted for 73% of &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; readership, while in &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot;, men accounted for 62%. The publisher noted, however, that readers of the latter magazine also tended to read the first, which led to their merger in 2010. Regarding the age of women for &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot;, 27% of them were under 20 years old, 27% were between 20 and 24 years old, 23% were between 25 and 29 years old, and 23% over 30 years old. As of 2017, the ratio between men and women is said to have shifted to about 6:4, thanks in part to the &quot;Comic Yuri Hime S&quot; merge and the mostly male readership &quot;YuruYuri&quot; brought with it.

====Academic studies====
Verena Maser conducted a study of Japanese &quot;yuri&quot; fandom demographics between September and October 2011. This study, mainly oriented towards the &quot;Yuri Komyu!&quot; community and the social network Mixi, received a total of 1,352 valid responses. The study found that 52.4% of respondents were women, 46.1% were men and 1.6% did not identify with either gender. The sexuality of the participants was also requested, separated into two categories: &quot;heterosexual&quot; and &quot;non-heterosexual&quot;. The results were as follows: 39.5% were heterosexual men, 30% were non-heterosexual women, 15.2% were heterosexual women, 4.7% were non-heterosexual men, and 1.2% identified as &quot;other&quot;. Regarding age, 69% of respondents were between 16 and 25 years old. Maser&#x27;s study reinforced the notion of the &quot;yuri&quot; fandom being split somewhat equally between men and women, as well as highlighting the differing sexualities within it.

===Relation to lesbianism===
====Semantic relationship====
The relationship between &quot;yuri&quot; and lesbianism is tenuous in Japan. While &quot;yuri&quot; was strongly associated with lesbianism in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, the correlation between the terms has weakened over time. Though Japanese fans, journalists, and publishers recognize that &quot;yuri&quot; and lesbianism share common characteristics, they can specifically segregate the terms as concepts, with &quot;Comic Yurihime&quot; editor Seitarō Nakamura stating that &quot;in general, [&quot;yuri&quot; is] not [about] lesbians [&quot;rezubian&quot;] with a carnal relationship.&quot; Japanese lesbian and queer magazines in the 1990s often opposed the conflation of &quot;yuri&quot; with lesbianism, likely due to its prior connotation with male-oriented pornography.

Erin Subramian of Yuricon explains that most Japanese people see the term &quot;lesbian&quot; as describing either &quot;abnormal people in pornography or strange people in other countries.&quot; Maser concurs that &quot;yuri&quot; is a genre primarily focused on ideals of beauty, purity, innocence, and spirituality before sexual identity; focus is placed on &quot;connection between hearts&quot; rather than &quot;connection between bodies.&quot; Nagaike notes in her analysis of letters published in &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; that many female readers of the magazine identify as heterosexual; she thus argues &quot;yuri&quot; is more closely aligned with homosociality than it is with homosexuality, even if the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. Maser analyzes contradictory sources and concludes that the &quot;line between yuri and &#x27;lesbian&#x27;/&#x27;homosexuality&#x27;&quot; is...blurry&quot;. She notes that in her sources, &quot;the term &quot;rezubian&quot; [lesbian] is used in many instances, but that it is almost never made clear what exactly it is referring to&quot;.

====Sociopolitical relationship====
Nagaike argues that &quot;yuri&quot; is a byproduct of the , which formed in pre-war all-girls schools in Japan. Isolated from the influence of patriarchy, adolescent girls created a &quot;&quot;shōjo&quot; culture&quot; that used Class S literature to disseminate and share homosocial cultural codes. Though this culture was significant in informing girls&#x27; attitudes about femininity and independence, it was ultimately ephemeral; upon leaving the single-sex school environment, girls became subject to patriarchal expectations of marriage and family.

As mixed-sex education became more common in the post-war era and Class S literature declined as a means to disseminate homosocial bonds, cross-dressing and BL emerged as the primary modes in literature for women to criticize and resist patriarchy. The emergence of &quot;yuri&quot; allowed for a return to Class S-style homosociality, of which homosexuality is a component. Thus, Nagaike asserts that &quot;yuri&quot; does not conform to the political vision of lesbianism espoused by philosophers like Monique Wittig that sees lesbianism as overthrowing &quot;the political and sociological interpretation of women&#x27;s identity;&quot; rather, &quot;yuri&quot; is closer to Adrienne Rich&#x27;s vision of a &quot;lesbian continuum&quot; that seeks to overthrow compulsory heterosexuality.

<doc id="70802" wikidata="Q204933" url="?curid=70802" title="Decapitation">
<text>Decapitation is the total separation of the head from the body. Such an injury is invariably fatal to humans and all vertebrate animals, since it deprives the brain of oxygenated blood by way of severing through the jugular vein and common carotid artery, while all other organs are deprived of the involuntary functions that are needed for the body to function.
The term beheading refers to the act of deliberately decapitating a person, either as a means of murder or as an execution; it may be performed with an axe, sword, or knife, or by mechanical means such as a guillotine. An executioner who carries out executions by beheading is sometimes called a headsman. Accidental decapitation can be the result of an explosion, a car or industrial accident, improperly administered execution by hanging or other violent injury. The national laws of Saudi Arabia and Yemen permit beheading. Under Sharia, which exclusively applies to Muslims, beheading is also a legal punishment in Zamfara State, Nigeria. In practice, Saudi Arabia is the only country that continues to behead its offenders regularly as a punishment for capital crimes. Cases of decapitation by suicidal hanging, suicide by train decapitation and by guillotine are known. 

Less commonly, decapitation can also refer to the removal of the head from a body that is already dead. This might be done to take the head as a trophy, as a secondary stage of an execution by hanging, for public display, to make the deceased more difficult to identify, for cryonics, or for other, more esoteric reasons.

== Etymology ==
The word decapitation has its roots in the Late Latin word . The meaning of the word can be discerned from its morphemes (down, from) + (head). The past participle of is which was used to create , the noun form of , in Medieval Latin, whence the French word was produced.

== History ==



Humans have practiced capital punishment by beheading for millennia. The Narmer Palette (c. 3000 BCE) shows the first known depiction of decapitated corpses. The terms &quot;capital offence&quot;, &quot;capital crime&quot;, &quot;capital punishment&quot;, derive from the Latin , &quot;head&quot;, referring to the punishment for serious offences involving the forfeiture of the head; i.e. death by beheading.

Some cultures, such as ancient Rome and Greece, regarded decapitation as the most honorable form of death. In the Middle Ages, many European nations continued to reserve the method only for nobles and royalty. In France, the French Revolution made it the only legal method of execution for all criminals regardless of class, one of the period&#x27;s many symbolic changes.

Others have regarded beheading as dishonorable and contemptuous, such as the Japanese troops who beheaded prisoners during World War II. In recent times, it has become associated with terrorism.

If a headsman&#x27;s axe or sword is sharp and his aim is precise, decapitation is quick and thought to be a relatively painless form of death. If the instrument is blunt or the executioner is clumsy, repeated strokes might be required to sever the head, resulting in a prolonged and more painful death. Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and Mary, Queen of Scots required three strikes at their respective executions. The same could be said for the execution of Johann Friedrich Struensee, favorite of the Danish queen Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, is said to have required up to 10 strokes before decapitation was achieved. This particular story may, however, be apocryphal, as highly divergent accounts exist. Historian and philosopher David Hume, for example, relates the following about her death:

To ensure that the blow would be fatal, executioners&#x27; swords usually were blade-heavy two-handed swords. Likewise, if an axe was used, it almost invariably was wielded with both hands. 

== Physiological aspects ==

===Physiology of death by decapitation===
Decapitation is quickly fatal to humans and most animals. Unconsciousness occurs within seconds without circulating oxygenated blood (brain ischemia). Cell death and irreversible brain damage occurs after 3–6 minutes with no oxygen, due to excitotoxicity. Some anecdotes suggest more extended persistence of human consciousness after decapitation, but most doctors consider this unlikely and consider such accounts to be misapprehensions of reflexive twitching rather than deliberate movement, since deprivation of oxygen must cause nearly immediate coma and death (&quot;[Consciousness is] probably lost within 2–3 seconds, due to a rapid fall of intracranial perfusion of blood&quot;).

A laboratory study testing for humane methods of euthanasia in awake animals used EEG monitoring to measure the time duration following decapitation for rats to become fully unconscious, unable to perceive distress and pain. It was estimated that this point was reached within 3–4 seconds, correlating closely with results found in other studies on rodents (2.7 seconds, and 3–6 seconds). The same study also suggested that the massive wave which can be recorded by EEG monitoring approximately one minute after decapitation ultimately reflects brain death. Other studies indicate that electrical activity in the brain has been demonstrated to persist for 13 to 14 seconds following decapitation (although it is disputed as to whether such activity implies that pain is perceived), and a 2010 study reported that decapitation of rats generated responses in EEG indices over a period of 10 seconds that have been linked to nociception across a number of different species of animals, including rats.

Some animals (such as cockroaches) can survive decapitation and die not because of the loss of the head directly, but rather because of starvation. A number of other animals, including snakes, and turtles, have also been known to survive for some time after being decapitated, as they have slower metabolisms and their nervous systems can continue to function at some capacity for a limited time even after connection to the brain is lost, responding to any nearby stimulus. In addition, the bodies of chickens and turtles may continue to move temporarily after decapitation.

Although head transplantation by the reattachment of blood vessels has seen some very limited success in animals, a fully functional reattachment of a severed human head (including repair of the spinal cord, muscles, and other critically important tissues) is not likely.

== Technology ==
=== Guillotine ===
Early versions of the guillotine included the Halifax Gibbet, which was used in Halifax, England, from 1286 until the 17th century, and the &quot;Maiden&quot;, employed in Edinburgh from the 16th through the 18th centuries.

The modern form of the guillotine was invented shortly before the French Revolution with the aim of creating a quick and painless method of execution requiring little skill on the part of the operator. Decapitation by guillotine became a common mechanically assisted form of execution.

The French observed a strict code of etiquette surrounding such executions. For example, a man named Legros, one of the assistants at the execution of Charlotte Corday, was imprisoned for three months and dismissed for slapping the face of the victim after the blade had fallen in order to see whether any flicker of life remained. The guillotine was used in France during the French Revolution and remained the normal judicial method in both peacetime and wartime into the 1970s, although the firing squad was used in certain cases. France abolished the death penalty in 1981.

The guillotine was also used in Algeria before the French relinquished control of it, as shown in Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot;.


Many German states had used a guillotine-like device known as a (&quot;falling axe&quot;) since the 17th and 18th centuries, and decapitation by guillotine was the usual means of execution in Germany until the abolition of the death penalty in West Germany in 1949. It was last used in communist East Germany in 1966.

In Nazi Germany, the was reserved for common criminals and people convicted of political crimes, including treason. Members of the White Rose resistance movement, a group of students in Munich that included siblings Sophie and Hans Scholl, were executed by decapitation.

Contrary to popular myth, executions were generally not conducted face-up, and chief executioner Johann Reichhart was insistent on maintaining &quot;professional&quot; protocol throughout the era, having administered the death penalty during the earlier Weimar Republic. Nonetheless, it is estimated that some 16,500 persons were guillotined in Germany and Austria between 1933 and 1945, a number that includes resistance fighters both within Germany itself and in countries occupied by Nazi forces. As these resistance fighters were not part of any regular army, they were considered common criminals and were in many cases transported to Germany for execution. Decapitation was considered a &quot;dishonorable&quot; death, in contrast to execution by firing squad.

== Historical practices by nation ==
=== Africa ===
==== Congo ====
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the conflict and ethnic massacre between local army and Kamuina Nsapu rebels has caused several deaths and atrocities such as rape and mutilation. One of them is decapitation, both a fearsome way to intimidate victims as well as an act that may include ritualistic elements. According to a UN report from Congolese refugees, they believed the Bana Mura and Kamuina Nsapu militias have &quot;magical powers&quot; as a result of drinking the blood of decapitated victims, making them invincible.

Besides the massive decapitations (like the beheading of 40 members of the State Police), a globally notorious case happened in March 2017 to Swedish politician Zaida Catalán and American UN expert Michael Sharp, who were kidnapped and executed during a mission near the village of Ngombe in Kasaï Province. The UN was reportedly horrified when video footage of the executions surfaced in April that same year, where some grisly details led to assume ritual components of the beheading: the perpetrators first cut the hair of both victims, and then one of them beheaded Catalán only, because it would &quot;increase his power&quot;, which may be linked to the fact that Congolese militias are particularly brutal in their acts of violence toward women and children.

In the trial that followed investigations after the bodies were discovered, and according to a testimony of a primary school teacher from Bunkonde, near the village of Moyo Musuila where the executions took place, he witnessed a teenage militant carrying the young woman&#x27;s head, but despite the efforts of the investigation, the head was never found. According to a report published on 29 May 2019, the Monusco peacekeeping military mission led by Colonel Luis Mangini, in the search for the missing remains, arrived to a ritual place in Moyo Musila where &quot;parts of bodies, hands and heads&quot; were cut and used for rituals, where they lost track of the victim&#x27;s head.

=== Asia ===
==== Azerbaijan ====
During the 2016 Armenian–Azerbaijani clashes, Yazidi-Armenian serviceman Kyaram Sloyan was decapitated by Azerbaijani servicemen.

Several reports of decapitation, along with other types of mutilation of Armenian POWs by Azerbaijani soldiers, emerged in 2020 during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.

==== China ====

In traditional China, decapitation was considered a more severe form of punishment than strangulation, although strangulation caused more prolonged suffering. This was because in Confucian tradition, a person&#x27;s body was a gift from their parents, and so it was therefore disrespectful to their ancestors to return their bodies to the grave dismembered. The Chinese, however, had other punishments, such as dismembering the body into multiple pieces (similar to the English quartering). In addition, there was also a practice of cutting the body at the waist, which was a common method of execution before being abolished in the early Qing dynasty due to the lingering death it caused. In some tales, people did not die immediately after decapitation.

==== India ====
The British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathans in British India during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would behead enemy soldiers who were captured, such as British and Sikh soldiers.

The Execution of Sambhaji was a significant event in 17th-century Deccan India, where the second Maratha King was put to death by order of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The conflicts between the Mughals and the Deccan Sultanates, which resulted in the downfall of the Sultanates, paved the way for tensions between the Marathas and the Mughals. Aurangzeb was drawn to Southern India due to the vanquished rebel Akbar fleeing to the Maratha monarch, Sambhaji. The Maratha King was then captured by the Mughal general Muqarrab Khan. Sambhaji and his minister Kavi Kalash were then taken to Tulapur, where they were tortured to death.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, decapitation was a common punishment, sometimes for minor offences. Samurai were often allowed to decapitate soldiers who had fled from battle, as it was considered cowardly. Decapitation was historically performed as the second step in seppuku (ritual suicide by disembowelment). After the victim had sliced his own abdomen open, another warrior would strike his head off from behind with a katana to hasten death and to reduce the suffering. The blow was expected to be precise enough to leave intact a small strip of skin at the front of the neck—to spare invited and honored guests the indelicacy of witnessing a severed head rolling about, or towards them; such an occurrence would have been considered inelegant and in bad taste. The sword was expected to be used upon the slightest sign that the practitioner might yield to pain and cry out—avoiding dishonor to him and to all partaking in the privilege of observing an honorable demise. As skill was involved, only the most trusted warrior was honored by taking part. In the late Sengoku period, decapitation was performed as soon as the person chosen to carry out seppuku had made the slightest wound to his abdomen.

Decapitation (without seppuku) was also considered a very severe and degrading form of punishment. One of the most brutal decapitations was that of (杉谷善住坊), who attempted to assassinate Oda Nobunaga, a prominent &quot;daimyō&quot;, in 1570. After being caught, Zenjubō was buried alive in the ground with only his head out, and the head was slowly sawn off with a bamboo saw by passers-by for several days (punishment by sawing; (). These unusual punishments were abolished in the early Meiji era. A similar scene is described in the last page of James Clavell&#x27;s book &quot;Shōgun&quot;.

==== Korea ====
Historically, decapitation had been the most common method of execution in Korea, until it was replaced by hanging in 1896. Professional executioners were called (망나니) and they were volunteered from death rows.

==== Thailand ====
Historically, decapitation had been the main method of execution in Thailand, until it was replaced by shooting in 1934.

==== Vietnam ====
Execution by beheading was one of the most common forms of execution in Vietnam under the feudal system. This form of execution still existed in the South Vietnam regime until 1962.

=== Europe ===
==== Bosnia and Herzegovina ====
During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992–1995) there were a number of ritual beheadings of Serbs and Croats who were taken as prisoners of war by mujahideen members of the Bosnian Army. At least one case is documented and proven in court by the ICTY where mujahedin, members of 3rd Corps of Army BiH, beheaded Bosnian Serb Dragan Popović.

==== Britain ====
In British history, beheading was typically used for noblemen, while commoners would be hanged; eventually, hanging was adopted as the standard means of non-military executions. The last actual execution by beheading was of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat on 9 April 1747, while a number of convicts were beheaded posthumously up to the early 19th century. (Typically traitors were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, a method which had already been discontinued.) Beheading was degraded to a secondary means of execution, including for treason, with the abolition of drawing and quartering in 1870 and finally abolished by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973. One of the most notable executions by decapitation in Britain was that of King Charles I of England, who was beheaded outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall in 1649, after being captured by parliamentarians during the English Civil War and tried for treason.

In England, a bearded axe was used for beheading, with the blade&#x27;s edge extending downwards from the tip of the shaft.

==== Celts ====

The Celts of western Europe long pursued a &quot;cult of the severed head&quot;, as evidenced by both Classical literary descriptions and archaeological contexts. This cult played a central role in their temples and religious practices and earned them a reputation as head hunters among the Mediterranean peoples. Diodorus Siculus, in his 1st-century &quot;Historical Library&quot; (5.29.4) wrote the following about Celtic head-hunting:

Both the Greeks and Romans found the Celtic decapitation practices shocking and the latter put an end to them when Celtic regions came under their control. 
According to Paul Jacobsthal, &quot;Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.&quot; Arguments for a Celtic cult of the severed head include the many sculptured representations of severed heads in La Tène carvings, and the surviving Celtic mythology, which is full of stories of the severed heads of heroes and the saints who carry their own severed heads, right down to &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off in a beheading game, just as Saint Denis carried his head to the top of Montmartre.

A further example of this regeneration after beheading lies in the tales of Connemara&#x27;s Saint Féchín, who after being beheaded by Vikings carried his head to the Holy Well on Omey Island and on dipping it into the well placed it back upon his neck and was restored to full health.

==== Classical antiquity ====
The ancient Greeks and Romans regarded decapitation as a comparatively honorable form of execution for criminals. The traditional procedure, however, included first being tied to a stake and whipped with rods. Axes were used by the Romans, and later swords, which were considered a more honorable instrument of death. Those who could verify that they were Roman citizens were to be beheaded, rather than undergoing crucifixion. In the Roman Republic of the early 1st century BC, it became the tradition for the severed heads of public enemies—such as the political opponents of Marius and Sulla—to be publicly displayed on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum after execution. Perhaps the most famous beheading was that of Cicero who, on instructions from Mark Antony, had his hands (which had penned the &quot;Philippicae&quot; against Antony) and his head cut off and nailed up for display in this manner.

==== France ====
In France, until the abolition of capital punishment in 1981, the main method of execution had been by beheading by means of the guillotine. Other than a small number of military cases in which a firing squad was used (including that of Jean Bastien-Thiry), the guillotine was the only legal method of execution from 1791, when it was introduced by the Legislative Assembly during the last days of the kingdom French Revolution, until 1981. Before the revolution, beheading had typically been reserved for noblemen and carried out manually. In 1981, President François Mitterrand abolished capital punishment and issued commutations for those whose sentences had not been carried out.

The first person executed by the guillotine in France was highwayman Nicolas Jacques Pelletier in April 1792. The last execution was of murderer Hamida Djandoubi, in Marseille, in 1977. Throughout its extensive overseas colonies and dependencies, the device was also used, including on St Pierre in 1889 and on Martinique as late as 1965.

==== Germany ====
* Fritz Haarmann, a serial killer from Hannover who was sentenced to death for killing 27 young men, was decapitated in April 1925. He was nicknamed &quot;The Butcher from Hannover&quot; and was rumored to have sold his victims&#x27; flesh to his neighbor&#x27;s restaurant.
* In July 1931, notorious serial killer Peter Kürten, known as &quot;The Vampire of Düsseldorf&quot;, was executed on the guillotine in Cologne.
* On 1 August 1933, in Altona, Bruno Tesch and three others were beheaded. These were the first executions in Nazi Germany. The executions concerned the Altona Bloody Sunday (&quot;Altonaer Blutsonntag&quot;) riot, an SA march on 17 July 1932 that turned violent and led to 18 people being shot dead.
* Marinus van der Lubbe by guillotine in 1934 after a show trial in which he was found guilty of starting the Reichstag fire.
* In February 1935 Benita von Falkenhayn and Renate von Natzmer were beheaded with the axe and block in Berlin for espionage for Poland. Axe beheading was the only method of execution in Berlin until 1938, when it was decreed that all civil executions would henceforth be carried out by guillotine. However, the practice was continued in rare cases such as that of Olga Bancic and Werner Seelenbinder in 1944. Beheading by guillotine survived in West Germany until 1949 and in East Germany until 1966.
* A group of three Catholic clergymen, Johannes Prassek, Eduard Müller and Hermann Lange, and an Evangelical Lutheran pastor, Karl Friedrich Stellbrink, were arrested following the bombing of Lübeck, tried by the People&#x27;s Court in 1943 and sentenced to death by decapitation; all were beheaded on 10 November 1943, in the Hamburg prison at Holstenglacis. Stellbrink had explained the raid next morning in his Palm Sunday sermon as a &quot;trial by ordeal&quot;, which the Nazi authorities interpreted to be an attack on their system of government and as such undermined morale and aided the enemy.
* In October 1944, Werner Seelenbinder was executed by manual beheading, the last legal use of the method (other than by guillotine) in both Europe and the rest of the Western world. Earlier the same year, Olga Bancic had been executed by the same means.
* In February 1943, American academic Mildred Harnack and the university students Hans Scholl, Sophie Scholl, and Christoph Probst of the White Rose protest movement, were all beheaded by the Nazi State. Four other members of the White Rose, an anti-Nazi group, were also executed by the People&#x27;s Court later that same year. The anti-Nazi Helmuth Hübener was also decapitated by People&#x27;s Court order.
* In 1966, former Auschwitz doctor Horst Fischer was executed by the German Democratic Republic by guillotine, the last executed by this method outside France. Beheading was subsequently replaced by shooting in the neck.

==== Nordic countries ====
In Nordic countries, decapitation was the usual means of carrying out capital punishment. Noblemen were beheaded with a sword, and commoners with an axe. The last executions by decapitation in Finland in 1825, Norway in 1876, Faroe Islands in 1609, and in Iceland in 1830 were carried out with axes. The same was the case in Denmark in 1892. Sweden continued the practice for a few decades, executing its second to last criminal—mass murderer Johan Filip Nordlund—by axe in 1900. It was replaced by the guillotine, which was used for the first and only time on Johan Alfred Ander in 1910.

Finland&#x27;s official beheading axe resides today at the Museum of Crime in Vantaa. It is a broad-bladed two-handed axe. It was last used when murderer Tahvo Putkonen was executed in 1825, the last execution in peacetime in Finland.

==== Spain ====

In Spain executions were carried out by various methods including strangulation by the garrotte. In the 16th and 17th centuries, noblemen were sometimes executed by means of beheading. Examples include Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem, Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn. They were tied to a chair on a scaffold. The executioner used a knife to cut the head from the body. It was considered to be a more honourable death if the executioner started with cutting the throat.

=== Middle East ===
==== Iran ====
Iran, since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has alleged it uses beheading as one of the methods of punishment.

==== Iraq ====

Though not officially sanctioned, legal beheadings were carried out against at least 50 prostitutes and pimps under Saddam Hussein as late as 2000.

Beheadings have emerged as another terror tactic especially in Iraq since 2003. Civilians have borne the brunt of the beheadings, although U.S. and Iraqi military personnel have also been targeted. After kidnapping the victim, the kidnappers typically make some sort of demand of the government of the hostage&#x27;s nation and give a time limit for the demand to be carried out, often 72 hours. Beheading is often threatened if the government fails to heed the wishes of the hostage takers. Sometimes, the beheadings are videotaped and made available on the Internet. One of the most publicized of such executions was that of Nick Berg.

Judicial execution is practiced in Iraq, but is generally carried out by hanging.

==== Saudi Arabia ====

Saudi Arabia has a criminal justice system based on Shari&#x27;ah law reflecting a particular state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam. Crimes such as rape, murder, apostasy, and sorcery are punishable by beheading. It is usually carried out publicly by beheading with a sword.

A public beheading will typically take place around 9am. The convicted person is walked into the square and kneels in front of the executioner. The executioner uses a sword to remove the condemned person&#x27;s head from his or her body at the neck with a single strike. After the convicted person is pronounced dead, a police official announces the crimes committed by the beheaded alleged criminal and the process is complete. The official might announce the same before the actual execution. This is the most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia.

According to Amnesty International, at least 79 people were executed in Saudi Arabia in 2013. Foreigners are not exempt, accounting for &quot;almost half&quot; of executions in 2013.

In 2015 Ashraf Fayadh (born 1980), a Saudi Arabian poet, was sentenced to be beheaded, but his sentence was later reduced to eight years in prison and 800 lashes, for apostasy.

==== Syria ====
The Syrian government employs hanging as its method of capital punishment. However, the terrorist organisation known as the Islamic State, which controlled territory in much of eastern Syria, had regularly carried out beheadings of people. Syrian rebels attempting to overthrow the Syrian government have been implicated in beheadings too.

=== North America ===

==== Mexico ====
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Ignacio Allende, José Mariano Jiménez and Juan Aldama were tried for treason, executed by firing squad and beheaded during the Mexican independence in 1811. Their heads were on display on the four corners of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas, in Guanajuato.

During the Mexican Drug War, some Mexican drug cartels turned to decapitation and beheading of rival cartel members as a method of intimidation.
This trend of beheading and publicly displaying the decapitated bodies was started by the Los Zetas, a criminal group composed by former Mexican special forces operators, trained in the infamous &quot;US Army School of the Americas&quot;, in torture techniques and psychological warfare.

==== United States ====
The United States government has never employed beheading as a legal method of execution. However, beheading has sometimes been used in mutilations of the dead, particularly of black people like Nat Turner, who led a rebellion against slavery. When caught, he was publicly hanged, flayed, and beheaded. This was a technique used by many enslavers to discourage the &quot;frequent bloody uprisings&quot; that were carried out by &quot;kidnapped Africans&quot;. While bodily dismemberment of various kinds was employed to instill terror, Dr. Erasmus D. Fenner noted postmortem decapitation was particularly effective.

During the Vietnam War, as a terror tactic, &quot;some American troops hacked the heads off... dead [Vietnamese] and mounted them on pikes or poles&quot;. Correspondent Michael Herr noted &quot;thousands&quot; of photo-albums made by US soldiers &quot;all seemed to contain the same pictures&quot;: &quot;the severed head shot, the head often resting on the chest of the dead man or being held up by a smiling Marine, or a lot of the heads, arranged in a row, with a burning cigarette in each of the mouths, the eyes open&quot;. Some of the victims were &quot;very young&quot;.
General George Patton IV, son of the famous WWII general George S. Patton, was known for keeping &quot;macabre souvenirs&quot;, such as &quot;a Vietnamese skull that sat on his desk.&quot; Other Americans &quot;hacked the heads off Vietnamese to keep, trade, or exchange for prizes offered by commanders.&quot;

Although the Utah Territory permitted a person sentenced to death to choose beheading as a means of execution, no person chose that option, and it was dropped when Utah became a state.

<text>The Stuart Restoration was the reinstatement in May 1660 of the Stuart monarchy in England, Scotland, and Ireland. It replaced the Commonwealth of England, established in January 1649 after the execution of Charles I, with his son Charles II. 

The term is also used to describe the reign of Charles II (1660–1685), and sometimes that of his younger brother James II (1685–1688).

==The Protectorate==

After Richard Cromwell, Lord Protector from 1658 to 1659, ceded power to the Rump Parliament, Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert then dominated government for a year. On 20 October 1659, George Monck, the governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland to oppose Fleetwood and Lambert. Lambert&#x27;s army began to desert him, and he returned to London almost alone whilst Monck marched to London unopposed. The Presbyterian members, excluded in Pride&#x27;s Purge of 1648, were recalled, and on 24 December the army restored the Long Parliament.

Fleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before Parliament to answer for his conduct. On 3 March 1660, Lambert was sent to the Tower of London, from which he escaped a month later. He tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the Commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the &quot;Good Old Cause&quot; to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill, but he was recaptured by Colonel Richard Ingoldsby, a participant in the regicide of Charles I who hoped to win a pardon by handing Lambert over to the new regime. Lambert was incarcerated and died in custody in 1684; Ingoldsby was pardoned.

==Restoration of Charles II==

On 4 April 1660, Charles II issued the Declaration of Breda, in which he made several promises in relation to the reclamation of the crown of England. While he did this, Monck organised the Convention Parliament, which met for the first time on 25 April. On 8 May, it proclaimed that King Charles II had been the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649. Historian Tim Harris argues that &quot;Constitutionally, it was as if the last nineteen years had never happened.&quot;

Charles returned from exile, leaving The Hague on 23 May and landing at Dover on 25 May. He entered London on 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday. To celebrate His Majesty&#x27;s Return to his Parliament, 29 May was made a public holiday, popularly known as Oak Apple Day. He was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661.

Some contemporaries described the Restoration as &quot;a divinely ordained miracle&quot;. The sudden and unexpected deliverance from political chaos was interpreted as a restoration of the natural and divine order. The Cavalier Parliament convened for the first time on 8 May 1661, and it would endure for over 17 years, finally being dissolved on 24 January 1679. Like its predecessor, it was overwhelmingly Royalist. It is also known as the Pensionary Parliament for the many pensions it granted to adherents of the King.

The leading political figure at the beginning of the Restoration was Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. It was the &quot;skill and wisdom of Clarendon&quot; which had &quot;made the Restoration unconditional&quot;.

Many Royalist exiles returned and were rewarded. Prince Rupert of the Rhine returned to the service of England, became a member of the privy council, and was provided with an annuity. George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich, returned to be the Captain of the King&#x27;s guard and received a pension. Marmaduke Langdale returned and was made &quot;Baron Langdale&quot;. William Cavendish, Marquess of Newcastle, returned and was able to regain the greater part of his estates. He was invested in 1666 with the Order of the Garter (which had been bestowed upon him in 1650), and was advanced to a dukedom on 16 March 1665.

==England and Wales==
===Commonwealth regicides and rebels===
The Indemnity and Oblivion Act, which became law on 29 August 1660, pardoned all past treason against the crown, but specifically excluded those involved in the trial and execution of Charles I. Thirty-one of the 59 commissioners (judges) who had signed the death warrant in 1649 were living. The regicides were hunted down; some escaped but most were found and put on trial. Three escaped to the American colonies. New Haven, Connecticut, secretly harboured Edward Whalley, William Goffe and John Dixwell, and after American independence named streets after them to honour them as forefathers of the American Revolution.

In the ensuing trials, twelve were condemned to death. The Fifth Monarchist Thomas Harrison, the first person found guilty of regicide, who had been the seventeenth of the 59 commissioners to sign the death warrant, was the first regicide to be hanged, drawn and quartered because he was considered by the new government still to represent a real threat to the re-established order. In October 1660, at Charing Cross or Tyburn, London, ten were publicly hanged, drawn and quartered: Thomas Harrison, John Jones, Adrian Scrope, John Carew, Thomas Scot, and Gregory Clement, who had signed the king&#x27;s death warrant; the preacher Hugh Peters; Francis Hacker and Daniel Axtell, who commanded the guards at the king&#x27;s trial and execution; and John Cooke, the solicitor who directed the prosecution. The 10 judges who were on the panel but did not sign the death warrant were also convicted.

Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, Judge Thomas Pride, and Judge John Bradshaw were posthumously attainted for high treason. Because Parliament is a court, the highest in the land, a bill of attainder is a legislative act declaring a person guilty of treason or felony, in contrast to the regular judicial process of trial and conviction. In January 1661, the corpses of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw were exhumed and hanged in chains at Tyburn.

In 1661 John Okey, one of the regicides who signed the death warrant of Charles I, was brought back from Holland along with Miles Corbet, friend and lawyer to Cromwell, and John Barkstead, former constable of the Tower of London. They were all imprisoned in the Tower. From there they were taken to Tyburn and hanged, drawn and quartered on 19 April 1662. A further 19 regicides were imprisoned for life.

John Lambert was not in London for the trial of Charles I. At the Restoration, he was found guilty of high treason and remained in custody in Guernsey for the rest of his life. Henry Vane the Younger served on the Council of State during the Interregnum even though he refused to take the oath which expressed approbation (approval) of the King&#x27;s execution. At the Restoration, after much debate in Parliament, he was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. In 1662 he was tried for high treason, found guilty and beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 June 1662.

===Regrant of certain Commonwealth titles===
The Instrument of Government, The Protectorate&#x27;s written constitutions, gave to the Lord Protector the King&#x27;s power to grant titles of honour. Over 30 new knighthoods were granted under the Protectorate. These knighthoods passed into oblivion upon the Restoration of Charles II, but many were regranted by the restored King.

Of the eleven Protectorate baronetcies, two had been previously granted by Charles I during the Civil War, but under Commonwealth legislation they were not recognised under the Protectorate (hence the Lord Protector&#x27;s regranting of them). When that legislation passed into oblivion these two baronets were entitled to use the baronetcies granted by Charles I, and Charles II regranted four more. Only one now continues: Richard Thomas Willy, 14th baronet, is the direct successor of Griffith Williams. Of the remaining Protectorate baronets one, William Ellis, was granted a knighthood by Charles II.

Edmund Dunch was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658, but this barony was not regranted. The male line failed in 1719 with the death of his grandson, also Edmund Dunch, so no one can lay claim to the title.

The one hereditary viscountcy Cromwell created for certain, (making Charles Howard Viscount Howard of Morpeth and Baron Gilsland) continues to this day. In April 1661, Howard was created Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Baron Dacre of Gillesland. The present Earl is a direct descendant of this Cromwellian creation and Restoration recreation.

===Venner rebellion (1661)===
On 6 January 1661, about 50 Fifth Monarchists, headed by a wine-cooper named Thomas Venner, tried to gain possession of London in the name of &quot;King Jesus&quot;. Most were either killed or taken prisoner; on 19 and 21 January 1661, Venner and 10 others were hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason.

===Church of England settlement===
The Church of England was restored as the national Church in England, backed by the Clarendon Code and the Act of Uniformity 1662. People reportedly &quot;pranced around May poles as a way of taunting the Presbyterians and Independents&quot; and &quot;burned copies of the Solemn League and Covenant&quot;.

==Ireland==

&quot;The commonwealth parliamentary union was, after 1660, treated as null and void&quot;. As in England the republic was deemed constitutionally never to have occurred. The Convention Parliament was dissolved by Charles II in January 1661, and he summoned his first parliament in Ireland in May 1661. In 1662, 29 May was made a public holiday known to this day as Oak Apple Day.

Coote, Broghill and Maurice Eustace were initially the main political figures in the Restoration. George Monck, Duke of Albemarle was given the position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland but he did not assume office. In 1662 James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde returned as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and became the predominant political figure of the Restoration period.

==Scotland==

Charles was proclaimed King again on 14 May 1660. He was not crowned, having been previously crowned at Scone in 1651. The Restoration &quot;presented an occasion of universal celebration and rejoicing throughout Scotland&quot;.

Charles II summoned his parliament on 1 January 1661, which began to undo all that been forced on his father Charles I of Scotland. The Rescissory Act 1661 made all legislation back to 1633 &#x27;void and null&#x27;.

==English colonies==
===Caribbean===
Barbados, as a haven for refugees fleeing the English republic, had held for Charles II under Lord Willoughby until defeated by George Ayscue. When news reached Barbados of the King&#x27;s restoration, Thomas Modyford declared Barbados for the King in July 1660. The planters, however, were not eager for the return of the former governor Lord Willoughby, fearing disputes over titles, but the King ordered he be restored.

Jamaica had been a conquest of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s and Charles II&#x27;s claim to the island was therefore questionable. However, Charles II chose not to restore Jamaica to Spain and in 1661 it became a British colony and the planters would claim that they held rights as Englishmen by the King&#x27;s assumption of the dominion of Jamaica. The first governor was Lord Windsor. He was replaced in 1664 by Thomas Modyford who had been ousted from Barbados.

===North America===
New England, with its Puritan settlement, had supported the Commonwealth and the Protectorate. Acceptance of the Restoration was reluctant in some quarters as it highlighted the failure of Puritan reform. Rhode Island declared in October 1660 and Massachusetts lastly in August 1661. The Colony of New Haven provided refuge for Regicides such as Edward Whalley, William Goffe and John Dixwell and would be subsequently merged into Connecticut in 1662, perhaps in punishment. John Winthrop, a former governor of Connecticut, and one of whose sons had been a captain in Monck&#x27;s army, went to England at the Restoration and in 1662 obtained a royal charter for Connecticut with New Haven annexed to it.

Maryland had resisted the republic until finally occupied by New England Puritans/Parliamentary forces after the Battle of the Severn in 1655. In 1660 the Governor Josias Fendall tried to turn Maryland into a Commonwealth of its own in what is known as Fendall&#x27;s Rebellion but with the fall of the republic in England he was left without support and was replaced by Philip Calvert upon the Restoration.

Virginia was the most loyal of King Charles II&#x27;s dominions. It had, according to the eighteenth-century historian Robert Beverley Jr., been &quot;the last of all the King&#x27;s Dominions that submitted to the Usurpation&quot;. Virginia had provided sanctuary for Cavaliers fleeing the English republic. In 1650, Virginia was one of the Royalist colonies that became the subject of Parliament&#x27;s An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego. William Berkeley, who had previously been governor up until 1652, was elected governor in 1660 by the House of Burgesses and he promptly declared for the King. The Anglican Church was restored as the established church.

The Somers Isles, alias Bermuda (originally named &quot;Virgineola&quot;), was originally part of Virginia, and was administered by the Somers Isles Company, a spin-off of the Virginia Company, until 1684. The already existing contest between the mostly Parliamentarian Adventurers (shareholders) of the company in England and the Bermudians, who had their own House of Assembly (and many of whom were becoming landowners as they were sold the land they had previously farmed as tenants as the profitability of the tobacco farmed exclusively for the company fell), placed the Bermudians on the side of the Crown despite the large number of Puritans in the colony.

Bermudians were attempting to shift their economy from tobacco to a maritime one and were being thwarted by the company, which relied on revenue from tobacco cultivation. Bermuda was the first colony to recognise Charles II as King in 1649. It controlled its own &quot;army&quot; (of militia) and deposed the Company appointed Governor, electing a replacement. Its Independent Puritans were forced to emigrate, settling the Bahamas under prominent Bermudian settler, sometime Governor of Bermuda, and Parliamentary loyalist William Sayle as the Eleutheran Adventurers. Although eventually reaching a compromise with the Commonwealth, the Bermudians dispute with the company continued and was finally taken before the restored Crown, which was keen for an opportunity to re-assert its authority over the wealthy businessmen who controlled the Somers Isles Company.

The islanders&#x27; protest to the Crown initially concerned the mis-treatment of Perient Trott and his heirs (including Nicholas Trott), but expanded to include the company&#x27;s wider mismanagement of the colony. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the company, and resulted in the company&#x27;s Royal Charter being revoked in 1684. From that point onwards the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony&#x27;s governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the company&#x27;s restraints, the emerging local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda&#x27;s progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to seafaring.

In 1663 the Province of Carolina was formed as a reward given to some supporters of the Restoration. The province was named after the King&#x27;s father, Charles I. The town of Charleston was established in 1669 by a party of settlers from Bermuda (some being Bermudians aboard Bermudian vessels, others having passed through Bermuda from as far as England) under the same William Sayle who had led the Eleutheran Adventurers to the Bahamas. In 1670, Sayle became the first Colonial Governor of the Province of Carolina.

==Culture==
The Restoration and Charles&#x27; coronation mark a reversal of the stringent Puritan morality, &quot;as though the pendulum [of England&#x27;s morality] swung from repression to licence more or less overnight&quot;. Theatres reopened after having been closed during the protectorship, Puritanism lost its momentum, and bawdy comedy became a recognisable genre. In addition, women were allowed to perform on the commercial stage as professional actresses for the first time. In Scotland, the bishops returned as the Episcopacy was reinstated.

To celebrate the occasion and cement their diplomatic relations, the Dutch Republic presented Charles with the Dutch Gift, a fine collection of old master paintings, classical sculptures, furniture, and a yacht.

===Literature===

Restoration literature includes the roughly homogenous styles of literature that centre on a celebration of or reaction to the restored court of King Charles II. It is a literature that includes extremes, for it encompasses both &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and the John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester&#x27;s &quot;Sodom&quot;, the high-spirited sexual comedy of &quot;The Country Wife&quot; and the moral wisdom of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. It saw Locke&#x27;s &quot;Treatises of Government&quot;, the founding of the Royal Society, the experiments and holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the hysterical attacks on theatres from Jeremy Collier, and the pioneering of literary criticism from John Dryden and John Dennis. The period witnessed news become a commodity, the essay develop into a periodical art form, and the beginnings of textual criticism.

===Style===

The return of the king and his court from exile led to the replacement of the Puritan severity of the Cromwellian style with a taste for magnificence and opulence and to the introduction of Dutch and French artistic influences. These are evident in furniture in the use of floral marquetry, walnut instead of oak, twisted turned supports and legs, exotic veneers, cane seats and backs on chairs, sumptuous tapestry and velvet upholstery and ornate carved and gilded scrolling bases for cabinets. Similar shifts appear in prose style.

===Comedy===

Comedy, especially bawdy comedy, flourished, and a favourite setting was the bed-chamber. Indeed, sexually explicit language was encouraged by the king personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian George Norman Clark argues:

The socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn.

===Spectacular===

The Restoration spectacular, or elaborately staged machine play, hit the London public stage in the late 17th-century Restoration period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable scenery, baroque illusionistic painting, gorgeous costumes, and special effects such as trapdoor tricks, &quot;flying&quot; actors, and fireworks. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, &quot;legitimate&quot; Restoration drama; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.

Basically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century court masque, though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from French opera, the spectaculars are sometimes called &quot;English opera&quot;. However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all. Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term &quot;opera&quot;, as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover Samuel Pepys.

The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Albion and Albanius&quot; would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;Psyche&quot; or Dryden&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot; would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.

==End of the Restoration==
The Glorious Revolution ended the Restoration. The Glorious Revolution which overthrew King James II of England was propelled by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau (William of Orange). William&#x27;s successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his accession to the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James&#x27; daughter.

In April 1688, James had re-issued the &quot;Declaration of Indulgence&quot; and ordered all Anglican clergymen to read it to their congregations. When seven bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King&#x27;s religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel. On 30 June 1688, a group of seven Protestant nobles invited the Prince of Orange to come to England with an army. By September it became clear that William would invade England.

When William arrived on 5 November 1688, James lost his nerve, declined to attack the invading Dutch and tried to flee to France. He was captured in Kent. Later, he was released and placed under Dutch protective guard. Having no desire to make James a martyr, William, Prince of Orange, let him escape on 23 December. James was received in France by his cousin and ally, Louis XIV, who offered him a palace and a pension.

William convened a Convention Parliament to decide how to handle the situation. While the Parliament refused to depose James, they declared that James, having fled to France had effectively abdicated the throne, and that the throne was vacant. To fill this vacancy, James&#x27;s daughter Mary was declared Queen; she was to rule jointly with her husband William, Prince of Orange, who would be king. The English Parliament passed the Bill of Rights of 1689 that denounced James for abusing his power.

The abuses charged to James included the suspension of the Test Acts after having sworn as king to uphold the supremacy of the Church of England, the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for merely petitioning the crown, the establishment of a standing army, and the imposition of cruel punishments. The bill also declared that henceforth no Roman Catholic was permitted to ascend the English throne, nor could any English monarch marry a Roman Catholic.

<text>The Chicago American was an afternoon newspaper published in Chicago under various names from 1900 until its dissolution in 1975.

==History==
The paper&#x27;s first edition came out on July 4, 1900, as &quot;Hearst&#x27;s Chicago American&quot;. It became the &quot;Morning American&quot; in 1902 with the appearance of an afternoon edition. The morning and Sunday papers were renamed as the &quot;Examiner&quot; in 1904. James Keeley bought the &quot;Chicago Record-Herald&quot; and &quot;Chicago Inter-Ocean&quot; in 1914, merging them into a single newspaper known as the &quot;Herald&quot;. William Randolph Hearst purchased the paper from Keeley in 1918.

 Distribution of the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; after 1918 was controlled by gangsters. Dion O&#x27;Banion, Vincent Drucci, Hymie Weiss and Bugs Moran first sold the &quot;Tribune&quot;. They were then recruited by Moses Annenberg, who offered more money to sell the &quot;Examiner&quot;, later the &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot;. This &quot;selling&quot; consisted of pressuring stores and news dealers. In 1939, Annenberg was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud and died in prison.

The newspaper joined the Associated Press on October 31, 1932.

Under pressure from his lenders, Hearst consolidated the &quot;American&quot; and the &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot; in 1939. It continued as the &quot;Chicago Herald-American&quot; until 1953 when it became the &quot;Chicago American&quot;. The &quot;American&quot; was bought by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1956, and was renamed as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s American&quot; in 1959.

As with many other afternoon daily newspapers the paper suffered in postwar years from declining circulation figures caused in part by television news and in part by population shifts from city to suburbs. The paper continued as an afternoon broadsheet until 1969 when the &quot;Tribune&quot; converted the paper to the tabloid-format &quot;Chicago Today&quot;. Measures to bolster the paper were unsuccessful, and &quot;Chicago Today&quot; published its final issue on September 13, 1974. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; inherited many of the &quot;Today&quot;&#x27;s writers and staff and became a 24-hour operation.

The &quot;American&quot; was the product of the merger or acquisition of 14 predecessor newspapers and inherited the tradition and the files of all of them.

As an afternoon paper, the &quot;American&quot; was dependent on street sales rather than subscriptions, and breaking news helped bring in street sales.

When Frank Lloyd Wright announced plans to build a mile-high building in Chicago, the &quot;American&quot; stole the drawings and printed them.

The tradition was exemplified by the longtime night city editor of the &quot;American&quot;, Harry &quot;Romy&quot; Romanoff, who could create news stories almost at will with only a telephone. He ran the city room at night with the help of two rewrite men (including Mike McGovern, noted below), one night photo editor, a sports desk editor (Brent Musburger&#x27;s first job out of journalism school), and one night copy boy who cut and pasted AP and UPI wires for Harry&#x27;s review. Since the afternoon paper was put together the previous evening, the night city editor was the key news editor. Romanoff enjoyed the fearful but absolute regard of pressmen, the composing room and the entire night staff of the Tribune Tower, which owned and housed the &quot;Chicago American&quot;&#x27;s operations in its final decades.

One night, floods threatened Southern Illinois, and the &quot;American&quot; did not have a big story for the front page. Romanoff called fire departments and police stations throughout the region, posing as &quot;Captain Parmenter of the state police&quot; (a nonexistent individual), urging them to take action. One fire department, bemused by the call, asked what they should do. &quot;Ring those fire bells! Call out the people!&quot; Romanoff then turned to his rewrite man to dictate the lead story:

:Fire bells rang over southern Illinois as police and fire departments called out the people to warn them of impending floods.

It never did flood, but the &quot;American&quot; had its banner headline. These headlines were necessary for sales of the early editions. Later in the day, breaking news would generally replace them or reduce their importance. Of course, many stories developed in this way were genuine scoops that would be expanded in later editions.

The &quot;American&quot; gave the same attention to smaller stories as to large ones. It was usually first with police news. One notable headline:
:Mother of 14 kids kills father of 9 in police station

Headquarters for the paper was the Hearst Building, located at 326 West Madison Street in Chicago. In 1961, the offices of &quot;Chicago&#x27;s American&quot; were moved adjacent to the Tribune Tower at 435 North Michigan Avenue, where they would remain until the ultimate demise of &quot;Chicago Today&quot; in 1974.

In the end, TV news brought an end to most afternoon papers, but up until the 1970s, Chicago had a competitive journalistic scene unmatched by most other American cities, five daily newspapers and four wire services in competition, and none were more competitive than &quot;Chicago&#x27;s American&quot;.

<text>A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm or a lightning storm, is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, known as thunder. Relatively weak thunderstorms are sometimes called thundershowers. Thunderstorms occur in a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds and often produce heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, or hail, but some thunderstorms produce little precipitation or no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.

Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a front. However, some kind of cloud forcing, whether it is a front, shortwave trough, or another system is needed for the air to rapidly accelerate upward. As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, condenses, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth&#x27;s surface. As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth&#x27;s surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.

Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena, which can be potentially hazardous. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.

There are three types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, and supercell. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.

== Life cycle ==

Warm air has a lower density than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom (this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon). Clouds form as relatively warmer air, carrying moisture, rises within cooler air. The moist air rises, and, as it does so, it cools and some of the water vapor in that rising air condenses. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent heat of condensation, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud&#x27;s ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder. Meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds. Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions in order to form:
# Moisture
# An unstable airmass
# A lifting force (heat)

All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: the developing stage, the mature stage, and the dissipation stage. The average thunderstorm has a diameter. Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, each of these three stages take an average of 30 minutes.

=== Developing stage ===
The first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as &quot;cumulus&quot; clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an &quot;updraft&quot; through the process of convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

=== Mature stage ===
In the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this &#x27;cap&#x27; is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called &quot;cumulonimbus incus&quot;. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating &quot;downdrafts&quot; as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.

Typically, if there is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and &#x27;rain itself out&#x27;, but, if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction, the downdraft will be separated from the updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.
=== Dissipating stage ===

In the dissipation stage, the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm&#x27;s further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.

==Classification==
There are four main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and supercell. Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere (&quot;wind shear&quot;). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes.

Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, normally greater than in the lowest of the troposphere, which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation. Precipitable water values of greater than favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes. Those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than . Upstream values of CAPE of greater than 800 J/kg are usually required for the development of organized convection.

===Single-cell===

This term technically applies to a single thunderstorm with one main updraft. Also known as air-mass thunderstorms, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term &quot;cell&quot; refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term &quot;air mass thunderstorm&quot;. When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30 minutes.

===Multi-cell clusters===

This is the most common type of thunderstorm development. &quot;Mature thunderstorms&quot; are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. &quot;Multicell storms&quot; form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20 minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.

===Multicell lines===

A squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term was used as a synonym for cold front. The squall line contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Severe weather in the form of strong straight-line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo, within the portion of the line that bows out the most. Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP, where mesoscale low pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes in the summer are called derechos, and move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can form, which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy, which are sometimes associated with a heat burst. This kind of storm is also known as &quot;Wind of the Stony Lake&quot; (; shi2 hu2 feng1) in southern China.

===Supercells===

Supercell storms are large, usually severe, quasi-steady-state storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height (&quot;wind shear&quot;), and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts (i.e., where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft) with a strong, rotating updraft (a &quot;mesocyclone&quot;). These storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud (or anvil) can break through the troposphere and reach into the lower levels of the stratosphere. Supercell storms can be wide. Research has shown that at least 90 percent of supercells cause severe weather. These storms can produce destructive tornadoes, extremely large hailstones ( diameter), straight-line winds in excess of , and flash floods. In fact, research has shown that most tornadoes occur from this type of thunderstorm. Supercells are generally the strongest type of thunderstorm.

===Severe thunderstorms===
In the United States, a thunderstorm is classed as severe if winds reach at least , hail is in diameter or larger, or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are reported. Although a funnel cloud or tornado indicates a severe thunderstorm, a tornado warning is issued in place of a severe thunderstorm warning. A severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe, or will soon turn severe. In Canada, a rainfall rate greater than in one hour, or in three hours, is also used to indicate severe thunderstorms. Severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell. However, multicell, supercell, and squall lines represent the most common forms of thunderstorms that produce severe weather.

===Mesoscale convective systems===

A mesoscale convective system (MCS) is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones, and normally persists for several hours or more. A mesoscale convective system&#x27;s overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape, and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones, squall lines, lake-effect snow events, polar lows, and mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs), and they generally form near weather fronts. Most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day. They tend to form when the surface temperature varies by more than between day and night. The type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across North America, Europe, and Asia, with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours.

Forms of MCS that develop in the tropics are found in use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon troughs, generally within the warm season between spring and fall. More intense systems form over land than over water. One exception is that of lake-effect snow bands, which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water, and occurs from fall through spring. Polar lows are a second special class of MCS. They form at high latitudes during the cold season. Once the parent MCS dies, later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex (MCV). Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall.

==Motion==
The two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of the wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth&#x27;s troposphere, the lowest of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth&#x27;s surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.

===Back-building thunderstorm===
A back-building thunderstorm, commonly referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004, and over Chennai on 1 December 2015.

==Hazards==
Each year, many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning. While severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer, they can occur at just about any time of the year.

===Cloud-to-ground lightning===
Cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations. One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting. Under a regime of low precipitation (LP) thunderstorms, where little precipitation is present, rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat. Direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion. In areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning, like Florida, lightning causes several fatalities per year, most commonly to people working outside.

Acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning. Distilled water has a neutral pH of 7. &quot;Clean&quot; or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or certain other solid chemical compounds. In ecosystems, acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil, resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.

===Hail===

Any thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm. Thunderclouds that are capable of producing hailstones are often seen obtaining green coloration. Hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards (known as orographic lifting), thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely. One of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern India, which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888. China also experiences significant hailstorms. Across Europe, Croatia experiences frequent occurrences of hail.

In North America, hail is most common in the area where Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming meet, known as &quot;Hail Alley&quot;. Hail in this region occurs between the months of March and October during the afternoon and evening hours, with the bulk of the occurrences from May through September. Cheyenne, Wyoming, is North America&#x27;s most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season. In South America, areas prone to hail are cities like Bogotá, Colombia.

Hail can cause serious damage, notably to automobiles, aircraft, skylights, glass-roofed structures, livestock, and most commonly, farmers&#x27; crops. Hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft. When hail stones exceed in diameter, planes can be seriously damaged within seconds. The hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft. Wheat, corn, soybeans, and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage. Hail is one of Canada&#x27;s most costly hazards. Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history. One of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund, Uttarakhand, India. The largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the United States fell in 2003 in Aurora, Nebraska, United States.

===Tornadoes and waterspouts===

A tornado is a violent, rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud (otherwise known as a thundercloud) or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds between , are approximately across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating. Some attain wind speeds of more than , stretch more than across, and stay on the ground for more than 100 kilometres (dozens of miles).

The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. An EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees but does not cause significant damage to structures. An EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.

Waterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes, characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water. These spiralling columns of air frequently develop within tropical areas close to the equator, but are less common within areas of high latitude.

===Flash flood===

Flash flooding is the process where a landscape, most notably an urban environment, is subjected to rapid floods. These rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding and are frequently (though not always) associated with intense rainfall. Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in arid regions as well as densely populated urban environments, where few plants, and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced. Soil erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of landslide phenomena.

===Downburst===

Downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.

===Thunderstorm asthma===
Thunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.

==Safety precautions==
Most thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become severe, and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of lightning. Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage.

===Preparedness===
Preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness takes the form of general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.

The National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur:
:* Know the names of local counties, cities, and towns, as these are how warnings are described.
:* Monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area.
:* Be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm.
:* Cancel or reschedule outdoor events (to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits).
:* Take action early so you have time to get to a safe place.
:* Get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives.
:* If you hear thunder, get to the safe place immediately.
:* Avoid open areas like hilltops, fields, and beaches, and do not be or be near the tallest objects in an area when thunderstorms are occurring.
:* Do not shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms.
:* If in the woods, put as much distance as possible between you and any trees during thunderstorms.
:* If in a group, spread out to increase the chances of survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a lightning strike.

===Safety===
While safety and preparedness often overlap, &quot;thunderstorm safety&quot; generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm. The American Red Cross recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in progress:

:* Take action immediately upon hearing thunder. Anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning.
:* Avoid electrical appliances, including corded telephones. Cordless and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm.
:* Close and stay away from windows and doors, as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind.
:* Do not bathe or shower, as plumbing conducts electricity.
:* If driving, safely exit the roadway, turn on hazard lights, and park. Remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal.

The NWS stopped recommending the &quot;lightning crouch&quot; in 2008 as it does not provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike.

==Frequent occurrences==
 Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, even in the polar regions, with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas, where they may occur nearly daily. At any given time, approximately 2,000 thunderstorms are occurring on Earth. Kampala and Tororo in Uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on Earth, a claim also made for Singapore and Bogor on the Indonesian island of Java. Other cities known for frequent storm activity include Darwin, Caracas, Manila and Mumbai. Thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe, and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones. In temperate regions, they are most frequent in spring and summer, although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year. They may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water. Thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures.
Some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states. These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes. Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States, but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas, particularly the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California. In spring and summer, they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the Rocky Mountains as part of the North American Monsoon regime. In the Northeast, storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest, but with less frequency and severity. During the summer, air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of Florida.

==Energy==

If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×108 kg of water vapor are lifted, and the amount of energy released when this condenses is 1015 joules. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms. It is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.

==Studies==
In more contemporary times, thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity. Every spring, storm chasers head to the Great Plains of the United States and the Canadian Prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping. Radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms. More organized meteorological projects such as VORTEX2 use an array of sensors, such as the Doppler on Wheels, vehicles with mounted automated weather stations, weather balloons, and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather. Lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground lightning strokes with 95 percent accuracy in detection and within of their point of origin.
==Mythology and religion==
Thunderstorms strongly influenced many early civilizations. Greeks believed that they were battles waged by Zeus, who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus. Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit. The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight Jötnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir. Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms. Christian doctrine accepts that fierce storms are the work of God. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.

Martin Luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began, causing him to pray to God for being saved and promising to become a monk.

==Outside of Earth==
Thunderstorms, evidenced by flashes of lightning, on Jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice, suggesting a mechanism similar to that on Earth. (Water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge, so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning). These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times more powerful than lightning on the Earth. The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior. The clouds of Venus may also be capable of producing lightning; some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth.

<text>The Adventures of Pinocchio ( ; , i.e. &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio. Story of a Puppet&quot;), commonly shortened to Pinocchio, is an 1883 children&#x27;s fantasy novel by Italian author Carlo Collodi. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio, which he faces many perils and temptations, meets characters that teach him about life, and learns goodness before he achieves his heart&#x27;s desire of becoming a real boy.

The story was originally published in serial form as &quot;The Story of a Puppet&quot; () in the , one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes at Chapter 15, but by popular demand from readers, the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book. Since then, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; has been one of the most popular children&#x27;s books and been critically acclaimed.

A universal icon and a metaphor of the human condition, the book is considered a canonical piece of children&#x27;s literature and has had great impact on world culture. Philosopher Benedetto Croce considered it one of the greatest works of Italian literature. Since its first publication, it has inspired many works of fiction, such as Walt Disney&#x27;s animated version, and commonplace ideas such as a liar&#x27;s long nose.

The book has been translated into as many as 260 languages worldwide, making it one of the world&#x27;s most translated books. While it is likely one of the best-selling books ever published, the actual total sales since its first publication are unknown due to the many reductions and different versions. According to Viero Peroncini, &quot;some sources report 35 million [copies sold], others 80, but it is only a way, even a rather idle one, of quantifying an unquantifiable success.&quot; According to Francelia Butler, it also remains &quot;the most translated Italian book and, after the Bible, the most widely read&quot;.

== Plot ==

In Tuscany, Italy, a carpenter named Master Antonio finds a log that he plans to carve into a table leg. However, after being frightened when the log cries out, he gives it to his neighbor Geppetto who wants to carve a puppet from it and make a living as a traveling puppeteer. He carves a boy and names him &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Once the puppet is finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and into the town, where he is caught by a Carabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons Geppetto.

Left alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto&#x27;s house to get something to eat, where a talking cricket warns him of the perils of disobedience and laziness. In retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, accidentally killing it. Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but a chick hatches from the egg and leaves to find food. He knocks on a neighbor&#x27;s door, but they fear he is pulling a prank and dump water on him. Cold and wet, Pinocchio goes home and lies down on a stove, and upon waking he finds his feet have burned off. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison, gives Pinocchio three pears to eat for breakfast, and makes him a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school and Geppetto makes him a suit of clothing consisting of a dress made of flowered paper, tree bark shoes, and a cap made of dough, and sells his only coat to buy him a spelling book.


On his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre and sells his school book to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppets Harlequin, Pulcinella and Signora Rosaura call out to Pinocchio. This angers the puppet master Mangiafuoco, and he decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his dinner. However, after Pinocchio pleads for his and Harlequin&#x27;s salvation and he learns of Geppetto&#x27;s poverty, Mangiafuoco releases him and gives him five gold pieces.
On his way home, Pinocchio meets a fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame; a white blackbird tries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the Cat eats it. The two convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city of &quot;Acchiappacitrulli&quot;, they will grow into a tree with gold coins. They stop for dinner at the Red Lobster Inn where they trick Pinocchio into paying for their meals and flee after telling the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio they would meet him at the Field of Miracles in the morning.

As Pinocchio sets off for the City of Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears and tells him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again and as he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised as bandits, ambush and rob him. After biting off the Cat&#x27;s paw, he escapes to a white house, where he is greeted by a young fairy with turquoise hair who says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the Fox and the Cat catch Pinocchio and hang him in a tree and leave after getting tired of waiting for him to suffocate, leaving Pinocchio to die alone and think about his misbehavior.
The Fairy has Pinocchio rescued and calls in three doctors to evaluate him - the Owl says he is alive, the Crow says he is dead, and the Ghost of the Talking Cricket says he is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy offers medicine to Pinocchio, which he takes when several Undertaker rabbits appear to collect his body. Now recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what happened to the gold coins and his nose grows. The Fairy explains that Pinocchio&#x27;s lies are causing his nose to grow and calls in a flock of woodpeckers to chisel it down to size. She then sends for Geppetto to come and live with them in the forest cottage.
As Pinocchio heads out to find Geppetto, he once again meets the Fox and the Cat, who remind him of the Field of Miracles, and he agrees to go with them and plant his gold. Once there, Pinocchio buries his coins and leaves to wait twenty minutes for it to grow, only for the Fox and the Cat dig up the coins and run away.
Once Pinocchio returns, a parrot mocks him for falling for the Fox and Cat&#x27;s tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse, where he reports the theft of the coins to a gorilla judge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio&#x27;s plea, the gorilla judge sentences him to four months in prison for the crime of foolishness. Fortunately, all criminals are released early when the Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army&#x27;s victory over the town&#x27;s enemies.
As Pinocchio heads back to the forest, he finds an enormous snake with a smoking tail blocking the way. He asks the serpent to move, but it remains completely still, and he assumes it is dead. He begins to step over it, but it suddenly rises up and hisses at him, toppling him over onto his head. Struck by Pinocchio&#x27;s fright and comical position, the snake laughs so hard he bursts an artery and dies.

Pinocchio then heads back to the Fairy&#x27;s house in the forest, where he sneaks into a farmer&#x27;s yard to steal some grapes. He is caught in a weasel trap and encounters a glowworm, where the farmer finds him and ties him up in his doghouse. When Pinocchio foils the chicken-stealing weasels, the farmer frees him as a reward. Pinocchio finally returns to the cottage, but there he finds nothing but a gravestone and believes the Fairy has died.
A friendly pigeon sees Pinocchio mourning the Fairy&#x27;s death and offers to give him a ride to the seashore, where Geppetto is building a boat to search for Pinocchio. Pinocchio is washed ashore when he tries to swim to his father, who is swallowed by The Terrible Dogfish. Pinocchio accepts a ride from a dolphin to the Island of Busy Bees where everyone works every day. Upon arriving there, Pinocchio offers to carry a lady&#x27;s jug home in return for food and water, and upon arriving at her house, he recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now old enough to be his mother. She says she will act as his mother, and he will begin going to school. She hints that if he does well in school and is good for one year, then he will become a real boy.
Pinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, making the other boys jealous. They trick Pinocchio into playing hooky by saying they saw a large sea monster at the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, they were lying, and a fight breaks out, during which Pinocchio is accused of injuring another boy. He escapes, and along the way saves a drowning Mastiff named Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio from The Green Fisherman, who was going to eat him. After meeting the Snail that works for the Fairy, she gives him another chance.
Pinocchio does excellently in school, and the Fairy promises that he will be a real boy the next day, saying he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked after meeting Candlewick, one of his closest friends, who tells him he is heading to a place called Toyland, where children play all day and never work or study. Pinocchio goes along with him, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.
One morning, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys&#x27; ears. A marmot tells Pinocchio that he has gotten donkey fever, as boys who play and never study or work turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed, and Pinocchio is sold to a circus where he is trained to do tricks, until he falls and sprains his leg after seeing the Fairy in one of the box seats. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and use his hide to make a drum, and throws him into the sea to drown him. But when he goes to retrieve the corpse, he finds Pinocchio, who explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again. Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea, where the Terrible Dogfish appears and swallows him. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, and they escape with help from a large tuna and look for a new place to live.


Pinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat, who are now impoverished and lame and blind respectively. They plead for food and money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that they have earned their misfortune. Geppetto and Pinocchio then arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for a farmer, and recognizes his dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.
After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money, and gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all of his money. That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy, with his puppet body lying lifeless on a chair. The Fairy has also left him a new suit, boots, and a bag which contains 40 gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health.

==History==
&quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; incorporates elements similar to that of fairy tales, as it is a story about an animated puppet and boys who turn into donkeys. The story is set in the Tuscan area of Italy, and features Italian language peppered with Florentine dialect features, such as the protagonist&#x27;s Florentine name.

As a young man, Collodi joined the seminary. However, the cause of Italian unification (&quot;Risorgimento&quot;) usurped his calling, as he took to journalism as a means of supporting the Risorgimento in its struggle with the Austrian Empire. In the 1850s, Collodi began to have a variety of both fiction and non-fiction books published. Once, he translated some French fairy-tales so well that he was asked whether he would like to write some of his own. In 1848, Collodi started publishing &quot;Il Lampione&quot;, a newspaper of political satire. With the founding of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, Collodi ceased his journalistic and militaristic activities and began writing children&#x27;s books.

Collodi wrote a number of didactic children&#x27;s stories for the recently unified Italy, including &quot;Viaggio per l&#x27;Italia di Giannettino&quot; (&quot;Little Johnny&#x27;s voyage through Italy&quot;; 1876), a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, and &quot;Minuzzolo&quot; (1878). In 1881, he sent a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet to a friend who edited a newspaper in Rome, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this &quot;bit of foolishness&quot; in his children&#x27;s section. The editor did, and the children loved it.

&quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; was originally published in serial form in the &quot;Giornale per i bambini&quot;, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. In the original, serialized version, Pinocchio dies a gruesome death: hanged for his innumerable faults, at the end of Chapter 15. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16–36, in which the Fairy with Turquoise Hair rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy, when he acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story more suitable for children. In the second half of the book, the maternal figure of the Blue-haired Fairy is the dominant character, versus the paternal figure of Geppetto in the first part. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book with huge success.

Children&#x27;s literature was a new idea in Collodi&#x27;s time, an innovation in the 19th century. Thus in content and style it was new and modern, opening the way to many writers of the following century.

==International popularity==
&quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; is the world&#x27;s third most translated book (240–260 languages), and was the first work of Italian children&#x27;s literature to achieve international fame. The book has had great impact on world culture, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide. The title character is a cultural icon and one of the most reimagined characters in children&#x27;s literature. The popularity of the story was bolstered by the powerful philosopher-critic Benedetto Croce, who greatly admired the tale and reputed it as one of the greatest works of Italian literature.

Carlo Collodi, who died in 1890, was respected during his lifetime as a talented writer and social commentator, and his fame continued to grow when &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was first translated into English by Mary Alice Murray in 1892, whose translation was added to the widely read Everyman&#x27;s Library in 1911. Other well regarded English translations include the 1926 translation by Carol Della Chiesa, and the 1986 bilingual edition by Nicolas J. Perella. The first appearance of the book in the United States was in 1898, with publication of the first US edition in 1901, translated and illustrated by Walter S. Cramp and Charles Copeland. From that time, the story was one of the most famous children&#x27;s books in the United States and an important step for many illustrators.

Together with those from the United Kingdom, the American editions contributed to the popularity of Pinocchio in countries more culturally distant from Italy, such as Iceland and Asian countries. In 1905, Otto Julius Bierbaum published a new version of the book in Germany, entitled &quot;Zapfelkerns Abenteuer&quot; (lit. &quot;The Adventures of Pine Nut&quot;), and the first French edition was published in 1902. Between 1911 and 1945, translations were made into all European languages and several languages of Asia, Africa and Oceania. In 1936, Soviet writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy published a reworked version of Pinocchio titled &quot;The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino&quot; (originally a character in the commedia dell&#x27;arte), which became one of the most popular characters of Russian children&#x27;s literature.

The first stage adaptation was launched in 1899, written by Gattesco Gatteschi and Enrico Guidotti and directed by Luigi Rasi. Also, Pinocchio was adopted as a pioneer of cinema: in 1911, Giulio Antamoro featured him in a 45-minute hand-coloured silent film starring Polidor (an almost complete version of the film was restored in the 1990s). In 1932, Noburō Ōfuji directed a Japanese movie with an experimental technique using animated puppets, while in the 1930s in Italy, there was an attempt to produce a full-length animated cartoon film of the same title. The 1940 Walt Disney version was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water.

==Literary analysis==
Before writing &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, Collodi wrote a number of didactic children&#x27;s stories for the recently unified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, titled &quot;Viaggio per l&#x27;Italia di Giannettino&quot; (&quot;Little Johnny&#x27;s voyage through Italy&quot;). Throughout &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of moral fiber and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun.

The structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folk-tales of peasants who venture out into the world but are naively unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations. At the time of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from the industrialization of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the cities; the problem was exacerbated by similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One major effect was the emigration of much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries, often as far away as South and North America.

Some literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. According to Thomas J. Morrissey and Richard Wunderlich in &quot;Death and Rebirth in Pinocchio&quot; (1983) &quot;such mythological events probably imitate the annual cycle of vegetative birth, death, and renascence, and they often serve as paradigms for the frequent symbolic deaths and rebirths encountered in literature. Two such symbolic renderings are most prominent: re-emergence from a journey to hell and rebirth through metamorphosis. Journeys to the underworld are a common feature of Eurasian literary epics: Gilgamesh, Odysseus, Aeneas, and Dante all benefit from the knowledge and power they put on after such descents. Rebirth through metamorphosis, on the other hand, is a motif generally consigned to fantasy or speculative literature [...] These two figurative manifestations of the death-rebirth trope are rarely combined; however, Carlo Collodi&#x27;s great fantasy-epic, &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, is a work in which a hero experiences symbolic death and rebirth through both infernal descent and metamorphosis. Pinocchio is truly a fantasy hero of epic proportions [...] Beneath the book&#x27;s comic-fantasy texture—but not far beneath—lies a symbolic journey to the underworld, from which Pinocchio emerges whole.&quot;

The main imperatives demanded of Pinocchio are to work, be good, and study. And in the end Pinocchio&#x27;s willingness to provide for his father and devote himself to these things transforms him into a real boy with modern comforts. &quot;as a hero of what is, in the classic sense, a comedy, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is protected from ultimate catastrophe, although he suffers quite a few moderate calamities. Collodi never lets the reader forget that disaster is always a possibility; in fact, that is just what Pinocchio&#x27;s mentors —Geppetto, the Talking Cricket, and the Fairy— repeatedly tell him. Although they are part of a comedy, Pinocchio&#x27;s adventures are not always funny. Indeed, they are sometimes sinister. The book&#x27;s fictive world does not exclude injury, pain, or even death—they are stylized but not absent. [...] Accommodate them he does, by using the archetypal birth-death-rebirth motif as a means of structuring his hero&#x27;s growth to responsible boyhood. Of course, the success of the puppet&#x27;s growth is rendered in terms of his metamorphic rebirth as a flesh-and-blood human.&quot;

==Adaptations==

The story has been adapted into many forms on stage and screen, some keeping close to the original Collodi narrative while others treat the story more freely. There are at least fourteen English-language films based on the story, Italian, French, Russian, German, Japanese and other versions for the big screen and for television, and several musical adaptations.

<doc id="70838" wikidata="Q366835" url="?curid=70838" title="Adrenochrome">
<text>Adrenochrome is a chemical compound produced by the oxidation of adrenaline (epinephrine). It was the subject of limited research from the 1950s through to the 1970s as a potential cause of schizophrenia. While it has no current medical application, the semicarbazide derivative, carbazochrome, is a hemostatic medication. 

Despite this compound&#x27;s name, it is unrelated to the element chromium; instead, the suffix indicates a relationship to color, as pure adrenochrome has a deep violet color.

== Chemistry ==
The oxidation reaction that converts adrenaline into adrenochrome occurs both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;. Silver oxide (Ag2O) was among the first reagents employed for this, but a variety of other oxidizing agents have been used successfully. In solution, adrenochrome is pink and further oxidation of the compound causes it to polymerize into brown or black melanin compounds.

=== Synthesis ===
Adrenochrome is readily synthesized from commercially available reagents: chloroacetic acid and catechol react in the presence of phosphoryl chloride to yield chloroacetylcatechol. After purification, chloroacetylcatechol is reacted with aqueous methylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid, yielding adrenalone hydrochloride. This is then hydrogenated to racemic adrenaline. Finally, adrenaline is oxidized to adrenochrome by an appropriate oxidizing agent such as silver oxide.

== History ==
Several small-scale studies involving 15 or fewer test subjects conducted in the 1950s and 1960s reported that adrenochrome triggered psychotic reactions such as thought disorder and derealization.

In 1954, researchers Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond claimed that adrenochrome is a neurotoxic, psychotomimetic substance and may play a role in schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. In what Hoffer called the &quot;adrenochrome hypothesis&quot;, he and Osmond in 1967 speculated that megadoses of vitamin C and niacin could cure schizophrenia by reducing brain adrenochrome.

The treatment of schizophrenia with such potent anti-oxidants is controversial. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reported methodological flaws in Hoffer&#x27;s work on niacin as a schizophrenia treatment and referred to follow-up studies that did not confirm any benefits of the treatment. Multiple additional studies in the United States, Canada, and Australia similarly failed to find benefits of megavitamin therapy to treat schizophrenia.

The adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia waned, despite some evidence that it may be psychotomimetic, as adrenochrome was not detectable in people with schizophrenia.

In the early 2000s, interest was renewed by the discovery that adrenochrome may be produced normally as an intermediate in the formation of neuromelanin. This finding may be significant because adrenochrome is detoxified at least partially by glutathione-S-transferase. Some studies have found genetic defects in the gene for this enzyme.

Adrenochrome is also believed to have cardiotoxic properties.

== In popular culture ==
* In his 1954 book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, Aldous Huxley mentioned the discovery and the alleged effects of adrenochrome, which he likened to the symptoms of mescaline intoxication, although he had never consumed it.
* Anthony Burgess mentions adrenochrome as &quot;drencrom&quot; at the beginning of his 1962 novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The protagonist and his friends are drinking drug-laced milk: &quot;They had no license for selling liquor, but there was no law yet against prodding some of the new veshches which they used to put into the old moloko, so you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches [...]&quot;
* Hunter S. Thompson mentioned adrenochrome in his 1971 book &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. This is the likely origin of current myths surrounding this compound, because a character states that &quot;There&#x27;s only one source for this stuff... the adrenaline glands from a living human body. It&#x27;s no good if you get it out of a corpse.&quot; The adrenochrome scene also appears in the novel&#x27;s film adaptation. In the DVD commentary, director Terry Gilliam admits that his and Thompson&#x27;s portrayal is a fictional exaggeration. Gilliam insists that the drug is entirely fictional and seems unaware of the existence of a substance with the same name. Hunter S. Thompson also mentions adrenochrome in his book &quot;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#x27;72&quot;. In the footnotes in chapter April, page 140, he says: &quot;It was sometime after midnight in a ratty hotel room and my memory of the conversation is hazy, due to massive ingestion of booze, fatback, and forty cc&#x27;s of adrenochrome.&quot;
* In the first episode of the ITV series &quot;Lewis&quot;, &quot;Whom the Gods Would Destroy&quot;, the motive for the crimes was that a prostitute had been killed years previously to harvest her adrenal glands.
* Adrenochrome is mentioned in the 2014 Warhammer 40,000 novel &quot;The Talon of Horus&quot; by Aaron Dembski-Bowden. It is described as a clear liquid beverage that is, &quot;harvested from the adrenal glands of living slaves [...]&quot;
* Adrenochrome is the subject of several conspiracy theories, including QAnon and Pizzagate, in which the chemical plays a similar role to earlier blood libel and Satanic ritual abuse stories. The theories commonly state that a cabal of Satanists rape and murder children, and harvest adrenochrome from their victims&#x27; blood as a drug or as an elixir of youth. In reality, adrenochrome has been produced by organic synthesis since at least 1952, is synthesized by biotechnology companies for research purposes, and has no medical or recreational uses.

<doc id="70839" wikidata="Q707767" url="?curid=70839" title="Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht">
<text>The Bishopric of Utrecht (; ) was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire in the Low Countries, in the present-day Netherlands. From 1024 to 1528, as one of the prince-bishoprics of the Holy Roman Empire, it was ruled by the bishops of Utrecht. 

The Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht is not to be confused with the Diocese of Utrecht, which covered a larger area. Over the areas outside the Prince-Bishopric, the bishop exercised only spiritual, not temporal, authority.

In 1528, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor secularized the Prince-Bishopric, depriving the bishop of its secular authority.

== History ==
===Background===
The Diocese of Utrecht was established in 695 when Saint Willibrord was consecrated bishop of the Frisians at Rome by Pope Sergius I. With the consent of the Frankish ruler, Pippin of Herstal, he settled in an old Roman fort in Utrecht. After Willibrord&#x27;s death the diocese suffered greatly from the incursions of the Frisians, and later on of the Vikings. Whether Willibrord could be called the first bishop of Utrecht is doubtful; as James Palmer points out, &quot;there was no real concept of a well-defined bishopric until at least the days of Alberic (775–84)&quot;. And while Saint Boniface is referred to in his hagiographies as the successor of Willibrord (and, in turn, Gregory of Utrecht is referred to as the successor to Willibrord and Boniface), this does not necessarily mean &quot;successor as bishop&quot;, but rather that they succeeded each other as missionaries to the Frisians.

=== Foundation ===
Better times appeared during the reign of the Saxon emperors, who frequently summoned the Bishops of Utrecht to attend the imperial councils and diets. In 1024 the bishops were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the new Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was formed. The secular territory over which it ruled was known as Sticht Utrecht or Het Sticht (a sticht was any piece of land governed by a bishop or abbot). This territory was divided into the &quot;Nedersticht&quot; (Lower Sticht, roughly corresponding to the present day province of Utrecht) and &quot;Oversticht&quot; (Upper Sticht, encompassing the present-day provinces of Overijssel, Drenthe, and part of Groningen).

In 1122, with the Concordat of Worms, the Emperor&#x27;s right of investiture was annulled, and the cathedral chapter received the right to elect the bishop. It was, however, soon obligated to share this right with the four other collegiate chapters in the city. The Counts of Holland and Guelders, between whose territories the lands of the Bishops of Utrecht lay, also sought to acquire influence over the filling of the episcopal see. This often led to disputes and consequently the Holy See frequently interfered in the election. After the middle of the 14th century the popes repeatedly appointed the bishop directly without regard to the five chapters.

It was part of the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle, until 1548 when it joined the Burgundian Circle as part of the Habsburg Netherlands.

In 1527, the Bishop sold his territories, and thus his secular authority, to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the principality became an integral part of the Habsburg dominions. The chapters transferred their right of electing the bishop to Charles V and his government, a measure to which Pope Clement VII gave his consent, under political pressure after the Sack of Rome.

=== Dissolution ===

The Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was conquered by Habsburg troops in 1528. The southwestern Nedersticht core territory around the city of Utrecht became the Lordship of Utrecht, whilst the southern part of the Oversticht was transformed into the Lordship of Overijssel. The northern parts were annexed in 1536 as the County of Drenthe.

<doc id="70841" wikidata="Q1867820" url="?curid=70841" title="City status in the United Kingdom">
<text>City status in the United Kingdom is granted by the monarch of the United Kingdom to specific centres of population, which might or might not meet the generally accepted definition of cities. , there are 76 cities in the United Kingdom—55 in England, seven in Wales, eight in Scotland, and six in Northern Ireland. Although it carries no special rights, the status of city can be a marker of prestige and confer local pride.

The status does not apply automatically on the basis of any particular criterion, though until 1889 in England and Wales it was limited to towns with diocesan cathedrals. This association between having an Anglican cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when King Henry VIII founded dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and granted them city status by issuing letters patent. A city with a cathedral is often termed a cathedral city.

City status in Ireland was granted to far fewer communities than in England and Wales, and there are only two pre-19th-century cities in present-day Northern Ireland. In Scotland, city status did not explicitly receive any recognition by the state until the 19th century. At that time, a revival of grants of city status took place, first in England, where the grants were accompanied by the establishment of new cathedrals, and later in Scotland and Ireland. In the 20th century, it was explicitly recognised that the status of city in England and Wales would no longer be bound to the presence of a cathedral, and grants made since have been awarded to communities on a variety of criteria, including population size.

The abolition of some corporate bodies as part of successive local-government reforms, beginning with the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, has deprived some ancient cities of their status. However, letters patent have been issued for most of the affected cities to ensure the continuation or restoration of their status. At present, Rochester and Elgin are the only former cities in the United Kingdom.

The name &quot;City&quot; does not, in itself, denote city status; it may be appended to place names for historic association (e.g. White City) or for marketing or disambiguation (e.g. Stratford City). A number of large towns (such as those with over 200,000 residents) in the UK are bigger than some small cities.

== History ==

=== England and Wales ===

==== Pre-19th century ====
The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organised by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the &quot;28 Cities&quot; () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.

In the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English Crown if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits, for which 22 dioceses existed in England &amp; Wales (see City status conferment further in the article). This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established when Henry VIII founded new dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six English towns and also granted them city status by issuing letters patent, demonstrating these were discrete procedures. Some cities today are very small because they were granted city status in or before the 16th century, then were unaffected by population growth during the Industrial Revolution—notably Wells (population about 10,000) and St Davids (population about 2,000). After the 16th century, no new dioceses (and no new cities) were created until the 19th century in England (a further city was created in Ireland during the rule of King James I in the 17th century).

==== 1836–1888 ====
A long-awaited resumption of creating dioceses began in 1836 with Ripon. Ripon Town Council assumed that this had elevated the town to the rank of a city, and started referring to itself as the &quot;City and Borough of Ripon&quot;. The next diocese formed was Manchester and its Borough Council began informally to use the title &quot;city&quot;. When Queen Victoria visited Manchester in 1851, widespread doubts surrounding its status were raised. The pretension was ended when the borough petitioned for city status, which was granted by letters patent in 1853. This eventually forced Ripon to regularise its position; its city status was recognised by Act of Parliament in 1865. From this year Ripon bore city status whilst the rapidly expanding conurbation of Leeds – in the Ripon diocese – did not. The Manchester case established a precedent that any municipal borough in which an Anglican see was established was entitled to petition for city status. Accordingly, Truro, St Albans, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Wakefield were all officially designated as cities between 1877 and 1888.

This was not without opposition from the Home Office, which dismissed St Albans as &quot;a fourth or fifth rate market town&quot; and objected to Wakefield&#x27;s elevation on grounds of population. In one new diocese, Southwell, a city was not created, because it was a village without a borough corporation and therefore could not petition the Queen. The diocese covered the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and the boroughs of Derby and Nottingham were disappointed that they would not be able to claim the title of city.

==== 1889–1907 ====

The link with Anglican dioceses was broken within England in 1889 when Birmingham successfully petitioned for city status (it was pre-empted in Ireland by Belfast in 1888) on the grounds of its large population and history of good local government. At the time of the grant, Birmingham lacked an Anglican cathedral, although the parish church later became a cathedral in 1905. This new precedent was followed by other large municipalities: Leeds and Sheffield became cities in 1893, and Bradford, Kingston upon Hull and Nottingham were honoured on the occasion of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The last three had been the largest county boroughs outside the London area without city status.

Between 1897 and 1914, applications were received from a number of other boroughs, but only Cardiff was successful in being designated a city in 1905 and granted a Lord Mayoralty as &quot;the Metropolis of Wales&quot;.

==== The status of Westminster ====
The London Government Act 1899 abolished the existing local authorities within the County of London and replaced them with 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster&#x27;s members of parliament, brought forward an amendment at the committee stage to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster to &#x27;City of Westminster&#x27;. This was intended to give &quot;recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries&quot;. He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it &quot;must necessarily disappear altogether&quot;. The amendment was rejected by the committee, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be &quot;an anomaly which, I think, would be not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations&quot;. The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that &quot;as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII&quot;. Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of &quot;city&quot; to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.

==== 1907–1953 ====
In 1907, the Home Office and King Edward VII agreed on a policy that future applicants would have to meet certain criteria. This policy, which was not at the time made public, had the effect of stemming the number of city creations.

The 1907 policy contained three criteria:
* A minimum population of 300,000.
* A &quot;local metropolitan character&quot;—this implied that the town had a distinct identity of its own and was the centre of a wider area.
* A good record of local government.

However, well into the 20th century it was often assumed that the presence of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting it. On this basis, the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; said that Southwell and St Asaph were cities.

The policy laid down by Edward VII was continued by his successor, George V, who ascended the throne in 1910. In 1911, an application for city status by Portsmouth was refused. Explaining the Home Secretary&#x27;s reason for not recommending the King to approve the petition, the Lord Advocate stated:

...during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.

Following the First World War, the King made an official visit to Leicester in 1919 to commemorate its contributions to the military victory. The borough council had made several applications for city status since 1889, and took the opportunity of the visit to renew its request. Leicester had a population of approximately 230,000 at the previous census, but its petition was granted as an exception to the policy, as it was officially a restoration of a dignity lost in the past. When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent applied for city status in 1925, it was initially refused as it had only 294,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, however, as it was felt to have outstanding importance as the centre of the pottery industry. The effective relaxation of the population rule led to applications from Portsmouth and Salford. The civil servants in the Home Office were minded to refuse both applications. In particular, Salford was felt to be &quot;merely a scratch collection of 240,000 people cut off from Manchester by the river&quot;. Salford&#x27;s case, however, was considered favourably by the Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, who had once been a Member of Parliament (MP) for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester North West. Following protests from Portsmouth, which felt it had better credentials as a larger town and as the &quot;first Naval Port of the kingdom&quot;, both applications were approved in 1926.

In 1927, a Royal Commission on Local Government was examining local council areas and functions in England and Wales. The question arose as to which towns were entitled to be called cities, and the chairman, the Earl of Onslow, wrote to the Home Office to seek clarification. The Home Office replied with a memorandum that read:

The title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no connexion with the status of the borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the title of a city and the seat of a bishopric, and the creation of a new see neither constitutes the town concerned a city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.

In 1928, Plymouth submitted an application for city status. As the borough had more inhabitants than Portsmouth and had absorbed Devonport and East Stonehouse, the King agreed to the request. However, he indicated that he had &quot;come to an end of city making&quot;, and Southampton&#x27;s application in the following year was turned down. In 1932 Sunderland&#x27;s petition to gain city status was turned down, as was Derby&#x27;s in 1935. The next city to be created was Lancaster in 1937 as part of the celebrations of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. With a population of a little over 50,000, Lancaster was stated to be an exception due to the town&#x27;s &quot;long association with the crown&quot; and because it was &quot;the county town of the King&#x27;s Duchy of Lancaster&quot;. Following the Second World War, members of Cambridge Borough Council made contact with Lancaster officials for assistance in their application. Cambridge became a city in 1951, again for &quot;exceptional&quot; reasons, as the only ancient seat of learning in the kingdom not a city or royal burgh and to coincide with the 750th anniversary of the borough&#x27;s first charter of incorporation.

==== 1953–1974 ====
It was anticipated that the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 would lead to the creation of a city, and Wolverhampton, Preston and Southampton made approaches; the only civic honour given was that of a lord mayoralty to Coventry. Croydon applied in 1954, but failed as it was felt not to have a sufficient identity apart from Greater London, and reports on the conduct of local government in the town were unfavourable. Derby and Southwark made unsuccessful applications in 1955. The planned reorganisations by the Local Government Commissions for England and Wales from 1958 effectively blocked new city grants. Southampton lodged a petition in 1958. Initially refused in 1959, pending the decision of the commission, it was eventually allowed in 1964. In the meantime, the administration of London was reformed under the London Government Act 1963. While the City of London was permitted to continue in existence largely unchanged, Westminster was merged with two neighbouring authorities to form a new London borough from 1 April 1965. In December 1963 it was announced that a charter was to be granted incorporating the new authority as &quot;Westminster&quot;, and that the Queen had accepted the advice of the Home Secretary to raise the London borough to the title and dignity of city. This example, of a successor local authority to a merged local government entity taking on that former entity&#x27;s city status, was to be replicated in many instances as a result of the 1972/74 local government reforms across England and Wales (see below).

With the establishment of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England in 1966, city grants were again in abeyance in England. Attempts by Derby, Teesside and Wolverhampton to become cities were not proceeded with. In Wales, Swansea campaigned for city status throughout the 1960s. The campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1969, in conjunction with the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales.

==== 1974 reorganisation and new cities ====
The Local Government Act 1972 abolished all existing local authorities outside London (other than parish councils) in England and Wales. This meant that the various local authorities that held city status ceased to exist on 1 April 1974. To preserve city status new letters patent were issued to the most relevant metropolitan borough, non-metropolitan district or successor parish councils created by the Act. Some of these came to cover local government districts many times wider than the previous city, even taking in many square miles of rural land outside the urban areas, for example the cities of Bradford, Leeds and Winchester. Three non-local authority preservations arose: here charter trustees were established for the cities of Lichfield and Salisbury (or New Sarum) being neither districts nor civil parishes, and special letters patent for a time preserved the city of Rochester.

In 1977, as part of the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the Home Office identified nine candidates for city status: Blackburn, Brighton, Croydon, Derby, Dudley, Newport, Sandwell, Sunderland and Wolverhampton. Ultimately, Derby received the award as the largest non-metropolitan district not already designated a city. In April 1980 a parish council was created for Lichfield, and the charter trustees established six years earlier were dissolved. City status was temporarily lost until new letters patent were issued in November of the same year. In 1992, on the fortieth anniversary of the monarch&#x27;s accession, it was announced that another town would be elevated to a city. An innovation on this occasion was that a competition was to be held, and communities would be required to submit applications. Sunderland was the successful applicant. This was followed in 1994 by the restoration of the dignity to St David&#x27;s, historic see of a bishop. Since 2000, city status has been awarded to towns or local government districts by competition on special occasions. A large number of towns have applied for the honour in recent decades including Blackpool, Colchester, Croydon, Gateshead, Ipswich, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Reading, Swindon and Warrington. Four successful applicants in England have become cities, as well as two in Wales; in 2000 for the Millennium celebrations, the new cities were Brighton and Hove and Wolverhampton; in 2002 for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee it was Preston and Newport, and in 2012 for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee it was Chelmsford and St Asaph.

====2021 bids for city status====

From June 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2022. Places submitting bids (some for a second or subsequent time) included Bangor (Northern Ireland), Bournemouth, Doncaster, Dunfermline, Dudley, Marazion, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Reading, St Andrews and Wrexham. Bids were also accepted from overseas territories and crown dependencies for the first time. The competition closed on 8 December 2021 with 39 locations on the shortlist, and the winners were to be announced in June 2022.

On 18 October 2021, the Prime Minister announced in Parliament that the Queen, in advance of the closing date, would accord city status to one of the applicants, Southend-on-Sea. This was in memory of Sir David Amess, the town&#x27;s MP who was murdered three days earlier and had long pressed for the status. City status was officially granted by letters patent dated 26 January 2022. They were presented to Southend Borough Council by Charles, Prince of Wales, on 1 March 2022.

An announcement on 20 May 2022 declared that eight new cities were to be created from the shortlist, with at least one in every UK country as well as in overseas locations. In England, Milton Keynes, Colchester and Doncaster were to be the recipients of the honour. Dunfermline, a previous royal capital of Scotland, was granted the privilege. Bangor in Northern Ireland was also a recipient, and the title in Wales was granted to Wrexham. These awards increased the number of official mainland cities to 76, with 55 in England, eight in Scotland, seven in Wales, six in Northern Ireland.

==== Greater London ====
Other than the cities of London and Westminster, no local authorities in the Greater London area have been granted city status. The Home Office had a policy of resisting any attempt by metropolitan boroughs to become cities even when their populations, and other proposed claims as qualifying criteria, might otherwise have made them eligible. It was felt that such a grant would undermine the status of the two existing cities in the capital. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark made a number of applications, but in 1955 the borough&#x27;s town clerk was told not to pursue the matter any further. Outside the boundaries of the county, the County Borough of Croydon made three applications, all of which were dismissed as it was not seen as being sufficiently separate from London. When the successor London Borough of Croydon applied in 1965 the Assistant Under Secretary of State summarised the case against Croydon: &quot;...whatever its past history, it is now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs&quot;.

The same objections were made when the London Boroughs of Croydon and Southwark unsuccessfully entered the competition for city status to mark the millennium: Croydon was said to have &quot;no particular identity of its own&quot; while Southwark was &quot;part of London with little individual identity&quot;. When the competition was held to mark the Golden Jubilee of 2002, Croydon made a sixth application, again unsuccessful. It was joined by the London Borough of Greenwich, which emphasised its royal and maritime connections, while claiming to be &quot;to London what Versailles is to Paris&quot;. In this vein Greenwich joined Kingston-upon-Thames and Kensington and Chelsea in London in having the title of Royal Borough in 2012.

==== Rochester ====
Rochester was recognised as a city from 1211 to 1998. On 1 April 1974, the city council was abolished, becoming part of the Borough of Medway, a local government district in the county of Kent. However, under letters patent the former city council area was to continue to be styled the &quot;City of Rochester&quot; to &quot;perpetuate the ancient name&quot; and to recall &quot;the long history and proud heritage of the said city&quot;. The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In 1979, the Borough of Medway was renamed as Rochester-upon-Medway, and in 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough.

On 1 April 1998, the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham were abolished and became the new unitary authority of Medway. Since it was the local government district that officially held city status under the 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city. Whilst the two other local government districts with city status (Bath and Hereford) that were abolished around this time decided to appoint charter trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty, Rochester-upon-Medway City Council did not do so. Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, they discovered that Rochester was not on the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office&#x27;s list of cities. The council campaigned unsuccessfully to be one of 2012 Diamond Jubilee cities. The campaign&#x27;s &quot;City of Medway&quot; logo was used on a council tourism leaflet titled &quot;Historic Rochester and Maritime Chatham&quot; until the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a 2010 complaint that it misleadingly implied Medway had &quot;officially been granted city status&quot; because &quot;readers of the leaflet were likely to be aware of [the] official definition of a city&quot;.

=== Scotland ===
Scotland had no cities by royal charter or letters patent before 1889. The nearest equivalent in pre-Union Scotland was the royal burgh. The term &quot;city&quot; was not always consistently applied, and there were doubts over the number of officially designated cities. The royal burghs of Edinburgh and Perth anciently used the title &quot;civitas&quot;, but the term &quot;city&quot; does not seem to have been used before the 15th century. Unlike the situation in England, in Scotland there was no link between the presence of a cathedral and the title of &quot;city&quot;. Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh were accepted as cities by ancient usage by the 18th century, while Perth and Elgin also used the title. In 1856, the burgh of Dunfermline resolved to use the title of &quot;city&quot; in all official documents in the future, based on long usage and its former status as a royal capital. The status was not officially recognised until 2022.

In 1889, Dundee was granted city status by letters patent. The grant by formal document led to doubts about the use of the title &quot;city&quot; by other burghs. In 1891, the city status of Aberdeen was confirmed when the burgh was enlarged by local Act of Parliament. The Royal Burgh of Inverness applied for promotion to a city as part of the Jubilee honours in 1897. The request was not granted, partly because it would draw attention to the lack of any charter granting the title to existing cities. Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow were constituted &quot;counties of cities&quot; by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. The Act made no statement on the title &quot;city&quot; for any other burgh. In 1969, the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, stated that there were six cities in Scotland (without naming them) and Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Elgin, Glasgow and Perth were the only burghs listed as cities in 1972.

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 completely reorganised Scotland&#x27;s local administration in 1975. All burghs were abolished, and a system of districts created. The four districts of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow had &quot;City&quot; included in their titles by the Act. The 1975 districts were replaced with the present council areas in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, and the same four cities were designated. Since the 1996 reorganisation, four more Scottish cities have been designated: Inverness as part of the millennium celebrations, Stirling in 2002 to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, Perth in 2012 to mark the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee and Dunfermline in 2022 to mark the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. In the case of these four cities, there are no city councils and no formal boundaries. In January 2008, a petition to matriculate armorial bearings for the City of Inverness was refused by Lord Lyon King of Arms on the grounds that there is no corporate body or legal persona to whom arms can be granted.

===Ireland and Northern Ireland ===

City status in Ireland tended historically to be granted by royal charter. There are many towns in Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that have never been called cities. In spite of this, Armagh was considered a city, by virtue of its being the seat of the Primate of All Ireland, until the abolition of Armagh&#x27;s city corporation by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. The only historic city with a charter in present-day Northern Ireland is Derry. The garrison town of Derry was attacked and destroyed by Cahir O&#x27;Doherty in 1608. The present city status is the result of a Royal Charter granted in 1615 to The Honourable The Irish Society as part of the Plantation of Ulster, providing for the building of a walled city, which was named in recognition of the London Guilds that established the Society.

In 1887, the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria was celebrated, and the Borough of Belfast submitted a memorial to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seeking city status. Belfast based its claim on its similarity to two English boroughs that had received the honour—the seaport of Liverpool and the textile centre of Manchester—and the fact that it had (at the time) a larger population than the City of Dublin. Following some legal debate, city status was conferred in 1888. The grant of the honour on the grounds of being a large industrial town, rather than a diocesan centre, was unprecedented. Belfast&#x27;s example was soon followed by Birmingham in England and Dundee in Scotland.

In 1994, Armagh&#x27;s city status was restored. In 2002, Lisburn and Newry were two of the five towns in the UK that were granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II to mark her Golden Jubilee. In the case of Lisburn, the status extended to the entire local government district. Newry, like Inverness and Stirling in Scotland, has no formal boundaries or city council. The letters patent were presented to representatives of Newry and Mourne District Council on behalf of the city.

===Crown colonies and British Overseas Territories===

During the British Empire, the Colonial Office had the power to declare cities in Crown colonies by letters patent when appointing bishops. When the Bishop of Guyana was created in 1842, Georgetown (then part of British Guiana) was officially declared the &quot;City of Georgetown&quot;. The same process was followed for Gibraltar, Jamestown, St Helena, Bridgetown, Barbados, St. John&#x27;s, Antigua and Barbuda, Victoria, Hong Kong and Nassau, Bahamas. Most of these have since gained independence from the United Kingdom, but Gibraltar and St Helena remain British Overseas Territories. This practice ended in 1865, and led to legal disputes about whether these letters patent were valid or not in territories with responsible government (primarily those in present day Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa). Goulburn in Australia for example found itself declared a city twice – once by letters patent in 1863 and once by law in 1885 after doubts arose to its status.

Hamilton, Bermuda was named as a city in 1897 as part of the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Since the second Millennium, competitions have been arranged by the UK government to grant the status to settlements. In 2021 submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories being allowed to take part for the first time. The applicants were George Town (in the Cayman Islands), Gibraltar, Stanley (in the Falkland Islands), Douglas and Peel (both in the Isle of Man). It was later discovered that Gibraltar had been previously named a city, researchers at The National Archives confirming that Gibraltar&#x27;s city status was still in effect, with the territory missing from the official list of cities for the past 140 years. Stanley and Douglas were later granted the honour, and after confirmations this will take the overseas total to five cities.

== Current practice of granting city status ==
According to a Memorandum from the Home Office issued in 1927,

If a town wishes to obtain the title of a city the proper method of procedure is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.

A town can now apply for city status by submitting an application to the Lord Chancellor, who makes recommendations to the sovereign. Competitions for new grants of city status have been held to mark special events, such as coronations, royal jubilees or the Millennium.

=== Lord mayors ===
Some cities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have the further distinction of having a lord mayor rather than just a mayor – in Scotland, the equivalent is the lord provost. Lord mayors have the right to be styled &quot;The Right Worshipful The Lord Mayor&quot;. The lord mayors and provosts of Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, the City of London and York have the further right to be styled &quot;The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor&quot; (or Provost), although they are not members of the Privy Council as this style usually indicates. The style is associated with the office, not the person holding it.

There are currently 70 recognised cities (including 31 lord mayoralties or lord provostships) in the UK: 52 cities (23 lord mayoralties) in England, six cities (two lord mayoralties) in Wales, seven cities (four lord provostships) in Scotland and five cities (two lord mayoralties) in Northern Ireland.

In the Republic of Ireland, the ceremonial head of the city government of Dublin is the Lord Mayor of Dublin. This title was granted by Charles II in 1665 when Dublin was part of the Kingdom of Ireland. Whilst the 1665 letters patent provided for the Lord Mayor to hold the formal title of Right Honourable, this was repealed in 2001. There is also a Lord Mayor of Cork, a title granted in 1900 when Cork was part of the (then) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

In modern practice, competitions are held for cities that wish to gain the distinction of a lord mayor. The 2002 competition was entered by Bath, Cambridge, Carlisle, Chichester, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, St Albans, St Davids, Salford, Southampton, Sunderland, Truro, Wolverhampton and Worcester; the successful candidate was Exeter. In 2012 a further competition was held, as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, with Armagh receiving the distinction. Other than Armagh, eleven cities had entered the contest in 2012, namely: Cambridge, Derby, Gloucester, Lancaster, Newport, Peterborough, Salford, Southampton, St Albans, Sunderland, and Wakefield.

===Local government districts===
Since local government reorganisation in 1974 city status has been awarded to a number of local government districts which are not themselves towns. Each includes a number of towns and villages outside the urban area from which the district takes its name. In some of these cases city status was awarded to districts where the largest settlement had city status before 1974. In other cases a borough was formed to govern an area covering several towns and then city status was granted to the borough. The largest &quot;city&quot; district in terms of area was until 1 April 2023 the City of Carlisle, which covered some of mostly rural landscape in the north of England, and was larger than smaller counties such as Merseyside or Rutland. (The largest now is the City of Winchester at .) Such cities include:

* City of Bradford, including the towns of Bingley, Ilkley, Keighley and Shipley as well as Bradford
* City of Canterbury, including the towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable as well as Canterbury
* City of Lancaster, including the towns of Carnforth, Heysham and Morecambe as well as Lancaster and surrounding rural areas.
* City of Leeds, including the towns of Otley, Pudsey and Wetherby as well as Leeds
* City of Peterborough, including rural areas as well as Peterborough
* City of Preston, including rural areas as well as Preston
* City of St Albans, including the town of Harpenden as well as St Albans
* City of Salford, including the towns of Eccles, Pendlebury and Swinton as well as Salford
* City of Sunderland, including the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring and Washington as well as Sunderland
* City of Wakefield, including the towns of Castleford, Normanton, Ossett and Pontefract as well as Wakefield
* City of Winchester, including the towns of Bishop&#x27;s Waltham and New Alresford as well as Winchester

There are some cities where the local government district is in fact smaller than the historical or natural boundaries of the city. Examples include: Manchester, where the traditional area associated includes areas of the neighbouring authorities of Trafford, Tameside, Oldham, Bury and the City of Salford; Kingston upon Hull, where surrounding areas and villages that are effectively suburbs, such as Cottingham, come under East Riding of Yorkshire Council; Glasgow, where suburban areas of the city are located in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire.

=== City councils ===
The holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights other than that of calling itself a &quot;city&quot;. Nonetheless, this appellation carries its own prestige and, consequently, competitions for the status are hard-fought.

Historically, city status could only be granted to incorporated towns. The grant was specifically awarded to the relevant local government area such as a civil parish or borough. However, recent grants have used a looser wording, where the status is awarded to the &quot;town&quot;. In most cases the &quot;town&quot; is held to be coterminous with the relevant local government area, such that the city status holder is the corporate body of the council. Examples include the Letters Patent awarded to the &quot;Towns of Brighton and Hove&quot;, the &quot;Town of Wolverhampton&quot; and the &quot;Town of Newport in the County Borough of Newport&quot;. In each case the existing borough council became the city council.

Most cities have city councils, which have varying powers depending on the country and type of settlement.

==== England ====
Thirteen of the 55 cities in England are in metropolitan counties and their city councils are single-tier metropolitan district councils. Outside the metropolitan counties fourteen cities are unitary authorities, and fourteen have ordinary district councils, which are subordinate to their local county council. In London the Westminster City Council functions as a London borough council, and the City of London Corporation is the council for the City of London. Eight smaller episcopal cities such as Ripon and Wells are neither local government districts nor within a &#x27;local government district with city status&#x27;, and have city councils which are parish councils, with limited powers. Two cities (Bath and Chester) have no city council, while Durham has a &#x27;city&#x27; parish council; these, however, maintain the status through charter trustees on behalf of their prior district areas which held city status before being abolished in 1996 and 2009.

==== Scotland ====
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are themselves council areas and have their own city councils. The cities of Dunfermline, Perth, Stirling and Inverness are part of council areas which do not have city status, and have no city councils. Stirling Council&#x27;s application for city status was specifically for the urban area of the (now former) Royal Burgh of Stirling and included proposed city boundaries which are much smaller than Stirling council area.

==== Wales ====
Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea are principal areas and have city councils. Wrexham, being awarded the status in 2022, still maintains its county borough council as of April 2023. The city councils of Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids are community councils with limited powers.

==== Northern Ireland ====
Belfast City Council is a local government district council. Since the local government reforms of 2015 the four other cities of Armagh, Derry, Lisburn and Newry form parts of wider districts and do not have their own councils.

=== City status conferment ===
City status is conferred by letters patent and not by a royal charter (except historically in Ireland). There are twenty towns in England and Wales that were recognised as cities by &quot;ancient prescriptive right&quot;; none of these communities had been formally declared a city, but they had all used the title since &quot;time immemorial&quot; (legally defined as before 3 September 1189) and had been granted some form of privilege such as freedoms by way of a charter or being given borough or corporation status. These ancient cities as listed by the Home Office in 1927:
* Bangor (Wales)
* Bath
* Canterbury
* Carlisle
* Chichester
* Coventry
* Durham
* Ely
* Exeter
* Hereford
* Lichfield
* Lincoln
* City of London
* Norwich
* Rochester (status lost in 1998)
* Salisbury
* Wells
* Winchester
* Worcester
* York
These twenty cities were concurrent with 22 ancient diocese (pre-English Reformation) locations. Bath and Wells being one diocese, the remaining three are in Wales:

* Llandaff – had not been incorporated as a borough or granted privileges so was not deemed a city. It was merged into the existing city of Cardiff in 1922;
* St Asaph – was never considered to be a city due to a lack of honours or charters, however it was later awarded the status in 2012;
* St Davids – had been a borough, yet lost the status in 1886 (so did not appear in the above list). The title of city was restored in 1994.

The holding of city status brings no special benefits other than the right to be called a city. All cities where a local government unit that holds that status is abolished have to be re-issued with letters patent reconfirming city status following local government reorganisation where that holder has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of cities since 1974, and York and Hereford&#x27;s status was confirmed twice, in 1974 and again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as happened at Rochester in 1998 (&quot;see above&quot;), and also previously in St David&#x27;s and Armagh, although both of these latter have regained city status since losing it. These three had been cities since time immemorial before the loss of city status.

== Officially designated cities ==

There are currently 76 officially designated cities in the UK, of which 17 have been created since 2000 in competitions to celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002, Diamond Jubilee in 2012, and Platinum Jubilee in 2022. The designation is highly sought after, with over 40 communities submitting bids at recent competitions.

City status has been applied to a variety of entities including towns, local government districts and civil parishes.

==Smallest and largest cities==
While cities are regularly ranked by the number of residents, this is not an ideal measure. Population can vary based on the number and type of residences present, and has to be limited to an area. The official area of a city in the UK is typically the coverage up to a local government/council boundary, there being a variety of council bodies. However, there are exceptions depending on the UK constituent country and whether the council has since been abolished.

Such a boundary can typically contain a built up (urban) area, and a surrounding, less populated rural landscape. Or the area of a city can be entirely built up, with that urban environment spilling over a boundary into another area which does not have city status. That wider urban area can still be considered in everyday parlance locally as a whole &#x27;city&#x27; although it is not a formal designation.

With the &#x27;square mile&#x27; City of London being in the middle of a huge urban area, it can be suggested that &#x27;small&#x27; should be applied to only cities with minimal urban areas that have nearby surrounding areas of countryside and so is visibly representative of the term, the city of Wells being more suitable in this regard as the smallest standalone city council area. Therefore, sizing can be interpreted in a number of ways, and below are top 5 lists of the smallest and largest cities ranked by population, city council area, and urban area.

All statistics are 2021 census figures.
Population is of the total residents in the city council area. Armagh (no local council) and the Largest Urban Area table both use urban population figures.

=== Smallest ===
=== Largest ===

==Towns not cities==
===Populous towns===

&#x27;City&#x27; can refer to any large settlement, with no fixed limit but there are British towns with large urban areas that could qualify for city status on the grounds of population size. Some have applied for city status and had the application turned down. The report &quot;Key Statistics for Built-Up Areas 2011&quot; published by the Office for National Statistics showed that, at the 2011 Census, the following were the largest urban areas in the United Kingdom not having a city as a component:
The largest local authorities to have been unsuccessful in applying for city status in recent competitions are:
* London Borough of Croydon – 390,719
* Metropolitan Borough of Dudley – 312,925
* Metropolitan Borough of Wirral – 312,293
* Metropolitan Borough of Stockport – 284,528
* Metropolitan Borough of Bolton – 261,037
* Borough of Medway – 249,488
* London Borough of Southwark – 244,866
* London Borough of Tower Hamlets – 220,500
* London Borough of Greenwich – 214,403 (became a Royal Borough on 3 February 2012)
* Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead – 200,300
* Borough of Northampton – 194,458 (borough abolished in 2021 and now part of West Northamptonshire, It was one of the most populous districts not to be a London borough, metropolitan borough, unitary authority or city; on this basis, the former borough council claimed that it is the largest town in England. The town remains the most populous civil parish in the UK.)
* Borough of Warrington – 191,084
* Borough of Luton – 184,371
* Borough of Bournemouth – 183,491 (Borough abolished and now forms part of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole)
* Borough of Swindon – 180,051
* Borough of Telford and Wrekin – 161,600
* Borough of Reading – 155,300
* Borough of Blackpool – 142,100
* Borough of Middlesbrough – 138,400
=== Cathedral towns ===
A &quot;cathedral city&quot; is a place designated as a city which has a cathedral.

==== England and Wales ====
Since being the seat of an Anglican diocese is no longer sufficient or necessary to gain city status, some cathedral towns exist:

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; referred to Southwell as a city, A photograph of the Football XI sitting on the steps of Norwood Park (home since 1888 of the Starkey Bramley) in 1954 is titled Southwell City F.C. and in 1949 Bury St Edmunds was referred to as a city.

There are 16 English and Welsh cities that have never had Anglican cathedrals within their borders – Brighton and Hove, Cambridge, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Plymouth, Preston, Salford, Southampton, Southend-on-Sea, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Swansea, and Wolverhampton.

Bath Abbey was once a diocesan cathedral, as was Westminster Abbey briefly during the reign of Henry VIII. These cities retained their city status despite their cathedrals losing that status.

==== Scotland ====
The national church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, is presbyterian in governance (not recognising authority of bishops), and thus has high kirks rather than cathedrals. However, the pre-Reformation dioceses do have extant cathedrals, most notably at Glasgow and Aberdeen, which remain in use by the Church of Scotland and continue to bear the honorific title of cathedral. Others (such as that of St Andrews) are now in ruins.

Both Perth and Elgin were recognised as cities before 1975; Perth&#x27;s city status was restored in 2012. Additionally, five other pre-Reformation sees—Brechin, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Kirkwall and St Andrews—are often referred to as cities, notably in names associated with the settlements (e.g. &#x27;City of Brechin and District&#x27; community council. and Brechin City F.C., City Road in St Andrews). Dornoch, Fortrose, Lismore, Saddell and Whithorn also possess pre-Reformation cathedrals but have never been described as cities.

Towns with non-Church of Scotland, post-Reformation cathedrals which are not recognised as cities are Ayr (R.C.), Millport (Episcopal), Oban (R.C.), Motherwell (R.C.) and Paisley (R.C.). Of these, Ayr, Motherwell and Paisley have larger populations than Perth, Stirling and Inverness, and both Ayr and Paisley have formally made a bid for city status during the millennium competition.

Of settlements granted city status in the 21st century, Inverness (awarded 2001) possesses an Episcopal cathedral (1866), but none under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. Stirling (awarded 2002) has never had a cathedral of any kind. Perth (reinstated 2012) has an Episcopal cathedral dating from 1860, but no pre-Reformation establishment.

==== Northern Ireland ====

In Northern Ireland, possession of a diocesan cathedral has never (except in the anomalous case of Armagh) been sufficient to attain this status. The Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871, The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; did refer to Armagh (which lost city status in 1840) and Lisburn as cities. Armagh subsequently regained city status formally in 1994, and Lisburn achieved city status in 2002.

There are four towns in Northern Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals that do not have city status—Clogher, Downpatrick, Dromore and Enniskillen.

Newry is the only city in Northern Ireland that does not have a Church of Ireland cathedral within its borders.

=== Claimants ===
A number of towns describe themselves as cities in some contexts, despite not having the requisite charter.
* Ballymena in Northern Ireland has been known informally as &quot;The City of the Seven Towers&quot; since the nineteenth century.
* The community council for Brechin is called City of Brechin &amp; District Community Council. The local football team is known as Brechin City F.C. (they were formed at a meeting on &quot;City Road&quot; in the town). Brechin also possesses a cathedral, and was the ancient seat of the see of Brechin.
* Dunkeld, the see of a bishop until the seventeenth century is sometimes referred to as a city. A &quot;City Hall&quot; was built in 1877, since converted into a holiday accommodation.
* The community council for Elgin is called City and Royal Burgh of Elgin Community Council. The local football team is known as Elgin City F.C.
* Guildford possesses a cathedral and the local football team is named Guildford City F.C. In 2013 the local council did not submit an application, citing low chance of success, and high time and resource against low benefits ratio.
* Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City are medium-sized New Towns in Hertfordshire established to reduce the overcrowding of London as part of the Garden city movement.
* After its unsuccessful attempts to gain city status, the town of Reading, Berkshire, started using the phrase &quot;City Centre&quot; on its buses and car-park signs. Reading&#x27;s urban area has in excess of 350,000 inhabitants, making it one of the largest urban areas in the UK and larger than many sizeable cities including Southampton, Kingston upon Hull and Derby. However, the population of the Borough of Reading was estimated as 142,800 in 2006 by the Office for National Statistics, as a number of the town&#x27;s large eastern and southern suburbs (such as Earley and Woodley) lie within neighbouring local authorities.

<text>Idi Amin Dada Oumee (, ; 30 May 192816 August 2003) was a Ugandan military officer and politician who served as the third president of Uganda from 1971 until his overthrow in 1979. He ruled as a military dictator and is considered one of the most brutal despots in modern world history.

Amin was born to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946, he joined the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army as a cook. He rose to the rank of lieutenant, taking part in British actions against Somali rebels and then the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, and Amin remained in the army, rising to the position of deputy army commander in 1964 and being appointed commander two years later. He became aware that Ugandan president Milton Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, so he launched the 1971 Ugandan coup d&#x27;état and declared himself president.

During his years in power, Amin shifted from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable support from Israel to being backed by Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi, Zaire&#x27;s Mobutu Sese Seko, the Soviet Union, and East Germany. In 1972, Amin expelled Asians, a majority of whom were Indian-Ugandans, leading India to sever diplomatic relations with his regime. In 1975, Amin assumed chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), an intergovernmental organization designed to promote solidarity among African states (an annually rotating role). Uganda was a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1977 to 1979. The United Kingdom broke diplomatic relations with Uganda in 1977, and Amin declared that he had defeated the British and added &quot;CBE&quot; to his title for &quot;Conqueror of the British Empire&quot;.

As Amin&#x27;s rule progressed into the late 1970s, there was increased unrest against his persecution of certain ethnic groups and political dissidents, along with Uganda&#x27;s very poor international standing due to Amin&#x27;s support for PFLP-EO and RZ hijackers in 1976, leading to Israel&#x27;s Operation Entebbe. He then attempted to annex Tanzania&#x27;s Kagera Region in 1978. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere ordered his troops to invade Uganda in response. Tanzanian Army and rebel forces successfully captured Kampala in 1979 and ousted Amin from power. Amin went into exile, first in Libya, then Iraq, and finally in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death in 2003.

Amin&#x27;s rule was characterized by rampant human rights abuses, including political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, as well as nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. International observers and human rights groups estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were killed under his regime.

== Early life ==

Virtually all retellings of Amin&#x27;s early life are contradictory, as he did not write an autobiography and never authorized a written account of his life. British governmental records put Amin&#x27;s birth year in 1925; however, no records were kept for native Ugandans at the time. In a 1972 interview with Judith Hare, Amin gives his birthplace as the village of Koboko and his age as forty-six, which would put his birth year in 1926. In a book published in 1977 by Little, Brown and written by a British advisor in Uganda using the pseudonym David Gwyn, Amin was born in Buganda with his age given as forty-eight, placing his birth year in 1928. The most comprehensive biography of Amin comes from his family based on oral tradition, which has some authority but its details ultimately cannot be confirmed. Family tradition and Saudi authorities in Jeddah puts his birth date as 10 Dhu al-Hijja 1346 in the Islamic calendar.

=== Early childhood and family ===

According to Amin&#x27;s family, Ugandan oral tradition, and his Saudi death certificate, Idi Amin Dada Oumee was born on 30 May 1928 at ≈ 4:00 AM in his father&#x27;s workplace, the Shimoni Police Barracks in Nakasero Hill, Kampala. He was given the name Idi after his birth on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. According to Fred Guweddeko, a researcher at Makerere University, Amin&#x27;s birth name was Idi Awo-Ango Angoo. There is disagreement on the meaning of the name &quot;Dada&quot;, with some arguing that it meant &quot;sister&quot; or &quot;effeminate&quot; in Kiswahili, but most sources agree that &quot;Dada&quot; was a clan within the Kakwa tribe which was observed over thirteen generations.

He was the third son of Amin Dada Nyabira Tomuresu (1889–1976), an ethnic Kakwa, and his second wife, Aisha Chumaru Aate (1904–1970), a Lugbara. His father was christened as a Roman Catholic and born with the name Andreas Nyabira Tomuresu. According to British journalist David Martin, Nyabira spent most of his life in South Sudan. He converted to Islam in 1910 after being conscripted as a bugler by the colonial British army under his uncle, the Kakwa tribal leader Sultan Ali Kenyi Dada as a six-year-old child soldier and was given the name Amin Dada. He joined the Protectorate Police Force in Kampala&#x27;s Nsambia Police Barracks in 1913.

Nyabira was forcibly conscripted into the British King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) in 1914 where he fought in the First World War during the East African campaign in Tanganyika before being honorably discharged in 1921 and given a plot of land in Arua District. The same year, he joined the Protectorate Police Force in the Nsambia Police Barracks prior to being transferred to the Shimoni Police Barracks in 1928, where Amin was born according to his family. He was transferred to the Kololo Police Barracks and retired from the police force in 1931 and worked at the Office of the Resident District Commissioner in Arua District.

His mother, Aisha Aate, was born to a Kakwa mother and Lugbara father. By all accounts, Aate was a traditional healer, herbalist, and a midwife. Ten years before Amin&#x27;s birth, Aate joined the Allah Water (also known as Yakani) movement, which was an anti-colonial alternative medicine congregation centered on a &quot;water of Yakan&quot; that was infused with a psychedelic daffodil plant locally known as Kamiojo, described as the &quot;LSD of Central Africa&quot;. The movement was repressed by British colonial authorities, who had judged it as rebellion. Despite being largely described as a cult, Amin&#x27;s family claims that Aate was a priestess in the &quot;Yakanye Order&quot; which they explained as a &quot;secret African society&quot;, of which Idi Amin was also a member, that used &quot;sacred water and other mystical powers&quot; for warfare.

According to Amin&#x27;s family, Aate had cured Irene Drusilla Namaganda, then Queen of Buganda and wife of Daudi Cwa II of Buganda, of her infertility. Aate&#x27;s high-ranking role in the Allah Water movement allegedly gained the interest of the Bugandan royal family and her alleged connection to the family led to rumours of Amin&#x27;s biological father being Daudi Chwa II. These rumours were reportedly spread by Nyabira&#x27;s childless senior wife, who was spiteful of Aate bearing two children.

According to Amin&#x27;s family, Idi Amin was given the title Awon&#x27;go (), in reference to rumours about his alleged paternity. Idi was reportedly chosen to take a &#x27;paternity test&#x27; as an infant by tribal elders, which involved abandoning him for four days in a forest near Mount Liru in Koboko where they returned to find Amin still alive. The elders attributed this apparent miracle to Nakan, a sacred seven-headed snake in Kakwa folk religion. His brother and sister died in 1932, when Idi was four years old.

Amin&#x27;s parents divorced when he was four, and most accounts suggest that he moved in with his mother&#x27;s family in 1944 in the rural farming town of Mawale Parish, Luweero District, in north-western Uganda. The divorce of his parents was reportedly due to the lasting rumours regarding Idi&#x27;s paternity, which angered his mother. Despite this, his family insists that he moved with his father per Muslim tradition in Tanganyika Parish, Arua District, while his mother continued to practice healing in Buganda.

=== Boyhood and education ===
While living with his mother&#x27;s relatives, Amin reportedly worked as a goat farmer from ages eight to ten. In 1938, he moved to the home of Sheikh Ahmed Hussein in the nearby town of Semuto and began memorizing the Quran through recitation until he was twelve. In 1940, Amin moved to Bombo and lived with his maternal uncle, Yusuf Tanaboo. He attempted to register for primary school but was rejected, this was reportedly due to Amin&#x27;s paternal Nubian heritage.

The same year, Amin was injured while participating in Nubian riots against discrimination at Makerere University in Wandegeya. He was enrolled in the Garaya madrasa in Bombo and continued memorizing the Quran under Mohammed Al Rajab until 1944, and reportedly won honours in recitation in 1943. Amin was conscripted by the colonial army alongside fifteen other students before being discharged for being underage.

In 1945, he moved to the Kiyindi Parish in Bwaise Parish and worked different odd jobs, this included work as a doorman and concierge assistant at the Grand Imperial Hotel in Kampala.

== King&#x27;s African Rifles ==

Amin joined the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) in 1946 as an assistant cook, while at the same time receiving military training until 1947. In later life he falsely claimed to have served in the Burma Campaign of World War II. He was transferred to Kenya for infantry service as a private in 1947, and served in the 21st KAR infantry battalion in Gilgil, Kenya Colony until 1949. That year, his unit was deployed to northern Kenya to fight against Somali rebels. In 1952, his brigade was deployed against the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. He was promoted to corporal the same year, then to sergeant in 1953.

In 1959, Amin was made Effendi Class 2 (Warrant Officer), the highest possible rank for a black soldier in the KAR. Amin returned to Uganda the same year and received a short-service commission as a lieutenant on 15 July 1961, becoming one of the first two Ugandans to become commissioned officers. He was assigned to quell the cattle rustling between Uganda&#x27;s Karamojong and Kenya&#x27;s Turkana nomads. According to researcher Holger Bernt Hansen, Amin&#x27;s outlook, behavior and strategies of communication were strongly influenced by his experiences in the colonial military. This included his direct and hands-on leadership style which would eventually contribute to his popularity among certain parts of Ugandan society.

== Rise in the Uganda Army ==

In 1962, following Uganda&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom, Amin was promoted to captain and then, in 1963, to major. He was appointed Deputy Commander of the Army in 1964 and, the following year, to Commander of the Army. In 1970, he was promoted to commander of all the armed forces.

Amin was an athlete during his time in both the British and Uganda Army. At tall and powerfully built, he was the Ugandan light heavyweight boxing champion from 1951 to 1960, as well as a swimmer. Amin was also a formidable rugby forward, although one officer said of him: &quot;Idi Amin is a splendid type and a good (rugby) player, but virtually bone from the neck up, and needs things explained in words of one letter&quot;. In the 1950s, he played for Nile RFC.

There is a frequently repeated urban myth that he was selected as a replacement by the East Africa rugby union team for their 1955 tour match against the British Lions. Amin, however, does not appear in the team photograph or on the official team list.

In 1965, Prime Minister Milton Obote and Amin were implicated in a deal to smuggle ivory and gold into Uganda from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The deal, as later alleged by General Nicholas Olenga, an associate of the former Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, was part of an arrangement to help troops opposed to the Congolese government trade ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. In 1966, the Ugandan Parliament demanded an investigation. Obote imposed a new constitution abolishing the ceremonial presidency held by Kabaka (King) Mutesa II of Buganda and declared himself executive president. He promoted Amin to colonel and army commander. Amin led an attack on the Kabaka&#x27;s palace and forced Mutesa into exile to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death in 1969.

Amin began recruiting members of Kakwa, Lugbara, South Sudanese, and other ethnic groups from the West Nile area bordering South Sudan. The South Sudanese had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from South Sudan to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and South Sudan; allegations persist that Amin&#x27;s army consisted mainly of South Sudanese soldiers.

== Seizure of power ==

Eventually a rift developed between Amin and Obote, exacerbated by the support Amin had built within the Uganda Army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote&#x27;s life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote took control of the armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of the commander of the Uganda Army.

Having learned that Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup with the assistance of Israeli government agents on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending that year&#x27;s Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote&#x27;s residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote&#x27;s government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported in the streets of Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin, who presented himself a soldier, not a politician, declared that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be held when the situation was normalized. He promised to release all political prisoners.

Amin held a state funeral in April 1971 for Edward Mutesa, former king (&quot;kabaka&quot;) of Buganda and president, who had died in exile.

== Presidency ==
=== Establishment of military rule ===

On 2 February 1971, one week after the coup, Amin declared himself President of Uganda, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Uganda Army Chief of Staff, and Chief of Air Staff. He suspended certain provisions of the Ugandan constitution, and soon instituted an Advisory Defense Council composed of military officers with himself as the chairman. Amin placed military tribunals above the system of civil law, appointed soldiers to top posts in government and government-owned corporations, and informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military courtesy. Amin ruled by decree; over the course of his rule he issued approximately 30 decrees.

Amin renamed the presidential lodge in Kampala from Government House to &quot;The Command Post&quot;. He disbanded the General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, and replaced it with the State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at the Kampala suburb of Nakasero became the scene of torture and capital punishment over the next few years. Other agencies used to persecute dissenters included the military police and the Public Safety Unit (PSU).

Obote took refuge in Tanzania, having been offered sanctuary there by the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. Obote was soon joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees fleeing Amin. The exiles attempted but failed to regain Uganda in 1972, through a poorly organised coup attempt.

=== Persecution of ethnic and political groups ===
Amin retaliated against the attempted invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972 by purging the Uganda Army of Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers had been massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and at least twice as many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.

The killings, motivated by ethnic, political, and financial factors, continued throughout Amin&#x27;s eight years in control. The exact number of people killed is unknown. The International Commission of Jurists estimated the death toll at no fewer than 80,000 and more likely around 300,000. An estimate compiled by exile organizations with the help of Amnesty International puts the number killed at 500,000.

In his 1997 book &quot;State of Blood: The Inside Story of Idi Amin&quot;, Henry Kyemba (who was a Ugandan minister for three years in Amin&#x27;s cabinet) states that &quot;Amin&#x27;s bizarre behavior derives partly from his tribal background. Like many other warrior societies, the Kakwa, Amin&#x27;s tribe, are known to have practiced blood rituals on slain enemies. These involve cutting a piece of flesh from the body to subdue the dead man&#x27;s spirit or tasting the victim&#x27;s blood to render the spirit harmless. Such rituals still exist among the Kakwa. Amin&#x27;s practices do not stop at tasting blood: on several occasions he has boasted to me and others that he has eaten human flesh.&quot; (Kyemba 109–10)

Among the most prominent people killed were Benedicto Kiwanuka, a former prime minister and chief justice; Janani Luwum, the Anglican archbishop; Joseph Mubiru, the former governor of the central bank of Uganda; Frank Kalimuzo, the vice-chancellor of Makerere University; Byron Kawadwa, a prominent playwright; and two of Amin&#x27;s own cabinet ministers, Erinayo Wilson Oryema and Charles Oboth Ofumbi.

Amin recruited his followers from his own ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese, and Nubians. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 per cent of the 22 top generals and 75 per cent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 per cent and 87.5 per cent of these groups even though they were only 5 per cent of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups. The Uganda Army grew from 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin&#x27;s military was largely a mercenary force. Half the soldiers were South Sudanese and 26 per cent Congolese, with only 24 per cent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.

In August 1972, Amin declared what he called an &quot;economic war&quot;, a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda&#x27;s 80,000 Asians were mostly from the Indian subcontinent and born in the country, their ancestors having come to Uganda in search of prosperity when India was still a British colony. Many owned businesses, including large-scale enterprises, which formed the backbone of the Ugandan economy.

On 4 August 1972, Amin issued a decree ordering the expulsion of the 50,000 Asians who were British passport holders. This was later amended to include all 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians emigrated to the UK. Others went to Commonwealth countries such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Fiji, or to India, Kenya, Pakistan, Sweden, Tanzania, and the United States. Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and the Europeans and handed them over to his supporters. Without the experienced owners and proprietors, businesses were mismanaged and many industries collapsed from lack of operational expertise and maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining Ugandan economy. At the time, Asians accounted for 90% of the country&#x27;s tax revenue; with their removal, Amin&#x27;s administration lost a large chunk of government revenue. The economy all but collapsed.

Idi Amin murdered an estimated 500 Yemeni Hadrami Arab merchants.

In 1975, Emmanuel Blayo Wakhweya, Amin&#x27;s finance minister and longest-serving cabinet member at the time, defected to London. This prominent defection helped Henry Kyemba, Amin&#x27;s health minister and a former official of the first Obote regime, to defect in 1977 and resettle in the UK. Kyemba wrote and published &quot;A State of Blood&quot;, the first insider exposé of Amin&#x27;s rule.

On 25 June 1976, the Defense Council declared Amin president for life.

=== International relations ===


Initially, Amin was supported by Western powers such as Israel, West Germany, and, in particular, the United Kingdom. During the late 1960s, Obote&#x27;s move to the left, which included his Common Man&#x27;s Charter and the nationalisation of 80 British companies, had made the West worried that he would pose a threat to Western capitalist interests in Africa and make Uganda an ally of the Soviet Union. Amin, who had served with the King&#x27;s African Rifles and taken part in Britain&#x27;s suppression of the Mau Mau uprising prior to Ugandan independence, was known by the British as &quot;intensely loyal to Britain&quot;. This made him an obvious choice as Obote&#x27;s successor. Although some have claimed that Amin was being groomed for power as early as 1966, the plotting by the British and other Western powers began in earnest in 1969, after Obote had begun his nationalization programme.

Throughout the first year of his presidency, Amin received key military and financial support from the United Kingdom and Israel. In July 1971 he visited both countries and asked for advanced military equipment, but the states refused to provide hardware unless the Ugandan government paid for it. Amin decided to seek foreign support elsewhere and in February 1972 he visited Libya. Amin denounced Zionism, and in return Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi pledged Uganda an immediate $25 million loan to be followed by more lending from the Libyan–Ugandan Development Bank. Over the following months Amin successively removed Israeli military advisers from his government, expelled all other Israeli technicians, and finally broke diplomatic relations. Gaddafi also mediated a resolution to long-standing Ugandan–Sudanese tensions, with Amin agreeing to stop backing Anyanya rebels in southern Sudan and instead recruit the former guerilla fighters into his army.

Following the expulsion of Ugandan Asians in 1972, most of whom were of Indian descent, India severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The same year, as part of his &quot;economic war&quot;, Amin broke diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom and nationalized all British-owned businesses. The United Kingdom and Israel ceased all trade with Uganda, but this commercial gap was quickly filled by Libya, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev grew increasingly interested in Uganda as a strategic counterbalance to perceived Chinese influence in Tanzania and Western influence in Kenya. It dispatched a military mission to Uganda in November 1973. While it could not supply the financial level available from the Western powers, the Soviet Union opted to provide Amin with military hardware in exchange for his support. The Soviet Union quickly became Amin&#x27;s largest arms supplier, sending Uganda tanks, jets, artillery, missiles, and small arms. By 1975, it was estimated that the Soviets had provided Amin&#x27;s government with $12 million in economic assistance and $48 million in arms. Amin also sent several thousand Ugandans to Eastern Bloc countries for military, intelligence, and technical training, especially Czechoslovakia. East Germany was involved in the General Service Unit and the State Research Bureau, the two agencies that were most notorious for terror. During the Ugandan invasion of Tanzania in 1979, East Germany attempted to remove evidence of its involvement with these agencies.

In December 1973, Amin launched a sarcastic &#x27;Save Britain Fund&#x27; during the 1973–1975 recession to &quot;save and assist our former colonial masters from economic catastrophe&quot;, while offering emergency food supplies and urging Ugandans to donate. In 1974, he offered to host and mediate negotiations to end the conflict in Northern Ireland, believing that Uganda&#x27;s position as a former British colony made it apt to do so.

In June 1976, Amin allowed an Air France airliner from Tel Aviv to Paris hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German Revolutionäre Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos flew in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; 7 hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 1 Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu (the commander of the unit), were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda&#x27;s international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda. In retaliation for Kenya&#x27;s assistance in the raid, Amin also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda.

Uganda under Amin embarked on a large military build-up, which raised concerns in Kenya. Early in June 1975, Kenyan officials impounded a large convoy of Soviet-made arms &quot;en route&quot; to Uganda at the port of Mombasa. Tension between Uganda and Kenya reached its climax in February 1976, when Amin announced that he would investigate the possibility that parts of southern Sudan and western and central Kenya, up to within of Nairobi, were historically a part of colonial Uganda. The Kenyan Government responded with a stern statement that Kenya would not part with &quot;a single inch of territory&quot;. Amin backed down after the Kenyan army deployed troops and armoured personnel carriers along the Kenya–Uganda border. Amin&#x27;s relations with Rwanda were tense, and during his tenure he repeatedly jeopardized its economy by denying its commercial vehicles transit to Mombasa and made multiple threats to bomb Kigali.

=== War with Tanzania and deposition ===
In January 1977 Amin appointed General Mustafa Adrisi Vice President of Uganda. That year, a split in the Uganda Army developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to Adrisi, who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners, particularly Sudanese, from the military. The growing dissatisfaction in the Uganda Army was reflected by frequent coup attempts; Amin was even wounded during one of them, namely Operation Mafuta Mingi in June 1977. By 1978, the number of Amin&#x27;s supporters and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed as a result of the years of neglect and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin&#x27;s ministers defected or fled into exile. In early 1978, Adrisi was severely injured in a car accident and flown to Cairo for treatment. While he was there, Amin stripped him of his positions as Minister of Defense and Minister of Home Affairs and denounced him for retiring senior prison officials without his knowledge. Amin then proceeded to purge several high-ranking officials from his government and took personal control of several ministerial portfolios. The shakeup caused political unrest and especially angered Adrisi&#x27;s followers, who believed that the car accident was a failed assassination attempt.

In November 1978, troops loyal to Adrisi mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Fighting consequently broke out along that border, and the Uganda Army invaded Tanzanian territory under unclear circumstances. According to several experts and politicians, Amin directly ordered the invasion in an attempt to distract the Ugandan military and public from the crisis at home. Other accounts suggest, however, that Amin had lost control of parts of the Uganda Army, so Amin&#x27;s sanction for the invasion was a &quot;post-facto&quot; action to save face regarding troops who had acted without his orders. In any case, Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of initiating the war against Uganda after the hostilities had erupted, and proclaimed the annexation of a section of Kagera when the Ugandan invasion initially proved to be successful. However, as Tanzania began to prepare a counter-offensive, Amin reportedly realized his precarious situation, and attempted to defuse the conflict without losing face. The Ugandan President publicly suggested that he and Nyerere participate in a boxing match which, in lieu of military action, would determine the outcome of the conflict. Nyerere ignored the message.

In January 1979, Nyerere mobilized the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force and counterattacked, joined by several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin&#x27;s army retreated steadily, despite military help from Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The President reportedly made several trips abroad to other countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the war, attempting to enlist more foreign support. He made few public appearances in the final months of his rule, but spoke frequently on radio and television. Following a major defeat in the Battle of Lukaya, parts of the Uganda Army command reportedly urged Amin to step down. He angrily refused and declared: &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to fight, I&#x27;ll do it myself.&quot; He consequently fired chief of staff Yusuf Gowon. However, Amin was forced to flee the Ugandan capital by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. After a short-lived attempt to rally some remnants of the Uganda Army in eastern Uganda which reportedly included Amin proclaiming the city of Jinja his country&#x27;s new capital, he fled into exile. By the time of his removal from power, Amin had become deeply unpopular in Uganda. The symbols of his rule, his pictures, and buildings associated with him were subject to vandalism during and after the war.

== Exile ==
Amin first escaped to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for staying out of politics. Amin lived for a number of years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania War for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin on 4 June 1980, and secured the first interview with him since his deposition. While in exile, Amin funded remnants of his army that fought in the Ugandan Bush War. Though he continued to be a controversial figure, some of Amin&#x27;s former followers as well as several rebel groups continued to fight in his name for decades and occasionally advocated for his amnesty and even his restoration to the Ugandan Presidency. During interviews he gave during his exile in Saudi Arabia, Amin held that Uganda needed him and never expressed remorse for the brutal nature of his regime.

In January 1989, Amin left his exile without authorization by the Saudi Arabian government and flew alongside one of his sons to Zaire. There, he intended to mobilize a rebel force to reconquer Uganda which was engulfed in another civil war at the time. The rest of his family stayed in Jeddah. Despite using a false Zairean passport, Amin was easily recognized upon arriving with Air Zaïre at N&#x27;djili Airport and promptly arrested by Zairean security forces. The Zairean government reacted unfavorably to Amin&#x27;s arrival and attempted to expel him from the country. At first, Saudi Arabia refused to allow him to return, as its government was deeply offended that he had &quot;abused their hospitality&quot; by leaving without permission, and doing so for political reasons. The Zairean government wanted neither to extradite Amin to Uganda where the ex-president faced murder charges nor keep him in Zaire, thereby straining international relations. As a result, Amin was initially expelled to Senegal from where he was supposed to be sent to Saudi Arabia, but the Senegalese government sent him back to Zaire when Saudi Arabia continued to refuse Amin a visa. Following appeals by Moroccan King Hassan II, the Saudi Arabian government finally relented and allowed Amin to return. In return, Amin had to promise to never again participate in any political or military activities, nor give interviews. He consequently spent the remainder of his life in Saudi Arabia.

In the final years of his life, Amin reportedly ate a fruitarian diet. His daily consumption of oranges earned him the nickname &quot;Dr Jaffa&quot; among Saudi Arabians.

== Illness and death ==

On 19 July 2003, Amin&#x27;s fourth wife, Nalongo Madina, reported that he was in a coma and near death at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from kidney failure. She pleaded with the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, to allow him to return to Uganda for the remainder of his life. Museveni replied that Amin would have to &quot;answer for his sins the moment he was brought back&quot;. Amin&#x27;s family eventually decided to disconnect life support and Amin consequently died at the hospital in Jeddah on 16 August 2003. He was buried in Ruwais Cemetery in Jeddah in a simple grave, without any fanfare.

After Amin&#x27;s death, David Owen revealed that during his term as the British Foreign Secretary (1977 to 1979), he had proposed having Amin assassinated. He has defended this, arguing: &quot;I&#x27;m not ashamed of considering it, because his regime goes down in the scale of Pol Pot as one of the worst of all African regimes&quot;.

== Family and associates ==

Idi Amin married at least six women, three of whom he divorced. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966. In 1967, he married Nora, and then married Nalongo Madina in 1972. On 26 March 1974, he announced on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Kay and Nora. Malyamu was arrested in Tororo on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya. In 1974, Kay Amin died under mysterious circumstances, with her body found dismembered. Nora fled to Zaire in 1979; her current whereabouts are unknown.

In July 1975, Amin staged a £2 million wedding to 19-year-old Sarah Kyolaba, a go-go dancer with the &quot;Revolutionary Suicide Mechanised Regiment Band&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Suicide Sarah&quot;. The wedding was held during the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit meeting in Kampala, and the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat, served as Amin&#x27;s best man. Before she met Amin, Sarah was living with a boyfriend, Jesse Gitta; he vanished and it is not clear if he was beheaded, or detained after fleeing to Kenya. The couple had four children and enjoyed rally race driving Amin&#x27;s Citroën SM, with Sarah as navigator. Sarah was a hairdresser in Tottenham when she died in 2015.
By 1993, Amin was living with the last nine of his children and one wife, Mama a Chumaru, the mother of the youngest four of his children. His last known child, daughter Iman, was born in 1992. According to the &quot;Daily Monitor&quot;, Amin married again a few months before his death in 2003.

Amin fathered as many as 60 children. Until 2003, Taban Amin (born 1955), Amin&#x27;s eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the Internal Security Organisation. Another of Amin&#x27;s sons, Haji Ali Amin, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected.

Sarah Kyolaba&#x27;s third child, Faisal Wangita (born in 1983 in Uganda; according to himself born in 1981 in Saudi Arabia) was involved in a brutal gang murder in Camden, North London, in 2006. In connection with this, he was sentenced to five years&#x27; detention in 2007, for conspiracy to wound, conspiracy to possess offensive weapons and violent disorder. He had been convicted for possession of offensive weapons, theft and fraud in the years before.

In early 2007, the award-winning film &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot; prompted one of his sons, Jaffar Amin (born in 1967), to speak out in his father&#x27;s defence. Jaffar Amin said he was writing a book to rehabilitate his father&#x27;s reputation. Jaffar is the tenth of Amin&#x27;s 40 official children by seven official wives.

Among Amin&#x27;s closest associates was the Briton Bob Astles. Isaac Maliyamungu was an instrumental affiliate and one of the more feared officers in Amin&#x27;s army.

== Character ==

=== Nicknames ===

Over the course of his career, Amin gained numerous nicknames, many of them derogatory:

* &quot;Big Daddy&quot;: affectionate nickname
* &quot;kijambiya&quot; (&quot;the machete&quot;): attributed to Ugandan security forces often murdering their victims with machetes
* &quot;Butcher of Uganda&quot;
* &quot;Butcher of Africa&quot;
* &quot;Butcher of Kampala&quot;
* &quot;Black Hitler&quot;
* &quot;Dada&quot;: It is disputed whether this was part of Amin&#x27;s family name or a nickname. Some observers have claimed that it originated as a nickname for Amin&#x27;s &quot;cowardly&quot; behavior, as it can be translated as &quot;sister&quot;, though this has been strongly disputed by others. Amin&#x27;s family has stated that &quot;Dada&quot; was simply an alternative name for the Lugbara people which is occasionally used as a personal name. Researcher Mark Leopold judged this to be more likely than the nickname theory.
* &quot;Dr. Jaffa&quot;: he earned this nickname in exile in Saudi Arabia due to his daily consumption of oranges, especially after allegedly transitioning to fruitarianism.

=== Erratic behavior, self-bestowed titles and media portrayal ===
As the years progressed, Amin&#x27;s behavior became more erratic, unpredictable, and strident. After the United Kingdom broke off all diplomatic relations with his regime in 1977, Amin declared that he had defeated the British, and he conferred on himself the decoration of CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire). His full self-bestowed title ultimately became: &quot;His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular&quot;, in addition to his officially stated claim of being the uncrowned king of Scotland. He never received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) or the Military Cross (MC). He conferred a doctorate of law on himself from Makerere University as well as the Victorious Cross (VC), a medal made to emulate the British Victoria Cross.

Amin became the subject of rumours, including a widespread belief that he was a cannibal. Amin reportedly also boasted that he kept the severed heads of political enemies in his freezer, although he said that human flesh was generally &quot;too salty&quot; for his taste.

During Amin&#x27;s time in power, popular media outside of Uganda often portrayed him as an essentially comic and eccentric figure. Julius Harris emphasized Amin&#x27;s allegedly clownish side in &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot;, while Yaphet Kotto drew more praise for projecting Amin&#x27;s sinister nature in &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot;. In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article described him as a &quot;killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet&quot;. The comedy-variety series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired four Amin sketches between 1976 and 1979, including one in which he was an ill-behaved houseguest in exile, and another in which he was a spokesman against venereal disease. In 1979, radio host Don Imus made multiple on-air telephone calls in an attempt to talk to Amin, and later hosted a phony interview with him that was deemed &quot;very dirty&quot;. In a &quot;Benny Hill Show&quot; episode transmitted in January 1977, Hill portrayed Amin sitting behind a desk that featured a placard reading &quot;ME TARZAN, U GANDA&quot;.

The foreign media were often criticized by Ugandan exiles and defectors for emphasizing Amin&#x27;s self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior. Other commentators even suggested that Amin had deliberately cultivated his eccentric reputation in the foreign media as an easily parodied buffoon in order to defuse international concern over his administration of Uganda. Ugandan soldier and rebel Patrick Kimumwe argued that Amin&#x27;s &quot;clowning conceal[ed] a ruthless extinction of human rights&quot; in Uganda. Journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey wrote, &quot;facile explanations of Amin&#x27;s regime, as either a one-man show or a lawless and ruthless band of killers, do not get at the heart of the power structure.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Gender historian Alicia Decker wrote that the &quot;deeply embedded culture of militarism in Uganda is undoubtedly Amin&#x27;s most enduring legacy.&quot; In the immediate aftermath of his deposition, war correspondent Al J Venter stated that Ugandans still spoke about Amin &quot;with a certain amount of awe, now laced with venom&quot;. His reputation in Uganda has been viewed over the decades following his rule in more complex ways than in the international community. Some Ugandans have praised him as a &quot;patriot&quot; and supported his decision to expel Asians from the country. At the time of his death, he was particularly well-regarded in north-western Uganda. One of Amin&#x27;s sons, Jaffar Remo, criticized the negative public perception of his father and called for a commission to investigate the veracity of the abuses committed under his rule.

== In popular culture ==

During the 1970s, while Amin was at the height of his infamy, British comic actor John Bird starred on the album &quot;The Collected Broadcasts of Idi Amin&quot;, with lyrics based on Alan Coren&#x27;s anti-Amin &quot;Punch&quot; columns. In 1975 the satirical single &quot;Amazin&#x27; Man&quot;, from the album, was released on the Transatlantic label. The record stayed for 12 weeks in the Australian Singles Chart, peaking at number 26.

A 1974 documentary film &quot;General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait&quot; by director Barbet Schroeder was made with the support and participation of Idi Amin. &quot;Rise and Fall of Idi Amin&quot; (1981) is a Kenyan film that details the history of Idi Amin&#x27;s reign. This film popularized many rumours about Amin&#x27;s brutality, such as his alleged mutilation of one of his wives. Amin is played by Joseph Olita, who reprised this role in &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; (1991), a film about romance between African and Asian-Americans following Amin&#x27;s 1972 expulsion of Asians from Uganda.

Amin is the subject of English journalist Giles Foden&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot; (1998), which focuses on Idi Amin&#x27;s Uganda through the eyes of a young Scottish physician. In 2006, the book was adapted into a movie, where Amin is portrayed by Forest Whitaker. Whitaker won the best leading actor award for this role at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, the Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild Award, and the BAFTAs.

<doc id="70843" wikidata="Q118725" url="?curid=70843" title="Hafez al-Assad">
<text>Hafez al-Assad (6 October 193010 June 2000) was a Syrian politician, military officer and dictator who was the 18th president of Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000. He was also the prime minister of Syria from 1970 to 1971 as well as the regional secretary of the regional command of the Syrian regional branch of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party and secretary general of the National Command of the Ba&#x27;ath Party from 1970 to 2000. Hafez al-Assad was a key participant in the 1963 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, which brought the Syrian regional branch of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party to power in the country, a power that lasted until the fall of the regime in 2024, then led by his son Bashar.

The new leadership appointed Assad as the commander of the Syrian Air Force. In February 1966 Assad participated in a second coup, which toppled the traditional leaders of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Assad was appointed defence minister by the new government. Four years later Assad initiated a third coup, which ousted the &quot;de facto&quot; leader Salah Jadid, and appointed himself as leader of Syria. Assad imposed various changes to the Ba&#x27;athist foreign policy after seizing power, such as abandoning Salah Jadid&#x27;s policy of exporting &quot;socialist revolution&quot; and strengthening Syria&#x27;s foreign relations with countries that his predecessor had deemed &quot;reactionary&quot;. Assad sided with the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War in return for support against Israel and, whilst he had forsaken the pan-Arab concept of unifying the Arab world into one Arab nation, he sought to paint Syria as the defender of the Palestinians against Israel. 

When he came to power, he organised the state along sectarian lines (Sunnis and non-Alawites became figureheads of political institutions whilst the Alawites took control of the military, intelligence, bureaucracy and security apparatuses). Ba&#x27;athist decision-making authority that had previously been collegial was reduced and given to the president. The Syrian government ceased to be a one-party system in the normal sense of the word and was turned into a one-party dictatorship with a strong presidency. To maintain this system, a cult of personality centred on Assad and his family was created by the president and the Ba&#x27;ath party. 

The Assad family’s personality cult was integrated with the Ba’athist doctrine to shape the state&#x27;s official ideology. Assad ordered an intervention in Lebanon in 1976, which resulted in the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. During his rule, his regime crushed an Islamist uprising led by the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood rebels through a series of crackdowns culminating in the Hama massacre, which led to two thirds of the city of Hama being destroyed.

After consolidating his personal authority over the Syrian government Assad began looking for a successor. His first choice was his brother Rifaat, but Rifaat attempted to seize power in 1983–1984 when Hafez&#x27;s health was in doubt. Rifaat was subsequently exiled when Hafez&#x27;s health recovered. Assad&#x27;s next choice of successor was his eldest son, Bassel. However, Bassel died in a highspeed car crash in 1994, and Assad turned to his third choice—his younger son Bashar, who at that time was a medical student in the UK, with no political experience. The move to appoint a member of his own family as his successor was met with criticism in some quarters of the Syrian ruling class, but Assad persisted with his plan and demoted officials who opposed this succession. Assad died in June 2000 and Bashar succeeded him as president, serving until he was overthrown in December 2024.
== Early life, education and early career==

=== Early life===
Hafez al-Assad was born on 6 October, 1930, in Qardaha, a town in the Alawite State in the north-west of Syria, all within the French-ruled Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon (Qardaha is nowadays within the Latakia Governorate of the Syrian Arab Republic); he was born into a poor family belonging to the Kalbiyya tribe of Alawites. His paternal grandfather, Sulayman al-Wahhish, gained the nickname &quot;al-Wahhish&quot; (wild beast) for his strength. Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s parents were Na&#x27;isa Shalish and Ali al-Assad. His father married twice and had eleven children. Hafez was his ninth son and the fourth from his second marriage. 

By the 1920s, Ali was respected locally and was initially opposed to the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, a French-ruled League of Nations mandate officially established in 1923. Nevertheless, Ali Sulayman later cooperated with the French administration and was appointed to an official post. Local residents called him &quot;al-Assad&quot; (the lion) for his accomplishments and, in 1927, he made the nickname his surname.

===Education and early political career===
Alawites initially opposed a united Syrian state (since they thought their status as a religious minority would endanger them). After the French left Syria in 1946, many Syrians mistrusted the Alawites because of their alignment with France. Assad left his Alawite village, beginning his education at age nine in Sunni-dominated Latakia. He became the first in his family to attend high school, but in Latakia, Assad faced anti-Alawite bias from Sunnis. He was an excellent student, winning several prizes at about age 14. Assad lived in a poor, predominantly Alawite part of Latakia; to fit in, he approached political parties that welcomed Alawites. These parties (which also espoused secularism) were the Syrian Communist Party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) and the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party; Assad joined the Ba&#x27;ath in 1946, whereas some of his friends belonged to the SSNP. The Ba&#x27;ath (Renaissance) Party espoused a pan-Arabist, socialist ideology.

Assad proved an asset to the party, organizing Ba&#x27;ath student cells and carrying the party&#x27;s message to the poor sections of Latakia and to Alawite villages. He was opposed by the Muslim Brotherhood, which allied itself with wealthy and conservative Muslim families. Assad&#x27;s high school accommodated students from rich and poor families, and Assad was joined by poor, anti-establishment Sunni Muslim youth from the Ba&#x27;ath Party in confrontations with students from wealthy Brotherhood families. He made many Sunni friends, some of whom later became his political allies. 

While still a teenager, Assad became increasingly prominent in the party as an organizer and recruiter, head of his school&#x27;s student-affairs committee from 1949 to 1951 and president of the Union of Syrian Students. During his political activism in school, he met many men who would later serve him when he became president.

==Air Force career: 1950–1958==

After graduating from high school, Assad aspired to be a medical doctor, but his father could not pay for his study at the Jesuit Saint Joseph University in Beirut. Instead, in 1950, he decided to join the Syrian Armed Forces. Assad entered the Homs Military Academy, which offered free food, lodging and a stipend. He wanted to fly, and entered the flying school in Aleppo in 1950. 

Assad graduated in 1955, after which he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Syrian Air Force. Upon graduation from flying school, he won a best-aviator trophy, and shortly afterwards was assigned to the Mezzeh air base near Damascus. He married Anisa Makhlouf in 1957, a distant relative of the powerful Makhlouf family.

In 1955, the military split in a revolt against President Adib Shishakli. Hashim al-Atassi, head of the National Bloc and briefly president after Sami al-Hinnawi&#x27;s coup, returned as president and Syria was again under civilian rule. After 1955, Atassi&#x27;s hold on the country was increasingly shaky. As a result of the 1955 election, Atassi was replaced by Shukri al-Quwatli, who was president before Syria&#x27;s independence from France. The Ba&#x27;ath Party grew closer to the Communist Party not because of shared ideology, but a shared opposition to the West. At the academy, Assad met Mustafa Tlass, his future minister of Defence. 

In 1955, Assad was sent to Egypt for a further six months of training. When Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal in 1956, Syria feared retaliation from the United Kingdom, and Assad flew in an air-defense mission. He was among the Syrian pilots who flew to Cairo to show Syria&#x27;s commitment to Egypt. After finishing a course in Egypt the following year, Assad returned to a small airbase near Damascus. During the Suez Crisis, he also flew a reconnaissance mission over northern and eastern Syria. In 1957, as squadron commander, Assad was sent to the Soviet Union for training in flying MiG-17s. He spent ten months in the Soviet Union, during which he fathered a daughter (who died as an infant while he was abroad) with his wife.

In 1958, Syria and Egypt formed the United Arab Republic (UAR), separating themselves from Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey (who were aligned with the United Kingdom). This pact led to the rejection of Communist influence in favour of Egyptian control over Syria. All Syrian political parties (including the Ba&#x27;ath Party) were dissolved, and senior officers—especially those who supported the Communists—were dismissed from the Syrian armed forces. Assad, however, remained in the military and rose quickly through the ranks. After reaching the rank of captain, he was transferred to Egypt, continuing his military education with the future president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak.

==Runup to 1963 coup: 1958–1963==

Assad was not content with a professional military career, regarding it rather as a gateway to politics. After the creation of the UAR, Ba&#x27;ath Party leader Michel Aflaq was forced by Nasser to dissolve the party. During the UAR&#x27;s existence, the Ba&#x27;ath Party experienced a crisis for which several of its members—mostly young—blamed Aflaq. To resurrect the Syrian Regional Branch of the party, Muhammad Umran, Salah Jadid, Assad and others established the Military Committee. In 1957–58 Assad rose to a dominant position in the Military Committee, which mitigated his transfer to Egypt. After Syria left the UAR in September 1961, Assad and other Ba&#x27;athist officers were removed from the military by the new government in Damascus, and he was given a minor clerical position at the Ministry of Transport.

Assad played a minor role in the failed 1962 military coup, for which he was jailed in Lebanon and later repatriated. That year, Aflaq convened the 5th National Congress of the Ba&#x27;ath Party (where he was re-elected as the Secretary-General of the National Command) and ordered the re-establishment of the party&#x27;s Syrian Regional Branch. At the Congress, the Military Committee (through Umran) established contacts with Aflaq and the civilian leadership. The committee requested permission to seize power by force, and Aflaq agreed to the conspiracy. After the success of the Iraqi coup d&#x27;état led by the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi Regional Branch, the Military Committee hastily convened to launch a Ba&#x27;athist military coup in March 1963 against President Nazim al-Kudsi (which Assad helped plan). 

The coup was scheduled for 7 March, but he announced a postponement (until the next day) to the other units. During the coup Assad led a small group to capture the Dumayr airbase, northeast of Damascus. His group was the only one that encountered resistance. Some planes at the base were ordered to bomb the conspirators, and because of this Assad hurried to reach the base before dawn. Because the 70th Armored Brigade&#x27;s surrender took longer than anticipated, however, he arrived in broad daylight. When Assad threatened the base commander with shelling, the commander negotiated a surrender; Assad later claimed that the base could have withstood his forces.

==Early Ba&#x27;ath Party rule: 1963–1970==

===Aflaqite leadership: 1963–1966===

====Military work====
Not long after Assad&#x27;s election to the Regional Command, the Military Committee ordered him to strengthen the committee&#x27;s position in the military establishment. Assad may have received the most important job of all, since his primary goal was to end factionalism in the Syrian military and make it a Ba&#x27;ath monopoly; as he said, he had to create an &quot;ideological army&quot;. To help with this task, Assad recruited Zaki al-Arsuzi, who indirectly (through Wahib al-Ghanim) inspired him to join the Ba&#x27;ath Party when he was young. Arsuzi accompanied Assad on tours of military camps, where Arsuzi lectured the soldiers on Ba&#x27;athist thought. In gratitude for his work, Assad gave Arsuzi a government pension. Assad continued his Ba&#x27;athification of the military by appointing loyal officers to key positions and ensuring that the &quot;political education of the troops was not neglected&quot;. He demonstrated his skill as a patient planner during this period. As Patrick Seale wrote, Assad&#x27;s mastery of detail &quot;suggested the mind of an intelligence officer&quot;.

Assad was in charge of the Syrian Air Force. By the end of 1964 he was named commander of the Air Force, with the rank of major general. Assad gave privileges to Air Force officers, appointed his confidants to senior and sensitive positions and established an efficient intelligence network. Air Force Intelligence, under the command of Muhammad al-Khuli, became independent of Syria&#x27;s other intelligence organizations and received assignments beyond Air Force jurisdiction. Assad prepared himself for an active role in the power struggles that lay ahead.

====Power struggle and 1966 coup====

In the aftermath of the 1963 coup, at the First Regional Congress (held 5 September 1963) Assad was elected to the Syrian Regional Command (the highest decision-making body in the Syrian Regional Branch). While not a leadership role, it was Assad&#x27;s first appearance in national politics; in retrospect, he said he positioned himself &quot;on the left&quot; in the Regional Command. Khalid al-Falhum, a Palestinian who would later work for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), met Assad in 1963; he noted that Assad was a strong leftist &quot;but was clearly not a communist&quot;, committed instead to Arab nationalism.

During the 1964 Hama riot, Assad voted to suppress the uprising violently if needed. The decision to suppress the Hama riot led to a schism in the Military Committee between Umran and Jadid. Umran opposed force, instead wanting the Ba&#x27;ath Party to create a coalition with other pan-Arab forces. Jadid desired a strong one-party state, similar to those in the communist countries of Europe. Assad, as a junior partner, kept quiet at first but eventually allied himself with Jadid. Why Assad chose to side with him has been widely discussed; he probably shared Jadid&#x27;s radical ideological outlook. Having lost his footing on the Military Committee, Umran aligned himself with Aflaq and the National Command; he told them that the Military Committee was planning to seize power in the party by ousting them. Because of Umran&#x27;s defection, Rifaat al-Assad (Hafez&#x27;s brother) succeeded Umran as commander of a secret military force tasked with protecting Military Committee loyalists.

In its bid to seize power the Military Committee allied themselves with the regionalists, a group of cells in the Syrian Regional Branch that refused to disband in 1958 when ordered to do so. Although Aflaq considered these cells traitors, Assad called them the &quot;true cells of the party&quot;; this again highlighted differences between the Military Committee and the National Command headed by Aflaq. At the Eighth National Congress in 1965 Assad was elected to the National Command, the party&#x27;s highest decision-making body. From his position as part of the National Command, Assad informed Jadid on its activities. After the congress, the National Command dissolved the Syrian Regional Command; Aflaq proposed Salah al-Din al-Bitar as prime minister, but Assad and Brahim Makhous opposed Bitar&#x27;s nomination. According to Seale, Assad abhorred Aflaq; he considered him an autocrat and a rightist, accusing him of &quot;ditching&quot; the party by ordering the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958. Assad, who also disliked Aflaq&#x27;s supporters, nevertheless opposed a show of force against the Aflaqites. In response to the imminent coup Assad, Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh left for London.

In the 1966 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, the Military Committee overthrew the National Command. The coup led to a permanent schism in the Ba&#x27;ath movement, the advent of neo-Ba&#x27;athism and the establishment of two centers of the international Ba&#x27;athist movement: one Iraqi- and the other Syrian-dominated.

===Jadid as strongman: 1966–1970===

====Beginning====
After the coup, Assad was appointed Minister of Defense. This was his first cabinet post, and through his position, he would be thrust into the forefront of the Syrian–Israeli conflict. His government was radically socialist, and sought to remake society from top to bottom. Although Assad was a radical, he opposed the headlong rush for change. Despite his title, he had little power in the government and took more orders than he issued. Jadid was the undisputed leader at the time, opting to remain in the office of Assistant Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command instead of taking executive office (which had historically been held by Sunnis). Nureddin al-Atassi was given three of the four top executive positions in the country: President, Secretary-General of the National Command and Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Command. The post of prime minister was given to Yusuf Zu&#x27;ayyin. Jadid (who was establishing his authority) focused on civilian issues and gave Assad &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Syrian military, considering him no threat.

During the failed coup d&#x27;état of late 1966, Salim Hatum tried to overthrow Jadid&#x27;s government. Hatum (who felt snubbed when he was not appointed to the Regional Command after the February 1966 coup d&#x27;état) sought revenge and the return to power of Hammud al-Shufi, the first Regional Secretary of the Regional Command after the Syrian Regional Branch&#x27;s re-establishment in 1963. When Jadid, Atassi and Regional Command member Jamil Shayya visited Suwayda, forces loyal to Hatum surrounded the city and captured them. In a twist of fate, the city&#x27;s Druze elders forbade the murder of their guests and demanded that Hatum wait. Jadid and the others were placed under house arrest, with Hatum planning to kill them at his first opportunity. When word of the mutiny spread to the Ministry of Defense, Assad ordered the 70th Armored Brigade to the city. By this time Hatum, a Druze, knew that Assad would order the bombardment of Suwayda (a Druze-dominated city) if Hatum did not accede to his demands. Hatum and his supporters fled to Jordan, where they were given asylum. How Assad learned about the conspiracy is unknown, but Mustafa al-Hajj Ali (head of military intelligence) may have telephoned the Ministry of Defense. Due to his prompt action, Assad earned Jadid&#x27;s gratitude.

In the aftermath of the attempted coup Assad and Jadid purged the party&#x27;s military organization, removing 89 officers; Assad removed an estimated 400 officers, Syria&#x27;s largest military purge to date. The purges, which began when the Ba&#x27;ath Party took power in 1963, had left the military weak. As a result, when the Six-Day War broke out, Syria had no chance of victory.

====Seizing power====
The Arab defeat in the Six-Day War, in which Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria, provoked a furious quarrel among Syria&#x27;s leadership. The civilian leadership blamed military incompetence, and the military responded by criticizing the civilian leadership (led by Jadid). Several high-ranking party members demanded Assad&#x27;s resignation, and an attempt was made to vote him out of the Regional Command, the party&#x27;s highest decision-making body. The motion was defeated by one vote, with Abd al-Karim al-Jundi (who the anti-Assad members hoped would succeed Assad as defense minister) voting, as Patrick Seale put it, &quot;in a comradely gesture&quot; to retain him. During the end of the war, the party leadership freed Aflaqites Umran, Amin al-Hafiz and Mansur al-Atrash from prison. Shortly after his release, Assad was approached by dissident Syrian military officers to oust the government; he refused, believing that a coup at that time would have helped Israel, but not Syria.

The war was a turning point for Assad (and Ba&#x27;athist Syria in general), and his attempted ouster began a power struggle with Jadid for control of the country. Until then Assad had not shown ambition for high office, arousing little suspicion in others. From the 1963 Syrian coup d&#x27;état to the Six-Day War in 1967, Assad did not play a leading role in politics and was usually overshadowed by his contemporaries. As Patrick Seale wrote, he was &quot;apparently content to be a solid member of the team without the aspiration to become number one&quot;. Although Jadid was slow to see Assad&#x27;s threat, shortly after the war Assad began developing a network in the military and promoted friends and close relatives to high positions.

=====Differences with Jadid=====
Assad believed that Syria&#x27;s defeat in the Six-Day War was Jadid&#x27;s fault, and the accusations against himself were unjust. By this time Jadid had total control of the Regional Command, whose members supported his policies. Assad and Jadid began to differ on policy; Assad believed that Jadid&#x27;s policy of a people&#x27;s war (an armed-guerrilla strategy) and class struggle had failed Syria, undermining its position. Although Jadid continued to champion the concept of a people&#x27;s war even after the Six-Day War, Assad opposed it. He felt that the Palestinian guerrilla fighters had been given too much autonomy and had raided Israel constantly, which in turn sparked the war. Jadid had broken diplomatic relations with countries he deemed reactionary, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Because of this, Syria did not receive aid from other Arab countries. Egypt and Jordan, which participated in the war, received £135 million per year for an undisclosed period.

While Jadid and his supporters prioritised socialism and the &quot;internal revolution&quot;, Assad wanted the leadership to focus on foreign policy and the containment of Israel. The Ba&#x27;ath Party was divided over several issues, such as how the government could best use Syria&#x27;s limited resources, the ideal relationship between the party and the people, the organization of the party and whether the class struggle should end. These subjects were discussed heatedly in Ba&#x27;ath Party conclaves, and when they reached the Fourth Regional Congress the two sides were irreconcilable.

Assad wanted to &quot;democratize&quot; the party by making it easier for people to join. Jadid was wary of too large a membership, believing that the majority of those who joined were opportunists. Assad, in an interview with Patrick Seale in the 1980s, stated that such a policy would make Party members believe they were a privileged class. Another problem, Assad believed, was the lack of local government institutions. Under Jadid, there was no governmental level below the Council of Ministers (the Syrian government). When the Iraqi Regional Branch (which continued to support the Aflaqite leadership) took control of Iraq in the 17 July Revolution, Assad was one of the few high-level politicians wishing to reconcile with them; he called for the establishment of an &quot;Eastern Front&quot; with Iraq against Israel in 1968. Jadid&#x27;s foreign policy towards the Soviet Union was also criticised by Assad, who believed it had failed. In many ways the relationship between the countries was poor, with the Soviets refusing to acknowledge Jadid&#x27;s scientific socialism and Soviet newspapers calling him a &quot;hothead&quot;. Assad, on the contrary, called for greater pragmatism in decision-making.

=====&quot;Duality of power&quot;=====
The conflict between Assad and Jadid became the talk of the army and the party, with a &quot;duality of power&quot; noted between them. Shortly after the failed attempt to expel Assad from the Regional Command, he began to consolidate his position in the military establishment—for example, by replacing Chief of Staff Ahmad al-Suwaydani with his friend Mustafa Tlass. Although Suwaydani&#x27;s relationship with Jadid had deteriorated, he was removed because of his complaints about &quot;Alawi influence in the army&quot;. Tlass was later appointed Assad&#x27;s Deputy Minister of Defense (his second-in-command). Others removed from their positions were Ahmad al-Mir (a founder and former member of the Military Committee, and former commander of the Golan Front) and Izzat Jadid (a close supporter of Jadid and commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade).

By the Fourth Regional Congress and Tenth National Congress in September and October 1968, Assad had extended his grip on the army, and Jadid still controlled the party. At both congresses, Assad was outvoted on most issues, and his arguments were firmly rejected. While he failed in most of his attempts, he had enough support to remove two socialist theoreticians (Prime Minister Yusuf Zu&#x27;ayyin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Brahim Makhous) from the Regional Command. However, the military&#x27;s involvement in party politics was unpopular with the ; as the gulf between Assad and Jadid widened, the civilian and military party bodies were forbidden to contact each other. Despite this, Assad was winning the race to accumulate power. As Munif ar-Razzaz (ousted in the 1966 Syrian coup d&#x27;état) noted, &quot;Jadid&#x27;s fatal mistake was to attempt to govern the army through the party&quot;.
While Assad had taken control of the armed forces through his position as Minister of Defense, Jadid still controlled the security and intelligence sectors through Abd al-Karim al-Jundi (head of the National Security Bureau). Jundi—a paranoid, cruel man—was feared throughout Syria. In February 1969, the Assad-Jadid conflict erupted in violent clashes through their respective proteges: Rifaat al-Assad (Hafez&#x27;s brother and a high-ranking military commander) and Jundi. The reason for the violence was Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s suspicion that Jundi was planning an attempt on Assad&#x27;s life. The suspected assassin was interrogated and confessed under torture. Acting on this information, Rifaat al-Assad argued that unless Jundi was removed from his post he and his brother were in danger.

From 25 to 28 February 1969, the Assad brothers initiated &quot;something just short of a coup&quot;. Under Assad&#x27;s authority, tanks were moved into Damascus and the staffs of &quot;al-Ba&#x27;ath&quot; and &quot;al-Thawra&quot; (two-party newspapers) and radio stations in Damascus and Aleppo were replaced with Assad loyalists. Latakia and Tartus, two Alawite-dominated cities, saw &quot;fierce scuffles&quot; ending with the overthrow of Jadid&#x27;s supporters from local posts. Shortly afterwards, a wave of arrests of Jundi loyalists began. On 2 March, after a telephone argument with head of military intelligence Ali Duba, Jundi committed suicide. When Zu&#x27;ayyin heard the news he wept, saying &quot;we are all orphaned now&quot; (referring to his and Jadid&#x27;s loss of their protector). Despite his rivalry with Jundi, Assad is said to have also wept when he heard the news.

Assad was now in control, but he hesitated to push his advantage. Jadid continued to rule Syria, and the Regional Command was unchanged. However, Assad influenced Jadid to moderate his policies. Class struggle was muted, criticism of reactionary tendencies of other Arab states ceased, some political prisoners were freed, a coalition government was formed (with the Ba&#x27;ath Party in control) and the Eastern Front espoused by Assad was formed with Iraq and Jordan. Jadid&#x27;s isolationist policies were curtailed, and Syria re-established diplomatic relations with many of its foes. Around this time, Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Egypt, Houari Boumediene&#x27;s Algeria and Ba&#x27;athist Iraq began sending emissaries to reconcile Assad and Jadid.

===== 1970 Coup d’etat=====
Assad began planning to seize power shortly after the failed Syrian military intervention in the Black September, a power struggle between the PLO and the Hashemite monarchy. While Assad had been in &quot;de facto&quot; command of Syrian politics since 1969, Jadid and his supporters still held the trappings of power. After attending Nasser&#x27;s funeral, Assad returned to Syria for the Emergency National Congress (held on 30 October). At the congress Assad was condemned by Jadid and his supporters, the majority of the party&#x27;s delegates. However, before attending the congress Assad ordered his loyal troops to surround the building housing the meeting. Criticism of Assad&#x27;s political position continued in a defeatist tone, with the majority of delegates believing that Assad had lost the battle. Assad and Tlass were stripped of their government posts at the congress; these acts had little practical significance.

When the National Congress ended on 12 November 1970, Assad ordered loyalists to arrest leading members of Jadid&#x27;s government. Although many mid-level officials were offered posts in Syrian embassies abroad, Jadid refused: &quot;If I ever take power, you will be dragged through the streets until you die.&quot; Assad imprisoned him in Mezze prison until his death. The coup was calm and bloodless; the only evidence of change to the outside world was the disappearance of newspapers, radio and television stations. A Temporary Regional Command was soon established, and on 16 November the new government published its first decree.

==Premiership and presidency: 1970–2000==

===Domestic events and policies===

====Consolidating power====

According to Patrick Seale, Assad&#x27;s rule &quot;began with an immediate and considerable advantage: the government he displaced was so detested that any alternative came as a relief&quot;. He first tried to establish national unity, which he felt had been lost under the leadership of Aflaq and Jadid. Assad differed from his predecessor at the outset, visiting local villages and hearing citizen complaints. The Syrian people felt that Assad&#x27;s rise to power would lead to change; one of his first acts as ruler was to visit Sultan al-Atrash, father of the Aflaqite Ba&#x27;athist Mansur al-Atrash, to honor his efforts during the Great Arab Revolution. He made overtures to the Writers&#x27; Union, rehabilitating those who had been forced underground, jailed or sent into exile for representing what radical Ba&#x27;athists called the reactionary classes: &quot;I am determined that you shall no longer feel strangers in your own country.&quot; Although Assad did not democratize the country, he eased the government&#x27;s repressive policies. Assad was approved as President in a referendum on 12 March 1971 and was formally inaugurated on 14 March.

He cut prices for basic foodstuffs 15 percent, which won him support from ordinary citizens. Jadid&#x27;s security services were purged, some military criminal investigative powers were transferred to the police, and the confiscation of goods under Jadid was reversed. Restrictions on travel to and trade with Lebanon were eased, and Assad encouraged growth in the private sector. While Assad supported most of Jadid&#x27;s policies, he proved more pragmatic after he came to power.

Most of Jadid&#x27;s supporters faced a choice: continue working for the Ba&#x27;ath government under Assad, or face repression. Assad made it clear from the beginning &quot;that there would be no second chances&quot;. However, later in 1970, he recruited support from the Ba&#x27;athist old guard who had supported Aflaq&#x27;s leadership during the 1963–1966 power struggle. An estimated 2,000 former Ba&#x27;athists rejoined the party after hearing Assad&#x27;s appeal, among them party ideologist Georges Saddiqni and Shakir al-Fahham, a secretary of the founding, 1st National Congress of the Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1947. Assad ensured that they would not defect to the pro-Aflaqite Ba&#x27;ath Party in Iraq with the Treason Trials in 1971, in which he prosecuted Aflaq, Amin al-Hafiz and nearly 100 followers (most &quot;in absentia&quot;). The few who were convicted were not imprisoned long, and the trials were primarily symbolic.

At the 11th National Congress, Assad assured party members that his leadership was a radical change from that of Jadid, and he would implement a &quot;corrective movement&quot; to return Syria to the true &quot;nationalist socialist line&quot;. Unlike Jadid, Assad emphasised &quot;the advancement of which all resources and manpower [would be] mobilised [was to be] the liberation of the occupied territories&quot;. This would mark a major break with his predecessors and would, according to Raymond Hinnebusch, dictate &quot;major alterations in the course of the Ba&#x27;thist state&quot;.

====Institutionalization====

Assad turned the presidency, which had been known simply as &quot;head of state&quot; under Jadid, into a position of power during his rule. In many ways, the presidential authority replaced the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s failed experiment with organised, military Leninism; Syria became a hybrid of Leninism and Gaullist constitutionalism. According to Raymond Hinnebusch, &quot;as the president became the main source of initiative in the government, his personality, values, strengths, and weaknesses became decisive for its direction and stability. Arguably Assad&#x27;s leadership gave the government an enhanced combination of consistency and flexibility which it hitherto lacked.&quot;

Assad institutionalised a system where he had the final say, which weakened the powers of the collegial institutions of the state and party. As fidelity to the leader replaced ideological conviction later in his presidency, corruption became widespread. The state-sponsored cult of personality became pervasive; as Assad&#x27;s authority strengthened at his colleagues&#x27; expense, he became the sole symbol of the government.

While Assad did not rule alone, he increasingly had the last word; those with whom he worked eventually became lieutenants, rather than colleagues. None of the political elite would question a decision of his, and those who did were dismissed. General Naji Jamil is an example, being dismissed after he disagreed with Assad&#x27;s handling of the Islamist uprising. The two highest decision-making bodies were the Regional Command and the National Command, both part of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Joint sessions of these bodies resembled politburos in socialist states which espoused communism. Assad headed the National Command and the Regional Command as Secretary General and Regional Secretary, respectively. The Regional Command was the highest decision-making body in Syria, appointing the president and (through him) the cabinet. As presidential authority strengthened, the power of the Regional Command and its members evaporated. The Regional and National Commands were nominally responsible to the Regional Congress and the National Congress—with the National Congress the &quot;de jure&quot; superior body—but the Regional Congress had &quot;de facto&quot; authority. The National Congress, which included delegates from Ba&#x27;athist Regional Branches in other countries, has been compared to the Comintern. It functioned as a session of the Regional Congress focusing on Syria&#x27;s foreign policy and party ideology. The Regional Congress had limited accountability until the 1985 Eighth Regional Congress, the last under Assad. In 1985, responsibility for leadership accountability was transferred from the Regional Congress to the weaker National Progressive Front.

====Sectarianism====
When Assad came to power, he increased Alawite dominance of the security and intelligence sectors to a near-monopoly. The coercive framework was under his control, weakening the state and party. According to Hinnebusch, the Alawite officers around Assad &quot;were pivotal because as personal kinsmen or clients of the president, they combined privileged access to him with positions in the party and control of the levers of coercion. They were, therefore, in an unrivalled position to act as political brokers and, especially in times of crisis, were uniquely placed to shape outcomes&quot;. The leading figures in the Alawite-dominated security system had family connections; Rifaat al-Assad controlled the Struggle Companies, and Assad&#x27;s brother-in-law Adnan Makhlouf was his second-in-command as Commander of the Presidential Guard. Other prominent figures were Ali Haydar (special-forces head), Ibrahim al-Ali (Popular Army head), Muhammad al-Khuli (head of Assad&#x27;s Air Force Intelligence Directorate from 1970–1987) and Military Intelligence head Ali Duba. Assad controlled the military through Alawites such as Generals Shafiq Fayadh (commander of the 3rd Division), Ibrahim Safi (commander of the 1st Division) and Adnan Badr Hassan (commander of the 9th Division). During the 1990s, Assad further strengthened Alawite dominance by replacing Sunni General Hikmat al-Shihabi with General Ali Aslan as chief of staff. The Alawites, with their high status, appointed and promoted based on kinship and favor rather than professional respect. Therefore, an Alawite elite emerged from these policies. Anti-Sunni orientation of his Alawite regime also pushed Assad to pursue closer relations with Shia Iran.

During the early years of his rule, some of Assad&#x27;s elite had appeared non-sectarian; prominent Sunni figures at the beginning of his rule were Abdul Halim Khaddam, Shihabi, Naji Jamil, Abdullah al-Ahmar and Mustafa Tlass. However, none of these people had a power base distinct from that of Assad. Although Sunnis held the positions of Air Force Commander from 1971 to 1994 (Jamil, Subhi Haddad and Ali Malahafji), General Intelligence head from 1970 to 2000 (Adnan Dabbagh, Ali al-Madani, Nazih Zuhayr, Fuad al-Absi and Bashir an-Najjar), Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army from 1974 to 1998 (Shihabi) and defense minister from 1972 until after Assad&#x27;s death (Tlass), none had power separate from Assad or the Alawite-dominated security system. When Jamil headed the Air Force, he could not issue orders without the knowledge of Khuli (the Alawite head of Air Force Intelligence). After the failed Islamst uprising, Assad&#x27;s reliance on his relatives intensified; before that, his Sunni colleagues had some autonomy. A defector from Assad&#x27;s government said, &quot;Tlass is in the army but at the same time seems as if he is not of the army; he neither binds nor loosens and has no role other than that of the tail in the beast.&quot; Another example was Shihabi, who occasionally represented Assad. However, he had no control in the Syrian military; Ali Aslan, First Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations during most of his tenure, was responsible for troop maneuvers. Although the Sunnis were in the forefront, the Alawites had the power.

====Islamist uprising====

=====Background=====
Assad&#x27;s pragmatic policies indirectly led to the establishment of a &quot;new class&quot;, and he accepted this while it furthered his aims against Israel. When Assad began pursuing a policy of economic liberalization, the state bureaucracy began using their positions for personal gain. The state gave implementation rights to &quot;much of its development program to foreign firms and contractors, fueling a growing linkage between the state and private capital&quot;. What ensued was a spike in corruption, which led the political class to be &quot;thoroughly embourgeoised&quot;. The channeling of external money through the state to private enterprises &quot;created growing opportunities for state elites&#x27; self-enrichment through corrupt manipulation of state-market interchanges. Besides outright embezzlement, webs of shared interests in commissions and kickbacks grew up between high officials, politicians, and business interests&quot;. The Alawite military-security establishment got the greatest share of the money; the Ba&#x27;ath Party and its leaders ruled a new class, defending their interests instead of those of peasants and workers (whom they were supposed to represent). This, coupled with growing Sunni disillusionment with what Hinnebusch calls &quot;the regime&#x27;s mixture of statism, rural and sectarian favouritism, corruption and new inequalities&quot;, fueled the growth of the Islamic movement. Because of this, the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria became the vanguard of anti-Ba&#x27;athist forces.

The Brotherhood had historically been a vehicle for Islamism during its introduction to the Syrian political scene during the 1960s under the leadership of Mustafa al-Siba&#x27;i. After Siba&#x27;i&#x27;s imprisonment, under Isam al-Attar&#x27;s leadership the Brotherhood developed into the ideological antithesis of Ba&#x27;athist rule. However, the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s organizational superiority worked in its favor; with Attar&#x27;s enforced exile, the Muslim Brotherhood was in disarray. It was not until the 1970s that the Muslim Brotherhood established a clear, central collective authority for its organization under Adnan Saad ad-Din, Sa&#x27;id Hawwa, Ali Sadr al-Din al-Bayanuni and Husni Abu. Because of their organizational capabilities, the Muslim Brotherhood grew tenfold from 1975 to 1978 (from 500 to 700 in Aleppo); nationwide, by 1978 it had 30,000 followers.

=====Events=====
The Islamist uprising began in the mid-to-late 1970s, with attacks on prominent members of the Ba&#x27;ath Alawite elite. As the conflict worsened, a debate in the party between hard-liners (represented by Rifaat al-Assad) and Ba&#x27;ath liberals (represented by Mahmoud al-Ayyubi) began. The Seventh Regional Congress, in 1980, was held in an atmosphere of crisis. The party leadership—with the exception of Assad and his proteges—were criticised severely by party delegates, who called for an anti-corruption campaign, a new, clean government, curtailing the powers of the military-security apparatus and political liberalization. With Assad&#x27;s consent, a new government (headed by the presumably clean Abdul Rauf al-Kasm) was established with new, young technocrats. The new government failed to assuage critics, and the Sunni middle class and the radical left (believing that Ba&#x27;athist rule could be overthrown with an uprising) began collaborating with the Islamists.

Believing they had the upper hand in the conflict, beginning in 1980 the Islamists began a series of campaigns against government installations in Aleppo; the attacks became urban guerrilla warfare. The government began to lose control in the city and, inspired by events, similar disturbances spread to Hama, Homs, Idlib, Latakia, Deir ez-Zor, Maaret-en-Namen and Jisr esh-Shagour. Those affected by Ba&#x27;athist repression began to rally behind the insurgents; Ba&#x27;ath Party co-founder Bitar supported the uprising, rallying the old, anti-military Ba&#x27;athists. The increasing threat to the government&#x27;s survival strengthened the hard-liners, who favored repression over concessions. Security forces began to purge all state, party and social institutions in Syria, and were sent to the northern provinces to quell the uprising. When this failed, the hard-liners began accusing the United States of fomenting the uprising and called for the reinstatement of &quot;revolutionary vigilance&quot;. The hard-liners won the debate after a failed attempt on Assad&#x27;s life in June 1980, and began responding to the uprising with state terrorism later that year. Under Rifaat al-Assad, Islamic prisoners at the Tadmur prison were massacred, membership in the Muslim Brotherhood became a capital offence and the government sent a death squad to kill Bitar and Attar&#x27;s former wife. The military court began condemning captured prisoners, which &quot;sometimes degenerated into indiscriminate killings&quot;. Little care was taken to distinguish Muslim Brotherhood hard-liners from their passive supporters, and violence was met with violence.Ultimately this culminated in the 1982 Hama massacre when the government crushed the uprising. Helicopter gunships, bulldozers, and artillery bombardment razed the city, killing thousands of people. The Ba&#x27;ath government withstood the uprising, not because of popular support, but because the opposition was disorganised and had little urban support. Throughout the uprising, the Sunni middle class continued to support the Ba&#x27;ath Party because of its dislike of political Islam. After the uprising the government resumed its version of militaristic Leninism, reverting the liberalization introduced when Assad came to power. The Ba&#x27;ath Party was weakened by the uprising; democratic elections for delegates to the Regional and National Congresses were halted, and open discussion within the party ended. The uprising made Syria more totalitarian than ever, and strengthened Assad&#x27;s position as undisputed leader of Syria.

====1983–1984 succession crisis====

In November 1983 Assad, a diabetic, had a heart attack complicated by phlebitis; this triggered a succession crisis. On 13 November, after visiting his brother in the hospital, Rifaat al-Assad reportedly announced his candidacy for president; he did not believe Assad would be able to continue ruling the country. When he did not receive support from Assad&#x27;s inner circle, he made, in the words of historian Hanna Batatu, &quot;abominably lavish&quot; promises to win them over.

Until his 1985 ouster, Rifaat al-Assad was considered the face of corruption by the Syrian people. Although highly paid as Commander of Defense Companies, he accumulated unexplained wealth. According to Batatu, &quot;there is no way that he could have permissibly accumulated the vast sums needed for the investments he made in real estate in Syria, Europe and the United States&quot;.

Although it is unclear if any top officials supported Rifaat al-Assad, most did not. He lacked his brother&#x27;s stature and charisma, and was vulnerable to charges of corruption. His 50,000-strong Defense Companies were viewed with suspicion by the upper leadership and throughout society; they were considered corrupt, poorly disciplined and indifferent to human suffering. Rifaat al-Assad also lacked military support; officers and soldiers resented the Defense Companies&#x27; monopoly of Damascus&#x27; security, their separate intelligence services and prisons and their higher pay. He did not abandon the hope of succeeding his brother, opting to take control of the country through his post as Commander of Defense Companies. In what became known as the &quot;poster war&quot;, personnel from the Defense Companies replaced posters of Assad in Damascus with those of Rifaat al-Assad. The security service, still loyal to Hafez, responded by replacing Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s posters with Hafez&#x27;s. The poster war lasted for a week until Assad&#x27;s health improved.

Shortly after the poster war, all of Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s proteges were removed from positions of power. This decree nearly sparked a clash between the Defense Companies and the Republican Guard on 27 February 1984, but conflict was avoided by Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s appointment as one of three Vice Presidents on 11 March. He acquired this post by surrendering his position as Commander of Defense Companies to a Hafez supporter. Rifaat al-Assad was succeeded as Defense Companies head by his son-in-law. During the night of 30 March, Rifaat ordered Defense Company loyalists to seal Damascus off and advance to the city. The Republican Guard was put on alert in Damascus, and 3rd Armored Division commander Shafiq Fayadh ordered troops outside Damascus to encircle the Defense Companies blocking the roads into the city. Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s plan might have succeeded if Special Forces commander Ali Haydar supported him, but Haydar sided with the president. Assad punished Rifaat al-Assad with exile, allowing him to return in later years without a political role. The Defense Companies were reduced by 30,000–35,000 men, and their role was assumed by the Republican Guard. Makhluf, the Republican Guard commander was promoted to major general, and Hafez&#x27;s son Bassel al-Assad, then an army major, became influential in the guard.

====Economy====

Assad called his domestic reforms a corrective movement, and it achieved some results. He tried to modernize Syria&#x27;s agricultural and industrial sectors; one of his main achievements was the completion of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River in 1974. One of the world&#x27;s largest dams, its reservoir was called Lake al-Assad. The reservoir increased the irrigation of arable land, provided electricity, and encouraged industrial and technical development in Syria. Many peasants and workers received increased income, social security, and better health and educational services. The urban middle class, which had been hurt by the Jadid government&#x27;s policy, had new economic opportunities.

By 1977 it was apparent that despite some success, Assad&#x27;s political reforms had largely failed. This was partly due to Assad&#x27;s foreign policy, failed policies, natural phenomena, and corruption. Chronic socioeconomic difficulties remained, and new ones appeared. Inefficiency, mismanagement, and corruption in the government, public, and private sectors, illiteracy, poor education (particularly in rural areas), increasing emigration by professionals, inflation, a growing trade deficit, a high cost of living and shortages of consumer goods were among problems faced by the country. The financial burden of Syria&#x27;s involvement in Lebanon since 1976 contributed to worsening economic problems, encouraging corruption and a black market. The emerging class of entrepreneurs and brokers became involved with senior military officers—including Assad&#x27;s brother Rifaat—in smuggling from Lebanon, which affected government revenue and encouraged corruption among senior government officials.

During the early 1980s, Syria&#x27;s economy worsened; by mid-1984, the food crisis was severe, and the press was full of complaints. Assad&#x27;s government sought a solution, arguing that food shortages could be avoided with careful economic planning. The food crisis continued through August, despite government measures. Syria lacked sugar, bread, flour, wood, iron, and construction equipment; this resulted in soaring prices, long queues and rampant black marketeering. Smuggling goods from Lebanon became common. Assad&#x27;s government tried to combat the smuggling, encountering difficulties due to the involvement of his brother Rifaat in the corruption. In July 1984, the government formed an effective anti-smuggling squad to control the Lebanon–Syria borders. The Defense Detachment commanded by Rifaat al-Assad played a leading role in the smuggling, importing $400,000 worth of goods a day. The anti-smuggling squad seized $3.8 million in goods during its first week.

The Syrian economy grew five to seven percent during the early 1990s; exports increased, the balance of trade improved, inflation remained moderate (15–18 percent) and oil exports increased. In May 1991 Assad&#x27;s government liberalised the Syrian economy, which stimulated domestic and foreign private investment. Most foreign investors were Arab states around the Persian Gulf since Western countries still had political and economic issues with the country. The Gulf states invested in infrastructure and development projects; because of the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s socialist ideology, Assad&#x27;s government did not privatize state-owned companies.

Syria fell into recession during the mid-1990s. Several years later, its economic growth was about 1.5 percent. This was insufficient since population growth was between 3 and 3.5 percent. Another symptom of the crisis was statism in foreign trade. Syria&#x27;s economic crisis coincided with a recession in world markets. A 1998 drop in oil prices dealt a major blow to Syria&#x27;s economy; when oil prices rose the following year, the Syrian economy partially recovered. In 1999, one of the worst droughts in a century caused a drop of 25–30 percent in crop yields compared with 1997 and 1998. Assad&#x27;s government implemented emergency measures, including loans and compensation to farmers and the distribution of free fodder to save sheep and cattle. However, those steps were limited and had no measurable effect on the economy.

Assad&#x27;s government tried to decrease population growth, but this was only marginally successful. One sign of economic stagnation was Syria&#x27;s lack of progress in talks with the EU on an agreement. The main cause of this failure was the country&#x27;s difficulty in meeting EU demands to open the economy and introduce reforms. Marc Pierini, head of the EU delegation in Damascus, said that if the Syrian economy was not modernised it would not benefit from closer ties to the EU. Assad&#x27;s government gave civil servants a 20-percent pay raise on the anniversary of the corrective movement that brought him to power. Although the foreign press criticised Syria&#x27;s reluctance to liberalize its economy, Assad&#x27;s government refused to modernize the bank system, permit private banks and open a stock exchange.

===Foreign policy===
====Yom Kippur War====
=====Planning=====
Since the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War, Assad was convinced that the Israelis had won the war by subterfuge; after gaining power, his top foreign-policy priority was to regain the Arab territory lost in the war. Assad reaffirmed Syria&#x27;s rejection of the 1967 UN Security Council Resolution 242 because he believed it stood for the &quot;liquidation of the Palestine question&quot;. He believed, and continued to believe until long into his rule, that the only way to get Israel to negotiate with the Arabs was through war.

When Assad took power, Syria was isolated; planning an attack on Israel, he sought allies and war material. Ten weeks after gaining power, Assad visited the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership was wary of supplying the Syrian government, viewing Assad&#x27;s rise to power with a reserve and believing him to lean further West than Jadid did. While he soon understood that the Soviet relationship with the Arabs would never be as deep as the United States&#x27; relationship with Israel, he needed its weapons. Unlike his predecessors (who tried to win Soviet support with socialist policies), Assad was willing to give the Soviets a stable presence in the Middle East through Syria, access to Syrian naval bases (giving them a role in the peace process) and help in curtailing American influence in the region. The Soviets responded by sending arms to Syria. The new relationship bore fruit, and between February 1971 and October 1973 Assad met several times with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.

Assad believed that Syria would have no chance in a war against Israel without Egyptian participation. He believed that if the United Arab Republic had not collapsed, the Arabs would already have liberated Palestine. For a war against Israel, Syria needed to establish another front. However, by this time Syria&#x27;s relations with Egypt and Jordan were shaky at best. Planning for war began in 1971 with an agreement between Assad and Anwar Sadat. In the beginning, the renewed Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based upon the proposed Federation of Arab Republics (FAR), a federation initially encompassing Egypt, Libya, Sudan (which left soon after FAR&#x27;s first summit) and Syria. Assad and Sadat used the FAR summits to plan war strategy, and by 1971 they had appointed Egyptian General Muhammad Sadiq supreme commander of both armies. From 1972 to 1973, the countries filled their arsenals and trained their armies. In a secret meeting of the Egyptian–Syrian Military Council from 21 to 23 August 1973, the two chiefs of staff (Syrian Youssef Chakkour and Egyptian Saad el-Shazly) signed a document declaring their intention to go to war against Israel. During a meeting of Assad, Sadat and their respective defense ministers (Tlass and Hosni Mubarak) on 26–27 August, the two leaders decided to go to war together.

Egypt went to war for a reason different from Syria’s. While Assad wanted to regain lost Arab territory, Sadat wished to strengthen Egypt&#x27;s position in its peace policy toward Israel. The Syrians were deceived by Sadat and the Egyptians, which would play a major role in the Arab defeat. Egyptian Chief of Staff Shazly was convinced from the beginning that Egypt could not mount a successful full-scale offensive against Israel; therefore, he campaigned for a limited war. Sadat knew that Assad would not participate in the war if he knew his real intentions. Since the collapse of the UAR, the Egyptians were critical of the Ba&#x27;athist government; they saw it as an untrustworthy ally.

=====The war=====

At 14:05 on 6 October 1973, Egyptian forces (attacking through the Sinai Peninsula) and Syrian forces (attacking the Golan Heights) crossed the border into Israel and penetrated the Israeli defense lines. The Syrian forces on the Golan Heights met with more intense fighting than their Egyptian counterparts, but by 8 October had broken through the Israeli defenses. The early successes of the Syrian army were due to its officer corps (where officers were promoted because of merit and not politics) and its ability to handle advanced Soviet weaponry: tanks, artillery batteries, aircraft, man-portable missiles, the Sagger anti-tank weapon and the 2K12 Kub anti-aircraft system on mobile launchers. With the help of these weapons, Egypt and Syria defeated Israel&#x27;s armor and air supremacy. Egypt and Syria announced the war to the world first, accusing Israel of starting it, mindful of the importance of avoiding appearing as the aggressor (Israel accused the Arab powers of starting the Six-Day War when they launched Operation Focus). In any case, early Syrian successes helped rectify the loss of face they had suffered following the Six-Day War.

The main reason for the reversal of fortune was Egypt&#x27;s operational pause from 7 to 14 October. After capturing parts of the Sinai, the Egyptian campaign halted and the Syrians were left fighting the Israelis alone. The Egyptian leaders, believing their war aims accomplished, dug in. While their early successes in the war had surprised them, War Minister General Ahmad Ismail Ali advised caution. In Syria, Assad and his generals waited for the Egyptians to move. When the Israeli government learned of Egypt&#x27;s modest war strategy, it ordered an &quot;immediate continuous action&quot; against the Syrian military. According to Patrick Seale, &quot;For three days, 7, 8, and 9 October, Syrian troops on the Golan faced the full fury of the Israeli air force as, from first light to nightfall, wave after wave of aircraft swooped down to bomb, strafe and napalm their tank concentration and their fuel and ammunition carriers right back to the Purple Line.&quot; By 9 October, the Syrians were retreating behind the Purple Line (the Israeli–Syrian border since the Six-Day War). By 13 October the war was lost, but (in contrast to the Six-Day War) the Syrians were not crushed; this earned Assad respect in Syria and abroad.

On 14 October, Egypt began a limited offensive against Israel for political reasons. Sadat needed Assad on his side for his peace policy with Israel to succeed, and military action as a means to an end. The renewed Egyptian military offensive was ill-conceived. A week later, due to Egyptian inactivity, the Israelis had organised and the Arabs had lost their most important advantage. While the military offensive gave Assad hope, this was an illusion; the Arabs had already lost the war militarily. Egypt&#x27;s behavior during the war caused friction between Assad and Sadat. Assad, still inexperienced in foreign policy, believed that the Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based on trust and failed to understand Egypt&#x27;s duplicity. Although it was not until after the war that Assad would learn that Sadat was in contact with American National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger almost daily during the war, the seeds of distrust had been sown. Around this time, Sadat called for an American-led ceasefire agreement between Egypt, Syria, and Israel; however, he was unaware that under Kissinger&#x27;s tenure the United States had become a staunch supporter of Israel.

On 16 October, Sadat—without telling Assad—called for a ceasefire in a speech to the People&#x27;s Assembly, the Egyptian legislative body. Assad was not only surprised but could not comprehend why Sadat trusted &quot;American goodwill for a satisfactory result&quot;. Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited Cairo, urging Sadat to accept a ceasefire without the condition of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. While Sadat was reluctant at first, Kosygin returned on 18 October with satellite images showing 300 Israeli tanks in Egyptian territory. The blow to Sadat&#x27;s morale was such that he sent a cable to Assad, obliquely saying that all hope was lost. Assad, who was in a better position, was still optimistic. Under Soviet influence, Egypt called for a ceasefire on 22 October 1973, direct negotiations between the warring parties and the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 242. The ceasefire resolution did not call for Israeli withdrawal from its occupied territories. Assad was annoyed since he had not been informed beforehand of Sadat&#x27;s change in policy (which affected them both). On 23 October the Syrian government accepted the ceasefire, spelling out its understanding of UN Resolution 338 (withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories and the safeguarding of Palestinian rights).

====Lebanese Civil War====


Syria intervened in Lebanon in 1976 during the civil war, which began in 1975. With the Egyptian–Israeli peace accords, Syria was the only neighboring state which threatened Israel. Syria initially tried to mediate the conflict; when that failed, Assad ordered the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), a regular force based in Syria with Syrian officers, troops into Lebanon to restore order. Around this time, the Israeli government opened its borders to Maronite refugees in Lebanon to strengthen its regional influence. Clashes between the Syria-loyal PLA and militants occurred throughout the country. Despite Syrian support and Khaddam&#x27;s mediation, Rashid Karami (the Sunni Muslim Prime Minister of Lebanon) did not have enough support to appoint a cabinet.

In early 1976 Assad was approached by Lebanese politicians for help in forcing the resignation of Suleiman Frangieh, the Christian President of Lebanon. Although Assad was open to change, he resisted attempts by some Lebanese politicians to enlist him in Frangieh&#x27;s ouster; when General Abdul Aziz al-Ahdāb attempted to seize power, Syrian troops stopped him. In the meantime, radical Lebanese leftists were gaining the upper hand in the military conflict. Kamal Jumblatt, leader of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), believed that his strong military position would compel Frangieh&#x27;s resignation. Assad did not wish a leftist victory in Lebanon which would strengthen the position of the Palestinians. He did not want a rightist victory either, instead of seeking a middle-ground solution which would safeguard Lebanon and the region. When Jumblatt met with Assad on 27 March 1976, he tried to persuade him to let him &quot;win&quot; the war; Assad replied that a ceasefire should be in effect to ensure the 1976 presidential elections. Meanwhile, on Assad&#x27;s orders Syria sent troops into Lebanon without international approval.

While Yasser Arafat and the PLO had not officially taken a side in the conflict, several PLO members were fighting with the LNM. Assad attempted to steer Arafat and the PLO away from Lebanon, threatening him with a cutoff of Syrian aid. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement. When Frangieh stepped down in 1976, Syria pressured Lebanese members of parliament to elect Elias Sarkis president. One-third of the Lebanese members of parliament (primarily supporters of Raymond Edde) boycotted the election to protest American and Syrian interference.

On 31 May 1976, Syria began a full-scale intervention in Lebanon to (according to the official Syrian account) end bombardment of the Maronite cities of Qubayat and Aandqat. Before the intervention, Assad and the Syrian government were one of several interests in Lebanon; afterward, they were the controlling factors in Lebanese politics. On Assad&#x27;s orders, the Syrian troop presence slowly increased to 30,000. Syria received approval for the intervention from the United States and Israel to help them defeat Palestinian forces in Lebanon. The Ba&#x27;athist group As-Sa&#x27;iqa and the PLA&#x27;s Hittīn brigade fought Palestinians who sided with the LNM.

Within a week of the Syrian intervention, Christian leaders issued a statement of support.

Muslim leaders established a joint command of all Palestinian groups except As-Sa&#x27;iqa, which was driven by the PLO to its stronghold near the main airport. Shortly afterward, As-Sa&#x27;iqa and other leftist Damascus forces were absorbed by the Syrian military. On 8 June 1976 Syrian forces were pushed back from Sidon, encountering stiff resistance in Beirut from the LNM. Assad&#x27;s actions angered much of the Arab world however and the sight of Syria trying to eliminate the PLO brought criticism upon him. There was considerable hostility to Assad&#x27;s alliance with the Maronites in Syria. As a result, the Syrian government asked the Arab League to assist in the conflict. The Arab League began to meditate, establishing the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF) for peacekeeping. Syrian strategy at this point was to gradually weaken the LNM and its Palestinian collaborators, continuing to support the Christian militia. However, the Syrians were unable to capture the LNM&#x27;s stronghold of Aley before the Arab League called for a ceasefire on 17 October. The Arab League strengthened the ADF to 30,000 troops, most Syrian. While some heavy fighting continued, by December 1976 and January 1977 most Palestinian and Lebanese groups had disposed of their heavy weaponry. According to Charles Winslow, the &quot;main phase&quot; of the Lebanese Civil War had ended by 1977; until the early 1990s most violence was attributed to the turf, proxy, inter-communal and state wars.
Assad used terrorism and intimidation to extend his control over Lebanon. Jumblatt died in a 1977 assassination allegedly ordered by Syria; in 1982, Syrian agents assassinated Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel (who was helped to power by the Israelis during the 1982 Lebanon War). Jumblatt and Gemayel had resisted Assad&#x27;s attempts to dominate Lebanon. Assad caused the failure of the 1983 Lebanon–Israel agreement, and by proxy guerrilla warfare forced the Israeli Defense Forces to withdraw to southern Lebanon in 1985. Terrorism against Palestinians and Jordanian targets during the mid-1980s thwarted the rapprochement between King Hussein of Jordan and the PLO, slowing Jordanian–Israeli cooperation in the West Bank.

==== Gulf War ==== 
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Assad sided with Kuwait and considered Iraq&#x27;s aggression as a serious threat to Syria&#x27;s interests. Assad and Hussein had long detested each other, and Assad felt that Syria would be the next target of Hussein if he won in Kuwait. As a result, Syria joined the US-led coalition and sent up to 20,000 troops to defend Saudi Arabia.

== Autocracy, succession, and death ==


Assad&#x27;s first choice of successor was his brother Rifaat al-Assad, an idea he broached as early as 1980, and his brother&#x27;s coup attempt weakened the institutionalised power structure on which he based his rule. Instead of changing his policy, Assad tried to protect his power by honing his governmental model. He gave a larger role to Bassel al-Assad, who was rumored to be his father&#x27;s planned successor; this kindled jealousy within the government. 

At a 1994 military meeting, Chief of Staff Shihabi said that since Assad wanted to normalize relations with Israel, the Syrian military had to withdraw its troops from the Golan Heights. Haydar replied angrily, &quot;We have become nonentities. We were not even consulted.&quot; When he heard about Haydar&#x27;s outburst, Assad replaced Haydar as Commander of Special Forces with the Alawite Major General Ali Habib. Haydar also reportedly opposed dynastic succession, keeping his views secret until after Bassel&#x27;s death in 1994 (when Assad chose Bashar al-Assad to succeed him); he then openly criticised Assad&#x27;s succession plans.

Abdul Halim Khaddam, Syria&#x27;s foreign minister from 1970 to 1984, opposed dynastic succession on the grounds that it was not socialist. Khaddam has said that Assad never discussed his intentions about succession with members of the Regional Command. By the 1990s, the Sunni faction of the leadership was aging; the Alawites, with Assad&#x27;s help, had received new base. The Sunnis were at a disadvantage since many were opposed to any kind of dynastic succession.
After returning to Syria, Bashar al-Assad enrolled in the Homs Military Academy. He was quickly promoted to Brigadier Commander, and served for a time in the Republican Guard. He studied most military subjects, &quot;including a tank battalion commander, command and staff&quot; (the latter two of which were required for a senior command in the Syrian army). Bashar al-Assad was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1997, and to colonel in January 1999. Official sources ascribe Bashar&#x27;s rapid promotion to his &quot;overall excellence in the staff officers&#x27; course, and in the outstanding final project he submitted as part of the course for command and staff&quot;. With Bashar&#x27;s training, Assad appointed a new generation of Alawite security officers to secure his succession plans. Shihabi&#x27;s replacement by Aslan as Chief of Staff on 1 July 1998—Shihabi was considered a potential successor by the outside world—marked the end of the long security-apparatus overhaul. 
Skepticism of Assad&#x27;s dynastic-succession plan was widespread within and outside the government, with critics noting that Syria was not a monarchy. By 1998 Bashar had made inroads into the Ba&#x27;ath Party, taking over Khaddam&#x27;s Lebanon portfolio (a post he had held since the 1970s). By December 1998 Bashar al-Assad had replaced Rafiq al-Hariri, Prime Minister of Lebanon and one of Khaddam&#x27;s proteges, with Salim al-Huss. Several Assad proteges, who had served since 1970 or earlier, were dismissed from office between 1998 and 2000. They were sacked not because of disloyalty to Assad, but because Assad thought they would not fully support Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s succession. &quot;Retirees&quot; included Muhammad al-Khuli, Nassir Khayr Bek and Ali Duba. Among the new appointees (Bashar loyalists) were Bahjat Sulayman, Major General Hassan Khalil and Major General Assef Shawkat (Assad&#x27;s son-in-law).

By the late 1990s, Assad&#x27;s health had deteriorated. American diplomats said Assad had difficulty staying focused and seemed tired during their meetings; he was seen as incapable of functioning for more than two hours a day. Because of his increasing seclusion from state affairs, the government became accustomed to working without his involvement in day-to-day affairs. Nearly all of his administrative tasks and even much of the important decision making was allegedly being delegated to his daughter, Bushra, who set up her own office next to her father in the Presidential Palace. Bushra, long believed to have been Assad&#x27;s favorite child and, had it not been for her gender, preferred candidate for succession, had a negative view towards Bashar&#x27;s ability to succeed Hafez and was allegedly mounting her own attempt at amassing power to succeed him. His spokesperson ignored the speculation, and Assad&#x27;s official routine in 1999 was basically unchanged from the previous decade. Assad continued to conduct meetings, traveling abroad occasionally; he visited Moscow in July 1999. 

On 26 March 2000, Assad embarked on another rare foreign trip to Geneva to meet with American president Bill Clinton.
On 10 June 2000, at the age of 69, Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack while on the telephone with Lebanese prime minister Salim al-Huss. A period of 40 days of mourning was declared in Syria and 7 days in Lebanon thereafter. Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, Libya, Morocco, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Kuwait and Qatar announced three days of national mourning. His funeral was held three days later. 

Assad is buried with his son, Bassel, in a mausoleum in his hometown of Qardaha. After Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s death, power was transferred to his son Bashar al-Assad with the support of Ba&#x27;ath loyalists, making Syria the first Arab republic to establish a dynastic system. On 11 December 2024, after the overthrow of his son Bashar in the Syrian civil war, the rebels set fire and burned his tomb inside the mausoleum.

<text>François Duvalier (; 14 April 190721 April 1971), also known as Papa Doc, was a Haitian politician and voodooist who served as the president of Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971. He was elected president in the 1957 general election on a populist and black nationalist platform. After thwarting a military coup d&#x27;état in 1958, his regime rapidly became more autocratic and despotic. An undercover government death squad, the Tonton Macoute (), indiscriminately tortured or killed Duvalier&#x27;s opponents; the Tonton Macoute was thought to be so pervasive that Haitians became highly fearful of expressing any form of dissent, even in private. Duvalier further sought to solidify his rule by incorporating elements of Haitian mythology into a personality cult.

Prior to his rule, Duvalier graduated from the Graduate School of Public Health of the University of Michigan on a scholarship that was meant to train Black doctors from the Caribbean to take care of African-American servicemen during World War II. He acquired the nickname &quot;Papa Doc&quot;. He was unanimously &quot;re-elected&quot; in a 1961 presidential election in which he was the only candidate. Afterwards, he consolidated his power step by step, culminating in 1964 when he declared himself president for life after another sham election, and as a result, he remained in power until his death in 1971. He was succeeded by his son, Jean‑Claude, who was nicknamed &quot;Baby Doc&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Duvalier was born in Port-au-Prince in 1907, the son of Duval Duvalier and baker His aunt, Madame Florestal, raised him. He completed a degree in medicine from the University of Haiti in 1934, and served as staff physician at several local hospitals. He spent a year at the University of Michigan studying public health and in 1943, became active in a United States–sponsored campaign to control the spread of contagious tropical diseases, helping the poor to fight typhus, yaws, malaria and other tropical diseases that had ravaged Haiti for years. His patients affectionately called him &quot;Papa Doc&quot;, a moniker that he used throughout his life.

The racism and violence that occurred during the United States occupation of Haiti, which began in 1915, inspired black nationalism among Haitians and left a powerful impression on the young Duvalier. He was also aware of the latent political power of the poor black majority and their resentment against the small mulatto (black and white mixed-race) elite. Duvalier supported Pan-African ideals, and became involved in the &quot;&quot; movement of Haitian author , both of which led to his advocacy of Haitian Vodou, an ethnological study of which later paid enormous political dividends for him. In 1938, Duvalier co-founded the journal &quot;Les Griots&quot;. On 27 December 1939, he married , with whom he had four children: Marie‑Denise, Nicole, Simone, and Jean‑Claude.

==Political rise==
In 1946, Duvalier aligned himself with President Dumarsais Estimé and was appointed Director General of the National Public Health Service. In 1949, he served as Minister of Health and Labor, but when Duvalier opposed Paul Magloire&#x27;s 1950 coup d&#x27;état, he left the government and resumed practicing medicine. His practice included taking part in campaigns to prevent yaws and other diseases. In 1954, Duvalier abandoned medicine, hiding out in Haiti&#x27;s countryside from the Magloire regime. In 1956, the Magloire government was failing, and although still in hiding, Duvalier announced his candidacy to replace him as president. By December 1956, an amnesty was issued and Duvalier emerged from hiding, and on 12 December 1956, Magloire conceded defeat. 

The two frontrunners in the 1957 campaign for the presidency were Duvalier and Louis Déjoie, a mulatto landowner and industrialist from the north. During their campaigning, Haiti was ruled by five temporary administrations, none lasting longer than a few months. Duvalier promised to rebuild and renew the country and rural Haiti solidly supported him as did the military. 
He resorted to &quot;&quot; populism, stoking the majority irritation at being governed by the few mulatto elite, which is how he described his opponent, Déjoie.

François Duvalier was elected president on 22 September 1957. Duvalier received 679,884 votes to Déjoie&#x27;s 266,992. Even in this election, however, there are multiple first-hand accounts of voter fraud and voter 

==Presidency==

===Consolidation of power===
After being elected president in 1957, Duvalier exiled most of the major supporters of Déjoie. He had a new constitution adopted that year.

Duvalier promoted and installed members of the black majority in the civil service and the army. In July 1958, three exiled Haitian army officers and five American mercenaries landed in Haiti and tried to overthrow Duvalier; all were killed. Although the army and its leaders had quashed the coup attempt, the incident deepened Duvalier&#x27;s distrust of the army, an important Haitian institution over which he did not have firm control. He replaced the chief-of-staff with a more reliable officer and then proceeded to create his own power base within the army by turning the Presidential Guard into an elite corps aimed at maintaining his power. After this, Duvalier dismissed the entire general staff and replaced it with officers who owed their positions, and their loyalty, to him. 

In 1959, Duvalier created a rural militia, the &quot;&quot; (, )—commonly referred to as the after a bogeyman—to extend and bolster support for the regime in the countryside. The &quot;Macoute&quot;, which by 1961 was twice as big as the army, never developed into a real military force but was more than just a secret police.

In the early years of his rule, Duvalier was able to take advantage of the strategic weaknesses of his powerful opponents, mostly from the mulatto elite. These weaknesses included their inability to coordinate their actions against the regime, whose power had grown increasingly strong.
In the name of nationalism, Duvalier expelled almost all of Haiti&#x27;s foreign-born bishops, an act that earned him excommunication from the Catholic Church. In 1966, he persuaded the Holy See to allow him permission to nominate the Catholic hierarchy for Haiti. Duvalier now exercised more power in Haiti than ever.

===Heart attack and Barbot affair===
On 24 May 1959, Duvalier suffered a massive heart attack, possibly due to an insulin overdose; he had been a diabetic since early adulthood and also suffered from heart disease and associated circulatory problems. During the heart attack, he was comatose for His physician believed that he had suffered neurological damage during these events, harming his mental health and perhaps explaining his subsequent actions.

While recovering, Duvalier left power in the hands of Clément Barbot, leader of the . Upon his return to work, Duvalier accused Barbot of trying to supplant him as president and had him imprisoned. In April 1963, Barbot was released and began plotting to remove Duvalier from office by kidnapping his children. The plot failed and Duvalier then ordered a nationwide search for Barbot and his fellow conspirators. During the search, Duvalier was told that Barbot had transformed himself into a black dog, which prompted Duvalier to order that all black dogs in Haiti be put to death. The captured and killed Barbot in July 1963. In other incidents, Duvalier ordered the head of an executed rebel packed in ice and brought to him so he could commune with the dead man&#x27;s spirit. Peepholes were carved into the walls of the interrogation chambers, through which Duvalier watched Haitian detainees being tortured and submerged in baths of sulfuric acid; sometimes, he was in the room during the torture.

===Constitutional changes===

In 1961, Duvalier began violating the provisions of the 1957 constitution. First, he replaced the bicameral legislature with a unicameral body. Then he called a new presidential election in which he was the sole candidate, though his term was to expire in 1963 and the constitution prohibited re-election. The election was flagrantly rigged; the official tally showed a total of 1,320,748 &quot;yes&quot; votes for another term for Duvalier, with none opposed. Upon hearing the results, he proclaimed, &quot;I accept the people&#x27;s will. ... As a revolutionary, I have no right to disregard the will of the &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;Latin America has witnessed many fraudulent elections throughout its history but none has been more outrageous than the one which has just taken place in Haiti&quot;. On 14 June 1964, a constitutional referendum made Duvalier &quot;&quot;, a title previously held by seven Haitian presidents. This referendum was also blatantly rigged; an implausible 99.9% voted in favor, which should have come as no surprise since all the ballots were premarked &quot;yes&quot;. The new document granted Duvalier—or &quot;&quot;, as he was called—absolute powers as well as the right to name his successor.

===Foreign relations===

====United States====
His relationship with the United States proved difficult. In his early years, Duvalier rebuked the United States for its friendly relations with Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo (assassinated in 1961) while ignoring Haiti. The Kennedy administration (1961–1963) was particularly disturbed by Duvalier&#x27;s repressive and totalitarian rule and allegations that he misappropriated aid money, at the time a substantial part of the Haitian budget, and a U.S. Marine Corps mission to train the . The U.S. thus halted most of its economic assistance in mid-1962, pending stricter accounting procedures, with which Duvalier refused to comply. Duvalier publicly renounced all aid from Washington on nationalist grounds, portraying himself as a &quot;principled and lonely opponent of domination by a 

Duvalier misappropriated millions of dollars of international aid, including US$15 million annually from the United States. He transferred this money to personal accounts. Another of Duvalier&#x27;s methods of obtaining foreign money was to gain foreign loans, including US$4 million from 

After the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, which Duvalier later claimed resulted from a curse that he had placed on Kennedy, the U.S. eased its pressure on Duvalier, grudgingly accepting him as a bulwark against communism. Duvalier attempted to exploit tensions between the U.S. and Cuba, emphasizing his anti-communist credentials and Haiti&#x27;s strategic location as a means of winning U.S. support:

====Cuba====
After Fulgencio Batista (a friend of Duvalier) was overthrown in the Cuban Revolution, Duvalier worried that new Cuban leader Fidel Castro would provide a safe haven for Haitian dissidents.

Duvalier enraged Castro by voting against the country in an Organization of American States (OAS) meeting and subsequently at the United Nations, where a trade embargo was imposed on Cuba. Cuba answered by breaking off diplomatic relations and Duvalier subsequently instituted a campaign to rid Haiti of communists. This move severed Haitian relations with Cuba for 38 years until the two countries re-established relations in 1997.
====Dominican Republic====
Duvalier&#x27;s relationship with the neighboring Dominican Republic was always tense: in his early years, Duvalier emphasized the differences between the two countries. In April 1963, relations were brought to the edge of war by the political enmity between Duvalier and Dominican president Juan Bosch. Bosch, a leftist, provided asylum and support to Haitian exiles who had plotted against the Duvalier regime. Duvalier ordered his Presidential Guard to occupy the Dominican Embassy in Pétion-Ville, with the goal of arresting a Haitian army officer believed to have been involved in Barbot&#x27;s plot to kidnap Duvalier&#x27;s children. The Dominican president reacted with outrage, publicly threatened to invade Haiti, and ordered army units to the border. However, as Dominican military commanders expressed little support for an invasion of Haiti, Bosch refrained from the invasion and sought mediation through 
====Ethiopia====
In 1966, Duvalier hosted the Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie I, in what would be the only visit of a foreign head of state to Haiti under Duvalier. During the visit, the two discussed bilateral agreements between their two nations and the economic shortcomings brought about by international pressure. Duvalier awarded Haile Selassie the Necklace of the Order of Jean-Jacques Dessalines the Great, and the emperor, in turn, bestowed upon Duvalier the Great Necklace of the Order of the Queen of Sheba.
====Nigeria and Biafra====
During the Nigerian Civil War, Duvalier granted diplomatic recognition to Biafra during its war against Nigeria, making Haiti one of few countries that recognized Biafra. Duvalier&#x27;s decision to recognize Biafra was influenced by his anti-communist foreign policy and by Haiti&#x27;s historical connection to the Igbo people, the predominant ethnic group of Biafra.

===Internal policies===

====Repression====

Duvalier&#x27;s government was one of the most repressive in the Western Hemisphere. During his 14-year rule, he murdered and exiled numerous political opponents; estimates of those killed are as high as 60,000. Attacks on Duvalier from within the military were treated as especially serious. When bombs were detonated near the Presidential Palace in 1967, Duvalier had nineteen officers of the Presidential Guard executed in Fort Dimanche. A few days later, Duvalier gave a public speech during which he read the attendance sheet with the names of all 19 officers killed. After each name, he said &quot;absent&quot;. After reading the whole list, Duvalier remarked that &quot;all were shot&quot;.
Haitian communists and even suspected communists bore the brunt of the government&#x27;s repression. Duvalier targeted them to reassure the U.S. that he was not communist: Duvalier was exposed to communist and leftist ideas early in his life and rejected them. On 28 April 1969, Duvalier instituted a campaign to rid Haiti of all communists. A new law declared that &quot;Communist activities, no matter what their form, are hereby declared crimes against the security of the State.&quot; Those convicted of Communist activity were subject to execution, and faced having their property confiscated.

====Social and economic policies====
Duvalier employed intimidation, repression, and patronage to supplant the old mulatto elites with a new elite of his own making. Corruption—in the form of government rake-offs of industries, bribery, extortion of domestic businesses, and stolen government funds—enriched the dictator&#x27;s closest supporters. Most of them held sufficient power to intimidate the members of the old elite, who were gradually co-opted or eliminated.

Many educated professionals fled Haiti for New York City, Miami, Montreal, Paris and several French-speaking African countries, exacerbating an already serious lack of doctors and teachers. Some of the highly skilled professionals joined the ranks of several agencies to work in development in newly independent nations such as Ivory Coast and the Congo.

The government confiscated peasant landholdings and allotted them to members of the militia, who had no official salary and made their living through crime and The dispossessed fled to the slums of the capital where they would find only meager incomes to feed themselves. Malnutrition and famine became endemic.

Nonetheless, Duvalier enjoyed significant support among Haiti&#x27;s majority black rural population, who saw in him a champion of their claims against the historically dominant mulatto elite. During his 14 years in power, he created a substantial black middle class, chiefly through government patronage. Duvalier also initiated the development of , now known as Toussaint Louverture International Airport.

====Personality cult and &quot;Vodou&quot;====
Duvalier fostered his cult of personality and claimed that he was the physical embodiment of the island nation. He also revived the traditions of &quot;Vodou&quot;, later using them to consolidate his power with his claim of being a &quot;Vodou&quot; priest himself. In an effort to make himself even more imposing, Duvalier deliberately modeled his image on that of Baron Samedi, one of the &quot;lwa&quot;, or spirits, of Haitian Vodou. He often donned sunglasses in order to hide his eyes and talked with the strong nasal tone associated with the &quot;lwa&quot;. The regime&#x27;s propaganda stated that &quot;Papa Doc was one with the &quot;lwa&quot;, Jesus Christ and God himself&quot;. The most celebrated image from the time shows a standing Jesus Christ with a hand on the shoulder of a seated Papa Doc, captioned, &quot;I have chosen him&quot;. Duvalier declared himself an &quot;immaterial being&quot; as well as &quot;the Haitian flag&quot; soon after his first election. In 1964, he published a catechism in which the Lord&#x27;s Prayer was heavily reworded to praise Duvalier instead of God.

Duvalier also held in his closet the head of former opponent Blucher Philogenes, who tried to overthrow him in 1963. He believed another political enemy, Clément Barbot, was able to change at will into a black dog and had the militia begin killing black dogs on sight in the capital.

==Death and succession==
François Duvalier died of heart disease and diabetes on 21 April 1971, seven days after his 64th birthday. His 19-year-old son , nicknamed &quot;Baby Doc&quot;, succeeded him as president.

On 8 February 1986, when the Duvalier regime fell, a crowd attacked Duvalier&#x27;s mausoleum, throwing boulders at it, chipping off pieces from it, and breaking open the crypt. Duvalier&#x27;s coffin was not inside, however. A prevailing rumor in the capital, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was that his son had removed his remains upon fleeing to the U.S. Air Force in a transport plane to Paris the day before.

==Books and films==
Many books have been written about the Duvalier era in Haiti, the best known of which is Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Comedians&quot;. Duvalier, however, dismissed the piece and referred to its author as &quot;a cretin, a stool pigeon, sadistic, unbalanced, perverted, a perfect , lying to his heart&#x27;s content, the shame of proud and noble England, a spy, a drug addict, and a torturer&quot;. The book was later made into a film. Greene himself was declared &quot;&quot; and barred from entering Haiti.

Alan Whicker featured Duvalier in a 1969 episode of &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;, which included an interview with the president. Made by Yorkshire Television, the documentary is deeply revealing of Duvalier&#x27;s character and of the state of Haiti in 1969.

The first authoritative book on the subject was &quot;Papa Doc: Haiti and its Dictator&quot; by Al Burt and Bernard Diederich, published in 1969, though several others by Haitian scholars and historians have appeared since Duvalier&#x27;s death in 1971. One of the most informative, Patrick Lemoine&#x27;s &quot;Fort‑Dimanche: Dungeon of Death&quot;, dealt specifically with victims of Fort Dimanche, the prison which Duvalier used for the torture and murder of his political opponents.

In 2007, John Marquis wrote &quot;Papa Doc: Portrait of a Haitian Tyrant&quot;, which relied in part on records from a 1968 espionage trial in Haiti to detail numerous attempts on Duvalier&#x27;s life. The trial&#x27;s defendant, David Knox, was a Bahamian director of information. Knox lost and was sentenced to death, but he was later granted amnesty.

<doc id="70847" wikidata="Q899559" url="?curid=70847" title="X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy">
<text>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the very topmost 50-60 atoms, 0.01 um, 5-10 nm of any surface. It belongs to the family of photoemission spectroscopies in which electron population spectra are obtained by irradiating a material with a beam of X-rays. XPS is based on the photoelectric effect that can identify the elements that exist within a material (elemental composition) or are covering its surface, as well as their chemical state, and the overall electronic structure and density of the electronic states in the material. XPS is a powerful measurement technique because it not only shows what elements are present, but also what other elements they are bonded to. The technique can be used in line profiling of the elemental composition across the surface, or in depth profiling when paired with ion-beam etching. It is often applied to study chemical processes in the materials in their as-received state or after cleavage, scraping, exposure to heat, reactive gasses or solutions, ultraviolet light, or during ion implantation.

Chemical states are inferred from the measurement of the kinetic energy and the number of the ejected electrons. XPS requires high vacuum (residual gas pressure &quot;p&quot; ~ 10−6 Pa) or ultra-high vacuum (p &lt; 10−7 Pa) conditions, although a current area of development is ambient-pressure XPS, in which samples are analyzed at pressures of a few tens of millibar.

When laboratory X-ray sources are used, XPS easily detects all elements except hydrogen and helium. The detection limit is in the parts per thousand range, but parts per million (ppm) are achievable with long collection times and concentration at top surface.

XPS is routinely used to analyze inorganic compounds, metal alloys, polymers, elements, catalysts, glasses, ceramics, paints, papers, inks, woods, plant parts, make-up, teeth, bones, medical implants, bio-materials, coatings, viscous oils, glues, ion-modified materials and many others. Somewhat less routinely XPS is used to analyze the hydrated forms of materials such as hydrogels and biological samples by freezing them in their hydrated state in an ultrapure environment, and allowing multilayers of ice to sublime away prior to analysis.

==Basic physics==

Because the energy of an X-ray with particular wavelength is known (for Al Kα X-rays, &quot;E&quot;photon = 1486.7 eV), and because the emitted electrons&#x27; kinetic energies are measured, the electron binding energy of each of the emitted electrons can be determined by using the photoelectric effect equation,

:formula_1,

where &quot;E&quot;binding is the binding energy (BE) of the electron measured relative to the chemical potential, &quot;E&quot;photon is the energy of the X-ray photons being used, &quot;E&quot;kinetic is the kinetic energy of the electron as measured by the instrument and formula_2 is a work function-like term for the specific surface of the material, which in real measurements includes a small correction by the instrument&#x27;s work function because of the contact potential. This equation is essentially a conservation of energy equation. The work function-like term formula_2 can be thought of as an adjustable instrumental correction factor that accounts for the few eV of kinetic energy given up by the photoelectron as it gets emitted from the bulk and absorbed by the detector. It is a constant that rarely needs to be adjusted in practice.

==History==
In 1887, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz discovered but could not explain the photoelectric effect, which was later explained in 1905 by Albert Einstein (Nobel Prize in Physics 1921). Two years after Einstein&#x27;s publication, in 1907, P.D. Innes experimented with a Röntgen tube, Helmholtz coils, a magnetic field hemisphere (an electron kinetic energy analyzer), and photographic plates, to record broad bands of emitted electrons as a function of velocity, in effect recording the first XPS spectrum. Other researchers, including Henry Moseley, Rawlinson and Robinson, independently performed various experiments to sort out the details in the broad bands. After WWII, Kai Siegbahn and his research group in Uppsala (Sweden) developed several significant improvements in the equipment, and in 1954 recorded the first high-energy-resolution XPS spectrum of cleaved sodium chloride (NaCl), revealing the potential of XPS. A few years later in 1967, Siegbahn published a comprehensive study of XPS, bringing instant recognition of the utility of XPS and also the first hard X-ray photoemission experiments, which he referred to as Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA). In cooperation with Siegbahn, a small group of engineers (Mike Kelly, Charles Bryson, Lavier Faye, Robert Chaney) at Hewlett-Packard in the US, produced the first commercial monochromatic XPS instrument in 1969. Siegbahn received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1981, to acknowledge his extensive efforts to develop XPS into a useful analytical tool. In parallel with Siegbahn&#x27;s work, David Turner at Imperial College London (and later at Oxford University) developed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for molecular species using helium lamps.

==Measurement==
A typical XPS spectrum is a plot of the number of electrons detected at a specific binding energy. Each element produces a set of characteristic XPS peaks. These peaks correspond to the electron configuration of the electrons within the atoms, e.g., 1&quot;s&quot;, 2&quot;s&quot;, 2&quot;p&quot;, 3&quot;s&quot;, etc. The number of detected electrons in each peak is directly related to the amount of element within the XPS sampling volume. To generate atomic percentage values, each raw XPS signal is corrected by dividing the intensity by a &quot;relative sensitivity factor&quot; (RSF), and normalized over all of the elements detected. Since hydrogen is not detected, these atomic percentages exclude hydrogen.

===Quantitative accuracy and precision===
XPS is widely used to generate an empirical formula because it readily yields excellent quantitative accuracy from homogeneous solid-state materials. Absolute quantification requires the use of certified (or independently verified) standard samples, and is generally more challenging, and less common. Relative quantification involves comparisons between several samples in a set for which one or more analytes are varied while all other components (the sample matrix) are held constant. Quantitative accuracy depends on several parameters such as: signal-to-noise ratio, peak intensity, accuracy of relative sensitivity factors, correction for electron transmission function, surface volume homogeneity, correction for energy dependence of electron mean free path, and degree of sample degradation due to analysis. Under optimal conditions, the quantitative accuracy of the atomic percent (at%) values calculated from the major XPS peaks is 90-95% for each peak. The quantitative accuracy for the weaker XPS signals, that have peak intensities 10-20% of the strongest signal, are 60-80% of the true value, and depend upon the amount of effort used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (for example by signal averaging). Quantitative precision (the ability to repeat a measurement and obtain the same result) is an essential consideration for proper reporting of quantitative results.

===Detection limits===
Detection limits may vary greatly with the cross section of the core state of interest and the background signal level. In general, photoelectron cross sections increase with atomic number. The background increases with the atomic number of the matrix constituents as well as the binding energy, because of secondary emitted electrons. For example, in the case of gold on silicon where the high cross section Au4f peak is at a higher kinetic energy than the major silicon peaks, it sits on a very low background and detection limits of 1ppm or better may be achieved with reasonable acquisition times. Conversely for silicon on gold, where the modest cross section Si2p line sits on the large background below the Au4f lines, detection limits would be much worse for the same acquisition time. Detection limits are often quoted as 0.1–1.0 % atomic percent (0.1% = 1 part per thousand = 1000 ppm) for practical analyses, but lower limits may be achieved in many circumstances.

=== Degradation during analysis ===
Degradation depends on the sensitivity of the material to the wavelength of X-rays used, the total dose of the X-rays, the temperature of the surface and the level of the vacuum. Metals, alloys, ceramics and most glasses are not measurably degraded by either non-monochromatic or monochromatic X-rays. Some, but not all, polymers, catalysts, certain highly oxygenated compounds, various inorganic compounds and fine organics are. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources produce a significant amount of high energy Bremsstrahlung X-rays (1–15 keV of energy) which directly degrade the surface chemistry of various materials. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources also produce a significant amount of heat (100 to 200 °C) on the surface of the sample because the anode that produces the X-rays is typically only 1 to away from the sample. This level of heat, when combined with the Bremsstrahlung X-rays, acts to increase the amount and rate of degradation for certain materials. Monochromatised X-ray sources, because they are farther away (50–100 cm) from the sample, do not produce noticeable heat effects. In those, a quartz monochromator system diffracts the Bremsstrahlung X-rays out of the X-ray beam, which means the sample is only exposed to one narrow band of X-ray energy. For example, if aluminum K-alpha X-rays are used, the intrinsic energy band has a FWHM of 0.43 eV, centered on 1,486.7 eV (&quot;E&quot;/Δ&quot;E&quot; = 3,457). If magnesium K-alpha X-rays are used, the intrinsic energy band has a FWHM of 0.36 eV, centered on 1,253.7 eV (&quot;E&quot;/Δ&quot;E&quot; = 3,483). These are the intrinsic X-ray line widths; the range of energies to which the sample is exposed depends on the quality and optimization of the X-ray monochromator. Because the vacuum removes various gases (e.g., O2, CO) and liquids (e.g., water, alcohol, solvents, etc.) that were initially trapped within or on the surface of the sample, the chemistry and morphology of the surface will continue to change until the surface achieves a steady state. This type of degradation is sometimes difficult to detect.

===Measured area===
Measured area depends on instrument design. The minimum analysis area ranges from 10 to 200 micrometres. Largest size for a monochromatic beam of X-rays is 1–5 mm. Non-monochromatic beams are 10–50 mm in diameter. Spectroscopic image resolution levels of 200 nm or below has been achieved on latest imaging XPS instruments using synchrotron radiation as X-ray source.

===Sample size limits===

Instruments accept small (mm range) and large samples (cm range), e.g. wafers. The limiting factor is the design of the sample holder, the sample transfer, and the size of the vacuum chamber. Large samples are laterally moved in x and y direction to analyze a larger area. 

=== Analysis time ===
Typically ranging 1–20 minutes for a broad survey scan that measures the amount of all detectable elements, typically 1–15 minutes for high resolution scan that reveal chemical state differences (for a high signal/noise ratio for count area result often requires multiple sweeps of the region of interest), 1–4 hours for a depth profile that measures 4–5 elements as a function of etched depth (this process time can vary the most as many factors will play a role). The time to complete a measurement is generally dependent on the brilliance of the X-ray source.

==Surface sensitivity==
XPS detects only electrons that have actually escaped from the sample into the vacuum of the instrument. In order to escape from the sample, a photoelectron must travel through the sample. Photo-emitted electrons can undergo inelastic collisions, recombination, excitation of the sample, recapture or trapping in various excited states within the material, all of which can reduce the number of escaping photoelectrons. These effects appear as an exponential attenuation function as the depth increases, making the signals detected from analytes at the surface much stronger than the signals detected from analytes deeper below the sample surface. Thus, the signal measured by XPS is an exponentially surface-weighted signal, and this fact can be used to estimate analyte depths in layered materials.

==Chemical states and chemical shift==
The ability to produce chemical state information, i.e. the local bonding environment of an atomic species in question from the topmost few nanometers of the sample makes XPS a unique and valuable tool for understanding the chemistry of the surface. The local bonding environment is affected by the formal oxidation state, the identity of its nearest-neighbor atoms, and its bonding hybridization to the nearest-neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor atoms. For example, while the nominal binding energy of the C1&quot;s&quot; electron is 284.6 eV, subtle but reproducible shifts in the actual binding energy, the so-called &quot;chemical shift&quot; (analogous to NMR spectroscopy), provide the chemical state information.

Chemical-state analysis is widely used for carbon. It reveals the presence or absence of the chemical states of carbon, in approximate order of increasing binding energy, as: carbide (-C2−), silane (-Si-CH3), methylene/methyl/hydrocarbon (-CH2-CH2-, CH3-CH2-, and -CH=CH-), amine (-CH2-NH2), alcohol (-C-OH), ketone (-C=O), organic ester (-COOR), carbonate (-CO32−), monofluoro-hydrocarbon (-CFH-CH2-), difluoro-hydrocarbon (-CF2-CH2-), and trifluorocarbon (-CH2-CF3), to name but a few.

Chemical state analysis of the surface of a silicon wafer reveals chemical shifts due to different formal oxidation states, such as: n-doped silicon and p-doped silicon (metallic silicon), silicon suboxide (Si2O), silicon monoxide (SiO), Si2O3, and silicon dioxide (SiO2). An example of this is seen in the figure &quot;High-resolution spectrum of an oxidized silicon wafer in the energy range of the Si 2&quot;p&quot; signal&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
The main components of an XPS system are the source of X-rays, an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with mu-metal magnetic shielding, an electron collection lens, an electron energy analyzer, an electron detector system, a sample introduction chamber, sample mounts, a sample stage with the ability to heat or cool the sample, and a set of stage manipulators.

The most prevalent electron spectrometer for XPS is the hemispherical electron analyzer. They have high energy resolution and spatial selection of the emitted electrons. Sometimes, however, much simpler electron energy filters - the cylindrical mirror analyzers are used, most often for checking the elemental composition of the surface. They represent a trade-off between the need for high count rates and high angular/energy resolution. This type consists of two co-axial cylinders placed in front of the sample, the inner one being held at a positive potential, while the outer cylinder is held at a negative potential. Only the electrons with the right energy can pass through this setup and are detected at the end. The count rates are high but the resolution (both in energy and angle) is poor.

Electrons are detected using electron multipliers: a single channeltron for single energy detection, or arrays of channeltrons and microchannel plates for parallel acquisition. These devices consists of a glass channel with a resistive coating on the inside. A high voltage is applied between the front and the end. An incoming electron is accelerated to the wall, where it removes more electrons, in such a way that an electron avalanche is created, until a measurable current pulse is obtained.

=== Laboratory based XPS ===
In laboratory systems, either 10–30 mm beam diameter non-monochromatic Al Kα or Mg Kα anode radiation is used, or a focused 20-500 micrometer diameter beam single wavelength Al Kα monochromatised radiation. Monochromatic Al Kα X-rays are normally produced by diffracting and focusing a beam of non-monochromatic X-rays off of a thin disc of natural, crystalline quartz with a &lt;1010&gt; orientation. The resulting wavelength is 8.3386 angstroms (0.83386 nm) corresponding to a 1486.7 eV photon energy. Aluminum Kα X-rays have an intrinsic full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.43 eV, centered at 1486.7 eV (&quot;E&quot;/Δ&quot;E&quot; = 3457). For a well–optimized monochromator, the energy width of the monochromated aluminum Kα X-rays is 0.16 eV, but energy broadening in common electron energy analyzers (spectrometers) produces an ultimate energy resolution on the order of FWHM=0.25 eV which is the ultimate energy resolution of most commercial systems. Under practical conditions, high energy-resolution settings produce peak widths (FWHM) between 0.4 and 0.6 eV for various elements and some compounds. For example, in a spectrum obtained for one minute at 20 eV pass energy using monochromated aluminum Kα X-rays, the Ag 3&quot;d&quot;5/2 peak for a clean silver film or foil will typically have a FWHM of 0.45 eV. Non-monochromatic magnesium X-rays have a wavelength of 9.89 angstroms (0.989 nm) which corresponds to a photon energy of 1253 eV. The energy width of the non-monochromated X-ray is roughly 0.70 eV, which is the ultimate energy resolution of a system using non-monochromatic X-rays. Non-monochromatic X-ray sources do not use any crystal to diffract the X-rays allowing all primary X-rays lines and the full range of high-energy Bremsstrahlung X-rays (1–12 keV) to reach the surface. The ultimate energy resolution (FWHM) when using a non-monochromatic Mg Kα source is 0.9–1.0 eV, which includes some contribution from spectrometer-induced broadening.

===Synchrotron based XPS===
A breakthrough has been brought about in the last decades by the development of large scale synchrotron radiation facilities. Here, bunches of relativistic electrons kept in orbit inside a storage ring are accelerated through bending magnets or insertion devices like wigglers and undulators to produce a high brilliance and high flux photon beam. The beam is orders of magnitude more intense and better collimated than typically produced by anode-based sources. Synchrotron radiation is also tunable over a wide wavelength range, and can be made polarized in several distinct ways. This way, photon can be selected yielding optimum photoionization cross-sections for probing a particular core level. The high photon flux, in addition, makes it possible to perform XPS experiments also from low density atomic species, such as molecular and atomic adsorbates.

One of the synchrotron facilities that allows XPS measurement is Max IV synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. The Hippie beam line of this facility also allows to perform in operando Ambient Pressure X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AP-XPS9. This latter technique allows to measure samples in ambient conditions, rather than in vacuum.

== Data processing ==

===Peak identification===
The number of peaks produced by a single element varies from 1 to more than 20. Tables of binding energies that identify the shell and spin-orbit of each peak produced by a given element are included with modern XPS instruments, and can be found in various handbooks and websites. Because these experimentally determined energies are characteristic of specific elements, they can be directly used to identify experimentally measured peaks of a material with unknown elemental composition.

Before beginning the process of peak identification, the analyst must determine if the binding energies of the unprocessed survey spectrum (0-1400 eV) have or have not been shifted due to a positive or negative surface charge. This is most often done by looking for two peaks that are due to the presence of carbon and oxygen.

===Charge referencing insulators===
Charge referencing is needed when a sample suffers a charge induced shift of experimental binding energies to obtain meaningful binding energies from both wide-scan, high sensitivity (low energy resolution) survey spectra (0-1100 eV), and also narrow-scan, chemical state (high energy resolution) spectra. Charge induced shifting is normally due to a modest excess of low voltage (-1 to -20 eV) electrons attached to the surface, or a modest shortage of electrons (+1 to +15 eV) within the top 1-12 nm of the sample caused by the loss of photo-emitted electrons. If, by chance, the charging of the surface is excessively positive, then the spectrum might appear as a series of rolling hills, not sharp peaks as shown in the example spectrum.

Charge referencing is performed by adding a &quot;Charge Correction Factor&quot; to each of the experimentally measured peaks. Since various hydrocarbon species appear on all air-exposed surfaces, the binding energy of the hydrocarbon C (1s) XPS peak is used to charge correct all energies obtained from non-conductive samples or conductors that have been deliberately insulated from the sample mount. The peak is normally found between 284.5 eV and 285.5 eV. The 284.8 eV binding energy is routinely used as the reference binding energy for charge referencing insulators, so that the charge correction factor is the difference between 284.8 eV and the experimentally measured C (1s) peak position.

Conductive materials and most native oxides of conductors should never need charge referencing. Conductive materials should never be charge referenced unless the topmost layer of the sample has a thick non-conductive film. The charging effect, if needed, can also be compensated by providing suitable low energy charges to the surface by the use of low-voltage (1-20 eV) electron beam from an electron flood gun, UV lights, low-voltage argon ion beam with low-voltage electron beam (1-10 eV), aperture masks, mesh screen with low-voltage electron beams, etc.

===Peak-fitting===
The process of peak-fitting high energy resolution XPS spectra is a mixture of scientific knowledge and experience. The process is affected by instrument design, instrument components, experimental settings and sample variables. Before starting any peak-fit effort, the analyst performing the peak-fit needs to know if the topmost 15 nm of the sample is expected to be a homogeneous material or is expected to be a mixture of materials. If the top 15 nm is a homogeneous material with only very minor amounts of adventitious carbon and adsorbed gases, then the analyst can use theoretical peak area ratios to enhance the peak-fitting process. Peak fitting results are affected by overall peak widths (at half maximum, FWHM), possible chemical shifts, peak shapes, instrument design factors and experimental settings, as well as sample properties:

* The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are useful indicators of chemical state changes and physical influences. Their increase may indicate a change in the number of chemical bonds, a change in the sample condition (x-ray damage) or differential charging of the surface (localised differences in the charge state of the surface). However, the FWHM also depends on the detector, and can also increase due to the sample getting charged. When using high energy resolution experiment settings on an XPS equipped with a monochromatic Al K-alpha X-ray source, the FWHM of the major XPS peaks range from 0.3 eV to 1.7 eV. The following is a simple summary of FWHM from major XPS signals: Main metal peaks (e.g. 1s, 2p3, 3d5, 4f7) from pure metals have FWHMs that range from 0.30 eV to 1.0 eV Main metal peaks (e.g. 1s, 2p3, 3d5, 4f7) from binary metal oxides have FWHMs that range from 0.9 eV to 1.7 eV The O (1s) peak from binary metal oxides have FWHMs that, in general, range from 1.0 eV to 1.4 eV The C (1s) peak from adventitious hydrocarbons have FWHMs that, in general, range from 1.0 eV to 1.4 eV
* Chemical shift values depend on the degree of electron bond polarization between nearest-neighbor atoms. A specific chemical shift is the difference in BE values of one specific chemical state versus the BE of one form of the pure element, or of a particular agreed-upon chemical state of that element. Component peaks derived from peak-fitting a raw chemical state spectrum can be assigned to the presence of different chemical states within the sampling volume of the sample.
* Peak shapes depend on instrument parameters, experimental parameters and sample characteristics.
* Instrument design factors include linewidth and purity of X-rays used (monochromatic Al, non-monochromatic Mg, Synchrotron, Ag, Zr), as well as properties of the electron analyzer.
* Settings of the electron analyzer (e.g. pass energy, step size)
* Sample factors that affect the peak fitting are the number of physical defects within the analysis volume (from ion etching, or laser cleaning), and the very physical form of the sample (single crystal, polished, powder, corroded)

==Theoretical aspects==

===Quantum mechanical treatment===

When a photoemission event takes place, the following energy conservation rule holds:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the photon energy, formula_6 is the electron BE (binding energy with respect to the vacuum level) prior to ionization, and formula_7 is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. If reference is taken with respect to the Fermi level (as it is typically done in photoelectron spectroscopy) formula_6 must be replaced by the sum of the binding energy (BE) relative to the Fermi level, formula_9, and the sample work function, formula_10 .

From the theoretical point of view, the photoemission process from a solid can be described with a semiclassical approach, where the electromagnetic field is still treated classically, while a quantum-mechanical description is used for matter.
The one—particle Hamiltonian for an electron subjected to an electromagnetic field is given by:

:formula_11,

where formula_12 is the electron wave function, formula_13 is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field and formula_14 is the unperturbed potential of the solid.
In the Coulomb gauge (formula_15), the vector potential commutes with the momentum operator 
(formula_16), so that the expression in brackets in the Hamiltonian simplifies to:

:formula_17

Actually, neglecting the formula_18 term in the Hamiltonian, we are disregarding possible photocurrent contributions. Such effects are generally negligible in the bulk, but may become important at the surface.
The quadratic term in formula_13 can be instead safely neglected, since its contribution in a typical photoemission experiment is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the first term .

In first-order perturbation approach, the one-electron Hamiltonian can be split into two terms, an unperturbed Hamiltonian formula_20, plus an interaction Hamiltonian formula_21, which describes the effects of the electromagnetic field:

:formula_22

In time-dependent perturbation theory, for an harmonic or constant perturbation, the transition rate between the initial state formula_23 and the final state formula_24 is expressed by Fermi&#x27;s Golden Rule:

:formula_25,

where formula_26 and formula_27 are the eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian in the initial and final state, respectively, and formula_5 is the photon energy. Fermi&#x27;s Golden Rule uses the approximation that the perturbation acts on the system for an infinite time. This approximation is valid when the time that the perturbation acts on the system is much larger than the time needed for the transition. It should be understood that this equation needs to be integrated with the density of states formula_29 which gives:

:formula_30

In a real photoemission experiment the ground state core electron BE cannot be directly probed, because the measured BE 
incorporates both initial state and final state effects, and the spectral linewidth is broadened owing to the finite core-hole lifetime (formula_31).

Assuming an exponential decay probability for the core hole in the time domain (formula_32), the spectral function will have a Lorentzian shape, with a FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) formula_33 given by:

:formula_34

From the theory of Fourier transforms, formula_33 and formula_31 are linked by the indeterminacy relation:

formula_37

The photoemission event leaves the atom in a highly excited core ionized state, from which it can decay radiatively (fluorescence) or non-radiatively (typically by &quot;Auger&quot; decay).
Besides Lorentzian broadening, photoemission spectra are also affected by a Gaussian broadening, whose contribution can be expressed by

:formula_38

Three main factors enter the Gaussian broadening of the spectra: the experimental energy resolution, vibrational and inhomogeneous broadening.
The first effect is caused by the non perfect monochromaticity of the photon beam -which results in a finite bandwidth- and by the limited resolving power of the analyzer. The vibrational component is produced by the excitation of low energy vibrational modes both in the initial and in the final state. Finally, inhomogeneous broadening can originate from the presence of unresolved core level components in the spectrum.

===Theory of core level photoemission of electrons===
====Inelastic mean free path====
In a solid, inelastic scattering events also contribute to the photoemission process, generating electron-hole pairs which show up as an inelastic tail on the high BE side of the main photoemission peak. In fact this allows the calculation of electron inelastic mean free path (IMFP). This can be modeled based on the Beer–Lambert law, which states
:formula_39
where formula_40 is the IMFP and formula_41 is the axis perpendicular to the sample. In fact it is generally the case that the IMFP is only weakly material dependent, but rather strongly dependent on the photoelectron kinetic energy. Quantitatively we can relate formula_42 to IMFP by
:formula_43
where formula_44 is the mean atomic diameter as calculated by the density so formula_45. The above formula was developed by Seah and Dench.

====Plasmonic effects====
In some cases, energy loss features due to plasmon excitations are also observed. This can either be a final state effect caused by core hole decay, which generates quantized electron wave excitations in the solid (intrinsic plasmons), or it can be due to excitations induced by photoelectrons travelling from the emitter to the surface (extrinsic plasmons).
Due to the reduced coordination number of first-layer atoms, the plasma frequency of bulk and surface atoms are related by the following equation: 
:formula_46,
so that surface and bulk plasmons can be easily distinguished from each other.
Plasmon states in a solid are typically localized at the surface, and can strongly affect IMFP.

====Vibrational effects====
Temperature-dependent atomic lattice vibrations, or phonons, can broaden the core level components and attenuate the interference patterns in an X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) experiment. The simplest way to account for vibrational effects is by multiplying the scattered single-photoelectron wave function formula_47 by the Debye–Waller factor:
:formula_48,
where formula_49 is the squared magnitude of the wave vector variation caused by scattering,
and formula_50 is the temperature-dependent one-dimensional vibrational mean squared displacement of the formula_51 emitter. In the Debye model, the mean squared displacement is calculated in terms of the Debye temperature, formula_52, as:
:formula_53

<text>John Kinzie (December 23, 1763 – June 6, 1828) was a fur trader from Quebec who first operated in Detroit and what became the Northwest Territory of the United States. A partner of William Burnett from Canada, about 1802-1803 Kinzie moved with his wife and child to Chicago, where they were among the first permanent white non-indigenous settlers. Kinzie Street (400N) in Chicago is named for him. Their daughter Ellen Marion Kinzie, born in 1805, was not the first child of European descent born in the settlement. That title goes to Eulalia Pelletier, the granddaughter of Chicago&#x27;s first permanent non-indigenous settler, Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable.

In 1812 Kinzie murdered Jean La Lime, who worked as an interpreter at Fort Dearborn in Chicago. This was known as &quot;the first murder in Chicago&quot;.

During the War of 1812, when living in Detroit, Kinzie was accused of treason by the British and imprisoned on a ship for transport to Great Britain. After escaping, he returned to American territory, settling again in Chicago by 1816. He lived there the rest of his years.

==Early life and first family==
Kinzie was born in Quebec City, Canada (then in the Colonial Province of Quebec) to John and Anne McKenzie, Scots-Irish immigrants. His father died before Kinzie was a year old, and his mother remarried. In 1773, the boy was apprenticed to George Farnham, a silversmith. Some of the jewelry created by Kinzie has been found in archaeological digs in Ohio.

By 1777, Kinzie had become a trader in Detroit, where he worked for William Burnett. As a trader, he became familiar with local Native American peoples and likely learned the dominant language. He developed trading at the Kekionga, a center of the Miami people.

In 1785, Kinzie helped rescue two American citizens, sisters, who had been kidnapped in 1775 from Virginia by the Shawnee and adopted into the tribe. One of the girls, Margaret McKinzie, married him; her sister Elizabeth married his companion Clark. Margaret lived with Kinzie in Detroit and had three children with him. After several years, she left Kinzie and Detroit and returned to Virginia with their children. All three of the Kinzie children eventually moved as adults to Chicago.

In 1789, Kinzie lost his business in the Kekionga (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana) and had to move further from the western U.S. frontier. The US was excluding Canadians from trade with the Native Americans in their territory. As the United States settlers continued to populate its western territory, Kinzie moved further west.

==Marriage and move to Chicago==

On March 10, 1798, Kinzie married again, to Eleanor Lytle McKillip. By the time they moved to Chicago, about 1802–1804, they had a year-old son, John. Eleanor bore him three more children in Chicago: Ellen Marion (born in 1805), Maria Indiana (1807), and Robert Allen (1810).

In 1804 Kinzie purchased the former house and lands of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, located near the mouth of the Chicago River. That same year, Governor William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory appointed Kinzie as a justice of the peace.

==War of 1812==
After American citizens built Fort Dearborn, Kinzie&#x27;s influence and reputation rose in the area; he was useful because of his relationship with the Native Americans. The War of 1812 began between Great Britain and the United States, and tensions rose on the northern frontier.

In June 1812, Kinzie killed Jean La Lime, who worked as an interpreter at Fort Dearborn. He fled to Milwaukee, then in Indian territory. While in Milwaukee, he met with pro-British Indians who were planning attacks on American settlements, including Chicago. Historians speculate that La Lime may have been informed on corruption related to purchasing supplies within the fort and thus been silenced. The case has been called &quot;Chicago&#x27;s first murder.&quot; It has been also proposed the Kinzie attempted to cover up his family&#x27;s early real estate transactions, substituting Francis May as the original owner (who died after eating at the son&#x27;s [James] home).

Although worried that Chicago would be on heightened alert, a force of as many as 500 Indians attacked the small garrison of soldiers, their support, and their families near the current intersection of 18th and Calumet, as they fled south along the lakeshore after evacuated the Fort. The Fort Dearborn attack took place on August 15, 1812, and left 53 dead, including women and children. Kinzie and his family, aided by Potawatomi Indians led by Billy Caldwell, escaped unharmed and returned to Detroit. Identifying as a British subject, Kinzie had a strong anti-American streak.

In 1813, the British arrested Kinzie and Jean Baptiste Chardonnay, also then living in Detroit, charging them with treason. They were accused of having corresponded with the enemy (the American General Harrison&#x27;s army) while supplying gunpowder to chief Tecumseh&#x27;s Indian forces, who were fighting alongside the British. Chardonnay escaped, but Kinzie was imprisoned on a ship for transport to England. When the ship was put into port in Nova Scotia to weather a storm, Kinzie escaped. He returned to American-held Detroit by 1814.

Although he had previously been a British subject, Kinzie switched to the United States. He returned to Chicago with his family in 1816 and lived there until his death in 1828.

During the 1820s, Kinzie served as a justice of the peace for the newly created Pike County, which at the time extended from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan.

==Death and legacy==

Kinzie suffered a stroke on June 6, 1828, and died a few hours later. Originally buried at the Fort Dearborn Cemetery, Kinzie&#x27;s remains were moved to City Cemetery in 1835. When the cemetery was closed due to concerns it could contaminate the city&#x27;s water supply, Kinzie&#x27;s remains were moved to Graceland Cemetery.

*In 1837, Kinzie&#x27;s son John H. Kinzie ran for the position of the first mayor of Chicago, losing to William Butler Ogden. He subsequently unsuccessfully ran twice more, in 1845 and in 1847.
*Maria Kinzie, a granddaughter, married George H. Steuart, a captain in the US cavalry from Maryland. He later served as a general in the Confederate Army.
*His great-granddaughter, Juliette Gordon Low, was the founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA.

<text>William Stephen Ian Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw (28 June 1918 – 1 July 1999) was a British Conservative Party politician who served in a wide number of Cabinet positions, most notably as Home Secretary from 1979 to 1983 and as &quot;&quot; Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1988. He was Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1991.

After the Conservative Party won an unexpected victory at the 1970 general election, Whitelaw was appointed as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council by Prime Minister Edward Heath. After the suspension of the Stormont Parliament resulted in the imposition of direct rule, Whitelaw served as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1972 to 1973. He also served under Heath as Secretary of State for Employment from 1973 to 1974 and as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1974 to 1975. 

Whitelaw served Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher throughout her leadership of the Conservative Party as deputy party leader. He served as &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister between 1979 and 1988 and as Home Secretary from 1979 to 1983. He stepped down as a Member of Parliament at the 1983 general election, and was appointed as a Member of the House of Lords. He served as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council from 1983 to 1988. He was a captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.

==Early life==
Whitelaw was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised at the family home, &quot;Monklands&quot;, on Thurlow Road in Nairn. He never met his father, William Alexander Whitelaw, born 1892, a member of a Scottish family of the landed gentry, who died in 1919 after service in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in the First World War, when his son was still a baby. Whitelaw was brought up by his mother, Helen, a daughter of Major General Francis Russell, MP for Cheltenham and a military attaché, and his paternal grandfather William Whitelaw (1868–1946), of Gartshore, Dunbartonshire, an Old Harrovian who had been educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, a landowner, briefly Conservative MP for Perth, 1892–1895, and chairman of the London and North-Eastern Railway Company. One of his great-aunts by marriage, born Dorothy Sarah Disraeli, was the niece of former Prime Minister and author Benjamin Disraeli.

Whitelaw was educated first at Wixenford School, Wokingham, before passing the entrance exam to Winchester College. From there he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a blue for golf and joined the Officer Training Corps. By chance he was in a summer camp in 1939 on the outbreak of the Second World War and was granted a regular, not wartime, commission in the British Army, in the Scots Guards, later serving in the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, a separate unit from the Guards Armoured Division. He commanded Churchill tanks in Normandy during the Second World War and during Operation Bluecoat in late July 1944. His was the first Allied unit to encounter German &quot;Jagdpanther&quot; tank destroyers, being attacked by three out of the twelve Jagdpanthers which were in Normandy.

The battalion&#x27;s second-in-command was killed when his tank was hit in front of Whitelaw&#x27;s eyes; Whitelaw succeeded to this position, holding it, with the rank of major, throughout the advance through the Netherlands into Germany and until the end of the war. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions at Caumont; a photograph of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery pinning the medal to his chest appears in his memoirs. After the end of the war in Europe, Whitelaw&#x27;s unit was to have taken part in the invasion of Japan, but the Pacific War ended before this. Instead he was posted to Palestine, before leaving the army in 1946 to take care of the family estates of Gartshore and Woodhall in Lanarkshire, which he inherited on the death of his grandfather.

==Political career==
Following early defeats as a candidate for the constituency of East Dunbartonshire in 1950 and 1951, Whitelaw was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Penrith and the Border at the 1955 general election and represented that constituency for 28 years. He held his first government posts under Harold Macmillan as a Lord of the Treasury (government whip) between 1961 and 1962 and then under Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour between 1962 and 1964. After the Conservatives lost the 1964 election, Douglas-Home appointed Whitelaw as Opposition Chief Whip. He was sworn of the Privy Council in January 1967.

===Heath government, 1970–1974===
When the Conservatives returned to power in 1970 under Edward Heath, Whitelaw was made Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, with a seat in the cabinet. Upon the imposition of direct rule in March 1972, he became the first Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, serving in that capacity until November 1973. During his time in Northern Ireland he introduced Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners. He attempted to negotiate with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, meeting its Chief of Staff Seán Mac Stiofáin in July 1972. The talks ended in an agreement to change from a seven-day truce to an open-ended truce; however, this did not last long. As a briefing for prime minister Heath later noted, Whitelaw &quot;found the experience of meeting and talking to Mr Mac Stíofáin very unpleasant&quot;. Mac Stiofáin in his memoir complimented Whitelaw, saying he was the only Englishman ever to pronounce his name in Irish correctly.

In 1973, Whitelaw left Northern Ireland—shortly before the Sunningdale Agreement was reached—to become Secretary of State for Employment, and confronted the National Union of Mineworkers over its pay demands. This dispute was followed by the Conservative Party losing the February 1974 general election. Also in 1974, Whitelaw became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

===In opposition, 1974–1979===
Soon after Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party returned to government, Heath appointed Whitelaw as deputy leader of the opposition and chairman of the Conservative Party. Following a second defeat in the October 1974 general election, during which Whitelaw had accused Wilson of going &quot;round and round the country stirring up apathy&quot;, Heath was forced to call a leadership election in 1975. Whitelaw loyally refused to run against Heath; however, and to widespread surprise, Margaret Thatcher narrowly defeated Heath in the first round. Whitelaw stood in his place and lost convincingly against Thatcher in the second round. The vote polarised along right–left lines, with in addition the region, experience and education of the MP having their effects.

Whitelaw managed to maintain his position as deputy leader until the 1979 general election, when he was appointed Home Secretary. In an unofficial capacity, he also served as Deputy Prime Minister in Thatcher&#x27;s new government.

===Home Secretary, 1979–1983===
Thatcher admired Whitelaw and appointed him Home Secretary in her first Cabinet, later writing of him &quot;Willie is a big man in character as well as physically. He wanted the success of the Government which from the first he accepted would be guided by my general philosophy. Once he had pledged his loyalty, he never withdrew it&quot;. Thatcher was rumoured to have said that &quot;every Prime Minister needs a Willie&quot; and Whitelaw was seen as Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister between 1979 and 1988 (though he never formally held the office), to the extent that the then Cabinet Secretary, Robert Armstrong, said that had Thatcher been killed in the Brighton hotel bombing, he thought he would have advised Queen Elizabeth II to send for Whitelaw.

As home secretary, Whitelaw adopted a hard-line approach to law and order. He improved police pay and embarked upon a programme of extensive prison building. His four-year tenure in office, however, was generally perceived as a troubled one. His much vaunted &quot;short, sharp shock&quot; policy, whereby convicted young offenders were detained in secure units and subjected to quasi-military discipline, won approval from the public but proved expensive to implement. He was home secretary during the six-day Iranian Embassy siege in April–May 1980.

In March 1981, he approved Wolverhampton Metropolitan Borough Council&#x27;s 14-day ban on political marches in the borough in response to a planned National Front demonstration there.

Inner city decay, unemployment and what was perceived at the time as heavy-handed policing of ethnic minorities (notably the application of what some called the &quot;notorious&quot; sus law) sparked major riots in London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Leeds, and a spate of disturbances elsewhere. The Provisional IRA escalated its bombing campaign in England.

He contemplated resigning after an intruder broke into the Queen&#x27;s bedroom in 1982 but was dissuaded from doing so. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t do without Willie,&quot; Margaret Thatcher reflected in later years. &quot;He was a wonderful person.&quot;

===Leader of the House of Lords, 1983–1988===
Two days after the 1983 general election, Whitelaw received a hereditary peerage (the first created for 18 years) as Viscount Whitelaw, of Penrith in the County of Cumbria. Thatcher appointed him Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords. Lord Whitelaw faced many challenges in attempting to manage the House of Lords, facing a major defeat over abolition of the Greater London Council within a year of taking over. However, his patrician and moderate style appealed to Conservative peers and his tenure is considered a success.

During his period as her deputy and as Leader of the Lords, Thatcher relied on Whitelaw heavily; she famously announced that &quot;every prime minister needs a Willie&quot;. He chaired the &quot;star chamber&quot; committee that settled the annual disputes between the limited resources made available by Treasury and the spending demands of other government departments. It was Whitelaw, in November 1980, who managed to dissuade Thatcher from going to Leeds to take charge of the Yorkshire Ripper investigation personally.

===Resignation===
Following a stroke in December 1987, he felt he had no choice but to resign. Nicholas Ridley argued that Whitelaw&#x27;s retirement marked the beginning of the end of the Thatcher premiership, as he was no longer around as often to give sensible advice and to moderate her stance on issues, or to maintain a consensus of support in her own Cabinet and parliamentary party. He resigned from the Cabinet on 10 January 1988.

==Marriage and children==
Whitelaw was married in 1943 to Cecilia Doriel Sprot (later Celia, Viscountess Whitelaw) (1917-2011), a philanthropist, charity worker and horticulturist who had been an ATS volunteer during the Second World War. They had four daughters:

* The Hon Elizabeth Susan Whitelaw (born 2 November 1944), married Nicholas Cunliffe-Lister, 3rd Earl of Swinton, mother of Mark Cunliffe-Lister, 4th Earl of Swinton.
* The Hon Carolyn Meliora Whitelaw (born 1946)
* The Hon Mary Cecilia Whitelaw (born 15 November 1947)
* The Hon Pamela Winifred Whitelaw (born 9 March 1951)

==Retirement and death==

During his retirement and until his death, Whitelaw was the chairman of the board of Governors at St Bees School, Cumbria. He was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1990. He formally resigned as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party in 1991; a farewell dinner was held in his honour on 7 August 1991.

After several years of declining health, Whitelaw died from natural causes at Ennim, his home in Blencow, on 1 July 1999, shortly after his 81st birthday. He had been married for 56 years. Although Whitelaw was given a hereditary peerage, the title became extinct on his death as his daughters were unable to inherit. His home for many years was the mansion of Ennim, just outside the village of Great Blencow near Penrith, Cumbria. He was buried at St. Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church, Dacre, Cumbria. Whitelaw was an active freemason.

<doc id="70850" wikidata="Q478250" url="?curid=70850" title="Smith of Wootton Major">
<text>Smith of Wootton Major, first published in 1967, is a novella by J. R. R. Tolkien. It tells the tale of a Great Cake, baked for the once in twenty-four year Feast of Good Children. The Master Cook, Nokes, hides some trinkets in the cake for the children to find; one is a star he found in an old spice box. A boy, Smith, swallows the star. On his tenth birthday the star appears on his forehead, and he starts to roam the Land of Faery. After twenty-four years the Feast comes around again, and Smith surrenders the star to Alf, the new Master Cook. Alf bakes the star into a new Great Cake for another child to find.

Scholars have differed on whether the story is an allegory or is, less tightly, capable of various allegorical interpretations; and if so, what those interpretations might be. Suggestions have included autobiographical allusions such as to Tolkien&#x27;s profession of philology, and religious interpretations such as that Alf is a figure of Christ. The American scholar Verlyn Flieger sees it instead as a story of Faërie in its own right.

This was Tolkien&#x27;s last major work published before his death in 1973.

== Background ==

J. R. R. Tolkien was a scholar of English literature, a philologist and medievalist interested in language and poetry from the Middle Ages, especially that of Anglo-Saxon England and Northern Europe.

&quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; began as an attempt to explain the meaning of Faery by means of a story about a cook and his cake, and Tolkien originally thought to call it &quot;The Great Cake&quot;. It was intended to be part of a preface by Tolkien to George MacDonald&#x27;s fairy story &quot;The Golden Key&quot;.

== Plot summary ==

The village of Wootton Major was well known around the countryside for its annual festivals, which were particularly famous for their culinary delights. The biggest festival of all was the Feast of Good Children. This festival was celebrated only once every twenty-four years: twenty-four children of the village were invited to a party, and the highlight of the party was the Great Cake, a career milestone by which Master Cooks were judged. In the year the story begins, the Master Cook was Nokes, who had landed the position more or less by default; he delegated much of the creative work to his apprentice Alf. Nokes crowned his Great Cake with a little doll jokingly representing the Queen of Faery. Various trinkets were hidden in the cake for the children to find; one of these was a star the Cook discovered in the old spice box.

The star was not found at the Feast, but was swallowed by a blacksmith&#x27;s son. The boy did not feel its magical properties at once, but on the morning of his tenth birthday the star fixed itself on his forehead, and became his passport to Faery. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith like his father, but in his free time he roamed the Land of Faery. The star on his forehead protected him from many of the dangers threatening mortals in that land, and the Folk of Faery called him &quot;Starbrow&quot;. The book describes his many travels in Faery, until at last he meets the true Queen of Faery. The identity of the King is also revealed.

The time came for another Feast of Good Children. Smith had possessed his gift for most of his life, and the time had come to pass it on to some other child. So he regretfully surrendered the star to Alf, and with it his adventures into Faery. Alf, who had become Master Cook long before, baked it into the festive cake once again for another child to find. After the feast, Alf retired and left the village; and Smith returned to his forge to teach his craft to his now-grown son.

== Publication history ==

The story was first published in the United Kingdom as a stand-alone book by George Allen &amp; Unwin on 9 November 1967, with 11 black and white illustrations and a coloured jacket illustration by Pauline Baynes. Tolkien had asked Baynes to limit her palette to black and white, as she had done for &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;; he was pleased with the result.

&quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; was first published in the United States by Houghton Mifflin the same year. It was reprinted in 1969 by Ballantine together with &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;.

The 2005 edition, edited by Verlyn Flieger, includes a previously unpublished essay by Tolkien, explaining the background and just why the elf-king spent so long in Wootton Major. It also explains how the story grew from this first idea into the published version.

The story was republished in 2021 together with &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, and &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; as &quot;Tales from the Perilous Realm&quot;.

== Analysis ==

=== Allegory ===

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that &quot;defeat hangs heavy&quot; in the story, while Tolkien called it &quot;an old man&#x27;s book&quot;, with presage of bereavement. Shippey adds that when Tolkien presents images of himself in his writings, as with Niggle, the anti-hero of &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; and Smith, there is &quot;a persistent streak of alienation&quot;. While Tolkien had stated that the story was &quot;not &#x27;allegory&#x27;&quot;, he had immediately added &quot;though it is capable of course of allegorical interpretation at certain points&quot;. Shippey presents evidence in support of the claim.

=== Capable of allegorical interpretation ===

Josh B. Long, in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, states that for Tolkien, &quot;allegorical interpretation&quot; was not the same as allegory, as interpretations come from a free interchange between text and reader, whereas allegory is imposed by the author. Long sees both religious &quot;undertones&quot; in the story, and autobiographical elements. He notes that the Catholic writer Joseph Pearce took the story as a parable, and that Flieger accepts &quot;a level of allegory&quot; but not the philological version proposed by Shippey. Instead, the Hall would be the church, Cook would be the parson, and cooking would be &quot;personal religion&quot;. Or, Matthew Dickerson and Jonathan Evans suggest, Alf is a figure of Christ, the king of a heavenly realm who arrives as a child and grows to be a man. Martin Sternberg sees the story as religious, with experiences of the numinous and &quot;traditional mystical ideas and motifs&quot;.

Long presents his own religious interpretation, likening the story&#x27;s Faery Queen to the Virgin Mary, with the lilies &quot;near the lawn&quot; as her symbol; Alf as Christ; the Great Cake perhaps as a Twelfth-cake for Epiphany; Nokes as a fool or &quot;a kind of anti-Tolkien&quot;; Smith, a &quot;lay Christian&quot;.

In addition, Long sees Shippey&#x27;s identification of birch and oak with philology and criticism as correct, but differs about what Tolkien wanted to say here. In Long&#x27;s view, the birch &quot;represents the sharp critique of most of his philological colleagues who supposed that Tolkien had squandered years of his life on a worthless piece of fantasy literature—a place he didn’t belong, or so they thought.&quot; In other words, he writes, the dispute was inside the philological community; far from fighting literary criticism, Tolkien had done much to heal the split between the critics and the philologists at Oxford.

=== Visit to Faërie ===

Flieger opposes viewing &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; as an allegory, instead seeking comparisons with Tolkien&#x27;s other fantasies. She argues that the story had sufficient &quot;bounce&quot; that no allegorical explanation was necessary, and indeed that such explanation detracts from the story of travels in the land of &quot;Faery&quot; and the element of mystery. She likens the &quot;first Cook&quot; to a whole series of &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s far-traveled characters&quot;, namely Alboin Errol, Edwin Lowdham, Frodo Baggins, Eärendil, Ælfwine-Eriol &quot;and of course Tolkien himself—all the Elf-friends.&quot; 

Further, Flieger sees &quot;thematic connections&quot; between the story and the &quot;dark power and ... echoes of a past too deep to forget&quot; of his poem &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot; (1962, with a history going back to his 1934 &quot;Looney&quot;). The two works share a distinctive feature: a &quot;prohibition against the return to Faërie.&quot; She states, however, that the two works describe the prohibition in differing moods and at different times. &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot; was written at the beginning of Tolkien&#x27;s career, &quot;cry[ing] for lost beauty&quot;; &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; almost at its end, &quot;an autumnal acceptance of things as they are&quot;. She comments, too, that &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot; could be a &quot;corrective&quot; reply to J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1920 play &quot;Mary Rose&quot;; and that &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; could then be a reply, much later, to his own poem. Whether or not that was the intention, she writes, Tolkien sought to &quot;create a true fairy-tale quality without the use of a traditional fairy-tale plot.&quot;

<doc id="70854" wikidata="Q3640063" url="?curid=70854" title="Billy Wright (loyalist)">
<text>William Stephen Wright (7 July 1960 – 27 December 1997), known as King Rat, was a Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary leader who founded the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) during The Troubles. Wright had joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in his home town of Portadown around 1975. After spending several years in prison, he became a Protestant fundamentalist preacher. Wright resumed his UVF activities around 1986 and, in the early 1990s, replaced Robin Jackson as commander of that organisation&#x27;s Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Wright was involved in the sectarian killings of up to 20 Catholics but was never convicted for any.

In 1994, the UVF and other paramilitary groups called a ceasefire. Wright became a staunch opponent of the Northern Ireland peace process, seeing it as a sell-out to Irish nationalists and republicans. Wright drew media attention during the Drumcree standoffs of 1995 and 1996, when he supported the Protestant Orange Order&#x27;s demand to march their traditional route through the Catholic district of Portadown.

During the July 1996 Drumcree crisis, Wright&#x27;s unit carried out several attacks, including a sectarian murder. For breaking the ceasefire, Wright&#x27;s Portadown unit was stood down by the UVF leadership. He was expelled from the UVF and threatened with assassination unless he immediately left Northern Ireland. Wright ignored these threats and formed the LVF with most of his brigade, becoming its leader. The LVF carried out a string of killings of Catholic civilians, while allegedly profiting from extortion and narcotics trafficking.

In January 1997, Wright was arrested for making death threats against a woman, and that March was convicted and sent to the Maze Prison. While imprisoned, Wright continued to direct the LVF. On 27 December 1997, Wright was assassinated by Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners with a gun smuggled into the prison. An inquiry into Wright&#x27;s death concluded that serious failings had been shown in the prison authorities. It has been alleged that Wright was a police informant who received help from the Special Branch.

==Early life==
William Stephen &quot;Billy&quot; Wright, named after his grandfather, was born in Wolverhampton, England on 7 July 1960 to David Wright and Sarah McKinley, Ulster Protestants from Portadown, Northern Ireland. He was the only son of five children. Before Wright&#x27;s birth, his parents had moved to England when they fell out with many of their neighbours after his grandfather had challenged tradition by running as an Independent Unionist candidate and defeated the local Official Unionist MP. The Wright family had a long tradition in Northern Ireland politics; Billy&#x27;s great-grandfather Robert Wright had once served as a Royal Commissioner. His father found employment in the West Midlands industrial city of Wolverhampton.

In 1964, the family returned to Northern Ireland and Wright soon came under the influence of his maternal uncle Cecil McKinley, a member of the Orange Order. About three years later, Wright&#x27;s parents separated and his mother decided to leave her children behind when she transferred once more to England. None of the Wright siblings would ever see their mother again. Wright and his four sisters (Elizabeth, Jackie, Angela and Connie) were placed in foster care by the welfare authorities. He was raised separately from his sisters in a children&#x27;s home in Mountnorris, South Armagh (a predominantly Irish republican area). Wright was brought up in the Presbyterian religion of his mother and attended church twice on Sundays. The young Wright mixed with Catholics and played Gaelic football, indicating an amicable relationship with the local Catholic, nationalist population. His family were not extreme Ulster loyalists. Wright&#x27;s father, while campaigning for an inquest into his son&#x27;s death, later described loyalist killings as &quot;abhorrent&quot;. Two of Wright&#x27;s sisters married Catholic men, one having come from County Tipperary and whom Wright liked. Wright&#x27;s sister Angela maintained that he personally got on well with Catholics, and that he was only anti-Irish republican and anti-IRA. For a while David Wright cohabitated with Kathleen McVeigh, a Catholic from Garvagh.

Whilst attending Markethill High School, Wright took a part-time job as a farm labourer where he came into contact with a number of staunchly unionist and loyalist farmers who served with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Reserve or the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The conflict known as the Troubles had been raging across Northern Ireland for about five years by this stage, and many young men such as Wright were swept up in the maelstrom of violence as the Provisional IRA ramped up its bombing campaign and sectarian killings of Catholics by loyalists continued to escalate. During this time Wright&#x27;s opinions moved towards loyalism and soon he got into trouble for writing the initials &quot;UVF&quot; on a local Catholic primary school wall. When he refused to clean off the vandalism, Wright was transferred from the area and sent to live with an aunt in Portadown.

==Early years in the UVF==

In the more strongly loyalist environment of Portadown, nicknamed the &quot;Orange Citadel&quot;, Wright was, along with other working-class Protestant teenagers in the area, targeted by the loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) as a potential recruit. On 31 July 1975, coincidentally the night following the Miami Showband killings, Wright was sworn in as a member of the Young Citizen Volunteers (YCV), the UVF&#x27;s youth wing. The ceremony was conducted by swearing on the Bible placed on a table beneath the Ulster banner. He was then trained in the use of weapons and explosives. According to author and journalist Martin Dillon, Wright had been inspired by the violent deaths of UVF men Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, both of whom were blown up after planting a bomb on board The Miami Showband&#x27;s minibus. The popular Irish cabaret band had been returning from a performance in Banbridge in the early hours of 31 July 1975 when they were ambushed at Buskhill, County Down by armed men from the UVF&#x27;s Mid-Ulster Brigade at a bogus military checkpoint. Along with Boyle and Somerville, three band members had died in the attack when the UVF gunmen had opened fire on the group following the premature explosion. Boyle and Somerville had allegedly served as role models for Wright. Boyle was from Portadown. However, in his 2003 work &quot;The Trigger Men&quot;, Dillon broke from this version of events and instead concluded that Wright had actually been sworn into the YCV in 1974 when he was 14 years of age. Wright&#x27;s sister Angela told Dillon that her brother&#x27;s decision to join the UVF had in fact had nothing to do with the Miami Showband killings and Dillon then concluded that Wright had encouraged this version of events as he felt linking his own UVF membership to the activities of his heroes Boyle and Somerville added an origin myth to his own life as a loyalist killer.

In 1975, shortly after Wright joined the organisation, he was caught in possession of illegal weapons and sentenced to five years in a wing of HMP Maze (Maze Prison) reserved for paramilitary youth offenders. Before his imprisonment Wright was taken to Castlereagh Holding Centre, a police interrogation centre with a notorious reputation for the brutality employed during grilling. According to Wright&#x27;s sister Angela, he later claimed that he had been subjected to a number of indignities by the interrogating officers, including having a pencil shoved into his rectum. During his spell in prison Wright briefly joined the blanket protest, although he stepped down following an order from the UVF&#x27;s Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership), who feared that prisoner participation in the protest was being interpreted as a show of solidarity with the Provisional IRA. Inside the Maze he became the wing commander of H Block 2.

Wright later claimed that his decision to join the YCV had been influenced by the Kingsmill massacre of January 1976, when ten local Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. Wright&#x27;s cousin Jim Wright, future father-in-law Billy Corrigan, and brother-in-law Leslie Corrigan, were also killed by republicans in this period. Wright later said of the Kingsmill massacre, &quot;I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. I felt it was my duty to help my people and that is what I have been doing ever since.&quot;
Locals say he was also &quot;indoctrinated&quot; by local loyalist paramilitaries; however he had personally come to the conclusion that the UVF was the only organisation that had the &quot;moral right&quot; to defend the Protestant people.

Wright was released from the Maze Prison in 1980. Whilst inside he had nursed a deep resentment against the British state for having imprisoned him for being a loyalist. He was met in the car park by his aunt and girlfriend. In a final act of defiance against the authorities, Wright raised his face up towards a British Army observation tower on the Maze&#x27;s perimeter fence and shouted &quot;Up the UVF&quot;. Following his release, he went to Scotland where he lived for a brief period. He had been there only six weeks when he was taken in for questioning by the Anti-Terrorist Squad based at New Scotland Yard. Although he was not charged with any offences, Wright was nonetheless handed an exclusion order banning him from Great Britain.

Not long after his release from the Maze Prison, Wright was re-arrested, along with a number of UVF operatives in the area on evidence provided by Clifford McKeown, a &quot;supergrass&quot; within the movement. Wright was charged with murder, attempted murder, and the possession of explosives. He was detained in Crumlin Road Prison for ten months. The cases, however, ended without any major convictions after McKeown changed his mind and ceased giving evidence.

==Born-again Christian==
Wright returned to Portadown and initially tried to avoid paramilitarism. He found a job as an insurance salesman and married his girlfriend Thelma Corrigan, by whom he had two daughters, Sara and Ashleen. He took in his sister Angela&#x27;s son to be raised alongside his own children when she went to live in the United States. He was regarded as a good father. In 1983, he became a born again Christian and lay preacher in the Free Presbyterian Church and began working as a gospel preacher in County Armagh. He had studied Christianity whilst in prison to pass the time.

As a consequence of his religious conversion, Wright eschewed the highlife favoured by many of his loyalist contemporaries such as Johnny Adair and Stephen McKeag, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. He read a lot, including Irish history and theology. In particular he studied the history of Protestantism in Europe. Wright&#x27;s religious faith had contradictory influences on his life. On the one hand, he argued that his faith drove him to defend the &quot;Protestant people of Ulster&quot;, while at the same time, he conceded that the cold-blooded murder of non-combatant civilians would ensure his damnation. He spoke of this dilemma during an interview with Martin Dillon: 

When asked by Dillon whether or not the conflict was a religious war, he replied: &quot;I certainly believe religion is part of the equation. I don&#x27;t think you can leave religion out of it&quot;.

Angela Wright later claimed that her brother had foreseen the September 11 attacks when he told her that as she was living in New York she was abiding in a &quot;city of sin&quot;; he then went on to predict that the World Trade Center towers would be destroyed from the air.

==Mid-Ulster UVF commander==

In the late 1980s, after a five-year absence from the organisation, Wright resumed his UVF activities. This was in consequence of the November 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which angered unionists because it gave the Irish Government an advisory role in Northern Ireland&#x27;s government. There were frequent raids by the RUC and British Army on his home in Portadown&#x27;s Corcrain estate. Although he was arrested repeatedly on suspicion of murder and conspiracy, he never faced any charges.

Wright rapidly ascended to a position of prominence within the UVF ranks, eventually assuming leadership of the local Portadown unit. He became commander of the UVF&#x27;s Mid-Ulster Brigade in the early 1990s, having taken over from his mentor Robin &quot;the Jackal&quot; Jackson, who had been the leader since July 1975 and one of Wright&#x27;s instructors in the use of weaponry. Jackson was implicated in the 1974 Dublin car bombings, the Miami Showband killings and a series of sectarian attacks. Founded in 1972 by its first commander Billy Hanna, the Mid-Ulster Brigade operated mainly around the Portadown and Lurgan areas. It was a self-contained, semi-autonomous unit which maintained a considerable distance from the Brigade Staff in Belfast. Holding the rank of brigadier, Wright directed up to 20 sectarian killings, according to the Northern Ireland security forces, although he was never convicted in connection with any of them.

In March 1991, the Mid-Ulster UVF killed three Catholic civilians in the Craigavon mobile shop shootings. The gunman shot two teenage girls in the head, then forced a male customer to lie on the pavement and shot him also. Loyalist sources later told the &quot;Sunday World&quot; newspaper the attack had been ordered and planned in Portadown by Billy Wright and Mark Fulton.

While most of Wright&#x27;s unit&#x27;s victims were Catholic civilians, some were republican paramilitaries. On 3 March 1991, the Mid-Ulster UVF shot dead three Provisional IRA men, along with a middle-aged civilian, in an ambush outside Boyle&#x27;s Bar in Cappagh, County Tyrone. Wright was widely blamed by nationalists and much of the press for having led this attack. According to Paul Larkin in his book &quot;A Very British Jihad: collusion, conspiracy and cover-up in Northern Ireland&quot;, UVF members at Cappagh claimed they had to drag Wright into the car as he became so frenzied once he started shooting that he didn&#x27;t want to stop. British journalist Peter Taylor, however, stated in his book &quot;Loyalists&quot; that reliable UVF sources told him Wright was not involved. The RUC arrested Wright after the shootings. During the interrogation he provided the RUC with an alibi which placed him in Dungannon when the Cappagh attack occurred, and the RUC confirmed this. Wright considered Cappagh to have been a successful UVF operation. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper quoted him as saying, &quot;I would look back and say that Cappagh was probably our best&quot;. The Cappagh attack surprised the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade, as it had been carried out in a village which was an IRA stronghold, a departure from the usual arbitrary killings of Catholic civilians. Wright boasted that he and his Mid-Ulster unit had &quot;put the East Tyrone Brigade of the IRA on the run&quot; and &quot;decimated&quot; them. But according to authors Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack in their book &quot;UVF: The Endgame&quot;, the UVF leadership insists Wright was not behind the Cappagh killings, instead it was UVF units from outside Portadown and that the UVF leadership even encouraged the &quot;King Rat&quot; myth for the media to help the heat to be taken off the units who were actually responsible for the attack. Furthermore, they state the Mid-Ulster UVF is not just the Portadown unit, but that it is made up of units from Dungannon, south Londonderry, Armagh City, Cookstown, Lurgan and smaller rural units from mid-Ulster.

The IRA tried to kill Wright on five occasions. On 23 October 1992 they planted a bomb under his car on West Street, Portadown. Wright found the bomb, which had fallen off, after being told a man was seen crouching beside the car. In June 1994, RUC officers visited Wright to warn him that someone had been seen tampering with his car. The officers were with him while he searched his car, but found nothing. Wright then sat in the car and started it, which detonated a bomb planted in the engine and set the car on fire. He escaped with minor injuries. The North Armagh Brigade of the IRA claimed responsibility.

As part of the Northern Ireland peace process, the IRA called a ceasefire in July 1994. This was followed by the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) calling a ceasefire on 13 October 1994. Wright was initially caught up in the euphoria, calling it &quot;the happiest day of my life&quot;. However he became skeptical of the IRA&#x27;s ceasefire, and soon he publicly disagreed with the UVF leadership calling their ceasefire. Wright &quot;detested what he saw as concessions to [Irish] nationalists enshrined in the tentative peace process, and accused the leaders of unionism and loyalism of betraying the cause&quot;. He eventually denounced the peace process as a sell-out.

Journalist Susan McKay, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, was one of the first to report that Wright at this time ran a lucrative protection racket and was one of the most significant drug dealers in the Portadown area, primarily in ecstasy.

===King Rat===
Wright&#x27;s unit called themselves the &quot;Brat pack&quot;. The nickname &quot;King Rat&quot; was first given to Wright by the Mid-Ulster Ulster Defence Association (UDA) commander Robert John Kerr as a form of pub bantering. According to journalist and author Paul Larkin, Kerr sat inside a pub and jokingly bestowed a nickname on each patron as they entered. When Wright walked through the door, Kerr gave him the sobriquet of &quot;King Rat&quot;. &quot;Sunday World&quot; journalists Martin O&#x27;Hagan and Jim Campbell picked up on it and satirically named them the &quot;rat pack&quot;; they also used the name &quot;King Rat&quot; to identify Wright. Much to Wright&#x27;s annoyance, the name became popular with the media. In response, Wright had the newspaper&#x27;s offices bombed and issued a death threat to O&#x27;Hagan and anyone who worked for the paper.

In an interview with Martin Dillon, he blamed the police raids, republican death threats and the &quot;King Rat&quot; nickname as factors which eventually caused the break-up of his marriage. He nevertheless maintained cordial relations with his ex-wife, Thelma, whom he described as a &quot;good Christian&quot;.

==Drumcree standoff==
The Drumcree conflict, stemming from an Orange Order protest at Drumcree Church after their parade had been banned from marching through the predominantly nationalist Catholic Garvaghy area of Portadown, returned to the headlines in 1995 with trouble expected in Wright&#x27;s Portadown stronghold. Just before the July marching season Irish government representative Fergus Finlay held a meeting with Wright in which the latter pledged his loyalty to the peace process and David Ervine in particular, although Wright also warned Finlay that loyalist views had to be respected. Cracks began to show however as Wright felt that the UVF response to the trouble had been inordinately low-key whilst his taste for the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) strategy also began to wane as the party moved increasingly towards a form of socialism, an ideology repugnant to Wright. A further problem arose when Wright, who by that time was a popular loyalist figure across Northern Ireland, travelled to the Shankill Road in Belfast in late 1995 to try to overturn a ban preventing an Orange Order parade entering a neighbouring Catholic area. Wright had hoped to bring local UVF units onto the streets of the Shankill to force an overturning of the ban but the Shankill commanders refused to put their units at Wright&#x27;s disposal, having assured the British authorities that they would not in a series of secret negotiations. Wright returned to Portadown in disgust, accusing the Belfast UVF of having surrendered. Nonetheless, when Wright was arrested in late 1995 for intimidation he was still on good terms with the UVF, whose magazine &quot;Combat&quot; called for his release.

In January 1996, Wright once again travelled to Belfast where he dropped a verbal bombshell by announcing that the Mid-Ulster Brigade would no longer operate under the authority of the Brigade Staff. That same year Wright was ordered to attend a meeting called by the Brigade Staff at &quot;the Eagle&quot;, their headquarters above a chip shop (bearing the same name) on the Shankill Road, to answer charges of alleged drug dealing and being a police informer. The latter accusation came about after the loss of a substantial amount of weapons from the Mid-Ulster Brigade and a large number of its members had been arrested. Wright refused to attend and continued to flout Brigade Staff authority.

Following the decision by RUC Chief Constable Hugh Annesley to ban the Orange parade through the Garvaghy Road area of Portadown in the summer of 1996, a protest campaign of road blockages and general disruption was organised across Northern Ireland by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The protests, which led to a reversal of the ban, saw no official UVF involvement although Wright, despite not being a member of the Orange Order, was personally involved and led a sizeable force of his men to Drumcree. Wright and the Mid-Ulster Brigade attracted considerable attention from the global media as they made a show of strength and defended the Orangemen&#x27;s right to march their traditional route. The brigade manned the barricades, and brought homemade weapons to the church; among these was a mechanical digger and a petrol tanker. There was intelligence that Wright and his unit had planned to attack the British Army and police who were blocking the Orangemen&#x27;s passage. Television cameras broadcast Wright directing rioters on Drumcree hill against the security forces. Wright even held a meeting with one of the central figures in the operation, UUP leader David Trimble, and he was often seen in the company of Harold Gracey, Grand Master of the Portadown District Orange Lodge.

Wright stood around , had close-cropped blond hair and cold, pale blue eyes.
Peter Taylor had been at Drumcree that July and got a close-up view of Wright. Taylor described Wright as a &quot;charismatic leader&quot;. Clad in neat jeans, white T-shirt and wearing a single gold earring, he displayed a muscular build. Flanked by two bodyguards, Wright&#x27;s sudden appearance at Drumcree had inspired much admiration from the young boys and girls who were present. Journalist David McKittrick in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; described Wright as having been heavily tattooed, who walked with a &quot;characteristic strut that radiated restrained menace&quot;; and had a &quot;bullet head, close-cropped with small ears and deep-set, piercing eyes&quot;. Martin Dillon, who had interviewed him in his home in Portadown, admitted that he had been pleasant and charming throughout the interview, yet throughout the encounter Dillon had &quot;sensed a dark side to his character&quot;. Wright was also considered to have been a &quot;political thinker and capable strategist&quot;.

As a result of the Belfast leadership&#x27;s inaction, Wright ordered several killings on his own initiative. On 9 July 1996, at the height of the Drumcree standoff, the dead body of Catholic taxi driver, Michael McGoldrick, was found in his cab in a remote lane at Aghagallon, near Lurgan, a day after having picked up a fare in the town. He had been shot five times in the head. Both the UVF and the UDA released statements emphatically denying involvement in McGoldrick&#x27;s killing. According to PUP leader David Ervine, Wright had ordered the killing for the purpose of incriminating the UVF Brigade Staff by making it appear as if they had sanctioned it. To further Wright&#x27;s ploy, a handgun had been sent down to the Mid-Ulster Brigade from the Shankill UVF arms dump, but as the weapon had no forensic history the plot backfired. Several years later, Clifford McKeown, the former supergrass, was convicted of the murder of McGoldrick. McKeown, who had claimed that the killing was a birthday present for Wright, was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for his involvement in the murder.

==Leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force==

Wright, along with the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade, was stood down on 2 August 1996 by the UVF&#x27;s Brigade Staff for the unauthorised attack on McGoldrick, insubordination, and undermining the peace process. Wright was expelled from the UVF and also threatened with execution by the Combined Loyalist Military Command if he did not leave Northern Ireland.

Wright expressed the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat in an interview with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:

My heart goes out to my family at a time like this. Well, if you think you&#x27;re right, then you&#x27;re right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that&#x27;s the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I&#x27;ve been prepared to die for long many a year. I don&#x27;t wish to die, but at the end of the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.

Other units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the deadline attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown&#x27;s Corcrain estate, receiving a hero&#x27;s welcome at both events. The security services reported that every lodge and band participating stopped near Billy Wright so that members could shake his hand. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea&#x27;s sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright&#x27;s entitlement to freedom of speech.

Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright&#x27;s &quot;mythical stature&quot; amongst loyalists &quot;provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF&quot; in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: &quot;I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all I would like to say is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, &#x27;For whom are you doing it?&#x27;&quot;. Wright&#x27;s hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the UDA. Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.

They were joined by other loyalists disaffected by the peace process, giving them a maximum strength estimated at around 250 activists. They operated outside the Combined Loyalist Military Command and ignored the ceasefire order of October 1994. Wright denounced the UVF leadership as &quot;communists&quot;, for the left wing inclinations of some of their public statements about reconciliation with nationalists. Wright was strongly anti-communist and his belief in this was increased by a series of meetings he held with representatives of far right Christian groups from the southern states of the US. From these meetings, organised by Pastor Kenny McClinton, Wright was introduced to conspiracy theories about the role of communists in bringing down Christian morality, ideas that appealed to him. In a somewhat similar vein, Wright also enjoyed close relations with a Bolton-based cell of activists belonging to the neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 and had members of this group staying in Portadown during the build-up to the Drumcree stand-off in 1997. The UVF in its turn, regarded Wright setting up a rival loyalist organisation in the Mid-Ulster area as &quot;treason&quot;. Members of the Belfast UVF often contemptuously referred to Wright as &quot;Billy Wrong&quot;, with one UVF leader suggesting that Wright was motivated by &quot;religious zealotry and blind bigotry&quot;. The LVF was proscribed by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam in June 1997.

Wright personally devised the LVF&#x27;s codename of &quot;Covenant&quot; which was used to claim its attacks. The LVF published a document stating their aims and objectives

The use of the Ulster conflict as a crucible for far-reaching, fundamental and decisive change in the United Kingdom constitution. To restore Ulster&#x27;s right to self-determination. To end Irish nationalist aggression against Ulster in whatever form. To end all forms of Irish interference in Ulster&#x27;s internal affairs. To thwart the creation and/or implementation of any All-Ireland/All-Island political super-structure regardless of the powers vested in such institutions. To defeat the campaign of de-Britishization and Gaelicisation of Ulster&#x27;s daily life.

===Imprisonment===
Despite a series of sectarian murders and attacks on Catholic property by the LVF from 1996 to early 1997 (although they were not claimed by the organisation), Wright was not arrested until January 1997. He was charged with committing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, and making death threats against a woman, Gwen Read. This threat followed an altercation with Read&#x27;s family and LVF members. On 7 March he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for both offences and initially imprisoned at HMP Maghaberry. On 18 March, he was visited by DUP politician Peter Robinson (who later became First Minister of Northern Ireland in 2008). During the meeting, Wright told Robinson he believed an attempt on his life by republicans was imminent.

He was sent to the Maze in April 1997. He demanded and was granted an LVF section in C and D wings of H-block 6 (H6) for himself and 26 fellow inmates. INLA prisoners were housed in the A and B wings, and the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP, the political wing of the INLA) warned there would be trouble if the prisoners were not kept segregated. In August 1997, LVF prisoners, led by Wright, rioted over their visiting accommodation in the Maze.

Wright continued to direct LVF operations from the prison, although his deputy Mark &quot;Swinger&quot; Fulton served as its nominal leader. LVF membership increased during Wright&#x27;s imprisonment; by October 1997, membership in the organisation was between 150 and 200, many of them former UVF members disillusioned with the ceasefire. It was afterwards discovered that he had kept an irregular diary whilst in prison. On some of the pages he had made subtle threats to Catholic human rights solicitor Rosemary Nelson (killed in 1999 by a Red Hand Defenders car bomb) and her client, IRA prisoner Colin Duffy, charged with killing two RUC constables (the charges against Duffy were later dropped). Wright&#x27;s appeal was scheduled to be heard in February 1998.

==Assassination==

A tense situation existed within the Maze Prison. INLA inmates had told staff &quot;they intend given a chance to take out the LVF&quot;. The Prison Officers Association said precautions had been put in place to ensure inmates from the two groups did not come into contact with each other. Prison officers, however, had grave concerns over security measures in H Block 6, where Wright and the LVF were housed. The situation was made more volatile because, unlike the IRA, the UVF, and the UDA, neither the LVF nor the INLA were on ceasefire.

The decision to kill Wright inside the Maze was made in mid-December 1997 at an INLA &quot;Ard Chomhairle&quot; which was attended by the INLA Chief of Staff. The assassination was to be carried out in retaliation for the LVF killing of Catholic civilian Gerry Devlin which had taken place shortly before. On 16 December a senior INLA member who had been at the &quot;Ard Chomhairle&quot; went to the Maze to pay a visit to the Officer Commanding of the INLA at H Block 6.

On the morning of Saturday 27 December 1997, just before 10.00 a.m., Wright was assassinated by INLA prisoners inside the Maze Prison. The operation was undertaken by three INLA volunteers – Christopher &quot;Crip&quot; McWilliams, John &quot;Sonny&quot; Glennon and John Kennaway – armed with two smuggled pistols, a PA63 semi-automatic and a .22 Derringer. He was shot in the forecourt outside H Block 6 as he sat in the back of a prison van (alongside another LVF prisoner, Norman Green and one prison officer acting as escort) on his way to the visitor&#x27;s complex where he had an arranged visit with his girlfriend, Eleanor Reilly. John Glennon had been pretending to paint a mural in the sterile area between A and B wings which placed him in a position to see and hear what happened in the forecourt. Upon hearing the announcement over the prison Tannoy system that Wright and Green had been called for their respective visits, Glennon gave a pre-arranged signal to his two waiting accomplices. They moved into position at the A wing turnstile; Glennon ran into the canteen and he mounted a table situated beneath a window which gave him a clearer view of the block forecourt. When he saw Wright entering the van at 9.59 a.m. he gave a second pre-arranged signal, which was: &quot;Go, go, go&quot;.

The three INLA men rushed through the turnstile leading to A wing&#x27;s exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they climbed onto the roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men who jumped in front of the car, however, the driver, John Park, thinking that he and the other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were shut by a prison guard believing it to be an escape attempt. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van were armed.

While an unarmed Kennaway physically restrained the driver, Glennon, armed with the Derringer, gave cover beside the van as McWilliams opened the side door on the left at the rear, and shouted the words: &quot;Armed INLA volunteers&quot;. With a smile on his face, he then took up a firing stance and aimed his PA63 pistol inside the van at Wright, who was sitting sideways facing the side door beside Norman Green, with Prison Officer Stephen Sterritt seated behind the driver, running to a corner. Wright had been in the middle of a conversation, discussing the &quot;cost of Christmas&quot;, with both men. After McWilliams ordered Sterritt to &quot;fuck up and sit in his seat&quot; and Green to get out of the way, the two men instantly dropped to the floor to protect themselves; however, Wright stood up and kicked out at his assailant who began firing at point blank range. Green pleaded with Wright to &quot;get down&quot;, but McWilliams climbed into the van and continued shooting at Wright, hitting him a total of seven times. Wright, despite being shot, continued to defend himself by moving forward, kicking and lashing out at McWilliams. Wright was fatally wounded by the last shot, the bullet having lacerated his aorta. He slumped against the legs of Green. After screaming &quot;they shot Billy&quot;, Green made an attempt to resuscitate Wright, but to no avail; he was taken to the prison hospital, where a doctor pronounced him dead at 10.53 a.m. None of the others inside the van were hurt as of INLA leadership&#x27;s orders. Immediately following the shooting attack, the three gunmen returned the way they had come and on arrival in A Wing, negotiations ensued between the volunteers and prison staff, assisted by the prison chaplain. The 3 men then proceeded to hand over all equipment and materials used in the operation. The three volunteers were then arrested at the prison reception. Upon being charged, Volunteer McWilliams issued a short statement which had been agreed beforehand with the leadership of the INLA if and when the operation against Wright proved successful. This brief statement read:

Billy Wright was executed for one reason and one reason only, and that was for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell in Long Kesh [Maze].

===Aftermath===

That night, LVF gunmen opened fire on a disco frequented by Catholic teenagers in Dungannon. Four civilians were wounded and one, a former Provisional IRA member, was killed. Police believed that the disco itself was the intended target.

Four masked and armed LVF men maintained a vigil beside Wright&#x27;s body which was displayed in an open coffin prior to his paramilitary funeral which took place in Portadown on 30 December. The LVF ordered all shops in the town to shut as a mark of respect; bus and taxi services were also suspended, and the Union Jack flew at half-mast. The media was kept at a distance. After a private service inside Wright&#x27;s Brownstown home, the funeral cortège, led by a lone bagpiper, proceeded to Seagoe Cemetery, away. Thousands of mourners were in attendance as the hearse containing Wright&#x27;s coffin moved through the crowded streets, flanked by a guard of honour and preceded by women bearing floral wreaths. The Reverend John Gray of the Free Presbyterian Church officiated at the graveside service. Wright&#x27;s friend, the former UDA member Pastor Kenny McClinton, also delivered an oration in which he eulogised Wright as having been &quot;complicated, articulate, and sophisticated&quot;. LVF gunmen fired a volley of shots over his flag-draped coffin.

Wright&#x27;s close friend and deputy, Mark &quot;Swinger&quot; Fulton assumed control of the LVF leadership after Wright&#x27;s death.
The LVF became more closely tied to the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) organisation that was led by Johnny &#x27;Mad Dog&#x27; Adair. 
The LVF committed a series of attacks on Catholic civilians, which it termed a &quot;measured military response&quot; in response to Billy Wright&#x27;s death. Other loyalist paramilitary groups also sought to avenge his killing. On 19 January 1998 the UDA&#x27;s South Belfast Brigade shot dead Catholic taxi driver Larry Brennan outside his company offices in the Lower Ormeau Road. Martin O&#x27;Hagan, the &quot;Sunday World&quot; journalist whom Wright especially disliked, was killed in September 2001 by the Red Hand Defenders, a cover-name used by the UDA and LVF.

On 20 October 1998, Christopher McWilliams, John Glennon, and John Kennaway were convicted of murdering Billy Wright, possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life. The three men had pleaded not guilty. Although they were sentenced to life imprisonment, they only served two years of their sentence due to the early release provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.

===Inquiry and allegations===
The nature of Wright&#x27;s killing, within a high security prison, has led to speculation that the authorities colluded with the INLA to have him killed as he was a danger to the emerging peace process. Four days before his death, Wright himself believed that he would shortly be killed within the Maze Prison by agents of the British and Irish governments in collusion with loyalist informers and the INLA. The INLA strongly denied these rumours, and published a detailed account of the assassination in the March/April 1999 issue of &quot;The Starry Plough&quot; newspaper. Wright&#x27;s father, David, had campaigned for a public inquiry into his son&#x27;s murder and had appealed for help to the Northern Ireland, British and Irish authorities for help in the matter. The murder was investigated by the Cory Collusion Inquiry and it was recommended that the UK Government launch an inquiry into the circumstances of Wright&#x27;s death. The Cory Inquiry concluded that &quot;whatever criticism might properly be made regarding the reprehensible life and crimes of Billy Wright, it is apparent that he met his death bravely&quot;, and described his killing as &quot;brutal and cowardly&quot;.

June 2005 saw the Billy Wright inquiry open, chaired by Lord MacLean. Also sitting on the inquiry were academic professor Andrew Coyle from the University of London and the former Anglican Bishop of Hereford, the Right Reverend John Oliver. On 14 September 2010, the findings of the panel were released publicly at Stormont House in Belfast and found that there was no evidence of collusion between the authorities and the INLA. The inquiry, which had cost £30 million, did find a number of failings within the security of the prison. There was the main question of how the weapons were smuggled inside the prison to the killers. There was also the issue regarding the decision to house the INLA and LVF in H Block 6, when it was known that they were deadly rivals, neither of which was on ceasefire, and the INLA had vowed to kill Wright given the opportunity. McWilliams and Kennaway had been transferred to the Maze from Maghaberry the previous May. One month before their transfer, when Wright had still been at Maghaberry, they had organised an unsuccessful hostage-taking incident at the prison. This was meant to end in the assassination of Wright; he was subsequently moved to the Maze. Other questions were raised after the discovery that on the morning of the killing, Prison Officer Raymond Hill was stood down from his post in the watchtower overlooking A and B wings of H-Block 6 where the INLA prisoners were housed. The CCTV camera placed in the area was also found to have been nonfunctioning for several days prior to the shooting. The visitors lists for 27 December 1997 had been circulated in both the LVF and INLA wings the day before thereby giving Wright&#x27;s assassins time to prepare for the killing as the list clearly stated that Wright was scheduled to receive a visit on 27 December. The LVF prison van had been parked outside the INLA wing that morning instead of following the normal procedure which was to park outside the LVF wing. And the gates leading from the forecourt were automatically locked as soon as the killers were spotted on the roof. This had prevented the van from driving off and thus effectively trapped Wright in the rear.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; before his own death, one of the killers, John Kennaway said the security inside the Maze was &quot;a joke&quot;. He claimed the weapons had been smuggled to McWilliams and Glennon inside nappies. He added that as soon as the &quot;screws&quot; [prison officers] had seen the INLA men on A wing&#x27;s roof, they assumed the men were staging an escape and sounded the alarm system. The gates were automatically locked-down therefore preventing the van from leaving. Kennaway suggested that had the prison officers not seen them and quickly sounded the alarm, the van could have driven away in time and Wright might have escaped with his life.

Shortly before the findings of the inquiry into Wright&#x27;s death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television&#x27;s &quot;Live Tonight&quot; the UVF&#x27;s mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, &quot;It was obvious he [Wright] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him to get out of the country – that&#x27;s when the LVF was formed, that&#x27;s when the breakaway group appeared.&quot; When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, &quot;You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to do something and they don&#x27;t do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don&#x27;t go – the defiance alone, it doesn&#x27;t leave many alternatives&quot;. McDonald expressed his belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright&#x27;s death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.

On 30 September 2011, Billy&#x27;s father David Wright died in Portadown at the age of 78. After his funeral service at the Killicomain Baptist Church, he was buried, like Billy, in Seagoe Cemetery. Up until his death, he had continued to profess his belief that there had been state collusion in his son&#x27;s killing. He denounced the findings of the inquiry released in 2010 as a &quot;total whitewash and a failure to get at the truth&quot;.

==Alleged links with RUC Special Branch==
There are allegations that RUC Special Branch colluded with Billy Wright, providing him with information on suspected IRA members as well as alibis and protection. Before his assassination in 2001, journalist Martin O&#x27;Hagan revealed to fellow journalist Paul Larkin that a high-ranking RUC officer had told him Wright received help from RUC Special Branch, and bore the code name &quot;Bertie&quot;. Some in the UVF also suspected that Wright was a police informer. An IRA Intelligence officer told Larkin that Wright was selected and trained by Special Branch to take over from Robin Jackson, also an alleged Special Branch agent.

A former member of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade, Laurence Maguire, claimed that police gave Wright information on targets, and that he was nearby in a car when some meetings with police took place &quot;up alleyways&quot;. Maguire further claimed that the UVF believed that Wright was a &quot;state agent&quot;. Two senior security sources also told a BBC &quot;Spotlight&quot; team that Wright was working for the police.

==Loyalist icon==

For years after his death, Wright&#x27;s image adorned murals in housing estates in Portadown and elsewhere throughout Northern Ireland. However, one of the most well-known of these, that on a wall near Portadown F.C.&#x27;s Shamrock Park home ground, was removed in 2006 with a mural of George Best painted in its stead. Wright is regarded as a martyr and hero by hardline loyalist bitter enders; many of whom have tattoos bearing his likeness. Some of Wright&#x27;s more ardent devotees have his likeness on their private parts. His successor Mark &quot;Swinger&quot; Fulton had one tattooed over his heart. Most of these tattoos were created by a Bolton-based member of Combat 18, who tattooed many LVF supporters with Wright&#x27;s image at houses in Portadown&#x27;s loyalist estates whilst visiting for the Twelfth.

One teenage girl in North Belfast set up a shrine to Wright in her bedroom complete with his photographs. She explained to a journalist, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in pop stars. Billy was a real Loyalist hero and I like to go to sleep at night looking at him&quot;. Gunmen at a paramilitary display in Portadown in 2000 told journalists: &quot;He [Wright] did what he had to do to ensure that our faith and culture were kept intact.&quot; In the immediate aftermath of Wright&#x27;s killing, Adair told his main gunmen Stephen McKeag and Gary Smyth that they had a free hand to &quot;avenge&quot; Wright&#x27;s death, with McKeag almost immediately launching a machine gun attack on a bar in a mainly Catholic area despite the UDA being officially on ceasefire. In a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF, the West Belfast UDA later referenced Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF. Despite this, the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright&#x27;s life and according to Adair&#x27;s sometime girlfriend Jackie &quot;Legs&quot; Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a &quot;bastard&quot;. Robinson wrote the incident off as jealousy on Adair&#x27;s part as Wright was already well-established as a leading figure in loyalism by that stage whilst Adair was still making his name.

The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; newspaper summed up Wright as having been &quot;one of the most fear-inspiring loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland since the Shankill Butchers in the 1970s&quot;. Peter Taylor offered an alternative insight into the reputation of Billy Wright by suggesting that popular myth had laid many killings and atrocities at Wright&#x27;s door when there was actually little evidence to back them up.

<doc id="70855" wikidata="Q325380" url="?curid=70855" title="Stadtholder">
<text>In the Low Countries, a stadtholder ( ) was a steward, first appointed as a medieval official and ultimately functioning as a national leader. The &quot;stadtholder&quot; was the replacement of the duke or count of a province during the Burgundian and Habsburg period (1384 – 1581/1795).

The title was used for the highest executive official of each province performing several duties, such as appointing lower administrators and maintaining peace and order, in the early Dutch Republic. As multiple provinces appointed the same stadtholder, the stadtholder of the powerful province of Holland at times functioned as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state of the Dutch Republic as a whole during the 16th to 18th centuries, in an effectively hereditary role. For the last half century of its existence, it became an officially hereditary title under Prince William IV of Orange. His son, Prince William V, was the last &quot;stadtholder&quot; of all provinces of the Republic, until fleeing French revolutionary troops in 1795. His son, William I of the Netherlands, in 1815 became the first sovereign king of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The title &quot;stadtholder&quot; is roughly comparable to the historical titles of Lord Protector in England, Statthalter in the Holy Roman Empire and Governor-general of Norway.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Stadtholder&quot; means &quot;steward&quot;. Its component parts literally translate as &quot;place holder,&quot; from Latin &quot;locum tenens&quot;, or as a direct cognate, &quot;stead holder&quot; (in modern Dutch &quot;stad&quot; means &quot;city&quot;, but the older meaning of &quot;stad&quot; – also &quot;stede&quot; – was &quot;place&quot;, and it is a cognate of English &quot;stead&quot;, as &quot;instead of&quot;); it was a term for a &quot;steward&quot; or &quot;lieutenant&quot;. However, this is not the word for the military rank of lieutenant, which is in Dutch.

== History ==
=== Seventeen Provinces ===

&quot;Stadtholder&quot;s in the Middle Ages were appointed by feudal lords to represent them in their absence. If a lord had several dominions (or, being a vassal, fiefs), some of these could be ruled by a permanent &quot;stadtholder&quot;, to whom was delegated the full authority of the lord. A &quot;stadtholder&quot; was thus more powerful than a governor, who had only limited authority, but the stadtholder was not a vassal himself, having no title to the land. The local rulers of the independent provinces of the Low Countries (which included the present-day Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) made extensive use of &quot;stadtholder&quot;s, e.g. the Duke of Guelders appointed a &quot;stadtholder&quot; to represent him in Groningen.

In the 15th century the Dukes of Burgundy acquired most of the Low Countries, and the constituent parts (duchies, counties, lordships) of these Burgundian Netherlands mostly each had their own &quot;stadtholder&quot;, appointed by the Duke in his capacity of duke, count or lord.

In the 16th century, the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, also King of Spain, who had inherited the Burgundian Netherlands, completed this process by becoming the sole feudal overlord: Lord of the Netherlands. Only the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and two smaller territories (the Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy and the Duchy of Bouillon) remained outside his domains. &quot;Stadtholder&quot;s continued to be appointed to represent Charles and King Philip II, his son and successor in Spain and the Low Countries (the electoral Imperial title would be held by his brother Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and his heirs in the separate Austrian branch of Habsburgs). Due to the centralist and absolutist policies of Philip, the actual power of the &quot;stadtholder&quot;s strongly diminished, compared to the &quot;landvoogd (es)&quot; or governor-general.

=== Dutch Republic ===
When, in 1581, during the Dutch Revolt, seven of the Dutch provinces declared their independence with the Act of Abjuration, the representative function of the &quot;stadtholder&quot; became obsolete in the rebellious northern Netherlands – the feudal lord himself having been abolished – but the office nevertheless continued in these provinces who now united themselves into the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The United Provinces were struggling to adapt existing feudal concepts and institutions to the new situation and tended to be conservative in this matter, as they had after all rebelled against the king to defend their ancient rights. The &quot;stadtholder&quot; no longer represented the lord but became the highest executive official, appointed by the States of each province (e.g. the States of Holland and West Friesland and the States of Friesland). Although each province could assign its own &quot;stadtholder&quot;, most &quot;stadtholder&quot;s held appointments from several provinces at the same time. The highest executive and legislative power was normally exerted by the sovereign States of each province, but the stadtholder had some prerogatives, like appointing lower officials and sometimes having the ancient right to affirm the appointment (by co-option) of the members of regent councils or choose &quot;burgomasters&quot; from a shortlist of candidates. As these councils themselves appointed most members of the States, the &quot;stadtholder&quot; could very indirectly influence the general policy. In Zeeland, the Princes of Orange, who after the Dutch Revolt most often held the office of &quot;stadtholder&quot; there, held the dignity of &quot;First Noble&quot;, and were as such a member of the States of that province, because they held the title of Marquis of Veere and Flushing as one of their patrimonial titles.

On the Republic&#x27;s central &#x27;confederal&#x27; level, the &quot;stadtholder&quot; of the provinces of Holland and Zeeland was normally also appointed Captain-General of the Dutch States Army and Admiral-General of the confederate fleet, though no &quot;stadtholder&quot; ever actually commanded a fleet in battle. In the army, he could appoint officers by himself; in the navy only affirm appointments of the five admiralty councils. Legal powers of the stadtholder were thus rather limited, and by law he was a mere official. His real powers, however, were sometimes greater, especially given the martial law atmosphere of the &#x27;permanent&#x27; Eighty Years War. Maurice of Orange after 1618 ruled as a military dictator, and William II of Orange attempted the same.

The leader of the Dutch Revolt was William the Silent (William I of Orange); he had been appointed &quot;stadtholder&quot; in 1572 by the States of the first province to rebel, Holland, as a replacement of the royal stadtholder (He had previously held the post as an appointee of Philip II.). His personal influence and reputation was subsequently associated with the office and transferred to members of his house. After his assassination, however, there was a short-lived move to install Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester as governor-general of Elizabeth I before Maurice in 1590 became stadtholder of five provinces, a position he would hold until his death (his cousin William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg held the post in the remaining two provinces, Friesland and Groningen).

Tensions nonetheless persisted between Orangists and republicans in the United Provinces, sometimes exploding into direct conflict. Maurice in 1618 and William III of Orange from 1672 replaced entire city councils with their partisans to increase their power: the so-called &quot;Changings of the Legislative&quot; (&quot;Wetsverzettingen&quot;). By intimidation, the &quot;stadtholder&quot;s tried to extend their right of affirmation, while they also attempted to add the remaining stadholderships like Friesland and Groningen to their other holdings. In reaction, the regents in Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel, after the death of William II in 1650, appointed no &quot;stadtholder&quot;, and banned his son William from the stadtholdership by an Act of Seclusion, something overcome by popular feeling during the catastrophic events of 1672, the Dutch Year of Disaster (&quot;Rampjaar&quot;), when the future William III of England was swept to power. After the death of William III in 1702 they again abstained from appointing a stadtholder. These periods are known as the First Stadtholderless Period and the Second Stadtholderless Period.

After the French invasion of 1747, the regents were forced by a popular movement to accept William IV, Prince of Orange, stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, as stadtholder in the other provinces. On 22 November 1747, the office of &quot;stadtholder&quot; was made hereditary (&quot;erfstadhouder&quot;) everywhere (previously only in Friesland). As William (for the first time in the history of the Republic) was &quot;stadtholder&quot; in all provinces, his function accordingly was restyled .

After William IV&#x27;s death in 1751, his infant son was duly appointed &quot;stadtholder&quot; under the regency of his mother. The misgovernment of this regency caused much resentment, which issued in 1780 in the Patriot movement, seeking to permanently limit the powers of the stadholderate. The Patriots first took over many city councils, then the States of the province of Holland, and ultimately raised civil militias to defend their position against Orangist partisans, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Through Prussian military intervention in 1787, Prince William V of Orange was able to suppress this opposition, and many leaders of the Patriot movement went into exile in France. The stadtholderate was strengthened with the Act of Guarantee (1788).

=== Abolition and transition to sovereign kingdom ===
The exiles returned with French armies in the winter of 1795 and overcame the frozen Dutch Water Line. William V fled to England, and the office of stadtholder was abolished that year, when the French revolutionary forces installed the Batavian Republic. Similarly, while from 1572 in the Southern Netherlands the Habsburg lords continued to appoint provincial stadtholders for the region, this ceased when they were annexed by France in 1794. In 1806, Napoleon established the Kingdom of Holland, putting his younger brother Louis on the throne. He abdicated his throne in 1810 in favour of his son Louis II. He ruled for nine days, until his uncle Napoleon took charge himself, annexing the kingdom to the French Empire, until its fall in 1813.

Soon after the French army withdrew from the Netherlands, William Frederick, the son of William V, was invited by the Triumvirate of 1813 to become the first &#x27;Sovereign Prince&#x27;. William had been living in exile in London during the French occupation. On 13 November 1813 he returned to the Netherlands to accept the invitation. On 16 March 1815 he assumed the title of King of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

== As political model ==
The stadtholderate was taken as a political model by the Founding Fathers of the United States with regard to the executive powers – Oliver Ellsworth for example arguing that without its influence in the United Provinces, &quot;their machine of government would no more move than a ship without wind&quot;.

<text>Bombyx mori, commonly known as the domestic silk moth, is a moth species belonging to the family Bombycidae. It is the closest relative of &quot;Bombyx mandarina&quot;, the wild silk moth. Silkworms are the larvae of silk moths. The silkworm is of particular economic value, being a primary producer of silk. The silkworm&#x27;s preferred food are the leaves of white mulberry, though they may eat other species of mulberry, and even leaves of other plants like the Osage orange. Domestic silk moths are entirely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths, which are other species of &quot;Bombyx&quot;, are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.

Sericulture, the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has existed for at least 5,000 years in China, whence it spread to India, Korea, Nepal, Japan, and then the West. The conventional process of sericulture kills the silkworm in the pupal stage. The domestic silk moth was domesticated from the wild silk moth &quot;Bombyx mandarina&quot;, which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The domestic silk moth derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.

Silk moths were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the Neolithic period. Before then, the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed. The domesticated &quot;Bombyx mori&quot; and the wild &quot;Bombyx mandarina&quot; can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids. It is unknown if &quot;B. mori&quot; can hybridize with other &quot;Bombyx&quot; species. Compared to most members in the genus &quot;Bombyx&quot;, domestic silk moths have lost their coloration as well as their ability to fly.

== Types ==
Mulberry silkworms can be divided into three major categories based on seasonal brood frequency. Univoltine silkworms produce only one brood a season, and they are generally found in and around Europe. Univoltine eggs must hibernate through the winter, ultimately cross-fertilizing in spring. Bivoltine varieties are normally found in East Asia, and their accelerated breeding process is made possible by slightly warmer climates. In addition, there are polyvoltine silkworms found only in the tropics. Their eggs typically hatch within 9 to 12 days, meaning there can be up to eight generations of larvae throughout the year.

== Description and life cycle ==

=== Larvae ===
Eggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a preference for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone. They are not monophagous, since they can eat other species of &quot;Morus&quot;, as well as some other Moraceae, mostly Osage orange. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to molt. After molting, the larval phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.

=== Pupae (cocoon) ===
After they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow, and the skin becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the pupal phase of their life cycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the salivary glands. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other Lepidoptera produce cocoons, but only a few — the Bombycidae, in particular the genus &quot;Bombyx&quot;, and the Saturniidae, in particular the genus &quot;Antheraea&quot; — have been exploited for fabric production.

The cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from long. The fibers are fine and lustrous, about in diameter. About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make . At least of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.

If the animal survives through the pupal phase of its life cycle, it releases proteolytic enzymes to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth. These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which reduces the value of the silk threads, although these damaged silk cocoons are still used as &quot;stuffing&quot; available in China and elsewhere in the production of duvets, jackets, and other purposes. To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled in water. The heat kills the silkworms, and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often, the silkworm is eaten.

As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the pupa, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. Mahatma Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the &quot;ahimsa&quot; philosophy &quot;not to hurt any living thing&quot;. This led to Gandhi&#x27;s promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute, and an extension of this principle has led to the modern production practice known as Ahimsa silk, which is wild silk (from wild and semiwild silk moths) made from the cocoons of moths that are allowed to emerge before the silk is harvested.

=== Moth ===
The moth is the adult phase of the silk worm&#x27;s life cycle. Silk moths have a wingspan of and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (due to carrying many eggs). All adult Bombycidae moths have reduced mouthparts and do not feed.

The wings of the silk moth develop from larval imaginal disks. The moth is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild &quot;B. mandarina&quot; and other &quot;Bombyx&quot; species, whose males fly to meet females. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved as their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. 

The legs of the silk moth develop from the silkworm&#x27;s larval (thoracic) legs. Developmental genes like Distalless and extradenticle have been used to mark leg development. In addition, removing specific segments of the thoracic legs at different ages of the larva resulted in the adult silk moth not developing the corresponding adult leg segments.

== Research ==
Due to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a model organism in the study of lepidopteran and general arthropod biology. Fundamental findings on genetics, pheromones, hormones, brain structures, and physiology have been made with the silkworm. One example of this was the molecular identification of the first known pheromone, bombykol, which required extracts from 500,000 individuals, due to the small quantities of pheromone produced by any individual silkworm.

Many research works have focused on the genetics of silkworms and the possibility of genetic engineering. Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 Mendelian mutations have been described. Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide. One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet. Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins. &quot;Bombyx mori&quot; females are also one of the few organisms with homologous chromosomes held together only by the synaptonemal complex (and not crossovers) during meiosis. In the oocytes of &quot;B. mori&quot;, meiosis is completely achiasmate (lacking crossovers). Even though synaptonemal complexes are formed during the pachytene stage of meiosis in &quot;B. mori&quot;, crossing-over homologous recombination does not occur between the paired chromosomes.

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories
has used research from the Universities of Wyoming and Notre Dame in a collaborative effort to create a silkworm that is genetically altered to produce spider silk. In September 2010, the effort was announced as successful.

Researchers at Tufts developed scaffolds made of spongy silk that feel and look similar to human tissue. They are implanted during reconstructive surgery to support or restructure damaged ligaments, tendons, and other tissue. They also created implants made of silk and drug compounds which can be implanted under the skin for steady and gradual time release of medications.

Researchers at the MIT Media Lab experimented with silkworms to see what they would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures. They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the silkworms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving directly onto the given shape. Using this knowledge they built a silk pavilion with 6,500 silkworms over a number of days.

Silkworms have been used in antibiotic discovery, as they have several advantageous traits compared to other invertebrate models. Antibiotics such as lysocin E, a non-ribosomal peptide synthesized by &quot;Lysobacter&quot; sp. RH2180-5 and GPI0363 are among the notable antibiotics discovered using silkworms.
In addition, antibiotics with appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters were selected that correlated with therapeutic activity in the silkworm infection model.

Silkworms have also been used for the identification of novel virulence factors of pathogenic microorganisms. A first large-scale screening using transposon mutant library of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; USA300 strain was performed which identified 8 new genes with roles in full virulence of &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Another study by the same team of researchers revealed, for the first time, the role of YjbH in virulence and oxidative stress tolerance in vivo.

== Domestication ==

The domestic species &quot;B. mori&quot;, compared to the wild species (e.g., &quot;B. mandarina&quot;), has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion. It has gained tolerance to human presence and handling, and also to living in crowded conditions. The domestic silk moths cannot fly, so the males need human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. The native color pigments have also been lost, so the domestic silk moths are leucistic, since camouflage is not useful when they only live in captivity. These changes have made &quot;B. mori&quot; entirely dependent upon humans for survival, and it does not exist in the wild. The eggs are kept in incubators to aid in their hatching.

=== Breeding ===

Silkworms were first domesticated in China more than 5,000 years ago.

Silkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworms from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving fecundity, the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (this lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors, including genetics.

=== Hobby raising and school projects ===

In the U.S., teachers may sometimes introduce the insect life cycle to their students by raising domestic silk moths in the classroom as a science project. Students have a chance to observe complete life cycles of insects from eggs to larvae to pupae to moths. 

The domestic silk moth has been raised as a hobby in countries such as China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Iran. Children often pass on the eggs to the next generation, creating a non-commercial population. The experience provides children with the opportunity to witness the life cycle of silk moths.

== Genome ==
The full genome of the domestic silk moth was published in 2008 by the International Silkworm Genome Consortium. Draft sequences were published in 2004.

The genome of the domestic silk moth is mid-range with a genome size around 432 million base pairs. A notable feature is that 43.6% of the genome are repetitive sequences, most of which are transposable elements. At least 3,000 silkworm genes are unique, and have no homologous equivalents in other genomes. The silkworm&#x27;s ability to produce large amounts of silk correlates with the presence of specific tRNA clusters, as well as some clustered sericin genes. Additionally, the silkworm&#x27;s ability to consume toxic mulberry leaves is linked to specialized sucrase genes, which appear to have been acquired from bacterial genes.

In 2018, Illumina&#x27;s short reads for 137 strain genomes were published. In 2022, Nanopore&#x27;s long reads for 545 strain genomes were published.

== As food ==
Silk moth pupae are edible insects and are eaten in some cultures:
* In Assam, India, they are boiled for extracting silk and the boiled pupae are eaten directly with salt or fried with chili pepper or herbs as a snack or dish. Live pupae may be eaten raw, boiled or fried.
* In Korea, they are boiled and seasoned to make a popular snack food known as &quot;beondegi&quot; (번데기).
* In China, street vendors sell roasted silk moth pupae.
* In Japan, silkworms are usually served as a &quot;tsukudani&quot; (佃煮), i.e., boiled in a sweet-sour sauce made with soy sauce and sugar.
* In Vietnam, this is known as &quot;&quot;, usually boiled, seasoned with fish sauce, then stir-fried and eaten as main dish with rice.
* In Thailand, roasted silkworm is often sold at open markets. They are also sold as packaged snacks.

Silkworms have also been proposed for cultivation by astronauts as space food on long-term missions.

== In culture ==
=== China ===

In China, a legend indicates the discovery of the silkworm&#x27;s silk was by an ancient empress named Leizu, the wife of the Yellow Emperor, also known as Xi Lingshi. She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.

The Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a Khotan prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, &quot;hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry&quot;, probably in the first half of the first century AD. About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms hidden in a hollow stick out of China, selling the secret to the eastern Romans.

=== Vietnam ===
According to a Vietnamese folk tale, silkworms were originally a beautiful housemaid running away from her gruesome masters and living in the mountain, where she was protected by the mountain god. One day, a lecherous god from the heaven came down to Earth to seduce women. When he saw her, he tried to rape her but she was able to escape and was hidden by the mountain god. The lecherous god then tried to find and capture her by setting a net trap around the mountain. With the blessing of Guanyin, the girl was able to safely swallow that net into her stomach. Finally, the evil god summons his fellow thunder and rain gods to attack and burn away her clothes, forcing her to hide in a cave. Naked and cold, she spit out the net and used it as a blanket to sleep. The girl died in her sleep, and as she wished to continue to help other people, her soul turned into silkworms.

== Feeding ==
&quot;Bombyx mori&quot; is essentially monophagous, exclusively eating mulberry leaves (&quot;Morus&quot; spp.). By developing techniques for using artificial diets, the amino acids needed for development are known. The various amino acids can be classified into five categories:

*Those which, when removed, cause larval development to stop entirely: lysine, leucine, isoleucine, histidine, arginine, valine, tryptophan, threonine, phenylalanine, methionine
*Those which, when removed, impede later stages of larval development: glutamate and aspartate
*Semi-essential amino acids, with negative effects that can be eliminated by supplementing with other amino acids: proline (ornithine can be substituted)
*Non-essential amino acids that can by replaced through biosynthesis by the larvae: alanine, glycine, serine
*Non-essential amino acids that can be removed with no effect at all: tyrosine

== Diseases ==
*&quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;, a fungus, destroys the entire silkworm body. This fungus usually appears when silkworms are raised under cold conditions with high humidity. This disease is not passed on to the eggs from moths, as the infected silkworms cannot survive to the moth stage. This fungus, however, can spread to other insects.
*Grasserie, also known as nuclear polyhedrosis, milky disease, or hanging disease, is caused by infection with the &quot;Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus&quot; (aka &quot;Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus&quot;, genus &quot;Alphabaculovirus&quot;). If grasserie is observed in the chawkie stage, then the chawkie larvae must have been infected while hatching or during chawkie rearing. Infected eggs can be disinfected by cleaning their surfaces prior to hatching. Infections can occur as a result of improper hygiene in the chawkie rearing house. This disease develops faster in early instar rearing.
*Pébrine is a disease caused by a parasitic microsporidian, &quot;Nosema bombycis&quot;. Diseased larvae show slow growth, undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite. Tiny black spots appear on larval integument. Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death. &quot;N. bombycis&quot; kills 100% of silkworms hatched from infected eggs. This disease can be carried over from worms to moths, then to eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food that the silkworms eat. Female moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of silkworms hatching from the diseased eggs die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, eggs from infected moths are ruled out by checking the moth&#x27;s body fluid under a microscope.
*Flacherie infected silkworms look weak and are colored dark brown before they die. The disease destroys the larva&#x27;s gut and is caused by viruses or poisonous food.
*Several diseases caused by a variety of funguses are collectively named Muscardine.

<text>A flamethrower is a ranged incendiary device designed to project a controllable jet of fire. First deployed by the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century AD, flamethrowers saw use in modern times during World War I, and more widely in World War II as a tactical weapon against fortifications.

Most military flamethrowers use liquid fuel, typically either heated oil or diesel, but commercial flamethrowers are generally blowtorches using gaseous fuels such as propane. Gases are safer in peacetime applications because their flames have less mass flow rate and dissipate faster, and often are easier to extinguish.

Apart from the military applications, flamethrowers have peacetime applications where there is a need for controlled burning, such as in sugarcane harvesting and other land-management tasks. Various forms are designed for an operator to carry, while others are mounted on vehicles.

== Military use ==
Modern flamethrowers were first used during the trench warfare conditions of World War I and their use greatly increased in World War II. They can be vehicle-mounted, as on a tank, or man-portable.

The man-portable flamethrower consists of two elements—the backpack and the gun. The backpack element usually consists of two or three cylinders. In a two-cylinder system, one cylinder holds compressed, inert propellant gas (usually nitrogen), and the other holds flammable liquid, typically some form of petrochemical. A three-cylinder system often has two outer cylinders of flammable liquid and a central cylinder of propellant gas to maintain the balance of the soldier carrying it. The gas propels the liquid fuel out of the cylinder through a flexible pipe and then into the gun element of the flamethrower system. The gun consists of a small reservoir, a spring-loaded valve, and an ignition system; depressing a trigger opens the valve, allowing pressurized flammable liquid to flow and pass over the igniter and out of the gun nozzle. The igniter can be one of several ignition systems: A simple type is an electrically heated wire coil; another used a small pilot flame, fueled with pressurized gas from the system.

Flamethrowers were primarily used against battlefield fortifications, bunkers, and other protected emplacements. A flamethrower projects a stream of flammable liquid, rather than flame, which allows bouncing the stream off walls and ceilings to project the fire into unseen spaces, such as inside bunkers or pillboxes. Typically, popular visual media depict the flamethrower as short-ranged and only effective for a few metres (due to the common use of propane gas as the fuel in flamethrowers in movies, for the safety of the actors). Contemporary flamethrowers can incinerate a target some from the operator; moreover, an unignited stream of flammable liquid can be fired and afterwards ignited, possibly by a lamp or other flame inside the bunker.

Flamethrowers pose many risks to the operator. The first disadvantage is the weapon&#x27;s weight and length, which impairs the soldier&#x27;s mobility. The weapon is limited to only a few seconds of burn time, since it uses fuel very quickly, requiring the operator to be precise and conservative. Flamethrowers using a fougasse-style explosive propellant system also have a limited number of shots. The weapon is very visible on the battlefield, which causes operators to become immediately singled out as prominent targets, especially for snipers and designated marksmen. Flamethrower operators were rarely taken prisoner, especially when their target survived an attack by the weapon; captured flamethrower users were in some cases summarily executed.

The flamethrower&#x27;s effective range is short in comparison with that of other battlefield weapons of similar size. To be effective, flamethrower soldiers must approach their target, risking exposure to enemy fire. Vehicular flamethrowers also have this problem; they may have considerably greater range than a man-portable flamethrower, but their range is still short compared with that of other infantry weapons.
The risk of a flamethrower operator being caught in the explosion of their weapon due to enemy hits on the tanks is exaggerated in films. In some cases, the pressure tanks have exploded and killed the operator when hit by bullets or grenade shrapnel. In the documentary &quot;Vietnam in HD&quot;, platoon sergeant Charles Brown tells of how one of his men was killed when his flamethrower was hit by grenade shrapnel during the battle for Hill 875.

The pressurizer is filled with a non-flammable gas that is under high pressure. If this tank ruptures, it might knock the operator forward as it was expended in the same way a pressurized aerosol can bursts outward when punctured. The fuel mixture in the containers is difficult to light, which is why magnesium-filled igniters are required when the weapon is fired. When pierced by a bullet, a metal can filled with diesel or napalm will merely leak unless the round is an incendiary type that may ignite the mixture inside.

The best way to minimize the disadvantages of flame weapons was to mount them on armoured vehicles. The Commonwealth and the United States were the most prolific users of vehicle-mounted flame weapons; the British and Canadians fielded &quot;Wasps&quot; (Universal Carriers fitted with flamethrowers) at infantry battalion level, beginning in mid-1944, and eventually incorporating them into infantry battalions. Early tank-mounted flamethrower vehicles included the &quot;Badger&quot; (a converted Ram tank) and the &quot;Oke&quot;, used first at Dieppe.

== Operation ==

A propane-operated flamethrower is a straightforward device. The gas is expelled through the gun assembly by its own pressure and is ignited at the exit of the barrel through piezo ignition.

Liquid-operated flamethrowers use a smaller tank with a pressurized gas to expel the flammable liquid fuel. The propellant gas is fed to two tubes. The first opens in the fuel tanks providing the pressure necessary for expelling the liquid. The other tube leads to an ignition chamber behind the exit of the gun assembly, where it is mixed with air and ignited through piezo ignition. This pre-ignition line is the source of the flame seen in front of the gun assembly in movies and documentaries. As the fuel passes through the flame, it is ignited and propelled towards the target.

== History ==
=== Ancient Greece ===

The concept of projecting fire as a weapon has existed since ancient times. During the Peloponnesian War, Boeotians used some kind of a flamethrower trying to destroy the fortification walls of the Athenians during the Battle of Delium.

=== Roman Empire ===
In 107 AD the Romans used a flamethrower against the Dacians; the device was similar to the one used at Delium.

Later, during the Byzantine era, sailors used rudimentary hand-pumped flamethrowers on board their naval ships. Greek fire, extensively used by the Byzantine Empire, is said to have been invented by Kallinikos of Heliopolis, probably about 673 AD. Byzantine texts described weapons, used by Byzantine land forces, which were shooting Greek fire and called cheirosiphona (χειροσίφωνα, meaning hand-held siphons, singular χειροσίφωνο). The flamethrower found its origins in a device consisting of a hand-held pump that shot bursts of Greek fire via a siphon-hose and a piston which ignited it with a match, similar to modern versions, as it was ejected. An illustration in Poliorcetica of Hero of Byzantium display a soldier with a portable flamethrower. Byzantines also used ceramic hand grenades filled with Greek fire.
Greek fire, used primarily at sea, gave the Byzantines a substantial military advantage against enemies such as members of the Arab Empire (who later adopted the use of Greek fire). An 11th-century illustration of its use survives in the John Skylitzes manuscript.

=== China ===

The &quot;Pen Huo Qi&quot; (&quot;fire spraying device&quot;) was a Chinese piston flamethrower that used a substance similar to petrol or naphtha, invented around 919 AD during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The earliest reference to Greek fire in China was made in 917, written by Wu Renchen in his &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms&quot;. In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the &#x27;fierce fire oil&#x27; that could not be doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu (林禹) in his &quot;Wu-Yue Beishi&quot; (吳越備史), hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire. Lin Yu mentioned also that the &#x27;fierce fire oil&#x27; derived ultimately from China&#x27;s contact in the &#x27;southern seas&#x27;, with Arabia (大食國 &quot;Dashiguo&quot;). In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River) in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used &#x27;fire oil&#x27; to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames. The Chinese applied the use of double-piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and a downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame (as referred to in the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; manuscript of 1044). In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976 AD, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction. Documented also in later Chinese publications, illustrations and descriptions of mobile flamethrowers on four-wheel push carts appear in the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot;, written in 1044 (its illustration redrawn in 1601 as well). Advances in military technology aided the Song dynasty in its defense against hostile neighbours to the north, including the Mongols.

=== Islamic World ===
Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Khwārazmī in &quot;Mafātīḥ al&quot;-&quot;ʿUlūm&quot; (“Keys to the Sciences”) ca. 976 AD mentions the &quot;bāb al-midfa&quot; and the &quot;bāb al-mustaq&quot; which he said were parts of naphtha-throwers and projectors (&quot;al-naffātāt wa al-zarāqāt&quot;). Book of Ingenious Mechanical Device (&quot;Kitāb fī ma &#x27;rifat al-ḥiyal al-handasiyya&quot;) of 1206 by Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari mentioned about ejectors of naphtha (&quot;zarāqāt al-naft&quot;).

=== Vietnam ===
The book Hồ trường khu cơ by Dao Duy Tu describes a flamethrowing weapon called the fire tiger &quot;The fire-thrower is also called fire-tiger, has a large bulb about one meter long, when in battle it spits fire, the tube spits out pine resin, if it hits something, it immediately catches fire...&quot;. &quot;Because the fire burns fiercely, it is called fire-tiger&quot;. These weapons were later used by the Tay Son Army

=== 18th century ===
In 1702, the Prussian Army tested P. Lange&#x27;s &quot;serpent-fire-spray&quot; (Schlangen-Brand-Spritze) who produced a jet of fire wide and long; two years later it was rejected as useless.

Peter the Great&#x27;s chief engineer Vasily Dmitrievich Korchmin designed various incendiary weapons.such as incendiary rockets and furnaces for heating cannonball; two Russian ships the “Svyatoy Yakov” and “Landsou” were armed with flamethrower tubes designed by him. He also developed instructions for their use together with the Tsar.

In the 1750s a French engineer named Dupre, developed a new flammable mixture; it was tested in LeHavre and set fire to a sloop. During the British shelling of LeHavre in 1759, the French War Minister tried to obtain authorization to use this fuel.

=== 19th century ===
Although flamethrowers were never used in the American Civil War, &quot;Greek Fire&quot; shells were produced and used by Union troops during the Second Battle of Charleston Harbor.

During the 1871 siege of Paris, French chemist Marcellin Berthelot suggested pumping flaming petroleum at Prussian troops.

In 1898 Russian captain Sigern-Korn experimented with burning jets of kerosene for defensive use; in theory in they would be fired from parapets of fortifications. The idea was abandoned due to technical issues

=== Early 20th century ===
During the siege of Port Arthur, Japanese combat engineers used hand pumps to spray kerosene into Russian trenches. Once the Russians were covered with the flammable liquid, the Japanese would throw bundles of burning rags at them.

Before WW1 German pioneers used the Brandröhre M.95 a weapon consisting of a sheet metal tube ( wide and long) filled with an incendiary mixture, and a friction igniter activated by a lanyard. The Brandröhre was designed to be used against enemy casemates; a long pole was used to reach the target and the lanyard was pulled to ignite the fuel; producing a long stream of fire. Those weapons were deployed in six-man teams and were limited by their short range. In theory the Brandröhre was replaced by the flamethrower in 1909 but it was still in use in WW1; it was used during the assaults on Fort du Camp-des-Romains in 1914 and Fort Vaux in 1916.

Bernhard Reddeman, a German military officer and former fireman, converted steam powered fire engines into flamethrowers; his design was demonstrated in 1907.

The English word &quot;flamethrower&quot; is a loan-translation of , since the modern flamethrower was invented in Germany. The first flamethrower, in the modern sense, is usually credited to Richard Fiedler. He submitted evaluation models of his &quot;Flammenwerfer&quot; to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple igniting wick device in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some . It was a single-shot weapon—for burst firing, a new igniter section was attached each time. In 1905 Fiedler&#x27;s flamethrower was demonstrated to the Prussian Committee of Engineers. In 1908 Fiedler started working with Reddeman and made some adjustments to the design; an experimental pioneer company was created to further test the weapon.

It was not until 1911 that the German Army accepted their first real flamethrowing device, creating a specialist regiment of twelve companies equipped with Flammenwerfer Apparent. Despite this, use of fire in a World War I battle predated flamethrower use, with a petrol spray being ignited by an incendiary bomb in the Argonne-Meuse sector in October 1914.

The flamethrower was first used in World War I on 26 February 1916 when it was briefly used against the French outside Verdun. On 30 July 1915 it was first used in a concerted action, against British trenches at Hooge, where the lines were apart—even there, the casualties were caused mainly by soldiers being flushed into the open and then shot rather than from the fire itself. After two days of fighting the British had suffered casualties of 31 officers and 751 other ranks.

The success of the attack prompted the German Army to adopt the device on all fronts. Flamethrowers were used in squads of six during battles, at the start of an attack destroying the enemy and to the preceding the infantry advance.

The flamethrower was useful at short distances but had other limitations: it was cumbersome and difficult to operate and could only be safely fired from a trench, which limited its use to areas where the opposing trenches were less than the maximum range of the weapon, namely apart—which was not a common situation; the fuel would also only last for about a minute of continuous firing.

The German deployed flamethrowers during the war in more than 650 attacks.

The Ottoman Empire received 30 flamethrowers from Germany during the war.

German flamethrowers were also used by Bulgarian forces.

Austria-Hungary adopted German designs; but also developed its own flamethrowers in 1915. These included the M.15 Flammenwerfer, which required a crew of three men and was too unwieldy for offensive use; a defensive model and a more portable model were also produced. Austro-Hungarian flamethrowers were unreliable and long hoses were used to prevent the shooter from igniting the fuel tank

The British experimented with flamethrowers in the Battle of the Somme, during which they used experimental weapons called &quot;Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors&quot;, named for their inventor, William Howard Livens, a Royal Engineers officer. This weapon was enormous and completely non-portable. The weapon had an effective range of , which proved effective at clearing trenches, but with no other benefit the project was abandoned.

Two Morriss static flamethrowers were mounted in HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot; and several Hay portable flamethrowers were deployed by the Royal Navy during the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918. A British newspaper report of the action referred to the British flamethrowers only as &quot;flammenwerfer&quot;, using the German word.

The French Army deployed the Schilt family of flamethrowers, which were also used by the Italian Army.

In 1931 the São Paulo Public Force created an assault car section. The first vehicle to be incorporated was a tank built from a Caterpillar Twenty Two tractor, featuring a turret mounted flamethrower and four Hotchkiss machineguns on the hull. It was used in combat during the Constitutionalist Revolution, routing federal troop from a bridge in an engagement in Cruzeiro.

In the interwar period, at least four flamethrowers were used in the Chaco War by the Bolivian Army, during the unsuccessful assault on the Paraguayan stronghold of Nanawa in 1933. During the battle of Kilometer 7 to Saavedra, Major Walther Kohn rode in a flamethrower equipped tankette; due to heat he exited the tank to fight on foot and was killed in combat.

=== World War II ===
The flamethrower was used extensively during World War II. In 1939, the Wehrmacht first deployed man-portable flamethrowers against the Polish Post Office in Danzig. Subsequently, in 1942, the U.S. Army introduced its own man-portable flamethrower. The vulnerability of infantry carrying backpack flamethrowers and the weapon&#x27;s short range led to experiments with tank-mounted flamethrowers (flame tanks), which were used by many countries.

==== Axis use ====
=====Germany=====
The Germans made considerable use of the weapon (&quot;Flammenwerfer&quot; 35) during their invasion of the Netherlands and France, against fixed fortifications. World War II German army flamethrowers tended to have one large fuel tank with the pressurizer tank fastened to its back or side. Some German army flamethrowers occupied only the lower part of its wearer&#x27;s back, leaving the upper part of his back free for an ordinary rucksack.

Flamethrowers soon fell into disfavour. Flamethrowers were extensively used by German units in urban fights in Poland, both in 1943 in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and in 1944 in the Warsaw Uprising (see the Stroop Report and the article on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising). With the contraction of the Third Reich during the latter half of World War II, a smaller, more compact flamethrower known as the Einstossflammenwerfer 46 was produced.

Germany also used flamethrower vehicles, most of them based on the chassis of the Sd.Kfz. 251 half track and the Panzer II and Panzer III tanks, generally known as &quot;Flammpanzers&quot;.

The Germans also produced the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42, a flame-mine or flame fougasse, based on a Soviet version of the weapon. This was essentially a disposable, single use flamethrower that was buried alongside conventional land mines at key defensive points and triggered by either a trip-wire or a command wire. The weapon contained around of fuel, that was discharged within a second, to a second and a half, producing a flame with a range. One defensive installation found in Italy included seven of the weapons, carefully concealed and wired to a central control point.

=====Finland=====
During the Winter War Finland adopted the Italian Lanciafiamme Modello 35 as the Liekinheitin M/40; 176 flamethrowers were ordered but only 28 arrived before the end of the war.

Those flamethrowers were not used in the Winter War; but were issued to engineers during the Continuation War along with captured ROKS-2 flamethrowers

OT-130 and OT-133 flame tanks were captured from the Soviet Union and issued at the start of the Continuation War; they were considered impratical and later retrofitted with cannons.

In 1944 they developed and adopted the Liekinheitin M/44.

=====Italy=====

Italy employed man-portable flamethrowers and L3 Lf flame tanks during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935 to 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, and during World War II. The L3 Lf flame tank was a CV-33 or CV-35 tankette with a flamethrower operating from the machine gun mount. In the Northern Africa Theatre, the L3 Lf flame tank found little to no success. An L6 Lf flametank was also developed using the L6/40 light tank platform.

=====Japan=====

Japan used man-portable flamethrowers to clear fortified positions, in the Battle of Wake Island, Corregidor, Battle of the Tenaru on Guadalcanal and Battle of Milne Bay.

=====Romania=====
Flamethrowers were also used by the Royal Romanian Army. They were also planned to become self-propelled; the Mareșal tank destroyer was planned to have a command vehicle version armed with machine guns and a flamethrower.

==== Allies ====
=====Britain and the Commonwealth=====
The British World War II army flamethrowers, &quot;Ack Packs&quot;, had a doughnut-shaped fuel tank with a small spherical pressurizer gas tank in the middle. As a result, some troops nicknamed them &quot;lifebuoys&quot;. It was officially known as Flamethrower, Portable, No 2.

Extensive plans were made in 1940–1941 by the Petroleum Warfare Department to use flame fougasse static flame projectors in the event of an invasion, with around 50,000 barrel-based incendiary mines being deployed in 7,000 batteries throughout Southern England.

The British hardly used their man-portable systems, relying on Churchill Crocodile tanks in the European theatre. These tanks proved very effective against German defensive positions, and caused official Axis protests against their use. This flamethrower could produce a jet of flame exceeding . There are documented instances of German units summarily executing any captured British flame-tank crews.

In the Pacific theatre, Australian forces used converted Matilda tanks, known as Matilda Frogs.

=====United States=====
In the Pacific theatre, the U.S. Army used M-1 and M-2 flamethrowers to clear stubborn Japanese resistance from prepared defenses, caves, and trenches. Starting in New Guinea, through the closing stages on Guadalcanal and during the approach to and reconquest of the Philippines and then through the Okinawa campaign, the Army deployed hand-held, man-portable units.

Often flamethrower teams were made up of combat engineer units, later with troops of the chemical warfare service. The Army fielded more flamethrower units than the Marine Corps, and the Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service pioneered tank mounted flamethrowers on Sherman tanks (CWS-POA H-4). All the flamethrower tanks on Okinawa belonged to the 713th Provisional Tank Battalion, which was tasked with supporting all U.S. Army and Marine infantry. All Pacific mechanized flamethrower units were trained by Seabee specialists with Col. Unmacht&#x27;s CWS Flamethrower Group in Hawaii.

The U.S. Army used flamethrowers in Europe in much smaller numbers, though they were available for special employments. Flamethrowers were deployed during the Normandy landings in order to clear Axis fortifications. Also, most boat teams on Omaha Beach included a two-man flamethrower team.

The Marine Corps used the backpack-type M2A1-7 and M2-2 flamethrowers, finding them useful in clearing Japanese trench and bunker complexes. The first known USMC use of the man portable flamethrower was against the formidable defenses at Tarawa in November 1943. The Marines pioneered the use of Ronson-equipped M-3 Stuart tanks in the Marianas. These were known as SATAN flame tanks. Though effective, they lacked the armour to safely engage fortifications and were phased out in favour of the better-armoured M4 Sherman tanks. USMC Flamethrower Shermans were produced at Schofield Barracks by Seabees attached to the Chemical Warfare Service under Col. Unmacht. CWS designated M4s with &quot;CWS-POA-H&quot; for &quot;Chemical Warfare Service Pacific Ocean Area, Hawaii&quot; plus a flamethrower number. The Marines had previously deployed large Navy flamethrowers mounted on LVT-4 AMTRACs at Peleliu. Late in the war, both services operated LVT-4 and −5 amphibious flametanks in limited numbers. Both the Army and the Marines still used their infantry-portable systems, despite the arrival of adapted Sherman tanks with the Ronson system (cf. flame tanks).

In cases where the Japanese were entrenched in deep caves, the flames often consumed the available oxygen, suffocating the occupants. Many Japanese troops interviewed post war said they were terrified more by flamethrowers than any other American weapon. Flamethrower operators were often the first U.S. troops targeted.

===== Soviet Union =====
The FOG-1 and −2 flamethrowers were stationary devices used in defense. They could also be categorized as a projecting incendiary mine. The FOG had only one cylinder of fuel, which was compressed using an explosive charge and projected through a nozzle. The November 1944 issue of the US War Department &quot;Intelligence Bulletin&quot; refers to these &quot;Fougasse flame throwers&quot; being used in the Soviet defense of Stalingrad. The FOG-1 was directly copied by the Germans as the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42.

Unlike the flamethrowers of the other powers during World War II, the Soviets were the only ones to consciously attempt to camouflage their infantry flamethrowers. With the ROKS-2 flamethrower this was done by disguising the flame projector as a standard-issue rifle, such as the Mosin–Nagant, and the fuel tanks as a standard infantryman&#x27;s rucksack. This was to try to stop the flamethrower operator from being specifically targeted by enemy fire. This &quot;rifle&quot; had a working action which was used to cycle blank igniter cartridges.

=== 1945–1980 ===

==== US military ====

The United States Marines used flamethrowers in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The M132 armored flamethrower, an M113 armored personnel carrier with a mounted flamethrower, was successfully used in the conflict.

Flamethrowers have not been in the U.S. arsenal since 1978, when the Department of Defense unilaterally stopped using them ⁠— ⁠the last American infantry flamethrower was the Vietnam-era M9-7. They have been deemed of questionable effectiveness in modern combat, though some have made the case for their tactical employment.

U.S. army flamethrowers developed up to the M9 model. In the M9 the propellant tank is a sphere below the left fuel tank and does not project backwards.

=====Israel=====

Crude homemade flamethrowers were built by Irgun in the late 1940s.

=====China=====

The PLA adopted the Type 74 flamethrower, a copy of the Soviet LPO-50. It was later used in the Sino-Vietnamese War.

=====Vietnam=====

LPO-50 and Type 74 flamethrowers were used by NVA forces during the Vietnam War.

=====Iraq=====

The Iraqi army used LPO-50 flamethrowers during the Iran-Iraq War.

===Post-1980s===

Non-flamethrower incendiary weapons remain in modern military arsenals. Thermobaric weapons may have been fielded in Afghanistan by the United States (2008) and have been used by Russia in Ukraine (2022). The U.S. and U.S.S.R. both developed a rocket launcher specifically for the deployment of incendiary munitions, respectively the M202 FLASH and the RPO &quot;Rys&quot; ancestor of the RPO-A Shmel.

==== Vietnam ====
The Type 74 is still being used by the Vietnamese Army.

==== French assault on Ouvéa cave (1988) ====

On 22 April 1988, Kanak rebels took 36 French hostages in Ouvéa island, New Caledonia, most of them gendarms and military personnel. On 5 May, after weeks of fruitless negotiations, a team of gendarms and paratroopers from the French Army launched a rescue operation. During the assault, a rebel machine gun position was neutralized using a flamethrower. All hostages were eventually set free.

==== Provisional IRA ====
In 1981 the FBI foiled an attempt by New York-based gun runner George Harrison to smuggle an M2 flamethrower to Ireland for the IRA. In the last stages of the Troubles, during the mid-1980s, the IRA smuggled in Soviet LPO-50 military flamethrowers (supplied to them by the Libyan government) into Northern Ireland. An IRA team riding on an improvised armoured truck used one of these flamethrowers, among other weapons, to storm a British Army permanent checkpoint in Derryard, near Rosslea, on 13 December 1989. Some months later, on 4 March 1990, the IRA attacked an RUC station in Stewartstown, County Tyrone, using an improvised flamethrower consisting of a manure-spreader towed by a tractor to spray of a petrol/diesel mix to engulf the base in flames, and then opened fire with rifles and an anti-tank rocket launcher. Another IRA unit carried two attacks in less than a year with another improvised flamethrower towed by a tractor on a British Army watchtower, the Borucki sangar, in Crossmaglen, County Armagh, also in the early 1990s. The first incident occurred on 12 December 1992, when the bunker was manned by Scots Guards, and the second on 12 November 1993. The device used as launcher was also a manure spreader, which doused the facility with fuel, ignited few seconds later by a small explosion. In the 1993 action, a nine-metre-high fireball engulfed the tower for seven minutes. The four Grenadier Guards inside the outpost were rescued by a Saxon armoured vehicle. Incendiary improvised devices were also proven by the republican paramilitaries, such as an IRA grenade attack on a British Army patrol on 4 April 1993 in Carrickmore, County Tyrone; the device consisted of of semtex and of petrol; the bomb exploded, but the fuel failed to ignite. A soldier was thrown several metres across the road by the blast.

==== Brazil ====
As of 2003 the locally made Hydroar T1M1 flamethrower was still being used by the 1º Batalhão de Forças Especiais.

==== China ====
The Chinese Army still issues the Type 74 flamethrower.

During an operation to hunt down the militant group responsible for the 2015 Aksu colliery attack, after using tear gas and flash grenades to no avail, Chinese paramilitary forces resorted to flamethrowers to root out suspected militants who were hiding in a cave.

==== Iraq conflict ====
Captain Shannon Johnson requested colonel John A. Toolan to supply his company with flamethrowers during the Battle of Fallujah; however no flamethrowers were issued.

The People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran claimed flamethrowers were used in the 2013 Camp Ashraf massacre

==== Italy ====
As of 2012 the locally made T-148/B flamethrower was still being used by the Italian Army

==== Myanmar ====
Flamethrowers have been used by the Tatmadaw during attacks on Rohingya villages during the Rohingya genocide.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War ====
On 8 February 2017, separatist leader Mikhail &#x27;Givi&#x27; Tolstykh was killed when an RPO-A Shmel rocket-assisted flamethrower was fired at his office in Donetsk.

On 21 November 2022, nine months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian sources claim that artillery and &quot;heavy flamethrowers&quot; were employed against a Ukrainian concentration of troops near Kupyansk, Kharkiv Oblast. Russian sources use the term &quot;heavy flamethrowers&quot; to describe TOS-1 multiple thermobaric rocket launchers.

== International law ==
Despite some assertions, flamethrowers are not generally banned. However the United Nations Protocol on Incendiary Weapons forbids the use of incendiary weapons (including flamethrowers) against civilians. It also forbids their use against forests unless they are used to conceal combatants or other military objectives.

== Owning a personal flamethrower ==

In the United States, private ownership of a flamethrower is not restricted by federal law, because a flamethrower is a tool, not a firearm. Flamethrowers are legal in 48 states and restricted in California and Maryland.

In California, unlicensed possession of a flame-throwing device—statutorily defined as &quot;any non-stationary and transportable device designed or intended to emit or propel a burning stream of combustible or flammable liquid a distance of at least &quot; H&amp;W 12750 (a)—is a misdemeanor punishable with a county jail term not exceeding one year &quot;or&quot; with a fine not exceeding $10,000 (CA H&amp;W 12761). Licenses to use flamethrowers are issued by the state fire marshal, and they may use any criteria for issuing or not issuing that license which is deemed fit, but must publish those criteria in the California Code of Regulations, Title 11, Section 970 et seq.

In the United Kingdom, flamethrowers are &quot;prohibited weapons&quot; under section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968 and article 45(1)(f) of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 and possession of a flamethrower would carry a sentence of up to ten years&#x27; imprisonment. On 16 June 1994, a man attacked school pupils at Sullivan Upper School, just outside Belfast, with a home-made flamethrower.

A South African inventor brought the Blaster car-mounted flamethrower to market in 1998 as a security device to defend against carjackers. It has since been discontinued, with the inventor moving on to pocket-sized self-defence flamethrowers.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc. and owner of SpaceX, developed a &quot;not a flamethrower&quot; for public sale through his business, The Boring Company, selling 20,000 units. This device uses liquid propane gas rather than a stream of gasoline, making it more akin to a torch, like those commonly available at home and garden centers.

== Other uses ==
Flamethrowers are occasionally used for igniting controlled burns for land management and agriculture. For example, in the production of sugar cane, where are burned to get rid of the dry dead leaves which clog harvesters, and incidentally kill any lurking venomous snakes. More commonly, a driptorch or a flare (fusee) is used.

U.S. troops allegedly used flamethrowers on the streets of Washington, D.C. (mentioned in a December 1998 article in the &quot;San Francisco Flier&quot;), as one of several clearance methods used for the surprisingly large amount of snow that fell before the presidential inauguration of John F. Kennedy. A history article on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notes, &quot;In the end, the task force employed hundreds of dump trucks, front-end loaders, sanders, plows, rotaries, and allegedly flamethrowers to clear the way&quot;.

Flamethrowers were employed by U.S. combat engineers during the Iraq War; they were used to clear brush and eliminate hiding spots for insurgents

A squad armed with backpack flamethrowers had an important part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony. They had one big tank each. They could make a flame about long.

In April 2014 it was reported by South Korea&#x27;s &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; newspaper without confirmation that a North Korean government official, O Sang-Hon, Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Public Security, was executed by flamethrower.

In August 2016 it was reported that the Islamic State used flamethrowers to execute six of its commanders in Tal Afar as punishment for their attempt to escape to Syria

It has been known for police to fill a &quot;flamethrower&quot;, not with flammable liquid, but rather with tear gas dissolved in water as a riot-control device; see Converted Flamethrower 40.

<text>Radical environmentalism is a grass-roots branch of the larger environmental movement that emerged from an ecocentrism-based frustration with the co-option of mainstream environmentalism.

== As a movement ==

=== Philosophy ===
The radical environmental movement aspires to what scholar Christopher Manes calls &quot;a new kind of environmental activism: iconoclastic, uncompromising, discontented with traditional conservation policy, at times illegal&quot;. Radical environmentalism presupposes a need to reconsider Western ideas of religion and philosophy, including capitalism, patriarchy, and globalization, sometimes through &quot;resacralising&quot; and reconnecting with nature.

The movement is typified by leaderless resistance organizations such as Earth First!, which subscribe to the idea of taking direct action in defense of Mother Nature including civil disobedience, ecotage and monkeywrenching. Movements such as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and Earth Liberation Army (ELA) also take this form of action, although focusing on economic sabotage, rather than civil disobedience. Radical environmentalists can include earth liberationists, as well as anarcho-primitivists, animal liberationists, bioregionalists, deep ecologists, eco-nationalism, ecopsychologists, green anarchists, and less often anti-globalization and anti-capitalist protesters, ecofeminists, neo-Pagans, Third Positionists, and Wiccans. This does not mean that everyone subscribing to those beliefs and values should be considered a radical environmentalist.

=== History ===


While many people believe that the first significant radical environmentalist group was Greenpeace, which made use of direct action beginning in the 1970s to confront whaling ships and nuclear weapons testers, others within the movement, argues as Earth Liberation Front (ELF) prisoner Jeff &quot;Free&quot; Luers, suggests that the movement was established centuries ago. He often writes that the concept of &quot;eco-defence&quot; was born shortly after the existence of the human race, claiming it is only recently that within the modern development of human society, and individuals losing touch with the earth and its wild roots, that more radical tactics and political theories have emerged.

The alternative tactic of using explosive and incendiary devices was established in 1976 by John Hanna and others as the Environmental Life Force (ELF), also now known as the &quot;original ELF&quot;. The group conducted a campaign of armed actions in northern California and Oregon, later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna&#x27;s arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the Salinas, California airport on May Day, 1977. It wasn&#x27;t until over a decade and a half later that this form of guerrilla warfare resurfaced as the Earth Liberation Front using the same ELF acronym.

In 1980 Earth First! was founded by Dave Foreman and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the Edward Abbey novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, Earth First! made use of such techniques as treesitting and treespiking to stop logging companies, as well as other activities targeted towards mining, road construction, suburban development and energy companies.

The organization were committed to nonviolent ecotage techniques from the group&#x27;s inception, with those that split from the movement in the 1990s including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) in 1992, naming themselves after the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) who formed in the 1970s. Three years later in Canada, inspired by the ELF in Europe the first &quot;Earth Liberation&quot; direct action occurred, but this time as the Earth Liberation Army (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and monkeywrenching as a tool, although no guidelines had been published.

The ELF gained national attention for a series of actions which earned them the label of eco-terrorists, including the burning of a ski resort in Vail, Colorado in 1998 that the ALF also claimed credit for —and the burning of an SUV dealership in Oregon in 1999. The defendants in the case were later charged in the FBI&#x27;s &quot;Operation Backfire&quot;, along with other arsons and cases, which were later named by environmentalists as the Green Scare; alluding to the Red Scare, periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks several laws were passed increasing the penalties for ecoterrorism, and hearings were held in Congress discussing the activities of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action since both groups forbid harming human or non-human life. It was then announced in 2003 that &quot;eco-terrorist&quot; attacks, known as &quot;ecotage&quot;, had increased from the ELF, ELA and the &quot;Environmental Rangers&quot;, another name used by activists when engaging in similar activity.

In 2005 the FBI announced that the ELF was America&#x27;s greatest domestic terrorist threat, responsible for over 1,200 &quot;criminal incidents&quot; amounting to tens of millions of dollars in damage to property, with the United States Department of Homeland Security confirming this regarding the ALF and ELF.

Plane Stupid then was launched in 2005, in an attempt to combat the growing airport expansions in the UK using direct action with a year later the first Camp for Climate Action being held with 600 people attending a protest called &quot;Reclaim Power&quot; converging on Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire and attempted to shut it down. There were thirty-eight arrests, with four breaching the fence and the railway line being blocked.

Radical environmentalism has been called a new religious movement by Bron Taylor (1998). Taylor contends that &quot;Radical environmentalism is best understood as a new religious movement that views environmental degradation as an assault on a sacred, natural world.&quot;

Some writers have used it to refer to the hypothetical danger of future dystopian governments, which might resort to fascist radical environmentalist policies in order to deal with environmental issues. Themes of eco-fascism and radical environmentalism can be found in movies and literature like &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, &quot;Hunger Games&quot;, &quot;Z.P.G.&quot;, and &quot;My Diary from 2091&quot;.

=== Offshoots ===

Several philosophies have arisen from ideas in radical environmentalism that include deep ecology, ecofeminism, social ecology and bioregionalism.

Deep Ecology is attributed to Arne Naess and is defined as &quot;a normative, ecophilosophical movement that is inspired and fortified in part by our experience as humans in nature and in part by ecological knowledge.&quot;

A rising Deep Ecologist among radical environmentalist circles is Pentti Linkola, regarded as the founder of ecofascism, and author of the book Can Life Prevail? A Radical Approach to the Environmental Crisis.

Ecofeminism originated in the 1970s and draws a parallel between the oppression of women in patriarchal societies and the oppression of the environment.

Social Ecology is an idea attributed to Murray Bookchin, who argued that in order to save the environment, human society needed to copy the structure of nature and decentralize both socially and economically.

Bioregionalism is a philosophy that focuses on the practical application of Social Ecology, and theorizes on &quot;building and living in human social communities that are compatible with ecological systems&quot;.

<text>Year 476 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Rutilus and Structus (or, less frequently, year 278 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 476 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Nathuram Vinayak Godse (19 May 1910 – 15 November 1949) () was the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. He was a Hindu nationalist from Maharashtra who shot Gandhi in the chest three times at point blank range at a multi-faith prayer meeting in Birla House in New Delhi on 30 January 1948. 

Godse was a member of the political party, the Hindu Mahasabha; and a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary volunteer organization; and a popularizer of the work of his mentor Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who had created the ideology of Hindutva. 

Godse had two unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi in 1944 before he succeeded the third time. After the 1948 assassination, Godse claimed Gandhi favoured the political demands of British India&#x27;s Muslims during the partition of India of 1947. Soon after Mahatma Gandhi had fallen from the fatal shots at the prayer meeting, and while the attendant crowd was in shock, Godse was grasped and restrained by Herbert Reiner Jr., a vice-consul at the new American embassy in Delhi who was also attending; eventually, Godse was taken away by the police. Godse had plotted the assassination with Narayan Apte and six others. After a trial that lasted over a year, Godse was sentenced to death on 8 November 1949. Although pleas for clemency were made by Gandhi&#x27;s two sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, they were turned down by India&#x27;s prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel, and Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and Godse was executed at the Ambala Central Jail on 15 November 1949.

==Early life==
Nathuram Vinayakrao Godse was born into a Maharashtrian Chitpavan Brahmin family. His father, Vinayak Vamanrao Godse, was a postal employee; his mother was Lakshmi (née Godavari). At birth, he was named Ramachandra. Nathuram was given his name due to his parents&#x27; fear that a curse targeted their male children, caused by the loss of their three previous sons. Young Ramachandra was therefore brought up as a girl for the first few years of his life, including having his nose pierced and being made to wear a nose-ring (&quot;nath&quot; in Marathi). It was then that he earned the nickname &quot;Nathuram&quot; (literally &quot;Ram with a nose-ring&quot;). After his younger brother was born, they switched to treating him as a boy.

Godse attended the local school at Baramati through the fifth standard, after which he was sent to live with an aunt in Pune so that he could study at an English-language school.

==Political career and beliefs==

Godse dropped out of high school and became an activist with Hindu nationalist organisations Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS; National Volunteer Organisation) and Hindu Mahasabha, although the exact dates of his membership are uncertain.

==RSS membership==

Godse joined RSS in Sangli (Maharashtra) in 1932 as a &quot;boudhik karyawah&quot; (ground worker), and simultaneously remained a member of the Hindu Mahasabha, both right-wing organisations. He often wrote articles in newspapers to publicise his thoughts. During this time, Godse and M. S. Golwalkar, later RSS chief, often worked together, and they translated Babarao Savarkar&#x27;s book &quot;Rashtra Mimansa&quot; into English. They had a falling out when Golwalkar took the entire credit for this translation. In the early 1940s, Godse formed his own organisation, &quot;Hindu Rashtra Dal&quot; on the Vijayadashami day of 1942, though he continued to remain a member of the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha.

In 1946, Godse claimed to have left the RSS and moved to the Hindu Mahasabha over the issue of the partition of India. However, historical sources do not corroborate this claim; an investigation published by The Caravan in January 2020 revealed that up until his final days, Godse was listed as a member in records kept by the RSS of meetings that took place long after he was supposed to have left the organisation. His family has also said that he had never left the RSS, highlighting that he held membership at the RSS as well as the Hindu Mahasabha. Godse&#x27;s 1946 claim is also refuted by his first deposition in Marathi after he assassinated Gandhi, where he says that while he did join the Hindu Mahasabha, &quot;I remained active in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.&quot;

==Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi==
In May 1944, Godse attempted to assassinate Gandhi with a knife. He led a group of 15 to 20 young men who rushed at Gandhi during a prayer meeting at Panchgani. Godse and his group was prevented by the crowds from reaching Gandhi. He was released due to Gandhi&#x27;s own policy of declining to press criminal charges.

In September 1944, Godse again led another group to block Gandhi&#x27;s passage from Sevagram to Mumbai. This time Godse was arrested with a dagger and he uttered threats to kill Gandhi. He was released again owing to Gandhi&#x27;s policy of not pressing criminal charges.

At 05:05 pm on 30 January 1948, as Gandhi made his way to a prayer meeting on a raised lawn behind Birla House, a mansion in New Delhi, where he was staying, Godse stepped out of the crowd flanking his path to the dais. He fired three bullets into Gandhi&#x27;s chest. Gandhi fell immediately, sending the attendant crowd into a state of shock. Herbert Reiner Jr., a 32-year-old vice-consul at the new American embassy in Delhi, was the first to rush forward and grasp Godse by the shoulders, spinning him into the arms of some military personnel, who disarmed him. Reiner then held Godse by the neck and shoulders until he was taken away by the military and police. Reiner reported later that in the moments before he apprehended him, Godse looked a little stunned at how easily he had carried out his plan. Gandhi was taken back to his room in Birla House, where he died soon thereafter.

==Trial and execution==
Godse was put on trial at the Punjab High Court, at Peterhoff, Shimla. On 8 November 1949, he was sentenced to death. Although pleas for commutation were made by Gandhi&#x27;s two sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, they were turned down by India&#x27;s prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and Godse was hanged at Ambala Central Jail on 15 November 1949.

==Aftermath==
Millions of Indians mourned Gandhi&#x27;s assassination; the Hindu Mahasabha was vilified and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was temporarily banned.

The RSS has consistently denied any connection with Godse. It has maintained that Godse &quot;left RSS in the mid-1930s&quot;. However, Nathuram Godse&#x27;s brother Gopal Godse stated that all the Godse brothers were members of the RSS at the time of the assassination and blamed the RSS for disowning them. The other members of the Godse family too have denied that he ever left the RSS. He remained in the position of &quot;boudhik karyawah&quot; (intellectual worker) in the RSS till his death.

==Attempts at image rehabilitation==
&quot;Me Nathuram Godse Boltoy&quot; (This is Nathuram Godse Speaking) is a two-act play written in the Marathi language by Pradeep Dalvi. It is based on the book &quot;May It Please Your Honour&quot; written by Gopal Godse. According to Karline McLain, the play &quot;enacts Godse&#x27;s defense plea&quot; and thus &quot;explores the assassination of Gandhi and the trial of Godse from Godse&#x27;s point of view.

In 2014, following the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s rise to power, the Hindu Mahasabha began attempts to rehabilitate Godse and portray him as a patriot. It requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to install a bust of Godse. It created a documentary film &quot;Desh Bhakt Nathuram Godse&quot; (Patriot Nathuram Godse) for release on the death anniversary of Gandhi on 30 January 2015.
There were attempts to build a temple for Godse and to celebrate 30 January as a &quot;Shaurya Diwas&quot; (&quot;Bravery Day&quot;). A civil suit was filed in Pune Court asking for a ban on the documentary film.

In May 2019, in the lead up to the final phase of Indian elections, BJP&#x27;s candidate from Bhopal, Pragya Thakur, called Godse a &quot;patriot&quot;. Facing intense backlash, she apologised later.

As Hindutva politics became more widespread in India, there have been attempts to commemorate Godse. The city of Meerut was proposed to be renamed after him but the possibility of such a name change was ruled out by the District Magistrate.

<doc id="70875" wikidata="Q35325" url="?curid=70875" title="Enochian">
<text>Enochian ( ) is an occult constructed language—said by its originators to have been received from angels—recorded in the private journals of John Dee and his colleague Edward Kelley in late 16th-century England. Kelley was a scryer who worked with Dee in his magical investigations. The language is integral to the practice of Enochian magic.

The language found in Dee&#x27;s and Kelley&#x27;s journals encompasses a limited textual corpus. Linguist Donald Laycock, an Australian Skeptic, studied the Enochian journals, and argues against any extraordinary features. The untranslated texts of the &quot;Liber Loagaeth&quot; manuscript recall the patterns of glossolalia rather than true language. Dee did not distinguish the &quot;Liber Loagaeth&quot; material from the translated language of the &quot;Calls&quot;, which is more like an artificial language. This language was called Angelical by Dee and later came to be referred to as &quot;Enochian&quot; by subsequent writers. The phonology and grammar resemble English, though the translations are not sufficient to work out any regular morphology. Some Enochian words resemble words and proper names in the Bible, but most have no apparent etymology.

Dee&#x27;s journals also refer to this language as &quot;Celestial Speech&quot;, &quot;First Language of God-Christ&quot;, &quot;Holy Language&quot;, or &quot;Language of Angels&quot;. He also referred to it as &quot;[[Adamic language|Adamical]]&quot; because, according to Dee&#x27;s angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The term &quot;Enochian&quot; comes from Dee&#x27;s assertion that the Biblical patriarch Enoch had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

== History ==

According to Tobias Churton in his text &quot;The Golden Builders&quot;, the concept of an Angelic or antediluvian language was common during Dee&#x27;s time. If one could speak the language of angels, it was believed one could directly interact with them.

=== Seeking contact and reported visions ===
In 1581, Dee mentioned in his personal journals that God had sent &quot;good angels&quot; to communicate directly with prophets. In 1582, Dee teamed up with the seer Edward Kelley, although Dee had used several other seers previously. With Kelley&#x27;s help as a scryer, Dee set out to establish lasting contact with the angels. Their work resulted, among other things, in the reception of Angelical, now more commonly known as Enochian.

The reception started on March 26, 1583, when Kelley reported visions in the crystal of a 21-lettered alphabet. A few days later, Kelley started receiving what became the book &quot;Liber Loagaeth&quot; (&quot;Book [of] Speech from God&quot;). The book consists of 49 great letter tables, or squares made of 49 by 49 letters. (However, each table has a front and a back side, making 98 tables of 49×49 letters altogether.) Dee and Kelley said the angels never translated the texts in this book.

=== Receiving the &quot;Angelic Keys&quot; ===
About a year later, at the court of King Stephen Báthory in Kraków, where both alchemists stayed for some time, another set of texts was reportedly received through Kelley. These texts comprise 48 poetic verses with English translations, which in Dee&#x27;s manuscripts are called , or &quot;Angelic Keys&quot;. Dee was apparently intending to use these &quot;Keys&quot; to open the &quot;Gates of Understanding&quot; represented by the magic squares in &quot;Liber Loagaeth&quot;:

== Phonology and writing system ==
The language was recorded primarily in Latin script. However, individual words written in Enochian script &quot;appear sporadically throughout the manuscripts&quot;. There are 21 letters in the script; one letter appears with or without a diacritic dot. Dee mapped these letters of the &quot;Adamical alphabet&quot; onto 22 of the letters of the English alphabet, treating U and V as positional variants (as was common at the time) and omitting the English letters J, K, and W. The Enochian script is written from right to left in John Dee&#x27;s diary. Different documents have slightly different forms of the script. The alphabet also shares many graphical similarities to a script, also attributed to the prophet Enoch, that appeared in the &quot;Voarchadumia Contra Alchimiam&quot; of Johannes Pantheus, a copy of which Dee is known to have owned.

The phonology of Enochian is &quot;thoroughly English&quot;, apart from difficult sequences such as &quot;bdrios&quot;, &quot;excolphabmartbh&quot;, &quot;longamphlg&quot;, &quot;lapch&quot;, etc. Similarly, Enochian orthography closely follows Early Modern English orthography, for example in having soft and hard and , and in using digraphs , , , and for the sounds , , , and . Laycock mapped Enochian orthography to its sound system and says, &quot;the resulting pronunciation makes it sound much more like English than it looks at first sight&quot;. However, the difficult strings of consonants and vowels in words such as &quot;ooaona&quot;, &quot;paombd&quot;, &quot;smnad&quot; and &quot;noncf&quot; are the kind of pattern one gets by joining letters from a text together in an arbitrary pattern. As Laycock notes, &quot;The reader can test this by taking, for example, every tenth letter on this page, and dividing the string of letters into words. The &#x27;text&#x27; created will tend to look rather like Enochian.&quot;

;Alphabet
The Enochian letters, with their letter names and English equivalents as given by Dee, and pronunciations as reconstructed by Laycock, are as follows. Modern pronunciation conventions vary, depending on the affiliations of the practitioner.

A number of fonts for the Enochian script are available. They use the ASCII range, with the letters assigned to the codepoints of their English equivalents.

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===
The grammar is for the most part without articles or prepositions. Adjectives are quite rare. Aaron Leitch identifies several affixes in Enochian, including &quot;-o&quot; (indicating &#x27;of&#x27;) and &quot;-ax&quot; (which functions like &quot;-ing&quot; in English). Leitch observes that, unlike English, Enochian appears to have a vocative case, citing Dee&#x27;s note in the margin of the First Table of &quot;Loagaeth&quot; – &quot;Befes the vocative case of Befafes&quot;.

==== Compounds ====
Compounds are frequent in the Enochian corpus. Modifiers and indicators are typically compounded with the nouns and verbs modified or indicated. These compounds can occur with demonstrative pronouns and conjunctions, as well as with various forms of the verb &#x27;to be&#x27;. The compounding of nouns with adjectives or other verbs is less common. Compounds may exhibit variant spellings of the words combined.

==== Conjugation ====
Conjugation can result in spelling changes which can appear to be random or haphazard. Due to this, Aaron Leitch has expressed doubt as to whether Enochian actually has conjugations. The very scant evidence of Enochian verb conjugation seems quite reminiscent of English, including the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; which is highly irregular.

Laycock reports that the largest number of forms are recorded for &#x27;be&#x27; and for &quot;goh-&quot; &#x27;say&#x27;:
::


Note that &quot;christeos&quot; &#x27;let there be&#x27; might be from &#x27;Christ&#x27;, and if so is not part of a conjugation.

For negation of verbs, two constructions are attested: e.g. &quot;chis ge&quot; &#x27;are not&#x27; (&quot;chis&quot; &#x27;they are&#x27;) and &quot;ip uran&quot; &#x27;not see&#x27; (&quot;uran&quot; &#x27;see&#x27;).

==== Pronouns ====
While Enochian does have personal pronouns, they are rare and used in ways that can be difficult to understand. Relative possessive pronouns do exist but are used sparingly.

Attested personal pronouns (Dee&#x27;s material only):
::


Demonstrative pronouns: &quot;oi&quot; &#x27;this&#x27;, &quot;unal&quot; &#x27;these, those&#x27;, &quot;priaz(i)&quot; &#x27;those&#x27;.

=== Syntax ===
Word order closely follows English, except for the dearth of articles and prepositions. Adjectives, although rare, typically precede the noun as in English.

== Vocabulary and corpus ==
Laycock notes that there are about 250 different words in the corpus of Enochian texts, more than half of which occur only once. A few resemble words in the Bible – mostly proper names – in both sound and meaning. For example, &quot;luciftias&quot; &quot;brightness&quot; resembles Lucifer &quot;the light-bearer&quot;; &quot;babalond&quot; &quot;wicked, harlot&quot; resembles Babylon. Leitch notes a number of root words in Enochian. He lists &quot;Doh&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Ia&quot;, &quot;Iad&quot;, among others, as likely root words. While the &quot;Angelic Keys&quot; contain most of the known vocabulary of Enochian, dozens of further words are found throughout Dee&#x27;s journals.

Thousands of additional, undefined words are contained in the &quot;Liber Loagaeth&quot;. Laycock notes that the material in &quot;Liber Loagaeth&quot; appears to be different from the language of the &#x27;Calls&#x27; found in the &quot;Angelic Keys&quot;, which appear to have been generated from the tables and squares of the &quot;Loagaeth&quot;. According to Laycock:

=== Dictionaries ===
There have been several compilations of Enochian words made to form Enochian dictionaries. A scholarly study is Donald Laycock&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Enochian Dictionary&quot;. Also useful is Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Gmicalzoma: An Enochian Dictionary&quot;.

== Representation of numbers ==
The number system is inexplicable. It seems possible to identify the numerals from 0 to 10:
*0 – T
*1 – L, EL, L-O, ELO, LA, LI, LIL
*2 – V, VI-I-V, VI-VI
*3 – D, R
*4 – S, ES
*5 – O
*6 – N, NORZ
*7 – Q
*8 – P
*9 – M, EM
*10 – X

However, Enochian texts contain larger numbers written in alphabetical form, and there is no discernible system behind them:
*12 – OS
*19 – AF
*22 – OP
*24 – OL
*26 – OX
*28 – OB, NI
*31 – GA
*33 – PD
*42 – VX
*456 – CLA
*1000 – MATB

*1,636 – QUAR
*3,663 – MIAN
*5,678 – DAOX
*6,332 – ERAN
*6,739 – DARG
*7,336 – TAXS
*7,699 – ACAM
*8,763 – EMOD
*9,639 – MAPM
*9,996 – CIAL
*69,636 – PEOAL
As Laycock put it, &quot;the test of any future spirit-revelation of the Enochian language will be the explanation of this numerical system.&quot;

== Relation to other languages ==
Dee believed Enochian to be the Adamic language universally spoken before the confusion of tongues. However, modern analysis shows Enochian to be an English-like constructed language. Word order closely follows English, except for the dearth of articles and prepositions. The very scant evidence of Enochian verb conjugation is likewise reminiscent of English, more so than with Semitic languages such as Hebrew, which Dee said were debased versions of the Enochian language.

<text>The Belcher Islands () are an archipelago in the southeast part of Hudson Bay near the centre of the Nastapoka arc. The Belcher Islands are spread out over almost . Administratively, they belong to the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. The hamlet of Sanikiluaq (where the majority of the inhabitants of the Belcher Islands live) is on the north coast of Flaherty Island and is the southernmost in Nunavut. Along with Flaherty Island, the other large islands are Kugong Island, Tukarak Island, and Innetalling Island. Other main islands in the 1,500-island archipelago are Moore Island, Wiegand Island, Split Island, Snape Island, and Mavor Island, while island groups include the Sleeper Islands, King George Islands, and Bakers Dozen Islands.

==History==
The archaeological evidence present on the islands indicates that they were inhabited by the Dorset culture between 500 BCE and 1000 CE. Centuries later, from 1200 to 1500, the Thule people made their presence on the islands.

The first European to encounter the islands was English sea explorer Henry Hudson, the namesake of Hudson Bay, who sighted the islands in 1610. In 1670, the islands and the entirety of Hudson Bay drainage basin were designated by the English king, Charles II, as Rupert&#x27;s Land, managed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The islands are named after Royal Navy Admiral Sir Edward Belcher (1799–1877).

In the early 19th century, caribou herds which lived on the islands disappeared. In an alternative effort to find warm clothing, the inhabitants of the islands sought the down of eider ducks, seaducks who nest on the island. In 1870, Rupert&#x27;s Land was ceded to the Northwest Territories.

Before 1914, English-speaking cartographers knew very little about the Belcher Islands, which they showed on maps as specks, much smaller than their true extent. In that year a map showing them, drawn by George Weetaltuk, came into the hands of Robert Flaherty, and cartographers began to represent them more accurately.

In 1941, a religious movement led by Charley Ouyerack, Peter Sala, and his sister Mina caused the death by blows or exposure of nine persons, an occurrence that came to be known as the Belcher Island Murders.

In 1999, when Nunavut was separated from Northwest Territories, the Belcher Islands were included within Nunavut, along with most islands in Hudson Bay.

==Geology==

=== General geology ===
The geologic units of the Belcher Group, which forms the Belcher Islands, were deposited during the Paleoproterozoic. Combined with other Paleoproterozoic units that occur along the edge of the Superior Craton, the Belcher Group forms part of the Circum-Superior Belt.

From youngest to oldest, the Belcher Group is composed of:

* Loaf Formation (molasse)
* Omarolluk Formation (flysch)
* Flaherty Formation (flood basalt)
* Kipalu Formation (iron formation)
* Mukpollo Formation (sandstone)
* Rowatt Formation (shallow water carbonate)
* Laddie Formation (deep marine red bed)
* Costello Formation (carbonate slope deposit)
* Mavor Formation (stromatolite reef complex)
* Tukarak Formation (shallow water carbonate)
* Fairweather Formation (shallow water carbonate)
* Eskimo Formation (flood basalt)
* Kasegalik Formation (sabkha)

The oldest part of the Belcher Group, the Kasegalik Formation, was deposited between 2.0185 and 2.0154 billion years ago. The Kasegalik Formation also contains the oldest unambiguous Cyanobacteria microfossils. Much of the Belcher Group strata were deposited under intertidal to shallow-water conditions, although the Mavor Formation formed a platform margin stromatolite reef complex, and the overlying Costello and Laddie formations represent slope and deep basin deposits, respectively. The Kipalu Formation, deposited approximately 1.88 billion years ago, is notable for being a granular iron formation. The Flaherty Formation basalt that composes much of the Belcher Islands was deposited between 1.87 and 1.854 billion years ago, with the overlying Omarolluk and Loaf formations being deposited from 1.854 billion years ago until sometime after 1.83 billion years ago.

=== Soapstone ===
The occurrence of very high-quality soapstone in the Belcher Islands supports a locally significant carving industry. These soapstone occurrences formed when sedimentary rocks of the Belcher Group were intruded by Haig sills and dykes approximately 1.87 billion years ago. Most soapstone is quarried from a site on western Tukarak Island where dolomite of the Costello Formation was intruded by hot magma, with dolomite reacting with quartz and water under intense heat to form talc, calcite, and carbon dioxide:

Other minerals within the soapstone are largely calcite, dolomite, talc, and clinochlore, with minor amounts of ilmenite.

Although most soapstone has been sourced from two quarries, the relatively widespread occurrence of Haig intrusions within the Belcher Islands suggests that there may be many more possible sources of high-quality soapstone not yet discovered.

==Flora==

Several species of willow (&quot;Salix&quot;) form a large component of the native small shrubbery on the archipelago. These include rock willow (&quot;Salix vestita&quot;), bog willow (&quot;S. pedicellaris&quot;), and Labrador willow (&quot;S. argyrocarpa&quot;), as well as naturally occurring hybrids between &quot;S. arctica&quot; and &quot;S. glauca&quot;. Trees cannot grow on the islands because of a lack of adequate soil.

==Fauna==
The main wildlife consists of belugas, walrus, caribou, common eiders and snowy owls all of which can be seen on the island year round. There is also a wide variety of fish that can be caught such as Arctic char, cod, capelin, lump fish, and sculpin. The historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and the eider is the subject of a feature-length Canadian documentary film called &quot;People of a Feather&quot;. The director, cinematographer and biologist Joel Heath, spent seven years on the project, writing biological articles on the eider.

In 1998, the Belcher Island caribou (&quot;Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus&quot;) herd numbered 800.
