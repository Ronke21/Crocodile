<text>Nijinsky (21 February 1967 – 15 April 1992) was a Canadian-bred, Irish-trained champion Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was the outstanding two-year-old in Europe in 1969 when he was unbeaten in five races. In the following season, he became the first horse for thirty-five years to win the English Triple Crown, a feat that has not been repeated as of 2024. He is regarded as one of the greatest European flat racehorses of the 20th century.

He was also historically important for establishing the international reputation of his sire Northern Dancer, though Nijinsky was atypical of Northern Dancer progeny in size and conformation. Retired to stud, he became the leading sire in Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the leading broodmare sire in North America. As a winner of top-class races from 6-14 furlongs, Nijinsky is also considered to be among the most versatile of the great horses of the 20th century.

==Background==
Nijinsky, a bay horse with a white heart on his forehead and three white feet, was bred at E. P. Taylor&#x27;s Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Northern Dancer, the winner of the 1964 Kentucky Derby who went on to become one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. His dam, Flaming Page, by Bull Page, was a successful racemare, winning the 1962 Queen&#x27;s Plate. At stud, she produced only two other foals. One of these was Fleur by Victoria Park, who produced the 1977 Epsom Derby winner The Minstrel by Northern Dancer; the other was Minsky, champion Irish two-year-old in 1970 and full brother to Nijinsky. Nijinsky was a big, powerful and handsome horse with great presence, standing high, resembling his dam rather than his sire in stature and conformation, traits he tended to pass on to his offspring.

He was offered for sale at the Windfields Farm&#x27;s annual yearling auction where he was bought for $84,000 () by the American minerals magnate and industrialist Charles W. Engelhard Jr., acting on the advice of the Irish trainer Vincent O&#x27;Brien. It was Engelhard&#x27;s wife Jane who decided that the colt should be named after the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Nijinsky was shipped to Ireland, where he was trained by O&#x27;Brien at Ballydoyle, County Tipperary.

==Racing career==

===1969: two-year-old season===
Nijinsky&#x27;s first four races were all at the Curragh. In June, he started at odds of 4/11 and won the six-furlong Erne maiden race easily. He followed up with wins in the Anglesey Stakes and the Railway Stakes. On his fourth appearance, he was extended for the first time in the Beresford Stakes. He won decisively from Decies, a colt who went on to win the Irish 2000 Guineas in 1970. Having proved himself the best of the Irish two-year-olds, he was sent to England in October to contest the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden for the first time by Lester Piggott, he was held up at the back of the six-horse field before moving through easily to take the lead inside the final furlong, earning top rating in the British Free Handicap.

===1970: three-year-old season===
====Spring====
On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Nijinsky beat the four-year-old Deep Run in the Gladness Stakes at the Curragh in April. The colt was then sent back to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas over one mile. He started the 4/7 favourite against thirteen opponents. Nijinsky took the lead two furlongs from the finish and, without being put under any pressure by Piggott, pulled clear to win by two and a half lengths from Yellow God. The second had won the Ascot 2,000 Guineas trial and the previous year&#x27;s Gimcrack Stakes, as well as finishing a close second in the Middle Park Stakes.

====Summer====
Nijinsky&#x27;s opposition in the Derby at Epsom was stronger and he started at odds of 11/8 – the only time he was ever odds against. His rivals were headed by the French-trained colts Stintino and Gyr. The veteran French trainer Etienne Pollet had delayed his retirement for a year to guide Gyr, a son of his champion Sea-Bird, through his three-year-old season. Nijinsky was held up by Piggott as usual before moving forward in the straight, by which time Gyr was in front and pulling clear of the Prix Lupin winner, Stintino. A furlong and a half from the finish, Piggott used his whip on Nijinsky. The favourite responded immediately, catching Gyr in a few strides and pulling ahead to win from him by two and a half lengths, with Stintino third.

The winning time of 2:34.68 was the fastest Epsom Derby since 1936. Nijinsky&#x27;s time for the last two furlongs of the race (10.6 and 11.25 seconds, respectively) was of sprint championship-winning standard. Piggott claimed that he was &quot;always cantering&quot;, while Bill Williamson, who rode Gyr, said that &quot;Nijinsky was just too good&quot;. Gyr subsequently franked the form by easily winning the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud.

On the day before the Derby, Nijinsky had overcome a severe bout of colic which could have threatened his life.

On 27 June, Nijinsky followed up his Epsom win by taking the Irish Derby at the Curragh. Ridden by Liam Ward, he started at odds of 4/11 and accelerated late to win by three lengths from Meadowville. In July, Nijinsky raced against older horses in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. His five opponents included winners of major races: Blakeney (1969 Epsom Derby), Karabas (Washington, D.C. International Stakes), Crepellana (Prix de Diane) and Caliban (Coronation Cup). Without being extended, Nijinsky moved through to take the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two lengths from Blakeney despite being eased down to a canter in the closing stages.

In August, Nijinsky contracted ringworm, which seriously affected his training schedule. The horse lost most of the hair on his body.

====Autumn====
Nijinsky appeared to be recovering after being placed on a &quot;rich&quot; diet including raw eggs and Irish Stout, and was sent to Doncaster for the St. Leger in September. In the one mile and six furlongs race, he was attempting to become the first horse since Bahram 35 years earlier to complete the English Triple Crown. He started the 2/7 favourite and won comfortably, although his margin of victory over Meadowville was only one length. As of 2024, he is the last horse to accomplish the feat of sweeping the English Triple Crown: since 1970 only Reference Point (1987), Nashwan (1989), Sea The Stars (2009) and Camelot (2012) have won two of the three races, but Oh So Sharp won the filly&#x27;s version of the Triple Crown in 1985.

In his next race, Nijinsky was sent to France for the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris in October. Piggott produced Nijinsky in the straight to make his challenge but was baulked twice before making his run on the wide outside. However, 150m from the finish he caught front runners Miss Dan and Sassafras and took a slight lead. In the last strides, Nijinsky appeared to veer left away from Piggott&#x27;s whip, and Sassafras, ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, produced a renewed effort to regain the advantage and win by a head. While many, including his trainer Vincent O&#x27;Brien, felt that Piggott had given Nijinsky too much ground to make up and had left his challenge too late, the jockey, who was heavily criticised by the media and racing public, said that in his opinion Nijinsky was past his peak for the year. It is beyond dispute that Nijinsky was a most unlucky loser. Piggott commented: &quot;Certainly Nijinsky would have won had he not swerved almost in the shadow of the post, and certainly he would have won had his initial finishing run not been blocked on the final bend&quot;.

Less than two weeks after his defeat in the Arc, Nijinsky ran his last race in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket. Although he had been known to sweat freely before some of his previous races, Nijinsky on this occasion appeared to become particularly nervous and anxious before the start. In the race itself, he ran well below his best form and was beaten 3/4 length at odds of 4/11 by the five-year-old English horse Lorenzaccio. O&#x27;Brien on this occasion concurred with Piggott, saying that Nijinsky appeared to have &quot;lost his fire.&quot; Nijinsky was retired to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky having been syndicated in August for $5,440,000.

==Assessment and honours==
Nijinsky was given a rating of 138 by Timeform, the second-highest for a winner of the Epsom Derby up to that time. He was Timeform&#x27;s Horse of the Year for 1970. Nijinsky was also voted British Horse of the Year by the Racecourse Association, gaining 38 of the 40 votes.

In 2018 Nijinsky was rated the greatest-ever Epsom Derby winner by a panel of experts assembled by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. In 2021, the &quot;Sporting Life&quot; ranked Nijinsky&#x27;s Derby win no. 1, ahead of Sea Bird, in their top-40 runnings of the race. In their book &quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Nijinsky as a &quot;great&quot; Derby winner and the best Irish racehorse of the 20th century.

Vincent O&#x27;Brien named Nijinsky and Sir Ivor as the best horses he had trained, placing Nijinsky first &quot;for brilliance.&quot; Lester Piggott concurred: &quot;I think Nijinsky probably on his day was the most brilliant horse I&#x27;ve ever ridden&quot;. Piggott added later that Nijinsky, during the summer of 1970 when he won the 2,000 Guineas, Epsom Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, was &quot;an unbeatable horse&quot; Piggott was adamant, however, that running in the St Leger led to the horse not winning at Longchamps.

The Manchester City footballer, Colin Bell, was given the nickname, Nijinsky, by his coach, Malcolm Allison, because of his (Bell&#x27;s) unrivalled stamina.

In 1970, a film was made about his racing career entitled &quot;A Horse Called Nijinsky&quot;. Narrated by Orson Welles, it was released in British cinemas and in 1988 released on VHS video. The Nijinsky team also was voted winners of the 1970 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award. Among the more unusual tributes, a Cabernet Sauvignon wine and a variety of winter wheat have been named in Nijinsky&#x27;s honour. Bronze statues of him stand at Ballydoyle and at The Curragh racecourse.

==Stud record==
Having been sent to stand at stud in the United States, Nijinsky was registered there as Nijinsky II.

The horse was an excellent sire. He sired 155 Stakes/Group winners (18.1% of 862 total foals) and 519 individual winners (60.2%), ranging over the full range of distances at which he excelled as a racehorse. He is the only sire to have a winner of the Kentucky and Epsom Derbies in the same year (1986). The horse was champion sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1986 and champion broodmare sire in the United States in 1993 and 1994.

<doc id="67991" wikidata="Q3531107" url="?curid=67991" title="Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Arlington National Cemetery)">
<text>The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, United States is the burial site (and the white, marble sarcophagus above it) of a World War I soldier whose remains were unidentifiable. After a design competition was held in 1928, the winning project was completed in 1932. The site now also includes the gravesites of two other unknowns, one from World War II and one from the Korean War, who were buried under two slabs between it and the Memorial Amphitheater behind it.

Other nations also have national burial sites for unknowns from the First World War (also known as World War I and the Great War), such as England, France, Canada, Portugal, and Italy. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is in England and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in France. Nations have presented their highest awards / medals to each other&#x27;s unknown soldier.

The World War I &quot;Unknown&quot; is a recipient of the Medal of Honor, the Victoria Cross, and several other foreign nations&#x27; highest service awards. The U.S. Unknowns from World War II and Korea have also received the Medal of Honor. 

The Tomb is guarded around-the-clock by a Tomb Guard from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Regiment, &quot;The Old Guard&quot;. The Changing of the Guard takes place every hour. In daylight hours during part of the year, the Changing of the Guard takes place every half-hour.

==Tomb of 1921==

On March 4, 1921, the United States Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American serviceman from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial Amphitheater. On November 11, 1921, the unknown soldier brought back from France was interred below a three-level marble tomb. The bottom two levels are six granite sections each and the top at least nine blocks with a rectangular opening in the center of each level through which the unknown remains were placed through the tomb and into the ground below. A stone slab, rather than marble, covers the rectangular opening.

==Tomb of 1931==

Since 1921, the intent was to place a superstructure on top of the Tomb, but it was not until July 3, 1926, that Congress authorized the completion of the Tomb and the expenditure of $50,000, . (The completed cost was $48,000.) A design competition was held and won by architect Lorimer Rich and sculptor Thomas Hudson Jones. An appropriation from Congress for the work was secured, and on December 21, 1929, a contract for completion of the Tomb itself was entered into. The Tomb would consist of seven pieces of marble in four levels (cap, die, base and sub-base) of which the die is the largest block with the sculpting on all four sides.

Quarrying the Yule marble (3.9 miles south of Marble, Colorado by the Vermont Marble Company) was a one-year process beginning in 1930. The cap was quarried on the first attempt but the base required three tries. The large middle block also required three tries. In late January 1931, the 56-ton middle block was lifted out of the quarry. The quarrying involved 75 men. When the block was separated from the mountain inside the quarry it weighed 124 tons. A wire saw was then brought into the quarry to cut the block down to 56 tons.

On February 3, 1931, the block reached the marble mill site (in the town of Marble) after a four-day trip from the quarry. There it was crated, then shipped to Vermont on February 8. The block was sawed to final size in West Rutland, Vermont, and fabricated by craftsmen in Proctor, Vermont, before it was shipped by train to Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. By September, all seven blocks were on the grounds of the Tomb site, at Arlington.

Assembly began in September 1931. An imperfection was found in the base, requiring three more quarryings. By the end of December 1931, the assembly was completed. Finishing work followed, with the carvings on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers under the direction of sculptor Thomas Jones. (The brothers also carved the Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial, among others). The Tomb was completed without formal ceremony on April 9, 1932.

The Tomb was placed at the head of the grave of the World War I Unknown. West of this grave are the crypts of Unknowns from World War II (south) and Korea (north). Between the two lies a crypt that once contained an Unknown from Vietnam (middle). His remains were positively identified in 1998 through DNA testing as First Lieutenant Michael Blassie, United States Air Force, and were removed. Those three graves are marked with white marble slabs flush with the plaza.

The Tomb has a flat-faced form and is relieved at the corners and along the sides by neo-classical pilasters set into the surface with objects and inscriptions carved into the sides. The 1931 symbolism of the objects on the north, south, and east sides changed over time.

: North and South panel with 3 wreaths on each side represent (in 1931) &quot;a world of memories&quot; but later the six major battles engaged in by American forces in France: Ardennes, Belleau Wood, Château-Thierry, Meuse-Argonne, Oisiu-Eiseu, and Somme. Each wreath has 38 leaves and 12 berries.

: East panel that faces Washington, DC, are three Greek figures representing Peace, Victory, and &quot;American Manhood&quot; – but later &quot;Valor&quot; instead of &quot;American Manhood&quot;

: West panel is inscribed with (centered on the panel):

: HERE RESTS IN
: HONORED GLORY
: AN AMERICAN
: SOLDIER
: KNOWN BUT TO GOD

==The Unknown of World War I==

On Memorial Day, 1921, four unknown servicemen were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France, Aisne-Marne, Meuse-Argonne, Somme, and St. Mihiel. U.S. Army Sgt. Edward F. Younger, who was wounded in combat, highly decorated for valor and received the Distinguished Service Cross, selected the Unknown of World War I from four identical caskets at the city hall in Châlons-en-Champagne, France, on October 24, 1921. Younger selected the World War I Unknown by placing a spray of white roses on one of the caskets. He chose the second casket from the right. The chosen Unknown was transported to the United States aboard . Those remaining were interred in the Meuse Argonne Cemetery, France.

The World War I Unknown lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda from his arrival in the United States until Armistice Day 1921. On November 11, 1921, President Warren G. Harding officiated at the interment ceremonies at the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. During the ceremony, the World War I Unknown was awarded the Victoria Cross by Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, on behalf of King George V of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Victoria Cross was placed with the soldier. Other Allied nations also awarded the American Unknown Soldier with decorations, including the Legion of Honour, Médaille Militaire, and Croix de Guerre from France, the War Cross from Czechoslovakia, the Gold Medal for Bravery from Italy, the Virtuti Militari from Poland, and the Virtutea Militara from Romania.

Earlier, on October 17, 1921, the British Unknown Warrior had been conferred the U.S. Medal of Honor by General of the Armies John Pershing.

==The Unknowns of World War II and Korea==

On August 3, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as a general during World War II, signed a bill to select and pay tribute to the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War. The selection ceremonies and the interment of these Unknowns took place in 1958. The World War II Unknown was selected from remains exhumed from cemeteries in Europe, Africa, Hawaii, and the Philippines.

Two Unknowns from World War II, one from the European Theater and one from the Pacific Theater, were placed in identical caskets and taken aboard and placed on either side of the Korean unknown. Navy Hospital Corpsman 1st Class William R. Charette, then the U.S. Navy&#x27;s only active-duty Medal of Honor recipient who was an enlisted man, selected the right-hand casket as the World War II Unknown. The casket of the remaining WWII unknown received a solemn burial at sea.

The Korean unknown had been selected from four unknown Americans who died in the Korean War that were disinterred from the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. Army Master Sergeant Ned Lyle made the final selection. The unselected unknowns were re-interred there.

The caskets of the WWII and Korean unknowns arrived in Washington on May 28, 1958, where they lay in the Capitol Rotunda until the morning of May 30, when they were carried on caissons to Arlington National Cemetery. President Eisenhower awarded each the Medal of Honor, and the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War were interred in the plaza beside their World War I comrade.

==The Unknown of Vietnam==


The Vietnam Unknown service member was originally designated by Medal of Honor recipient U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Allan Jay Kellogg Jr., during a ceremony at Pearl Harbor.

Each branch of the Armed Services took part in the transportation to honor the unknown. Marines from Marine Barracks Hawaii consisted of an Honor Guard of nine enlisted men and Lt. Denis Muller. The designated Vietnam Unknown was transported aboard , where the Marines stood guard over the casket during the voyage to Naval Air Station Alameda, California. At Travis, the debarkation ceremony turned the remains over to the USAF on May 24, 1984. The next day, the remains of the Unknown were flown from Travis Air Force Base, California, arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. Once there the remains were turned over to the US Army, where the remains were taken to Fort McNair for placement upon the horse-drawn wagon which later carried the Unknown to the Capitol Rotunda for display before interment. While on display for public viewing, all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces stood in honor, guarding the casket of the Unknown for two weeks.

Many Vietnam veterans and President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan visited the Vietnam Unknown in the U.S. Capitol. An Army caisson carried the Vietnam Unknown from the Capitol to the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day, May 28, 1984.

President Reagan presided over the funeral, presented the Medal of Honor to the Vietnam Unknown, and acted as next of kin by accepting the interment flag at the end of the ceremony. The interment flags of all Unknowns at the Tomb of the Unknowns are on view in the Memorial Display Room.

===Identification of the Unknown===
In 1994, Ted Sampley, a POW/MIA activist, determined that the remains of the Vietnam Unknown were likely those of Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, who was shot down near An Lộc, Vietnam, in 1972. Sampley published an article in his newsletter and contacted Blassie&#x27;s family, who attempted to pursue the case with the Air Force&#x27;s casualty office without result. In January 1998, CBS News broadcast a report based on Sampley&#x27;s investigation which brought political pressure to support the identification of the remains. The body was exhumed on May 14, 1998. Based on mitochondrial DNA testing, Department of Defense scientists confirmed the remains were those of Blassie. The identification was announced on June 30, 1998, and on July 10, Blassie&#x27;s remains arrived home to his family in St. Louis, Missouri; he was reinterred at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery on July 11.

===Re-designation of the crypt===
The slab over the crypt that once held the remains of the Vietnam Unknown has since been replaced. The original inscription of &quot;Vietnam&quot; has been changed to &quot;Honoring and Keeping Faith with America&#x27;s Missing Servicemen 1958 – 1975&quot; as a reminder of the commitment of the Armed Forces to the fullest possible accounting of missing service members. It was decided that the crypt would remain vacant.

==Tomb Guards==
Tomb Guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (TUS) are volunteer, enlisted, United States Army soldiers (men or women) assigned to the &quot;3d U.S. Infantry Regiment&quot; also known as &quot;The Old Guard&quot; (TOG) at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall (originally Fort Myer). TOG soldiers who have the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of 11B basic infantry or 31B military police are eligible to volunteer and apply to serve as Tomb Guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (TUS). The TUS has been called the &quot;Tomb of the Unknowns&quot; when referring to the combined three or four burials from World War I, World War II, Korea (and Vietnam), but it is still officially called the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 

Tomb Guards make it their goal to earn the Tomb Guard Identification Badge (TGIB). The Tomb Guard Identification Badge (TGIB) is awarded after the Tomb Guard Sentinel passes a series of tests, including one on the history of Arlington National Cemetery.

The first military guards at &quot;The Tomb&quot; were troopers from the 3rd Cavalry, &quot;Brave Rifles&quot;, who were posted nearby on Fort Myer. Since April 6, 1948, (known then as &quot;Army Day&quot;), when the regiment was reactivated, it has been guarded by soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Regiment, &quot;The Old Guard&quot;. The Old Guard is also posted to Fort Myer, Virginia, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. It is considered one of the highest honors within the American military to serve as a Sentinel at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Fewer than 20 percent of all volunteers are accepted for training and of those only a fraction pass training to become full-fledged Tomb Guards. The Tomb Guard Identification Badge is the third least-awarded qualification badge of the United States Army; as of December 26, 2023, they number 868, including 26 which have been revoked and 9 &quot;administrative errors&quot;. It is preceded by the 154 Military Horseman Identification Badges and the 17 Astronaut Badges.

The soldier &quot;walking the mat&quot; does not wear rank insignia, so as not to outrank the Unknowns, whatever their ranks may have been. Non-commissioned officers (usually the Relief Commander and Assistant Relief Commanders), do wear insignia of their rank when changing the guard only. They have a separate uniform (without rank) that is worn when they actually guard the Unknowns or are &quot;posted.&quot;

The sentinels will confront people who cross the barriers at the tomb or whom they perceive to be disrespectful or excessively loud; requesting all in attendance to remain silent and standing prior to the beginning of a guard change.

On November 9–10, 2021, in honor of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&#x27;s centennial commemoration, members of the public were allowed to walk on the plaza and lay flowers for the first time since 1925. Arlington National Cemetery has permitted the public to lay flowers at the Tomb on the three succeeding Memorial Days since the Centennial.

===Weapons===

Tomb guards are always equipped with a rifle and bayonet as well as a sidearm, with the changes in exact weaponry reflecting the changes in the Army. Past weapons have been the M1903 Springfield and M1 Garand rifles, as well as the M1911 and M9 pistols. Guards are currently equipped with the M14 rifle and the Sig Sauer P320 M17 9mm.

===Walking the mat===
There is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the Tomb and crypts. The tomb guard:

# Marches 21 steps south down the black mat laid across the Tomb.
# Turns and faces east, toward the Tomb, for 21 seconds.
# Turns and faces north, changes weapon to the outside shoulder, and waits 21 seconds.
# Marches 21 steps up the mat.
# Turns and faces east for 21 seconds.
# Turns and faces south, changes weapon to the outside shoulder, and waits 21 seconds.
# Repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the Changing of the Guard.

After each turn, the guard executes a sharp &quot;shoulder-arms&quot; movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.

Out of respect for the interred, the sentinels command silence at the tombs. If the guard walking the mat must vocally confront a disturbance from spectators, or a threat, the routine is interrupted and remains so until the disturbance is under control. The sentinel will exit the mat, place the weapon in port arms position, and confront the disturbance. Once under control, the sentinel then walks on the pavement to the other side of the mat, turns to shoulder arms, and resumes the routine from the point of interruption.

Twenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowed—the 21-gun salute.

The mat is usually replaced twice per year: before Memorial Day and before Veterans Day. This is required because of the wear on the rubber mat by the special shoes worn by tomb guards. The sentinels have metal plates built into the soles and inner parts of their shoes to allow for a more rugged sole and to give the signature click of the heel during maneuvers. The sentinels wear sunglasses because of the bright reflection from the marble surrounding the Tomb and the Memorial Amphitheater.

===Changing of the Guard===
While Arlington National Cemetery is open, during the day in the summer months from April 1 to September 30, the guard is changed every half hour. During the winter months, from October 1 to March 31, the guard is changed every hour. After the cemetery closes to the public (7 p.m. to 8 a.m. April through September, and 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. October through March), the guard is changed every two hours. The ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever Arlington National Cemetery is open.

The guard change is very symbolic but also conducted in accordance with Army regulations. The relief commander or assistant relief commander, along with the incoming guard, are both required for a guard change to take place. The relief commander orders the outgoing guard to &quot;pass on your orders&quot; to the incoming guard. The outgoing guard will say to the incoming guard, &quot;Post and orders remain as directed.&quot; The incoming guard&#x27;s response is always &quot;Orders acknowledged.&quot; During changes when the public is witnessing the ceremony, the commander will inform the public that the ceremony is about to take place and that those in attendance should remain &quot;silent and standing&quot; throughout the entire event. In some occurrences, the public is also asked to refrain from taking flash pictures (mostly during inclement weather).

On October 4, 2021, the first all-female changing of the guard took place to honor Sergeant of the Guard Sgt. Chelsea Porterfield, who was the first woman to hold that position.

===Dedication===
A civilian guard was first posted at the Tomb on November 17, 1925, to prevent, among other things, families from picnicking on the flat marble slab with views of the city. A military guard was first posted on March 25, 1926. The first 24-hour guard was posted on midnight, July 2, 1937. The Tomb of the Unknowns has been guarded continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, since that time. Inclement weather, terrorist attacks, and more have never caused the watch to cease.

Since 1948, the tomb guards, a special platoon within the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), work on a team rotation of 24 hours on, 24 hours off, for five days, taking the following four days off. A guard takes an average of six hours to prepare his uniform—heavy wool, regardless of the time of year—for the next day&#x27;s work. In addition to preparing the uniform, guards also conduct physical training, tomb guard training, participate in field exercises, cut their hair before the next workday, and at times are involved in regimental functions as well. Tomb guards are required to memorize 35 pages of information about Arlington National Cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one.

A special Army decoration, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge, is authorized for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions (from a pool of more than 300), a uniform test with two gigs (errors) or fewer (measured to 1/64&quot;), and a test on the guard-changing sequence. After serving honorably for a period of nine months, and having passed the sequence of tests, a tomb guard is permanently awarded the Badge. Since the first award on February 7, 1958, fewer than 650 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this badge, including four women. A small number of tomb guard Identification Badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as Guards before 1959. The Tomb Guard Identification Badge is the only badge awarded by the United States Army that can be revoked after a soldier has left the military. The Regimental Commander of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment has the authority to revoke a badge from any Guard (past or present) for any act that would bring discredit upon the Tomb of the Unknowns.

The badge was designed in 1956 and was first issued to members of the Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns on February 7, 1958. The badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item, meaning the soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the honor guard. Upon leaving the duty, the badge was returned and reissued to incoming soldiers. In 1963, a regulation was enacted that allowed the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform, even after the soldier&#x27;s completion of duty at the Tomb of the Unknowns.

In keeping with the dedication Tomb Guards have made, 2021 served as a centennial commemoration for The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Throughout 2021, the cemetery held events leading up to the centennial ceremony on November 11, 2021. The public was able to experience and participate in the commemorative events in many ways, both at the cemetery and virtually.

==Damage and repair to the Tomb Monument==
Cracking and weathering caused concerns for the long-term preservation of the Tomb Monument. A November 1963 report first recorded horizontal cracking of the monument&#x27;s marble die block. Though this was the first time that the damage was documented, the report made it clear that the cracks had become visible some time before that date.

In 1963–1964, there were two cracks—referred to as &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;—extending approximately around the die block. By 1974, they had extended to . They grew another over the next 15 years. Inspection determined that the cracks had increased horizontally since 1990. Analysis also indicated that the cracks were not surficial but extended partially through the block and would eventually extend all the way through.

The 1990 report documented deterioration of the marble&#x27;s surface. As much as of the marble surface was lost through weathering. The study projected that before 2010, the Tomb Monument would have been weathered enough to have a negative effect on the experience of the visitors and concluded that the only solutions were to enclose or replace the monument.

Several options were considered to deal with the damage. Officials at Arlington National Cemetery determined that proper repair could return the Tomb Monument to an acceptable appearance. However, because the cracks would continue to lengthen and widen, continuous grouting, regrouting, touch-up, monitoring, and maintenance would be required. Therefore, a report commissioned by Arlington National Cemetery and published in June 2006 confirmed the Cemetery&#x27;s conclusion that &quot;replacement of the three pieces of the Tomb Monument is the preferred alternative&quot;. A final decision was scheduled to be made on September 30, 2007.

In 2003, John Haines, a retired car dealer, offered to donate a large slab of marble to Arlington National Cemetery to replace the existing marble. Haines paid $31,000 for the marble slab. The marble was not removed from the quarry, however, because imperfections were found and the block was rejected.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation objected to the plan to replace the authentic Tomb Monument. The Trust expressed concern that Arlington National Cemetery sought to replace the existing monument with marble from the original quarry, which experts agreed was likely to eventually crack.

The Trust observed that the Cemetery&#x27;s own 1990 report recommended that the monument be repaired and that the Cemetery, in fact, commissioned Oehrlein Architects to repair the stone. In 2007, Mary Oehrlein informed Congressional staff members that: &quot;The existing monument can easily be repaired, as was done 17 years ago, using conventional conservation methods to re-grout the cracks. Once repaired, the fault lines would be virtually invisible from the public viewing areas.&quot;

On September 26, 2007, U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka announced that an amendment crafted together with Senator Jim Webb would be added to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 1585) that would require a report on the plans of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to replace the monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns. The secretaries would be required to advise Congress on the efforts to maintain and preserve the monument. Additionally, they would have to provide an assessment on the feasibility and advisability of repairing rather than replacing the Tomb Monument. Finally, if the secretaries chose replacement, they would have to report those plans and detail how they intended to dispose of the existing monument. Once the report was provided, the secretaries were prevented from taking action to replace the monument for at least 180 days. The Akaka-Webb amendment was included in the bill by unanimous consent of the Senate. An amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill authorized a review of the monument&#x27;s condition. The bill also authorized repair, but not replacement, of the monument. Final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 (H.R. 4986) was signed by President Bush on January 28, 2008.

In June 2009 Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that the monument was to be repaired, not replaced. In 2010, the cracks were filled but the repairs lasted only a few months. As of June 2011, the cemetery was struggling to repair the cracks in the monument, one of which measured long, with another at . In September 2011, the cracks were filled again and on October 21, 2011, inspection by the Corps of Engineers and other experts pronounced the repairs a success.

<text>Isabella Fiorella Elettra Giovanna Rossellini (; born 18 June 1952) is an Italian actress. The daughter of Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian film director Roberto Rossellini, she is noted for her successful tenure as a Lancôme model and an established career in American and European cinema. She has received nominations for an Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, a British Academy Film Award and a Primetime Emmy Award.

After making her acting debut with &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; (1976), Rossellini had her breakthrough role in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) for which she received the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. She starred in the box office hit &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), and had further roles in &quot;Cousins&quot; (1989), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993), &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994), &quot;Big Night&quot; (1996), &quot;Roger Dodger&quot; (2002), &quot;Infamous&quot; (2006), &quot;Two Lovers&quot; (2008), &quot;Enemy&quot; (2013), &quot;Joy&quot; (2015), &quot;La chimera&quot; (2023). She also voiced roles in &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018) and &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On&quot; (2021). For playing a nun in &quot;Conclave&quot; (2024), she garnered a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Rossellini received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the HBO film &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (1996). She received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series nomination for &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1997). She also has guest starred in the sitcoms &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;30 Rock&quot; as well as the dramas &quot;Alias&quot; and &quot;The Blacklist&quot;. She portrayed Simone Beck in the HBO series &quot;Julia&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Rossellini was born in Rome, the daughter of Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman, who was of Swedish and German descent, and Italian director Roberto Rossellini, who was born in Rome from a family originally from Pisa, Tuscany. She has three siblings from her mother: her fraternal twin sister Isotta Ingrid Rossellini, who is an adjunct professor of Italian literature, a brother, Robertino Ingmar Rossellini; and a half-sister, Pia Lindström, who formerly worked on television and is from her mother&#x27;s first marriage with Petter Lindström. She has four other siblings from her father&#x27;s two other marriages: Romano (who died at age nine), Renzo, Gil, and Raffaella. Growing up, she received &quot;a liberal Catholic education&quot;.

Rossellini was raised in Rome, as well as in Santa Marinella and Paris. She underwent an operation for appendicitis at the age of five. At 11, she was diagnosed with scoliosis. To correct it, she had to undergo an 18-month ordeal of painful stretchings, body casts and surgery on her spine using pieces of one of her shin bones. Consequently, she has incision scars on her back and shin.

At 19, she went to New York City, where she attended Finch College, while working as a translator and as a television reporter for RAI. She also appeared intermittently on &quot;L&#x27;altra Domenica&quot; (&quot;The Other Sunday&quot;), a TV show featuring Roberto Benigni. However, she decided not to stay full-time in New York until her marriage to Martin Scorsese (1979–1982), whom she met when she interviewed him for RAI.

==Career==
===Modeling===
At the age of 28, her modeling career began, when she was photographed by Bruce Weber for &quot;British Vogue&quot; and by Bill King for American &quot;Vogue&quot;. During her career, she has also worked with many other renowned photographers, including Richard Avedon, Steven Meisel, Helmut Newton, Peter Lindbergh, Norman Parkinson, Eve Arnold, Francesco Scavullo, Annie Leibovitz, Denis Piel, and Robert Mapplethorpe. Her image has appeared on such magazines as &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and &quot;Elle&quot;. In March 1988, an exhibition dedicated to photographs of her, called &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;, was held at the Musee d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris.

Rossellini&#x27;s modeling career led her into the world of cosmetics, when she became the exclusive spokesmodel for the French cosmetics brand Lancôme in 1982, replacing Nancy Dutiel in the United States and Carol Alt in Europe. At Lancôme, in 1990, she was involved in product development for the fragrance Trésor. In 1996, when she was 43, she was removed as the face of Lancôme for being &quot;too old&quot;. In 2016, at the age of 63, she was rehired by Lancôme&#x27;s new female CEO, Francoise Lehmann, as a global brand ambassador for the company.

In October 1992, Rossellini modelled for Madonna&#x27;s controversial book &quot;Sex&quot;. Rossellini also appeared in Madonna&#x27;s music video for her successful Top 5 hit song &quot;Erotica&quot;, released in autumn 1992.

Rossellini was the inaugural brand ambassador for the Italian Silversea Cruises company in 2004, and she appeared in print ads and on their website. Barbara Muckermann, the senior vice-president of worldwide marketing and communications in 2004, said at the time of the announcement, &quot;Isabella is the ideal personification of Silversea&#x27;s exclusive standard of elegance, glamour and sophistication.&quot;

Rossellini made her film debut with a brief appearance as a nun opposite her mother in the 1976 film &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;. Her first role was the 1979 film &quot;Il Prato&quot;, and then in 1980 she appeared in Renzo Arbore&#x27;s film &quot;Il pap&#x27;occhio&quot; with Martin Scorsese.

Following her mother&#x27;s death in 1982, Rossellini was cast in her first American film, &quot;White Nights&quot; (1985). This was followed by her notable role as the tortured nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens in the David Lynch film &quot;Blue Velvet,&quot; in which she also contributed her own singing. Other significant film roles during this period include her work in &quot;Cousins&quot; (1989), &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993), and &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; (1994). In 1996, she appeared as herself in an episode of the TV series &quot;Friends&quot; called &quot;The One with Frank Jr.&quot;

In 2003, Rossellini was a recurring character on the television series &quot;Alias&quot;. In that same year, she also appeared in the Canadian film &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;, directed by Guy Maddin. In 2004, she played the High Priestess Thar in the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries &quot;Legend of Earthsea&quot;, and the director Robert Lieberman stated that Rossellini &quot;brings a very big persona to the screen. She carries a great deal of beauty. We needed someone who had a feeling of authority to be this kind of mother superior type and at the same time not be totally dour and unattractive.&quot;

In 2006, Rossellini appeared in several television documentaries. First, she narrated a two-hour television special on Italy for the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Discovery Atlas&quot; series. Then, alongside Segway PT inventor Dean Kamen, she spoke about her past and current activities on an episode of &quot;Iconoclasts&quot;, a series that featured on the Sundance Channel (known as SundanceTV from 2014 onwards), an independent film network founded by film industry veteran Robert Redford. The Sundance Channel then purchased the 2006 Guy Maddin-directed short film &quot;My Dad Is 100 Years Old&quot;, a tribute that Rossellini created for her father. In the film, she played almost every role, including Federico Fellini, Alfred Hitchcock and her mother, Ingrid Bergman. Rossellini&#x27;s twin sister, Isotta Ingrid, criticized the short film, calling it an &quot;inappropriate&quot; tribute.

In 2007, Rossellini guest starred on two episodes of the television show &quot;30 Rock&quot;, playing Alec Baldwin&#x27;s character&#x27;s ex-wife. Around the same time, Rossellini enrolled at New York University where she undertook an undergraduate degree in Art and Environmental Studies, and then pursued with a master&#x27;s degree at Hunter College in New York to study animal behavior. Then the Sundance Channel commissioned her to contribute a short-film project to the environmental program &quot;The Green&quot;. Rossellini explained in a 2013 interview:

They contacted me again when they had allocated some money to experiment in making a web series. At first, I thought I didn&#x27;t know what to say, I didn&#x27;t know what to write and then thought it might be really fun to do little short films about animals. This is how the first three episodes of &quot;Green Porno&quot; came about. When I showed them the pilot, Sundance commissioned eight more. It was a huge hit!

Debuting in 2008, the first series of &quot;Green Porno&quot; had over 4 million views on YouTube and two further seasons were produced; there are 18 episodes in the series. Rossellini worked with a small budget for &quot;Green Porno&quot; and she was responsible for the scripts, helped to design the creatures, directed the episodes, and is the primary actor in the series. In each of the episodes, she acts out the mating rituals and reproductive behaviour of various animals while commentary is played.

&quot;Green Porno&quot; was followed by two other animal-themed television productions: &quot;Seduce Me: The Spawn of Green Porno&quot; and &quot;Mammas&quot;. &quot;Seduce Me: The Spawn of Green Porno&quot; is a five-episode online series that was premiered in mid-2010 and explores the topic of animal courtship. As with &quot;Green Porno&quot;, Rossellini wrote, directed and acted in the series; she is also a producer of the series. Rossellini explained in 2010, &quot;I always wanted to make films about animals – there&#x27;s not an enormous audience, but there&#x27;s an enormous audience for sex.&quot;

&quot;Mammas&quot; debuted in the United States on 12 May 2013, Mother&#x27;s Day weekend there, and is a celebration of the maternal aspects of the animal world. Rossellini is again the primary actor and plays the maternal versions of animals such as spiders and hamsters. Rossellini explained in a 2013 interview part of the research process for &quot;Mammas&quot;: &quot;First of all it&#x27;s about diversity. When talking about motherhood, I would find examples of ten different species that either don&#x27;t get pregnant in the belly but in the mouth or back. Or species that abandon their children all-together so that I don&#x27;t tell ten stories that are too similar.&quot;

After the completion of her &quot;Green Porno&quot; productions, Rossellini acted in the film &quot;Enemy&quot;, with Jake Gyllenhaal, which was shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Rossellini praised the film during a TIFF interview: &quot;I love the subtlety of the film. It reminded me of Kafka. It&#x27;s very metaphysical, but yet it&#x27;s also a solid thriller. It made me leap up out of my seat at the end.&quot; Rossellini also played the silent film actor Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s mother in Vlad Kozlov&#x27;s &quot;Silent Life&quot;, a feature-length version of the director&#x27;s silent, black-and-white short film &quot;Daydreams of Rudolph Valentino&quot;. Kozlov&#x27;s film was due for release in 2012, but, as of February 2014, the film has not been officially released.

Rossellini was the president of the jury for the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in 2011. In April 2015, she was announced as the president of the jury for the section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2016, Rossellini was cast as Rita Marks, the matriarch of the Marks crime family in the Hulu original series, &quot;Shut Eye&quot;.

In 2023, Rossellini was honoured with Lifetime Achievement Award at the 18th Rome Film Festival.

In 2024, Rossellini received acclaim for her portrayal of Sister Agnes in the political drama, &quot;Conclave&quot;, opposite Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow.

==Stage and live performance==
In 2004, Rossellini acted in an Off-Broadway production of Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot;, with Richard Thomas.

Rossellini&#x27;s friend, Carole Bouquet, also a model who later became an actress, suggested that &quot;Green Porno&quot; could be transformed into a lecture format with a longer duration. Bouquet then introduced Rossellini to the French filmmaker and screenwriter, Jean-Claude Carrière, and they created a 70-minute-long monologue that expands upon the &quot;Green Porno&quot; films. The structure of the performance is in accordance with the types of reproductive systems:

Some animals reproduce with male and female; some animals change sex – they start female and they end male or vice-versa. Some fish do that. Some animals are hermaphrodites – they don&#x27;t need anybody, they have both vaginas and penises. Then we have animals that don&#x27;t need sex at all, they just clone themselves.
In the live show, Rossellini explores the topics of homosexuality (&quot;I think society has made the mistake of seeing the act of making love or mating as an act of reproduction, when actually it is used for other things, too. Animals use it for social events, bonding, solving conflict and so on.&quot;) and maternal instincts, and has explained that her research has influenced her perspective on societal notions of beauty: &quot;If you look at nature, there is no perfection. Everything is always evolving and adapting according to whatever the environmental pressure. The more diversity there is, the more things are going to survive.&quot;

Rossellini debuted the live version of &quot;Green Porno&quot; at the Adelaide Festival of Arts on 15 March 2014 and was warmly received by the audience. The show was the first of the 2014 program to sell out. Much of the production and backstage documentary footage was shot and directed by her nephew, Tommaso Rossellini.

Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;smallest circus in the world&quot;, a stage play exploring the ability of animals to think, was premiered in May 2018, at the Jerome Robbins Theater of the Baryshnikov Arts Center. The play &quot;addresses the scientific discoveries about animal minds, intelligence, and emotions. Joined onstage by various animals portrayed by Pan, her trained dog, Rossellini transforms herself into Aristotle, Descartes, B.F. Skinner, Charles Darwin, and more, to deliver a vivid monologue about the brilliance of the animal kingdom&quot;.

Rossellini performed &quot;Link Link Circus&quot; (as in Ring Ring) as a benefit for The Gateway Performing Arts Center of Suffolk County, in Bellport, New York, the south shore Long Island village where she is a local organic farmer. &quot;Link Link Circus&quot; is performed by Rossellini in a black and red ringmaster&#x27;s tailcoat, with the assistance of her dog, Peter Pan, who performs a few tricks and is costumed as other animals including a chicken and a dinosaur. In addition to Rossellini and Pan, the production includes puppets, handled by puppeteer Schuyler Beeman, and still photos, home movies, animation and excerpts from her &quot;Green Porno&quot; film series projected on a large screen behind the set decorated with Rossellini&#x27;s childhood toys, including a marionette stage and a toy upright piano, which Rossellini plays in the show. The set was designed by Andy Byers, who is also the costume designer and composer for the show. In promoting the show, which was performed twice at The Gateway, Rossellini appeared in Long Island&#x27;s &quot;Newsday&quot;. Proceeds from The Gateway production of &quot;Link Link Circus&quot; also benefited The Plaza Cinema &amp; Media Arts Center, a non-profit located near Rossellini&#x27;s Bellport home in Patchogue, New York.

Rossellini has been a frequent guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World, most recently appearing in the 2019 and 2022 seasons.

==Activism==
Rossellini is involved in conservation efforts. She is the president and director of the Howard Gilman Foundation – a leading institution focused on the preservation of wildlife, arts, photography and dance – and she has been a board member of the Wildlife Conservation Network. She received US$100,000 from Disney to help with her conservation efforts in those two organizations. She has also helped with the Central Park Conservancy, and is a major benefactor of the Bellport-Brookhaven Historical Society in Bellport, Long Island, where she is a part-time resident.

Rossellini is involved in training guide dogs for the blind. She is a former trustee of the George Eastman House and a 1997 George Eastman Award honoree for her support of film preservation. She is also a National Ambassador for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF.

==Personal life==

Rossellini holds dual Italian and United States citizenship. She speaks Italian, French and English fluently. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Rossellini married filmmaker Martin Scorsese in 1979. After she and Scorsese divorced in 1982, Rossellini was married to Jon Wiedemann from 1983 to 1986. Rossellini has a daughter, Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann (born 1983), and an adopted son, Roberto (born 1993).

Filmmaker David Lynch and Rossellini were a couple from 1986 to 1991. She was also engaged to actor Gary Oldman from 1994 to 1996.

She has always lived near her twin sister Isotta Ingrid, while growing up in Rome or residing in New York City.

Rossellini raises and trains future guide dogs for the Guide Dog Foundation.

In 1998, she received an Honourable Mention at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival for her role in the film &quot;Left Luggage&quot;. In 2013, she was awarded with the Berlinale Camera at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2016, she was granted an honorary doctorate by the Université du Québec à Montréal.

==Notes==
==Bibliography==
Rossellini has written four books:
*&quot;Some of Me&quot; (1997)
*&quot;Looking at Me&quot; (2002)
* &quot;In the name of the Father, the Daughter and the Holy Spirits: Remembering Roberto Rossellini&quot; (2006)

The 3rd title was published as a written tribute alongside the short film, &quot;My Dad Is 100 Years Old&quot;, and used the script from the short film as its basis. To accompany the third series of &quot;Green Porno&quot;, Rossellini produced a multimedia collection that contains a book and DVD, both of which give additional information for the series&#x27; third season. These were released in 2008. Further backstage material was released filmed by her nephew, Tommaso.

<doc id="68001" wikidata="Q2814783" url="?curid=68001" title="Gaviiformes">
<text>Gaviiformes () is an order of aquatic birds containing the loons or divers and their closest extinct relatives. Modern gaviiformes are found in many parts of North America and northern Eurasia (Europe, Asia and debatably Africa), though prehistoric species were more widespread.

==Classification and evolution==
There are five living species, and all are placed in the genus &quot;Gavia&quot;. The loons were formerly often considered to be the most ancient of the northern hemisphere bird families; this idea grew basically out of the perceived similarity of shape and (probably) habits between loons and the entirely unrelated extinct Cretaceous order Hesperornithiformes. In particular &quot;Enaliornis&quot;, which was apparently an ancestral and plesiomorphic member of that order, was sometimes used to support claims of Albian (Early Cretaceous) Gaviiformes. 

More recently, it has become clear that the Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes are the most ancient groups of modern birds, and these being distinct by the end of the Albian 100 million years ago (Ma), while just possible, is not at all well-supported. Loons belong to a more modern radiation. They were once believed to be related to grebes, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both groups were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes or in even older classifications as the Urinatores. The family name Urinatoridae was used for the family Gaviidae. This was derived from Greek &quot;Urinator&quot; meaning &quot;diver&quot;. However, as recently as the 1930s, it was determined that the two groups (grebes and divers) are not that closely related at all and are merely the product of convergent evolution and adapted in a similar way to a similar ecological niche. The similarity is so strong that even the most modern cladistic analyses of general anatomical features are easily misled into grouping loons and grebes.

The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy still allied the loons with the grebes in its massively polyphyletic &quot;Ciconiiformes&quot;, and it is almost certain that the relationships of loons lie with &quot;some&quot; of the orders placed therein. Namely, other recent authors have considered loons to share a rather close relationship with seabirds such as penguins (Sphenisciformes), tubenoses (Procellariiformes), waders (Charadriiformes) – and perhaps the newly discovered clade Mirandornithes which unites grebes (Podicipediformes) and their closest living relatives, the flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes). It is perhaps notable that some early penguins had skulls and beaks that were in many aspects similar to those of the known living and fossil Gaviiformes.

===Fossil record===

In prehistoric times, the loons had a more southerly distribution than today, and their fossils have been found in places such as California, Florida and Italy. The conflicting molecular data regarding their relationships is not much resolved by the fossil record; though they seem to have originated at the end of the Late Cretaceous like their presumed relatives, modern loons are only known with certainty since the Eocene. By that time almost all modern bird orders are at least strongly suspected to have existed – if not known from unequivocally identified specimens – anyway.

The oldest known stem-gaviiform is &quot;Nasidytes&quot; from the Early Eocene aged London Clay of England, dating to around 55 million years ago.

&quot;Colymboides&quot; is widely known from early Priabonian – about 37 million years ago (Ma) in the Late Eocene – to Early Miocene (late Burdigalian, less than 20 Ma) limnic and marine rocks of western Eurasia north of the Alpide belt, between the Atlantic and the former Turgai Sea. It is usually placed in the Gaviidae already, but usually in a subfamily Colymboidinae, with the modern-type loons making up the Gaviinae. But the &quot;Colymboides&quot; material is generally quite distinct from modern loons, and may actually belong in a now-extinct family of primitive gaviiforms. Furthermore, the supposed genus could well be paraphyletic, so that for example &quot;Dyspetornis&quot; – which is now contained therein – might have to be separated again. A leg of an undescribed small diver was found in the Late Oligocene deposits at Enspel (Germany); it too may or may not belong to &quot;Colymboides&quot;. Of the crown genus &quot;Gavia&quot;, nearly ten prehistoric species have been named to date, and about as many undescribed ones await further study. The genus is known from the Early Miocene onwards, and the oldest members of them are rather small (some are smaller than the red-throated loon). Throughout the late Neogene, the genus by and large follows Cope&#x27;s Rule.

Some older fossils are sometimes assigned to the Gaviiformes. From the Late Cretaceous, the genera &quot;Lonchodytes&quot; (Lance Formation, Wyoming) and &quot;Neogaeornis&quot; (Quinriquina Formation, Chile) have been described; both are usually allied with orders which are considered related to loons. In particular the latter is still sometimes explicitly proposed as a primitive loon as they both were initially, but other authors consider &quot;Neogaeornis&quot; a hesperornithiform; note however that neither Gaviiformes nor Hesperornithiformes are known from the Southern Hemisphere or anywhere near it. &quot;Lonchodytes&quot; was more certainly quite close to loons, but probably closer still to some of the loons&#x27; relatives. &quot;Eupterornis&quot; from the Paleocene of Châlons-sur-Vesle (France) has some features reminiscent of loons, but others seem more similar to Charadriiformes such as gulls (Laridae). A piece of a carpometacarpus supposedly from Oligocene rocks near Lusk, Wyoming was described as &quot;Gaviella pusilla&quot;, but this handbone also shows some similarities to the plotopterids which were flightless wing-propelled divers and if these are apomorphic would make an unconvincing member of the Gaviidae (though it still could be a small-winged gaviiform in a yet-undescribed family &quot;Gaviellidae&quot;): while the carpometacarpus in &quot;Gavia&quot; is somewhat convergent to that of wing-propelled divers, enabling the wings to be used as rudders for quick underwater turns, &quot;Colymboides&quot; still had an unspecialized plesiomorphic hand. &quot;Parascaniornis&quot;, sometimes allied to the loons by early authors, was eventually determined to be a junior synonym of the hesperornithiform &quot;Baptornis&quot;. A supposed mid-Eocene diver fossil form Geiseltal (Germany) was erroneously assigned to &quot;Gavia&quot;.

<doc id="68003" wikidata="Q339297" url="?curid=68003" title="Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first modern Olympiad, twelve athletics events were contested. A total of 25 medals (12 silver for winners, 13 bronze for runner-up, none for third) were awarded. The medals were later denoted as 37 modern medals (12 gold, 13 silver, 12 bronze). All of the events except the marathon were held in the Panathinaiko Stadium, which was also the finish for the marathon. Events were held on 6 April, 7 April, 9 April, and 10 April 1896 (all dates are according to the Gregorian calendar). Altogether, 63 athletes, all men, from nine nations competed. This made athletics the most international of the nine sports at the 1896 Games.

==Summary of events==
The American team of 11, which featured only one national champion, was dominant, taking 9 of the 12 titles. No world records were set, because few international top competitors had participated. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible.

The heats of the 100 metres were the first Olympic event to be conducted, and the winner of the first heat, Francis Lane, can thus be considered the first Olympic winner. The first Olympic champion was crowned in the triple jump, Harvard student James Connolly. Connolly also did well in the other jumping events, placing second in the high jump and third in the long jump.

Many other athletes were versatile as well. Thomas Burke won both the 100 metres and 400 metres, a feat not since repeated, while London-based Australian Edwin Flack won the 800 and 1500 metres races. Robert Garrett, a Princeton student, won two first and two second places. His first title was in the discus throw, an event originating from the Ancient Olympics, but never before held at an international event. Garrett had attempted to train for the event with a 10 kilogram replica of a discus, but had given up as it was too heavy. When he learned the actual competition discus weighed only 2 kilograms, he entered the event after all, and won it, to the dismay of the Greek public, who considered their throwers &quot;unbeatable&quot;.

A second event held for the first time in international competition was the marathon foot race. It was conceived by Michel Bréal, a friend of Pierre de Coubertin, based on the legend of Pheidippides. This Athenian soldier first completed a two-day run to seek Spartan help against the invading Persians in the Battle of Marathon, and then ran from the town of Marathon to Athens days later to announce the victory, dying as a result of his heroic efforts. The race started in Marathon, and ran for 40 kilometres over dusty roads to Athens. The Greek public, disappointed as there had not yet been a Greek victor in athletics, was overjoyed when it was announced during the race that a Greek runner had taken the lead. When Spiridon Louis, a water carrier from Maroussi, arrived in the stadium he was accompanied by the Greek Crown Prince on his final lap. Louis would never again compete in a race, but his victory made him a national hero.

The exploits of Louis, Garrett, Connolly, and Flack would be chronicled in the 1984 NBC miniseries, &quot;The First Olympics: Athens, 1896&quot;.

The day after the official marathon Stamata Revithi ran the 40-kilometer course in 5 hours 30 minutes, finishing outside Panathinaiko Stadium. She was denied entry into the official competition since the 1896 Olympics excluded women from competition.
== Schedule ==


==Medal summary==

These medals were retroactively assigned by the International Olympic Committee; at the time, winners were given a silver medal and runners-up bronze medals. Athletes coming third received no award.
==Medal table==
==Participating nations==

A total of 63 athletes from 9 nations competed at the Athens Games. Due to the nature of participation at the Games of the time not being fully through National Olympic Committees, there is a lack of clarity on which nations competed. For instance, Olympedia lists 1 athlete from Cyprus and 2 from Smyrna in counting 11 nations, but also notes the participation of &quot;Cyprus and Smyrna as part of the Greek team&quot;. Further, Chile claims to have had a competitor participate, which would increase the total to 64 athletes from 10 nations, but other sources list Luis Subercaseaux as not having started.

<doc id="68005" wikidata="Q3758978" url="?curid=68005" title="Loon">
<text>Loons (North American English) or divers (British / Irish English) are a group of aquatic birds found in much of North America and northern Eurasia. All living species of loons are members of the genus Gavia, family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes.

==Description==
Loons, which are the size of large ducks or small geese, resemble these birds in shape when swimming. Like ducks and geese, but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon&#x27;s toes are connected by webbing. The loons may be confused with the cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), but can be distinguished from them by their distinct call. Cormorants are not-too-distant relatives of loons, and like them are heavy-set birds whose bellies, unlike those of ducks and geese, are submerged when swimming. Loons in flight resemble plump geese with seagulls&#x27; wings that are relatively small in proportion to their bulky bodies. The bird points its head slightly upwards while swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight, the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.

Male and female loons have identical plumage, which is largely patterned black-and-white in summer, with grey on the head and neck in some species. All have a white belly. This resembles many sea-ducks (Merginae) – notably the smaller goldeneyes (&quot;Bucephala&quot;) – but is distinct from most cormorants, which rarely have white feathers, and if so, usually as large rounded patches rather than delicate patterns. All species of loons have a spear-shaped bill.

Males are larger on average, but relative size is only apparent when the male and female are together. In winter, plumage is dark grey above, with some indistinct lighter mottling on the wings, and a white chin, throat and underside. The specific species can then be distinguished by certain features, such as the size and colour of the head, neck, back and bill. But reliable identification of loons in winter is often difficult even for experts – particularly as the smaller immature birds look similar to winter-plumage adults, making size an unreliable means of identification.

Gaviiformes are among the few groups of birds in which the young moult into a second coat of down feathers after shedding the first one, rather than growing juvenile feathers with downy tips that wear off, as is typical in many birds. This trait is also found in tubenoses (Procellariiformes) and penguins (Sphenisciformes), both relatives of the loons.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Loons are excellent swimmers, using their feet to propel themselves above and under water. However, since their feet are located far back on the body, loons have difficulty walking on land, though they can effectively run short distances to reach water when frightened. Thus, loons avoid coming to land, except for mating and nesting. 

Loons fly strongly, though they have high wing loading (mass to wing area ratio), which complicates takeoff. Indeed, most species must run upwind across the water&#x27;s surface with wings flapping to generate sufficient lift to take flight. Only the red-throated loon (&quot;G. stellata&quot;) can take off from land. Once airborne, loons are capable of long flights during migration. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, who have implanted satellite transmitters in some individuals, have recorded daily flights of up to 1078 km in a 24-hour period, which probably resulted from single movements. North European loons migrate primarily via the South Baltic and directly over land to the Black Sea or Mediterranean. Loons can live as long as 30 years and can hold their breath for as long as 90 seconds while underwater.

Loons are migratory birds, and in the winter months they move from their northern freshwater lake nesting habitats to southern marine coastlines. They are well-adapted to this change in salinity, however, because they have special salt glands located directly above their eyes. These glands filter out salts in their blood and flush this salty solution out through their nasal passages, which allows them to immediately consume fish from oceans and drink saltwater after their long migration. 

===Diet and feeding===
Loons find their prey by sight. They eat mainly fish, supplemented with amphibians, crustaceans and similar mid-sized aquatic fauna. Specifically, they have been noted to feed on crayfish, frogs, snails, salamanders and leeches. They prefer clear lakes because they can more easily see their prey through the water. The loon uses its pointy bill to stab or grasp prey. They eat vertebrate prey headfirst to facilitate swallowing, and swallow all their prey whole.

To help digestion, loons swallow small pebbles from the bottoms of lakes. Similar to grit eaten by chickens, these gastroliths may assist the loon&#x27;s gizzard in crushing the hard parts of the loon&#x27;s food such as the exoskeletons of crustaceans and the bones of frogs and salamanders. The gastroliths may also be involved in stomach cleaning as an aid to regurgitation of indigestible food parts.

Loons may inadvertently ingest small lead pellets, released by anglers and hunters, that will contribute to lead poisoning and the loon&#x27;s eventual death. Jurisdictions that have banned the use of lead shot and sinkers include but are not limited to Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Michigan, some areas of Massachusetts, Yellowstone National Park, Canada, Great Britain, and Denmark.

===Reproduction===
Loons nest during the summer on freshwater lakes and/or large ponds. Smaller bodies of water (up to 0.5 km2) will usually only have one pair. Larger lakes may have more than one pair, with each pair occupying a bay or section of the lake. The red-throated loon, however, may nest colonially, several pairs close together, in small Arctic tarns and feed at sea or in larger lakes, ferrying the food in for the young.

Loons mate on land, often on the future nest site, and build their nests close to the water, preferring sites that are completely surrounded by water such as islands or emergent vegetation. Loons use a variety of materials to build their nests including aquatic vegetation, pine needles, leaves, grass, moss and mud. Sometimes, nest material is almost lacking. Both male and female build the nest and incubate jointly for 28 days. If the eggs are lost, the pair may re-nest, usually in a different location. Since the nest is very close to the water, rising water may induce the birds to slowly move the nest upwards, over a metre.

Despite the roughly equal participation of the sexes in nest building and incubation, analysis has shown clearly that males alone select the location of the nest. This pattern has the important consequence that male loons, but not females, establish significant site-familiarity with their territories that allows them to produce more chicks there over time. Sex-biased site-familiarity might explain, in part, why resident males fight so hard to defend their territories.

Most clutches consist of two eggs, which are laid in May or June, depending upon latitude. Loon chicks are precocial, able to swim and dive right away, but will often ride on their parents&#x27; back during their first two weeks to rest, conserve heat, and avoid predators. Chicks are fed mainly by their parents for about six weeks but gradually begin to feed themselves over time. By 11 or 12 weeks, chicks gather almost all of their own food and have begun to fly. In 2019, a necropsy of a bald eagle found floating on a Maine lake (beside the floating body of a loon chick) found that the eagle had been stabbed through the heart by an adult loon&#x27;s beak.

Biologists, especially from Chapman University, have extensively studied the mating behaviour of the common loon (&quot;G. immer&quot;). Contrary to popular belief, pairs seldom mate for life. Indeed, a typical adult loon is likely to have several mates during its lifetime because of territorial takeover. Each breeding pair must frequently defend its territory against &quot;floaters&quot; (territory-less adults) trying to evict at least one owner and seize the breeding site. Territories that have produced chicks in the past year are especially prone to takeovers, because nonbreeding loons use chicks as cues to indicate high-quality territories. One-third of all territorial evictions among males result in the death of the owner; in contrast, female loons usually survive. Birds that are displaced from a territory but survive usually try to re-mate and (re)claim a breeding territory later in life. 

In 2020, a loon hatched for the first time in over a century in Southeastern Massachusetts at Fall River, the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife and Biodiversity Research Institute. The chicks were relocated in 2015 with the hopes of re-establishing breeding and nesting patterns.

==Etymology and taxonomy==

The European Anglophone name &quot;diver&quot; comes from the bird&#x27;s habit of catching fish by swimming calmly along the surface and then abruptly plunging into the water. The North American name &quot;loon&quot; likely comes from either the Old English word &quot;lumme&quot;, meaning lummox or awkward person, or the Scandinavian word &quot;lum&quot; meaning lame or clumsy. Either way, the name refers to the loon&#x27;s poor ability to walk on land.

Another possible derivation is from the Norwegian word &quot;lom&quot; for these birds, which comes from Old Norse &quot; lómr&quot;, possibly cognate with English &quot;lament&quot;, referring to the characteristic plaintive sound of the loon. The scientific name &quot;Gavia&quot; refers to seabirds in general.

The scientific name &quot;Gavia&quot; was the Latin term for the smew (&quot;Mergellus albellus&quot;). This small sea-duck is quite unrelated to loons and just happens to be another black-and-white seabird which swims and dives for fish. It is not likely that the ancient Romans had much knowledge of loons, as these are limited to more northern latitudes and since the end of the last glacial period seem to have occurred only as rare winter migrants in the Mediterranean region.
The term &quot;gavia&quot; was transferred from the ducks to the loons only in the 18th century. Earlier naturalists referred to the loons as &quot;mergus&quot; (the Latin term for diving seabirds of all sorts) or &quot;colymbus&quot;, which became the genus name used in the first modern scientific description of a &quot;Gavia&quot; species (by Carl Linnaeus) in 1758. Unfortunately, confusion about whether Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;wastebin genus&quot; &quot;Colymbus&quot; referred to loons or grebes abounded. North American ornithologists used the genus name to refer to grebes, while Europeans used it for loons, following Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Richard Bowdler Sharpe.

The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature tried to settle this issue in 1956 by declaring &quot;Colymbus&quot; a suppressed name unfit for further use and establishing &quot;Gavia&quot;, created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus name for the loons. However, the situation was not completely resolved even then, and the following year the ICZN had to act again to prevent Louis Pierre Vieillot&#x27;s 1818 almost-forgotten family name Urinatoridae from overruling the much younger Gaviidae. Some eminent ornithologists such as Pierce Brodkorb tried to keep the debate alive, but the ICZN&#x27;s solution has been satisfactory.

==Systematics and evolution==
All living species are placed in the genus &quot;Gavia&quot;. It has been suggested that the genus &quot;Gavia&quot; originated in Europe during the Paleogene. The earliest species, &quot;G. egeriana&quot;, was found in early Miocene deposits in Dolnice in the Czech Republic. During the remainder of the Miocene, &quot;Gavia&quot; managed to disperse into North America via the Atlantic coastlines, eventually making their way to the continent&#x27;s Pacific coastlines by the Late Miocene. Study of the interrelationships of the extant species has found that the red-throated loons are the most basal of the five species.


===Fossil record===
Nearly ten prehistoric species have been named to date in the genus &quot;Gavia&quot;, and about as many undescribed ones await further study. The genus is known from the Early Miocene onwards, and the oldest members are rather small (some are smaller than the red-throated loon). Throughout the late Neogene, the genus by and large follows Cope&#x27;s Rule (that population lineages tend to increase in body size over evolutionary time). 

List of fossil &quot;Gavia&quot; species

* †&quot;G. concinna&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of west and east United States)
* †&quot;G. egeriana&quot; (Early Miocene of Czechoslovakia ?and Cheswold, Delaware, United States –? Yorktown Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina, United States)

List of fossil &quot;Gavia&quot; specimens
* &quot;Gavia&quot; sp. (Early-Middle Miocene of eastern United States)
* &quot;Gavia&quot; sp. (Calvert Middle Miocene ?or Pleistocene of Maryland, United States) – same as &quot;Gavia&quot; cf. &quot;immer&quot; below?
* &quot;Gavia&quot; spp. (Middle Miocene of Steinheim, Germany) – three species
* &quot;Gavia&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene of Empoli, Italy)
* &quot;Gavia&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene of Kerč Peninsula, Ukraine)
* &quot;Gavia&quot; cf. &quot;concinna&quot; (San Diego Middle/Late Pliocene of San Diego, California, United States) – two species?
* &quot;Gavia&quot; sp. (Early Pleistocene of Kairy, Ukraine)
* &quot;Gavia&quot; cf. &quot;immer&quot; (Pleistocene of California and Florida, United States) – possibly a &quot;G. immer&quot; paleosubspecies

&quot;&quot;Gavia&quot; portisi&quot; from the Late Pliocene of Orciano Pisano, Italy, is known from a cervical vertebra that may or may not have been from a loon. If so, it was from a bird slightly smaller than the common loon. Older authors were quite sure the bone was indeed from a &quot;Gavia&quot; and even considered &quot;G. concinna&quot; a possibly junior synonym of it. This is now regarded as rather unlikely due to the quite distinct range and age. The Early Pliocene &quot;Gavia&quot; skull from Empoli (Italy) was referred to &quot;G. concinna&quot;, and thus could conceivably have been of &quot;&quot;G.&quot; portisi&quot; if that was indeed a loon. The holotype vertebra may now be lost, which would make &quot;&quot;G.&quot; portisi&quot; a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*Various Indigenous myths from the California region have a recurring figure, Loon or Loon Woman, based on the common loon.
*The Tlingit of Alaska believe that loon cries forecast rain. Gaǥeit is named after the common loon (&quot;kagit&quot;).

*The common loon is the provincial bird of Ontario and is depicted on the Canadian one-dollar coin, which has come to be known affectionately as the &quot;loonie&quot;.
*The common loon is the official state bird of Minnesota.
*Mercer, Wisconsin, promotes itself as the &quot;Loon Capital of the World&quot;.
*Henry David Thoreau describes a playful and inspiring acquaintance with a loon on Walden Pond in his book &quot;Walden&quot;.
*The Great Lakes Loons are a minor-league professional baseball team based in Midland, Michigan, United States. The primary mascot is Lou E. Loon.
*The Warner Bros./Amblin cartoon Tiny Toon Adventures features Shirley the Loon, who speaks with a thick Valley girl accent and is obsessed with superficial New Age paraphernalia. She is voiced by Saturday Night Live cast member Gail Matthius.
*The Major League Soccer club Minnesota United FC use a loon in the club&#x27;s crest, and as a nickname for the team.
*Thanks to its inclusion as a preset in the E-mu Emulator, a specific sample of a Canadian loon, notably heard in &quot;Sueño Latino&quot; (1989) and in 808 State’s &quot;Pacific State&quot; (1989), has become a recurring motif in electronic-based popular music.

<doc id="68029" wikidata="Q8692" url="?curid=68029" title="Bilbao">
<text>Bilbao is a city in northern Spain, the largest city in the province of Biscay and in the Basque Country as a whole. It is also the largest city proper in northern Spain. Bilbao is the tenth largest city in Spain, with a population of more than 347,000 as of 2023. The Bilbao metropolitan area has 1,037,847 inhabitants, making it the most populous metropolitan area in northern Spain. The comarca of Greater Bilbao is the fifth-largest urban area in Spain. Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the Greater Basque region.

Bilbao is located in the north-central part of Spain, some south of the Bay of Biscay, where the economic social development is located, where the estuary of Bilbao is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small mountain ranges with an average elevation of . Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by Iberian standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude.

After its foundation in the late 13th century by Diego López V de Haro, head of the powerful Haro family, Bilbao was one of the commercial hubs of the Basque Country that enjoyed significant importance in the Crown of Castile. This was due to its thriving port activity based on the export of wool and iron commodities extracted from the Biscayan quarries to all over Europe.

Throughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the centre of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind Barcelona. At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities. Nowadays, Bilbao is a vigorous service city that is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalisation process, started by the iconic Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, and continued by infrastructure investments, such as the airport terminal, the rapid transit system, the tram line, the Azkuna Zentroa, and the currently under development Abandoibarra and Zorrozaurre renewal projects.

Bilbao is also home to football team Athletic Club, a significant symbol for Basque nationalism due to its promotion of only Basque players and being one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history.

On 19 May 2010, the city of Bilbao was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, awarded by the city state of Singapore. Considered the Nobel Prize for urbanism, it was handed out on 29 June 2010. On 7 January 2013, its mayor, Iñaki Azkuna, received the 2012 World Mayor Prize awarded every two years by the British foundation The City Mayors Foundation, in recognition of the urban transformation experienced by the Biscayan capital since the 1990s. On 8 November 2017, Bilbao was chosen the Best European City 2018 at The Urbanism Awards 2018, awarded by the international organisation The Academy of Urbanism.

== Toponymy and symbols ==
The official name of the town is Bilbao, as known in most languages of the world. Euskaltzaindia, the official regulatory institution of the Basque language, has agreed that between the two possible names existing in Basque, &quot;Bilbao&quot; and &quot;Bilbo&quot;, the historical name is &quot;Bilbo&quot;, while &quot;Bilbao&quot; is the official name. Although the term &quot;Bilbo&quot; does not appear in old documents, in the play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; by William Shakespeare, there is a reference to swords presumably made of Biscayan iron which he calls &quot;bilboes&quot;, suggesting that it is a word used since at least the sixteenth century.

There is no consensus among historians about the origin of the name. Generally accepted accounts state that prior to the 12th century, the independent rulers of the territory, named Lords of Zubialdea, were also known as Lords of Bilbao la Vieja (&quot;Old Bilbao&quot;). The symbols of their patrimony are the tower and church used in the shield of Bilbao to this day. One possible origin was suggested by the engineer Evaristo de Churruca. He said that it was a Basque custom to name a place after its location. For Bilbao this would be the result of the union of the Basque words for river and cove: &quot;Bil-Ibaia-Bao&quot;. The historian José Tussel Gómez argues that it is just a natural evolution of the Spanish words &quot;bello vado&quot;, beautiful ford. On the other hand, according to the writer Esteban Calle Iturrino, the name derives from the two settlements that existed on both banks of the estuary, rather than from the estuary itself. The first, where the present Casco Viejo is located, would be called &quot;billa&quot;, which means stacking in Basque, after the configuration of the buildings. The second, on the left bank, where now Bilbao La Vieja is located, would be called &quot;vaho&quot;, Spanish for mist or steam. From the union of these two derives the name Bilbao, which was also written as &quot;Bilvao&quot; and &quot;Biluao&quot;, as documented in its municipal charter.
An &quot;-ao&quot; ending is also present in nearby Sestao and Ugao, that could be explained from Basque &quot;aho&quot;, &quot;mouth&quot;.

===Demonym===

The demonym is &quot;bilbaíno, -a&quot;&quot;, although the popular pronunciation &quot;bilbaino/a&quot; (sic) is also frequent. In Basque, it is &quot;bilbotar&quot;, which is sometimes also used in Spanish, generally within the Basque Country. 
The village is affectionately known by its inhabitants as the &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;hole&quot;, since it is surrounded by mountains. The nickname &quot;botxero&quot; is derived from this nickname. Another nickname that Bilbao receives is that of &quot;chimbos&quot;, which comes from birds that were hunted in large numbers in these places during the 19th century.

The titles, the flag and the coat of arms are Bilbao&#x27;s traditional symbols and belong to its historic patrimony, being used in formal acts, for the identification and decoration of specific places or for the validation of documents.

=== Titles ===
Bilbao holds the historic category of township (&quot;villa&quot;), with the titles of &quot;Very noble and very loyal and unbeaten&quot; (&quot;Muy Noble y Muy Leal e Invicta&quot;). It was the Catholic Monarchs who awarded the title &quot;Noble Town&quot; (&quot;Noble Villa&quot;) on 20 September 1475. Philip III of Spain, via a letter in 1603 awarded the town the titles of &quot;Very noble and very loyal&quot;. After the siege of Bilbao, during the First Carlist War, on 25 December 1836, the title of &quot;Unbeaten&quot; was added.

=== Coat of arms ===

The coat of arms is emblazoned as follows:
It has its origins in the 14th century and has remained with the same symbols since then, although its presentation has been adapted according to the destiny of the coat of arms. The durability of this shield is due to the representativeness of the symbols that appear. The navigable estuary and the stone bridge, prior to the founding of the town.  The wolves, typical of the coat of arms of the founder of the town in 1300, Diego López de Haro, son of Diego Lope Díaz de Haro (Lope comes from the Latin Lupus (wolf)) were added by the town council to represent the founder. Later, the fortress or castle that guarded the bridge was added and, when it was demolished in 1366, it was replaced by the temple of San Antón that was built in its place and inaugurated in 1433.

=== Flag ===
The flag that represents the city is white with a red block, in a ratio of three parts long by two wide. The colours red and white are the historical ones of the villa.

The Royal Order of 30 July 1845 determined the maritime password for the population. This was defined as a white flag with an upper red die next to the pod. The die should be square and the length of its side should equal half of the pod. Previously, at least since 1511, the banner that the &quot; Bilbao Consulate &quot; was wearing was white with a red Cross of Burgundy. The relationship of the town with the mercantile and marine activities was always very strong coming to share headquarters. In 1603 the new consistorial house is inaugurated and in it the headquarters of the city council and of the referred one &quot; Bilbao Consulate &quot; are located. The intimate relationship made the flag of the Consulate was related as a flag of the town by citizenship.

The definition of the maritime flag in 1845 was assumed by the population, who accepted it as their own, and so did the city council. At the inauguration of the Bilbao-Miranda de Ebro railway line, it was already used as a symbol of the town&#x27;s representation, being permanently adopted in 1895 although no resolution has been adopted for this purpose.

Although it has always been assumed by the municipal institution and citizenship, at the beginning of the 20th century it was discussed in a municipal plenary session about the determination of a flag for the town. There was talk about &quot;the use of the crimson colour of the Lordship of Biscay, or of the cross of Saint Andrew&quot; but without reaching any resolution to the effect.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Remains of an ancient settlement were found on the top of Mount Malmasín, dating from around the 3rd or 2nd century BC. Burial sites were also found on mounts Avril and Artxanda, dated 6,000 years old. Some authors identify the old settlement of Bilbao as &quot;Amanun Portus&quot;, cited by Pliny the Elder, or with &quot;Flaviobriga&quot;, by Ptolemy.

=== Medieval Bilbao ===

Ancient walls, which date from around the 11th century, have been discovered below the Church of San Antón. Bilbao was one of the first towns founded in the fourteenth century, during a period in which approximately three-quarters of the Biscayan cities were developed, among them Portugalete in 1323, Ondarroa in 1327, Lekeitio in 1335, and Mungia and Larrabetzu in 1376. Diego López V de Haro, then third Lord of Biscay, founded Bilbao through a municipal charter dated in Valladolid on 15 June 1300 and confirmed by King Ferdinand IV of Castile in Burgos, on 4 January 1301. Diego López established the new town on the right bank of the Nervión river, on the grounds of the &quot;elizate&quot; of Begoña and granted it the &quot;fuero&quot; of Logroño, a compilation of rights and privileges that would prove fundamental to its later development.

In 1310 María Díaz I de Haro, niece of Diego López V and Lady of Biscay, grants a new municipal charter to the city, which extends its commercial privileges even further, transforming the city in a mandatory stop for all the trade coming from Castile towards the sea. This second charter established that the road from Orduña to Bermeo, at the time the most important trade route in the lordship, had to traverse the San Antón Bridge in Bilbao instead of the pass in Etxebarri, as it did until then. This strengthened the position of Bilbao as a trading post, in detriment of Bermeo, city which until then had acted as the main port of the territory. In addition, Bilbao was granted exclusive rights to all trade between the city and Las Arenas. In 1372, John I of Castile strengthened even more the city&#x27;s position by naming Bilbao a free port and granting it special privileges concerning the trade of iron. This caused Bilbao to become an important port, particularly due to its trade with Flanders and Great Britain.

In 1443 the Church of Saint Anthony the Great was enshrined, having been built in the place of an old &quot;alcázar&quot;. Still today the church is one of the oldest extant buildings of the city. On 5 September 1483, the Queen Isabella I of Castile traveled to Bilbao to swear fealty to the fueros of Biscay. Her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon had already done so in 1476 in Gernika.

=== Modern age ===

On 21 June 1511, Queen Joanna of Castile ordered the creation of the Consulate of the Sea of Bilbao. This would become the most influential institution of the borough for centuries, and would claim jurisdiction over the estuary, improving its infrastructure. Under the Consulate&#x27;s control, the port of Bilbao became one of the most important of the kingdom. The first printing-press was brought to the town in 1577. Here in 1596, the first book in the Basque language was edited, entitled &quot;Doctrina Christiana en Romance y Bascuence&quot; by Dr. Betolaza.

In 1602 Bilbao was made the capital of Biscay, a title previously held by Bermeo. Around 1631, the city was the scenario of a series of revolts against the increased taxation on salt, which had been ordered by the Crown, an event locally known as the &quot;&quot;Machinada&quot; of the salt&quot;. The revolt ended with the execution of several of its leaders. The city had seen a continuous increase of its wealth, especially after the discovery of extensive iron deposits in the surrounding mountains, and by the end of the century it managed to overcome the economic crises that affected the rest of the kingdom, thanks in part to the increased trading of wool (which now used the port of Bilbao instead of the one in Santander), and to the iron ore and its commerce with England and the Netherlands.

=== Contemporary Bilbao ===

==== Napoleonic invasion and Carlist wars ====

The French invasion of Spain saw the occupation of several Basque cities, but Bilbao was not among them. The first open uprising against Napoleonic rule took place on 6 August 1808, a month after the Battle of Bailén. French troops sieged and sacked the city, alongside the neighbouring towns of Deusto and Begoña on 16 August. Beginning in February 1810, the city was under the command of Pierre Thouvenot, general of the French army and Baron of the Empire, who had become the head of the Military Government of &quot;Vizcaya&quot;, which included the three Basque provinces. Thouvenot intended to move forward with the plan of total annexation of the Basque provinces into France, but the Peninsular War and ultimately the Battle of Vitoria made those plans impossible.

The Basque Country was one of the main sites of battles during the First Carlist War, a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent Maria Christina, known as liberals, and those of the late king&#x27;s brother Carlos of Borbón, known as Carlists. The Carlists were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain. The Carlist general Tomás de Zumalacárregui tried to take the city during the siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near Begoña and died some time after in the town of Zegama. The next year, the city resisted a second siege during which the liberal general Baldomero Espartero defeated the Carlists in the Battle of Luchana. The city was untouched by the Second Carlist War, which took place mostly in Catalonia, but was again an important scenario during the Third Carlist War; in April 1874 the city suffered a third siege which lasted two months.

Despite the warfare, Bilbao prospered during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when it rose as the economic centre of the Basque Country. It was during this time that the railway first arrived to the city and the Bank of Bilbao (which later would go on to become the BBVA) was founded, as well as the Bilbao Stock Exchange. Steelmaking industries flourished with the creation of many new factories, including the Santa Ana de Bolueta and the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in 1902. The city was modernised with new avenues and walkways, as well as with new modern buildings such as the City Hall building, the Basurto Hospital and the Arriaga Theatre. The population increased dramatically, from 11,000 in 1880 to 80,000 in 1900. Social movements also arose, notably Basque nationalism under Sabino Arana, which in the subsequent decades would grow to become the Basque Nationalist Party.

==== Civil war and Francoist dictatorship ====

The Spanish Civil War in Bilbao started with a number of small uprisings suppressed by the Republican forces. On 31 August 1936, the city suffered its first bombing, with a series of air bombs dropped by Nationalist airplanes. In September, the Nationalists distributed pamphlets threatening further bombing if the city did not give up, which finally took place on 25 September when German planes, in coordination with Francoist forces, dropped at least a hundred bombs on the city. In May 1937, the Nationalist army besieged the town. The battle lasted until 19 June of that year, when Lieutenant Colonel Putz was ordered to destroy all bridges over the estuary, and the troops of the 5th Brigade took the borough from the mountains Malmasin, Pagasarri, and Arnotegi.

With the war over, Bilbao returned to its industrial development, accompanied by steady population growth. In the 1940s, the city was rebuilt, starting with the bridges and by 1948, the first commercial flight took off from the local airport. Over the next decade, there was a revival of the iron industry, which became a strategic industrial sector in Spain, as a consequence of the economic model promoted by Francoism. The city received migrants from other Spanish regions looking to work in the iron industry. The demand for housing outstripped supply, and workers built slums on the hillsides. It was in this context that the first social movements arose and the strike of the &quot;Euskalduna&quot; shipyard in 1947 was the first one to take place during the Francoist dictatorship. In this environment of social repression, on 31 July 1959 the separatist organisation ETA was created from Basque nationalist movements. During the 1960s the city was the scenario of several urban projects, with the creation of new neighbourhoods like Otxarkoaga and the motorway to the French border. In June 1968 the University of Bilbao, the first public university, was established. It would later be integrated into the University of the Basque Country.

==== Democracy and urban renewal ====

After the end of Francoist Spain and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, in a process known in Spain as the transition, Bilbao was able to hold democratic elections again. This time Basque nationalists rose to power. With the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country in 1979, Vitoria-Gasteiz was elected the seat of the government and therefore the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Basque Autonomous Community, although Bilbao was larger and more powerful economically. In the 1980s, several factors such as labour demands and the arrival of cheap labour from abroad led to a devastating industrial crisis.

On 26 August 1983 during the celebration of the local festivities known as &quot;Aste Nagusia&quot;, the estuary overflowed up to five metres in some areas due to the continuous raining, killing two people and causing important destructions in the city&#x27;s infrastructure, with a total economic cost that reached 60,000 million pesetas (around €360 million)

Since the mid-1990s, Bilbao has been in a process of deindustrialization and transition to a service economy, supported by investment in infrastructure and urban renewal, starting with the opening of the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum (the so-called &quot;Guggenheim effect&quot;), and continuing with the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, Santiago Calatrava&#x27;s Zubizuri, the metro network by Norman Foster, the tram, the Iberdrola Tower and the Zorrozaurre development plan, among others. Many officially supported associations such as Bilbao Metrópoli-30 and Bilbao Ría 2000 were created to monitor these projects.
== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Bilbao is located near the northern edge of the Iberian Peninsula, about from the Bay of Biscay. It covers an area of , of which are urban and the remaining consist of the surrounding mountains. The official average altitude is , although there are measurements between and . It is also the core of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Greater Bilbao. It is surrounded by the municipalities of Derio, Etxebarri, Galdakao, Loiu, Sondika, and Zamudio to the north; Arrigorriaga and Basauri to the west; Alonsotegi to the south; and Barakaldo and Erandio to the east.

Bilbao is located on the Basque threshold, the range between the larger Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. The soil is predominantly composed of mesozoic materials (limestone, sandstone, and marl) sedimented over a primitive paleozoic base. The relief of the province is dominated by NW-SE and WNW-ESE oriented folds. The main fold is the anticline of Bilbao which runs from the municipality of Elorrio to Galdames. Inside Bilbao there are two secondary folds, one in the northeast, composed of Mounts Artxanda, Avril, Banderas, Pikota, San Bernabé, and Cabras; and other in the south, composed of Mounts Kobetas, Restaleku, Pagasarri and Arraiz. The highest point in the municipality is Mount Ganeta, of , followed by Mount Pagasarri, of , both on the border with Alonsotegi.

=== Hydrology ===

The main river system of Bilbao is also the hydrological artery of Biscay. The rivers Nervión and Ibaizabal converge in Basauri and form an estuary named variously &quot;estuary of Bilbao&quot;, &quot;of the Nervión&quot;, &quot;of the Ibaizabal&quot;, or &quot;of the Nervión-Ibaizabal&quot;. The estuary runs for and with a low flow (with an average of per second). Its main tributary is the river Cadagua, which rises in the Mena valley and has a basin of , mostly lying in the neighbouring province of Burgos. This river is also the natural border between Bilbao and Barakaldo.

The river has frequently suffered from human intervention, as seen in the dredging of its bottom, the building of docks on both banks and especially in the Deusto canal, an artificial waterway dug between 1950 and 1968 in the district of Deusto as a lateral canal, with the aim of facilitating navigation, sparing ships from the natural curves of the estuary. The project was stopped with left to complete, and it was decided to leave it as a dock. However, in 2007, a plan was approved to continue the canal and form the island of Zorrozaurre. This human intervention has also brought negative results in the quality of the water, after decades of toxic waste dumping causing a situation of anoxia (lack of oxygen), which almost eliminated the entire fauna and flora. However, in recent years this situation is being reversed, thanks to a dumping ban and natural regeneration. now it is possible to observe algae, tonguefishes, crabs, and seabirds, as well as occasional bathers in the summer months.

The estuary is also a natural border for several neighbourhoods and districts within the borough. Entering the municipality from the west it separates the districts of Begoña and Ibaiondo, then Abando and Uribarri and lastly Deusto and Basurto-Zorroza.

=== Climate ===

Its proximity to the Bay of Biscay gives Bilbao an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), with precipitation occurring throughout the year and without a well-defined dry summer. Precipitation is abundant, and given the latitude and atmospheric dynamics, rainy days represent 45% and cloudy days 40% of the annual total. The rainiest season is between October and April, November being the wettest. Snow is not frequent in Bilbao, although it is possible to see snow on the top of the surrounding mountains. Sleet is more frequent, about 10 days per year, mainly in the winter months. Bilbao is nearest to the subtropical boundary of all the Atlantic coastal cities in the country with an August daily mean of . There is also a drying trend in summer with only around of rainfall in July – but not dry enough to be considered Mediterranean.

The proximity of the ocean also means that the two best defined seasons (summer and winter) remain mild, with low intensity thermal oscillations. Average maximum temperatures vary between in the summer months, while the average minimum in winter is between .

Extreme record observations in Bilbao are maximum (on 11 August 2024) and minimum (on 3 February 1963). The maximum precipitation in a day was on 26 August 1983 when severe flooding was caused by the Nervión river.

== Demographics ==
According to the Basque Statistics Office, the population of Bilbao is 342,397 people as of 2017, distributed on a land area of , making Bilbao the largest city by population of the Basque Autonomous Community and of the Basque Country as a whole. Bilbao makes the main component of the Bilbao metropolitan area, with a population of 1,037,847 people.

The first credible data on the population of Bilbao are post-1550. It is known that in 1530 Biscay had approximately 65,000 inhabitants, a number that could have been reduced by plagues that struck the city in 1517, 1530, 1564–68, and 1597–1601, the last being especially devastating. This trend for periodic reverses in population growth was maintained until the nineteenth century. Since then, Bilbao has experienced an exponential growth in population thanks to industrialisation. After a peak of 433,115 inhabitants in 1982, the municipalities of the Txorierri valley were removed from Bilbao, with the corresponding loss of their population.

Spanish is the most spoken language in the city, followed by Basque language. According to the city government of Bilbao, at least 51% of the population can speak &quot;some Basque&quot;, while 29% consider themselves to be fluent.

=== Migration ===

Out of the 355,731 people residing in Bilbao in 2009, only 114,220 (32.1%) were born inside the municipality. Of the remainder, 114,908 were born in other Biscayan towns, while 9,545 were born in the other two Basque provinces; 85,789 came from the rest of Spain (mainly Castile-León and Galicia), and 33,537 were foreigners. There are 127 different nationalities registered in Bilbao, although 60 of them represent fewer than 10 people each. The largest foreign communities are Bolivians and Colombians, with 4,879 and 3,730 respectively. Other nationalities with more than 1,000 inhabitants are Romanians (2,248), Moroccans (2,058), Ecuadorians (1,832), Chinese (1,390), Brazilians (1,273) and Paraguayans, with 1,204.

== Government ==

The city of Bilbao is the capital of the province of Biscay and as such it is home of the administrative entities that pertain to the provincial administration, both from the autonomous and central governments. Settled in the city are the provincial delegations of the different departments of the Basque autonomous government, each coordinated by a representative. In addition, the Government of Spain has the official Government Subdelegation in the city.

=== Municipal government ===
Bilbao is a municipality and has a mayor-council government system. The municipal government is elected for four-year terms by universal suffrage and it is divided into two branches, executive and legislative. The legislative side consists of a municipal plenum composed of 29 councillors. These councillors represent the different political parties elected in the local elections, for which can vote all residents registered in the city who are citizens of Spain or of any member state of the European Union. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and a board of governors. The number of members of the board cannot be more than a third the number of members of the legislative plenum and the mayor can appoint them at his or her own discretion.

Since 1892 the seat of the government has been the Bilbao City Hall, located on the centric Ernesto Erkoreka Plaza and by the Estuary of Bilbao. It is the fourth city hall building to have been used since the year 1300. The first three city halls were located by the San Antón Church but were destroyed due to floodings. The current building was designed by the Spanish architect Joaquín Rucoba in Baroque style and was built in the former site of the San Agustín Monastery, which was destroyed during the First Carlist War. Since the Spanish transition to democracy, the city has been governed by the Basque Nationalist Party, often with support of the Socialist Party of the Basque Country. Iñaki Azkuna served as mayor from 1999 until his passing in 2014, when he was replaced by Ibon Areso. Azkuna was awarded the World Mayor prize in 2012. Since the 2019 municipal election, the councillors of the plenum have the following political distribution: 14 seats for the Basque Nationalist Party, 5 seats for the Socialist Party of the Basque Country, 4 seats for the EH Bildu coalition, 3 seats for Udalberri and 3 seats for the People&#x27;s Party. The mayor is Juan Mari Aburto, chosen with 19 votes from the Basque Nationalist Party and the Socialist party.

In 2008 and 2010, Bilbao won the Municipal Transparency Prize, awarded by the Spanish division of Transparency International. In 2009 it came second, after Sant Cugat del Vallés.

=== Districts ===

The municipality is divided into eight districts (Basque: &quot;barrutia&quot;) which are further subdivided into 34 neighbourhoods (Basque: &quot;auzoa&quot;). Most of the districts and neighbourhoods were former independent municipalities and elizates that were eventually annexed into the city. Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as Bilbao la Vieja. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of Begoña and the river side of Uribarri. In the 19th century the merge of Abando into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality&#x27;s town hall and the Mount Cobetas, such as Errekalde and Basurto. Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Begoña and Deusto. In the decade of 1960 as an effort to stop the increasing problem of slums, new neighbourhoods were created from the ground up, among them Otxarkoaga and Txurdinaga, which were joined together as a new district, Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga in the decade of 1990.

== Economy ==

The Bilbao metropolitan area comprises about 47% of the total population of the Basque autonomous community, out of which a 15% is registered in the municipality of Bilbao. The &quot;comarca&quot; of Greater Bilbao, in which the city occupies a central position, has a GDP per capita of €30,860, higher than the Spanish and European Union averages. The Bilbao metropolitan area has a nominal GDP amounting to $36,9 billion. Bilbao has been the economic centre of the Basque autonomous community since the original establishment of the Consulate of the Sea in the city in the 16th century, mostly thanks to the commerce in Castilian products on the town&#x27;s port. It was in the 19th century when the city experimented its biggest economic development, mainly based on the exploitation of the nearby iron mines and siderurgy, both of which promoted maritime traffic and port activity and eventually the development of a very important shipbuilding industry.

=== Banking ===

Banking became an important sector with the establishment of the Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: &quot;Banco de Bilbao&quot;) in 1857 and the Bank of Biscay (Spanish: &quot;Banco de Vizcaya&quot;) in 1901. These two entities merged in 1988 creating the BBV, which finally merged with Argentaria bank in 1999, creating the current multinational corporation, the BBVA. The savings banks that were established locally, the Municipal Savings Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: &quot;Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao&quot;) in 1907 and the Provincial Savings Bank of Biscay (Spanish: &quot;Caja de Ahorros Provincial de Vizcaya&quot;) in 1921, would merge in 1990 to form the Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa (BBK), which would merge again in 2012 with other Basque financial entities (Kutxa and Caja Vital Kutxa) to form Kutxabank. There is also the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Bilbao and the Stock Exchange Market of Bilbao, founded in 1890.

=== Port ===
The historical port was located in what is today an area called the Arenal, a few steps from the old city, until the late 19th century. In 1902, an exterior port was built at the mouth of the estuary, in the coastal municipality of Santurtzi. Further extensions to the outer port, which became called &quot;the super-port&quot;, led to the final move of the city portuary facilities in the 1970s, finally replacing the docks in the centre of the city, with the exception of those located in the neighbourhood of Zorrotza, still active.

The port of Bilbao is a first-class commercial port and is among the top five of Spain. Over 200 regular maritime services link Bilbao with 500 ports worldwide. At the close of 2009 cargo movements amounted to 31.6 million tonnes, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries being the main markets. In the first semester of 2008, it received over 67,000 passengers and 2,770 ships. This activity contributed €419 million to the Basque GDP and maintains almost 10,000 jobs.

=== Mining and ironworks ===
Iron is the main and most abundant raw material found in Biscay, and its extraction has been legally regulated since 1526. Mining was the main primary activity in Bilbao and the minerals, of great quality, were exported to all over Europe. It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that an ironworks industry was developed, benefiting from the resources and the city&#x27;s good communication links. In the 20th century, both Spanish and European capitals imported around 90% of the iron from Biscay. Although World War I made Bilbao one of the main ironworks powers, a subsequent crisis prompted a decline in the activity.

=== Tourism ===

The first notion of Bilbao as a tourist destination came with the inauguration of the railway between Bilbao and the coastal neighbourhood of Las Arenas, in the municipality of Getxo in 1872. The connection made Bilbao a minor beach destination.

The real tourist surge though would come much later with the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 1997. Thereafter tourist arrivals registered a continued upward trend, reaching over 932,000 visitors in 2018. The trend was exponential considering that in 1995, Bilbao only counted 25,000 tourists. Bilbao also hosts 31% of the total Basque Country visitors, being the top destination of this autonomous community, outranking San Sebastián. The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Madrid and Catalonia. International travellers are predominantly French, crossing the border just to the east. The others arrive from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Tourism generates about €300 million yearly for the Biscayan GDP. Bilbao also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, and the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, in nearby Barakaldo.

=== Stock exchange ===
Plans to create a stock exchange market in Bilbao began in the early 19th century, even though it would not be realized until 21 July 1890. Bilbao&#x27;s institution is one of the country&#x27;s four regional stock exchanges, joining Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia as Spain&#x27;s commercial centres. It is owned by Bolsas y Mercados Españoles.

== Cityscape ==


=== Urban planning ===
In its beginnings, Bilbao only had three streets (&quot;Somera&quot;, &quot;Artecalle&quot;, and &quot;Tendería&quot;) surrounded by walls located where Ronda street now stands. Inside this enclosure, there was a small hermitage dedicated to the Apostle Saint James (the current St. James&#x27; Cathedral), which pilgrims visited on their way to Santiago de Compostela. In the fifteenth century, four more streets were built, forming the original &quot;Zazpikaleak&quot; or &quot;Seven Streets&quot;. In 1571, after several floods and a major fire in 1569, the walls were demolished in order to allow the expansion of the town.

In 1861, engineer Amado Lázaro projected an &quot;ensanche&quot; inside the then-municipality of Abando with wide avenues and regular buildings, that included the hygienists ideas of the time. The project was mostly based on Barcelona&#x27;s &quot;Eixample&quot;, designed by Ildefons Cerdà. However, the project was dropped by the Bilbao City Council after considering it &quot;utopian and excessive&quot; because of its high cost, though of great quality. Furthermore, Lázaro had calculated the demographic growth of the town was based on the previous three centuries, a provision that eventually would not conform to reality.

The next large urban change in Bilbao would come in 1876, when the capital annexed (in several stages) the neighbouring municipality of Abando. The new &quot;ensanche&quot; project was planned by a team made of architect Severino de Achúcarro and engineers Pablo de Alzola (elected Mayor that same year), and Ernesto de Hoffmeyer. Unlike Lázaro&#x27;s, this project was significantly smaller, compassing against the original . It also featured a not so strict grid pattern, a park to separate the industrial and residential areas and the Gran Vía de Don Diego López de Haro, the main thoroughfare, where many relevant buildings were located, such as the Biscay provincial government hall or the BBVA Tower. By the end of the 1890s, this widening was half completed and already filled, so a new extension was planned by Federico Ugalde.

By 1925, the municipalities of Deusto and Begoña, as well as part of Erandio were annexed, and in 1940, the remaining part of Erandio became part of Bilbao. The last annexation took place in 1966, with the municipalities of Loiu, Sondika, Derio, and Zamudio. This made Bilbao larger than ever, with . However, all these municipalities, with the exception of Deusto and Begoña regained their independence on 1 January 1983.

On 18 May 2010, the government of Singapore awarded Bilbao the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, at the World Cities Summit 2010. It is considered the Pritzker of urbanism.

=== Architecture ===

Bilbao&#x27;s buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from gothic, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and contemporary architecture. The Old Town features many of the oldest buildings in the city, as the St. James&#x27; Cathedral or the Church of San Antón, included in the borough&#x27;s coat of arms. Most of the Old Town is a pedestrian zone during the day. Nearby is one of the most important religious temples of Biscay, the Basilica of Begoña, dedicated to the patron saint of the province, Our Lady of Begoña.

Seventeen bridges span the banks of the estuary inside the town&#x27;s boundaries. Among the most interesting ones are the Zubizuri (Basque for &quot;white bridge&quot;), a pedestrian footbridge designed by Santiago Calatrava opened in 1997, and the Princes of Spain Bridge, also known as &quot;La Salve&quot;, a suspension bridge opened in 1972 and redesigned by French conceptual artist Daniel Buren in 2007. The Deusto Bridge is a bascule bridge opened in 1936 and modelled after the Michigan Avenue Bridge, in Chicago. Between 1890 and 1893 the first transporter bridge (&quot;Puente Colgante&quot;) in the world on the Nervion river, between Portugalete and Getxo, was built by Alberto Palacio (architect and engineer) together with his brother Silvestre.

Since the deindustrialization process started in the 1990s, many of the former industrial areas are being transformed into modern public and private spaces designed by several of the world&#x27;s most renowned architects and artists. The main example is the Guggenheim Museum, located in what was an old dock and wood warehouse. The building, designed by Frank Gehry and inaugurated in October 1997, is considered among architecture experts as one of the most important structures of the last 30 years, and a masterpiece by itself. The museum houses part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation modern art collection. Another example is the Azkuna Zentroa, a wine warehouse built in 1909 and completely redesigned in 2010 by French designer Philippe Starck into a multi-purpose venue that consists of a cinema multiplex, a fitness centre, a library, and a restaurant, among other spaces. The Abandoibarra area is also being renovated, and it features not only the Guggenheim Museum, but also Arata Isozaki&#x27;s tower complex, the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall and the Iberdrola Tower, designed by Argentine architect César Pelli which is, since its completion in 2011, the Basque Country&#x27;s tallest skyscraper, high. Zorrozaurre is the next area to be redeveloped, following a 2007 master plan designed by Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. This peninsula was transformed into a island and will feature residential and commercial buildings, as well as the new BBK seat.
=== Parks and gardens ===

, Bilbao has 18 public parks inside its limits, totalling of green spaces. Furthermore its green belt has a total area of , of which are urbanized. The largest parks are Mount Cobetas, of , and Larreagaburu, of , both located on the outskirts.

The Doña Casilda Iturrizar Park is located in the district of Abando, near the town centre and covers an area of . It is named after a local benefactress who donated the grounds to the borough. It is an English-style garden designed by Ricardo Bastida and opened to the public in 1907. It features a dancing water fountain surrounded by a pergola, and a pond with many species of ducks, geese and swans, which gives the park the alternate name of &quot;Ducks&#x27; Park&quot;, as known locally. In recent years, it was expanded to be connected with the Abandoibarra area. In Ibaiondo, the Etxeberria Park was built in the 1980s in the place where a steel mill previously stood. The original chimney was maintained as a homage of its industrial past. It covers an area of , on a sloped terrain that overlooks the Old Town. Other relevant public spaces inside the city include the Europa Park, the Miribilla Park, or the Memorial Walkway, a long walkway, with high lamps, located in the left bank of the estuary and that connects the main sights.

Mount Artxanda is easily accessible from the town centre by a funicular. There is a recreational area at the summit, with restaurants, a sports complex and a balcony with panoramic views. In the south, Mount Pagasarri receives hundreds of hikers every weekend since the 1870s, who seek its natural wonders. Its environment is officially protected since 2007.

== Culture ==
Bilbao was appointed a &quot;City of Design&quot; by UNESCO in 2014 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.

=== Theatres ===

The main hall of the city is the Arriaga Theatre, reopened in 1985 as a municipal venue with a varied repertoire that includes dancing, opera, live music and theatre. Also very active are the Campos Elíseos Theatre and the Euskalduna Concert Hall. Other important venues include La Fundición, dedicated to contemporary dances and theatre; the Pabellón 6, the Sala BBK and the Azkuna Zentroa.

=== Museums ===

Bilbao has more than a dozen museums covering a range of fields including art, science, and sport, which have played a central role in Bilbao being named one of the most creative cities in the world.

The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, was inaugurated on 19 October 1997 and is work of the Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection is centred in the visual arts of the second half of the 20th century and the present, with relevant artworks from Richard Serra and Jeff Koons, although including as well temporary exhibitions with a more varied nature, like Russian art or engravings from Albrecht Dürer.

Another important museum is the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, first established in 1908 and housing a notable collection of Spanish and European work from the 12th century to present times. The collection from before the 20th century is centred mainly around Spanish and Flemish artists such as El Greco, Francisco de Zurbarán, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, Francisco Goya and Anthony van Dyck. The museum also holds one of the best collections of Basque art, with works from the 19th century to present times. It has an eye-catching collection of Avant-garde art, from the Post-Impressionism of Paul Gauguin to Pop art and the expressionism of Francis Bacon.

The Basque Museum showcases Basque archaeology and ethnography, and holds frequent exhibitions in the area of Basque history. The museum building itself is part of the heritage listing &quot;Conjunto histórico&quot;. The city also has several specialised museums, like the Maritime Museum Estuary of Bilbao (&quot;Bilboko Itsasadarra Itsas Museoa&quot;), located next to the Estuary of Bilbao, which holds ships and other collection related to the region&#x27;s fishing and shipbuilding culture, being particularly relevant the &quot;Carola&quot; crane, last remaining element of the Euskalduna shipyard that existed where the museum now stands.

Other relevant museums are the Biscayan Archeological Museum (&quot;Arkeologi Museoa&quot;) which holds important collections related to the region&#x27;s prehistory, and the Diocesan Museum of Religious Art (&quot;Eleiz Museoa&quot;), both located in the Casco Viejo quarter.

=== Music ===

The Euskalduna Concert Hall is home to frequent musical performances and it is home of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra (&quot;Bilbao Orkestra Sinfonikoa&quot;) and the opera season programmed by the ABAO (Bilbao Association of Friends of the Opera). The Arriaga Theatre is frequently the host of numerous musical events, other notable stages include the Philharmonic Society of Bilbao (chamber music) and Bilborock (pop and rock music). The city hosts many different musical festivities, often funded by the city hall. Due to its scope, it is especially relevant the Bilbao BBK Live festival, which has been celebrated every year since 2006 and focuses on Basque, Spanish and international pop and rock music. Since the opening of the new San Mamés Stadium in 2013, it has been often used as an open-air concert venue, the first ever concert being one from the American band Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2017. Other relevant music festivals include the &quot;Bilbao Distrito Jazz&quot; and the &quot;Bilbao Ars Sacrum&quot;, the latter dedicated to religious music.

Bilbao is the birthplace of famous composer Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga, who lived his formative years in the city before moving to Paris at age 15. Also native from Bilbao were the soprano singer Josefa Cruz de Gassier and Natividad Álvarez, nicknamed &quot;Nati, la bilbainita&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Nati, the little one from Bilbao&quot;) a dancer and castanets player who achieved national fame in the early 20th century. Also relevant is the Bilbao Choir Society (&quot;Bilboko Koral Elkartea&quot;), established in 1866. Important musical bands coming from the city include rock band &quot;Fito &amp; Fitipaldis&quot;, Basque folk band &quot;Oskorri&quot; and folk-pop band &quot;Mocedades&quot;.

Bilbao hosted the 2018 MTV Europe Music Awards.

=== Festivals and events ===

Bilbao hosts several regular festivals and events. The most relevant is the Big Week of the city (&quot;Aste Nagusia&quot;), celebrated annually since 1978 and lasting nine days. It is the city&#x27;s main festival, attracting over 1,500,000 people every year. The festivities begin on the first Saturday before 22 August, and during those nine days the city hall organises a series of cultural events of diverse kind, including concerts, stage plays, Basque rural sports and bullfighting, as well as nightly firework displays. The festivities begin with the &quot;chupinazo&quot; or &quot;txupinazo&quot;, which is the launch of a small rocket, and the reading of a proclamation by the festivities&#x27; herald. The central point of the festivities is the place around the &quot;txosnas&quot;, where the different &quot;konpartsak&quot; are reunited, organised by neighbourhood associations as well as cultural, social and political groups. The symbol of the festivities is &quot;Marijaia&quot;, a large doll which is burned during the last day of celebrations.

Beyond the main festivities of the &quot;Aste Nagusia&quot;, the city also celebrates some minor festivities, many of them religious in nature, such as Saint Agatha on 5 February, the celebrations of Our Lady of Begoña on 11 October, the Day of Thomas the Apostle on 21 December and the Christmas festivities, centred around the figure of Olentzero. There are also festivities in the different neighbourhoods and districts which are celebrated locally, such as the &quot;Fiestas del Carmen&quot; in Santutxu and Indautxu, &quot;Fiestas Santiago&quot; in Bilbao la Vieja, &quot;Fiestas San Ignacio&quot; in San Inazio and &quot;Fiestas San Roque&quot; in Arxtanda and Larraskitu.

The city also hosts the International Festival of Documentary and Short Film under the commercial name of Zinebi. It was first held in 1959 under the name International Festival of Ibero-American and Filipino Documentary Film of Bilbao, with the goal of being complementary to the San Sebastián International Film Festival. Since 1981 it is organised by the city hall and takes place in the Arriaga Theatre. Bilbao is also the host of the SAIL in Festival, a yearly event centred exclusively around sailing, which brings together international representatives of this sport.

=== Cuisine ===
Traditional Bilbao dishes are centred around products from the sea and the estuary, such as eels and cod. For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of Biscay, including dishes such as &quot;bacalao al pil pil&quot; (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), &quot;bacalao a la vizcaína&quot; (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of &quot;choricero&quot; peppers and onions), &quot;merluza en salsa verde&quot; (hake fish with green sauce), &quot;chipirones en su tinta&quot; (squid served with its own ink), &quot;morros a la vizcaína&quot; (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), &quot;revuelto de perretxikos&quot; (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as &quot;canutillos de Bilbao&quot; (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), &quot;Pantxineta&quot; (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), rice cakes and &quot;bollos de mantequilla&quot; (butter buns).

Bilbao, as other Basque cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the &quot;pintxos&quot;, which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include &quot;rabas&quot; (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), Spanish omelette (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), &quot;&quot; (stuffed mushrooms), &quot;triángulos&quot; (Bilbao-style sandwiches), &quot;gildas&quot; (one or more olives, a &quot;guindilla&quot; pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).

As for beverages, typical from the region is the &quot;txakoli&quot;, a white wine usually drunk as an apéritif. Biscayan &quot;txakoli&quot; (&quot;Bizkaiko Txakolina&quot;) is a protected for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are cider, &quot;patxaran&quot; (sloe-flavoured liqueur) and &quot;Rioja&quot; wine.

There are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the Casco Viejo quarter. &quot;Txokos&quot; are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.

=== Language ===

The Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the Basque language, which is local to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as Bermeo or Lekeitio. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total. However, the number of Basque speakers has experienced a continuous increase since, reaching a figure of 37% in 2001. More than half of the Basque speakers were younger than 30 and lived in the districts of Deusto, Begoña and Abando.

According to the data from the 2016 census, the population older than 2 years old registered in the municipality of Bilbao who speaks Basque fluently represents 29% of the total population, while those who can speak it with difficulty represent around 19.95% of the total. Finally, those who cannot speak or understand the language represent the remaining 51.06% of the census.

==Transport==
=== Roads and highways ===

Bilbao is a relevant transport hub for northern Spain. Bilbao is connected to three major motorways and a series of minor roads of national and provincial level. The city lies on two international roads, the European route E70 that follows the coast of the Bay of Biscay and the cities of Santander and Gijón to the west and with Eibar, San Sebastián and Bordeaux to the east. The European route E80 connects the city with inner Spain to the south, including Burgos and Salamanca and continuing to Lisbon, and Toulouse to the north. The AP-68 motorway (European road E-804) starts in the city, joining with Vitoria-Gasteiz, Logroño and ending in Zaragoza.

The city is connected with the regions of Cantabria, Asturias and Galicia via the A-8 motorway and with Durango, Eibar, San Sebastián and the French border via the AP-8 motorway, which is a toll road. The AP-68 toll motorway to the south is the main road connecting Bilbao with southern Spain and the Mediterranean coast, connecting in Miranda de Ebro with the A-1 to Madrid and in Zaragoza with the AP-2 to Barcelona.

Minor roads passing through Bilbao or starting in the city itself include the national road N-634 which connects San Sebastián with Santiago de Compostela and runs parallel to the A-8 and AP-8 motorways. The regional road BI-631 connects Bilbao with Bermeo, while the BI-626 joins the city with Balmaseda. The city is circled by the BI-625 and N-637 roads, which form a half-ring to the east, and the N-634 and A-8 to the west.

The city&#x27;s main arteries the Gran Vía de Don Diego López de Haro, which crosses the financial and business district of Abando and connecting it with the Casco Viejo to the east and the San Mamés area to the west. The Sabino Arana Avenue and Juan Antonio Zunzunegui Avenue provide a direct route between the central districts and the motorways while Autonomía Street joins the southern districts on an east-west direction. The city has 14 bridges connecting opposite sides of the Estuary of Bilbao and the Kadagua river, including the La Salve and Euskalduna bridges, as well a series of tunnels under the Mount Artxanda.

=== Airports ===

Bilbao is served by the Bilbao Airport (BIO), the busiest terminal in the Basque Country and in the entire Northern coast, with more than 5.4 million passengers in 2018. It is located north of the borough, between the municipalities of Loiu and Sondika. 20 airlines operate in the terminal, including Iberia, Lufthansa, and TAP Portugal. Top destinations include London, Frankfurt, Munich, Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. It opened to the public in September 1948, with a regular flight to Madrid. On 19 November 2000, a new terminal building was opened, designed by Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava. In February 2009, a project was approved to expand the current building to double its capacity. Although originally expected to be completed by 2014, the financial crisis and the decrease of passenger traffic delayed it to at least 2019. No work has begun as of 2018.

Some low-cost airlines, such as Ryanair, also use the Vitoria Airport (VIT) located in Foronda located 59 km (37 mi) south of the city.

=== Railways ===

Long-distance rail lines connect Bilbao with Madrid, Barcelona and other destinations in northern Spain. The city has four railway stations: the Bilbao-Abando and Bilbao-Concordia railway stations are owned by Adif and operated by the Spanish railways Renfe, whereas the Bilbao-Atxuri and Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo stations are owned by the Basque railway network ETS and operated by Euskotren, serving short-distance local destinations.

The Bilbao-Abando station is the main railway station of the city, with Renfe running Iberian-gauge long-distance Alvia trains to Madrid and Barcelona, as well as Intercity services to Vigo with connections possible to A Coruña and Hendaye. During the summer there are special trains to Málaga. The city will be connected to the Basque Y high-speed train network around 2023, allowing for high speed AVE trains to operate between the Basque capitals and also to Madrid and other Spanish cities in the future. The arrival of the new high speed services will involve the creation of a completely new underground station that will replace the current infrastructure. The construction is expected to begin in 2020.

Bilbao-Concordia station is located in close vicinity to Bilbao-Abando, and hosts the narrow-gauge railway services ran by Renfe under the Renfe Feve brand. Renfe runs frequent regional trains to the cities of Santander and León. Euskotren Trena runs regular services to Bermeo from the Bilbao-Atxuri station, while in the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station there are regional services to Durango, Eibar and San Sebastián.

=== Public transport ===

Public transport by rail and bus is organised by the &quot;Bizkaiko Garraio Partzuergoa&quot; (Consortium of the Biscayan Transport). The consortium manages the Barik card, a form of electronic ticket valid across almost all public transport systems of the Bilbao metropolitan area and Biscay province, as well as some other selected services in other provinces of the Basque autonomous community.

The mass transit rail system is divided into different networks managed by separate operators. Bilbao metro, established in 1995, operates two underground lines with some overground sections (Line 1 and Line 2). These two lines connect the metropolitan area following the estuary on both sides, starting in Etxebarri in the south all the way to Plentzia and Santurtzi by the coast. Line 1 was built following largely the same route as the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which was still active by the time the Metro system opened in 1995 and since has been replaced by it. The metro system stations were designed by Norman Foster. Line 3 of metro is operated by Euskotren Trena, which also operates the regional services to Durango and Eibar as well as a commuter rail line that connects the centre of Bilbao with Lezama and the Txorierri valley. This third line of metro was inaugurated on 8 April 2017 and is expected to be extended to the airport in the near future. Projects for a fourth and fifth line exist and are currently being studied.

Euskotren also operates a tramway line under the brand Euskotren Tranbia. The line follows the estuary of Bilbao across the central districts of the city, starting in the Bilbao-Atxuri Station and connecting important areas like the Guggenheim museum and the San Mamés football stadium. The original tram network started operations in 1876 and gradually expanded across the city to finally shut down in the 1960s due to being largely replaced by urban buses. The new tram system was opened on 18 December 2002, almost forty years after the closing of the original system.

Renfe operates four commuter-rail lines in a system separate from the metro. Three of them operate under the Cercanías brand and are collectively known as &quot;Cercanías Bilbao&quot;, while a fourth line is operated by Renfe Feve. The three lines operated under the Cercanías name operate largely overground and travel larger distances than the metro system, reaching municipalities outside of the metropolitan area such as Muskiz or even outside of the Biscay province, like Amurrio. The three lines all start in the Bilbao-Abando railway station, whereas the line operated by Renfe Feve starts in the Bilbao-Concordia station.

The gaps in the railway service are covered by an extensive bus network. The urban bus system is operated under the brand Bilbobus and has 28 regular bus lines, 8 microbus lines and 8 night buses collectively known as &quot;Gautxori&quot; (night owl). The Bilbaobus network is limited to the city limits, and only a few lines extend beyond it. The BizkaiBus network fills this gap, with more than 100 lines, connecting the city with all other municipalities in the metropolitan area, as well as with most towns in Biscay and some in Álava.

A Brittany Ferries ferry service links Santurtzi, near Bilbao, to Portsmouth (UK). MV Cap Finistère ferry departs from the port of Bilbao, north west of the town centre. A service operated by Acciona Trasmediterranea served the same route from 16 May 2006 until April 2007. P&amp;O Ferries operated this route until its withdrawal on 28 September 2010 with a ship called the Pride of Bilbao.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bilbao, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 minutes. Three percent of public transit passengers ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 7 minutes, while 4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 10% travel more than in a single direction.
== Infrastructure ==

=== Healthcare ===

The public healthcare system is served and managed by the Basque healthcare system (&quot;Osakidetza&quot;), which has a network of medical centres established across the city. The most relevant hospital of the city is the Basurto Hospital, located in the Basurto-Zorroza district. It was opened in 1908 after ten years of construction, and it was built due to the fast increase of population in the late 19th century. Its design was based on the Eppendorf Hospital of Hamburg, in (Germany), one of the most modern at the time. In 2008 the hospital was named the best hospital in customer support in Spain.

However, the two largest hospitals that provide healthcare services to the inhabitants of the city are located outside of the city limits: the University Hospital of Gurutzeta/Cruces in neighbouring Barakaldo and the Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital in Galdakao. Other minor public hospitals located in the city include the Santa Marina Hospital and the Hospital of Urduliz, located in the metropolitan area.

=== Utilities ===

The headquarters of &quot;Iberdrola&quot;, a multinational electric utility company are located in Bilbao. The company was created in 1992 after the merging of &quot;Iberduero&quot; and &quot;Hidroeléctrica Española&quot; and it is in charge of production and distribution of electricity. There are two thermal power stations located in the city&#x27;s surroundings, one in Santurtzi and the other in Zierbena. The electricity produced in both these stations is then transferred to the electrical substation of Güeñes by the company &quot;Red Eléctrica de España&quot;, which is the company responsible of moving electricity from the production stations to the final consumers. There is a combined cycle power station in the municipality of Amorebieta called &quot;Bizkaia Energia&quot;, whose energy is transferred to the substation of Gatika.

The supply of all oil-based fuels distributed in the whole metropolitan area (gasoline, diesel fuel and butane) are produced in the oil refinery owned by &quot;Petronor&quot; in the municipalities of Muskiz and Abanto Zierbena. &quot;Petronor&quot; is a large oil company founded in Bilbao in 1968 and it currently comprises two partners, Repsol (85.98%) and Kutxabank (14.02%).

Supply of drinking water is managed by the &quot;Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia&quot; (Bilbao Bizkaia Water Consortium), a public entity with the responsibility of managing the water infrastructure and distribution to many Biscayan municipalities, Bilbao and its metropolitan area included. The supply of drinking water for the city comes from the Uribarri-Ganboa and Urrunaga reservoirs, which are fed by the river Zadorra.
==Education==

The Basque Country has a bilingual education system, with students able to choose between four linguistic models: A, B, D, and X, which differ in the prevalence of Basque or Spanish as the spoken and written language used in classes. In Bilbao, there is a prevalence of model D (where Basque is the vehicle language and Spanish is taught as a subject) in Primary School, while Compulsory Secondary Education students favour model B (where some subjects are in Basque and other in Spanish). Finally, 67% of Baccalaureate students choose model A (in which Spanish is the vehicle language and Basque is a subject). English is the most widespread foreign language taught, being the option for 97% of pre-university students.

=== Higher education ===
Two universities are seated in Bilbao. The older is the University of Deusto, founded by the Society of Jesus in 1886. It took its name from the then independent municipality of Deusto, annexed to Bilbao in 1925. It was the only higher education institute in the borough until the establishment in 1968 of the University of Bilbao, later to become the University of the Basque Country in 1980. This public university, which has a presence in the three provinces of the autonomous community, has its main Biscayan campus in the municipality of Leioa, although the Technical and Business faculties are based in Bilbao. Since 2014, Mondragon University has also a presence in the city through the innovation and entrepreneurial centre Bilbao Innovation Factory. In 2015, the offer of higher education in the city was expanded with the foundation of Dantzerti, the Higher School of Dramatic Arts and Dance of the Basque Country.

== Sport ==
As in the rest of Spain, football is the most popular competitive sport, followed by basketball. Some people are interested in basque sports, one of the oldest sports in Spain. One could enjoy a Basque pelota match in Bizkaia Frontoia, Bilbao. In addition, Bilbao offers many outdoor activities owing to its location by the sea amid the hilly countryside. Hiking and rock climbing in the nearby mountains are very popular. Watersports, especially surfing, are practised on the beaches of nearby Sopelana and Mundaka.

=== Clubs ===
;Football
The main football club is Athletic Club, commonly known as Athletic Bilbao in English. It plays at the new San Mamés stadium, which opened in 2013 and seats 53,332 spectators.
Athletic Bilbao was one of the founding members of the Spanish football league, La Liga, and has played in the Primera División (First Division) ever since – winning it on eight occasions. Its red and white striped flag can be seen throughout the city. Athletic is noted for its &quot;Basque policy&quot;, in place since 1911, with only players born in or having a clear connection to the Basque region being allowed to represent the club.

;Basketball
The main basketball club is Bilbao Basket, which plays in the Spanish top division Liga ACB and their home venue is the Bilbao Arena. The main achievements of the clubs were being the runner-up of the Liga ACB during the 2010–2011 season, losing the final series 3–0 against FC Barcelona Bàsquet; as well as the runner-up of the EuroCup Basketball in the 2012–2013 edition, where they lost to the Russian team Lokomotiv Kuban.

<text>The 2000 Guineas Stakes is a Group 1 flat race in Great Britain open to three-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km) and scheduled to take place each year at the start of May.

|}
























It is one of Britain&#x27;s five Classic races, and at present it is the first to be run in the year. It also serves as the opening leg of the Triple Crown, followed by the Derby and the St Leger, although the feat of winning all three has been rarely attempted in recent decades.

==History==
The 2000 Guineas Stakes was first run on 18 April 1809, and it preceded the introduction of a version for fillies only, the 1000 Guineas Stakes, by five years. Both races were established by the Jockey Club under the direction of Sir Charles Bunbury, who had earlier co-founded the Derby at Epsom. The races were named according to their original prize funds (a guinea amounted to 21 shillings, so the original prize was £2,100).

By the mid-1860s, the 2000 Guineas was regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s most prestigious races for three-year-olds. The five leading events for this age group, characterised by increasing distances as the season progressed, began to be known as &quot;Classics&quot;. The concept was later adopted in many other countries.

European variations of the 2000 Guineas include the Irish 2,000 Guineas, the Mehl-Mülhens-Rennen, the Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains and the Premio Parioli. Elsewhere, variations include the Australian Guineas and the Satsuki Shō.

The 2000 Guineas is served by trial races such as the Craven Stakes and the Greenham Stakes, but for some horses it is the first race of the season. The 2000 Guineas itself can act as a trial for the Derby, and the last horse to win both was Camelot in 2012. The most recent 2000 Guineas participant to win the Derby was City Of Troy, placed ninth in 2024.

Since 2001, the 2000 Guineas and the 1000 Guineas Stakes have offered equal prize money. Each had a purse of £523,750 in 2019.

<text>The St Leger Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 115 yards (2,921 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

Established in 1776, the St Leger is the oldest of Britain&#x27;s five Classics. It is the last of the five to be run each year, and its distance is longer than any of the other four.

The St Leger is the final leg of the English Triple Crown, which begins with the 2000 Guineas and continues with the Derby. It also completes the Fillies&#x27; Triple Crown, following on from the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks. The St Leger has rarely featured Triple Crown contenders in recent decades, with the only one in recent years being the 2012 2,000 Guineas and Derby winner Camelot, who finished second in the St Leger.

==History==

===Early years===
The event was devised by Anthony St Leger, an army officer and politician who lived near Doncaster. It was initially referred to as &quot;A Sweepstake of 25 Guineas&quot;, and its original distance was two miles. The rules stipulated that colts and geldings were to carry 8 st, and fillies would receive an allowance of 2 lb.

The inaugural running was held at Cantley Common on 24 September 1776. The first winner was an unnamed filly owned by the event&#x27;s organiser, the 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. The filly was later named Allabaculia.

The title St Leger Stakes was decided at a dinner party held in 1778 at the Red Lion Inn located in the Market Place, Doncaster, to discuss the coming year&#x27;s race. It was suggested that it should be called the Rockingham Stakes in honour of the host, the Marquess of Rockingham, but the Marquess proposed that it should be named instead after Anthony St Leger. That year the event was moved to its present location, Town Moor, in 1778.

The race came to national prominence in 1800, when a horse called Champion registered the first Derby–St Leger double. Its length was cut to 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 193 yards in 1813, and despite some minor alterations has remained much the same ever since. The victory of West Australian in 1853 completed the first success in the Triple Crown.

===Post-1900===
The St Leger Stakes was closed to geldings in 1906. It was transferred to Newmarket during World War I, and the substitute event was called the September Stakes. It was cancelled in 1939 because of the outbreak of World War II, and the following year&#x27;s edition was held at Thirsk in November. For the remainder of this period it was staged at Manchester (1941), Newmarket (1942–44) and York (1945).

The race was switched to Ayr in 1989 after the scheduled running at Doncaster was abandoned due to subsidence. The 2006 race took place at York because its regular venue was closed for redevelopment.

The St Leger Stakes has inspired a number of similar events around the world, although many are no longer restricted to three-year-olds. European variations include the Irish St. Leger, the Prix Royal-Oak, the Deutsches St. Leger and the St. Leger Italiano. Other national equivalents include the Kikuka-shō, the New Zealand St. Leger and the VRC St Leger.

==In popular culture==
As the last of the classics, the race marks the end of summer in England. The popular adage &quot;sell in May and go away, come back on St Leger Day&quot; suggests investors should sell their shares in May and buy again after the race.

The Agatha Christie novel &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; has the St Leger as a plot point near the end of the novel.

<doc id="68035" wikidata="Q125357130" url="?curid=68035" title="Female impersonation">
<text>Female impersonation is a type of theatrical performance where a man dresses in women&#x27;s clothing for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience. While the term female impersonator is sometimes used interchangeably with drag queen, they are not the same. Drag as an art form is associated with queer identity whereas female impersonation may come from a wide a range of gender identity paradigms, including heteronormativity. Additionally, many drag artists view drag as a lived form of self-expression or creativity, and perceive drag as something that is not limited to the stage or to performance. In contrast, female impersonation is specifically limited to performance and may or may not involve an LGBTQI point of view.

== History of female impersonation==

=== Ancient Greece ===
The concept of drag can be seen in the earliest forms of entertainment, including Ancient Greek theatre. In ancient western cultures, women often were not allowed to perform onstage or become actors, therefore male actors played the roles of women also. This demonstrates how female impersonation can be traced back to the earliest forms of entertainment and spectacle. Not only this, but men and boys were expected to dress as women, or in drag, for many religious ceremonies and rituals in Ancient Greece.

There is some controversy as to whether this is actually where drag emerged, or if it occurred later in history, in the 19th century with forms of entertainment such as minstrel shows and Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, as he often incorporated male actors as female impersonators.

===United States===
==== Minstrel shows ====

The evolution of female impersonation and drag in the United States was influenced by minstrel shows. The term female impersonator was in wide use during the 19th century in theater in the United States to refer to a specific type of performer in minstrel shows and later vaudeville known as &quot;wench&quot; and &quot;dame&quot; roles. These roles were performed by both cisgender heterosexual men, and by queer men who were closeted and in some rare cases openly non-heterosexual. The actor Thomas L. Moxley was a celebrated blackface female impersonator who performed under the name Master Floyd in George Kunkel&#x27;s Nightingales; a leading minstrel show of the 1850s and 1860s. 

These shows were an example of how Blackface was used in a racist form of entertainment where the performers would mock African American men, but as time went on they found it amusing to mock African American women as well. They performed in comedic skits, dances, and &quot;wench&quot; songs. Black people themselves were largely excluded from being performers as at this point in history. Blackface in minstrel shows emerged in , but became more established with the creation of the character of Jim Crow, which was first performed in 1828. After the Civil War, performance troupes began to be composed of Black performers. The shows maintained popularity in American entertainment into the 1920s.

In the 19th century and early 20th century minstrel show female impersonators did not attempt to present the illusion of femininity, but rather lampooned cisgender women through a comic representation of women that did not attempt to completely remove the actor&#x27;s masculine physical traits. Minstrel show female impersonators often employed sexist and racist stereotypes within bawdy humor to make fun of women, often in black women, in blackface. This type of humor continued on the vaudeville and burlesque stage.

In the twentieth century some cross-gender impersonators, both female and male, in the United States became highly successful performing artists in nightclubs and theaters. There was a concerted effort by these working female impersonators in America, to separate the art of female impersonation from queer identity with an overt representation of working female impersonators as heterosexual. Some of the performers were in fact cisgender men, but others were closeted due to the politics and social environment of the period. It was criminal in many American cities to be homosexual, or for LGBTQ people to congregate, and it was therefore necessary for female impersonators to distance themselves from identifying as queer in order to avoid criminal charges. The need to hide queer identity was prevalent among female impersonators working in non-LGBTQ nightclubs before heteronormative audiences from the early 1900s to as late as the 1970s.

==== Vaudeville and female impersonators ====

The broad comedic stylings of the minstrel shows helped develop the vaudeville shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s. In addition to the &quot;wench players&quot;, minstrel shows developed the role of &quot;prima donnas&quot;, who appeared more elegant and refined while still retaining their comedic elements. While the &quot;wenches&quot; were purely American creations, the &quot;prima donnas&quot; were inspired by both American and European cross-dressing shows, like Shakespearean actors and castrati. With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, Great Migration of African Americans, and an influx of immigrants, vaudeville&#x27;s broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy. Near the end of the 19th century a new type of female impersonation, the female illusionist, began to appear in vaudeville. This type of performer did not use humor to denigrate women, but rather attempted to celebrate women by presenting a realistic looking woman in tasteful fashions of the period.

With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well. Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna. They were known to perform song and dance routines with multiple outfit changes. George W. Munroe, who was known for portraying gossipy old Irish women, started in vaudeville in the late 19th century, and became a Broadway star; portraying the title role in the musical &quot;The Doings of Mrs. Dooley&quot; at the Grand Opera House in 1902. Other vaudeville female impersonators included Gilbert Sarony as his female character Giddy Gusher, Neil Burgess as the Widow Bedotte, and the Russell Brothers who portrayed Irish maids.

In New York City, famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge found success, and he eventually made his way to the Broadway stage performing as a woman. He published a magazine, &quot;Magazine and Beauty Hints&quot; (1913), which provided beauty and fashion tips, and he posed for corset and cosmetics advertisements. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Bothwell Browne was the top female impersonator of the West Coast. He performed at the Grand Opera House and Central Theater, among other venues, went on tour with United Vaudeville, and later appeared in the film Yankee Doodle in Berlin (1919), produced by Mack Sennett.

At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished. However, African-American comedian Andrew Tribble found success as a female impersonator on Broadway and in Black Vaudeville. Connection with sex work and homosexuality eventually led to the decline of female impersonation during the Progressive Era. Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.

<text>Institute for Supply Management (ISM) is the world&#x27;s oldest and largest supply management association. Founded in 1915, the U.S.-based not-for-profit educational association serves professionals and organizations with interest in supply management, providing education, training, qualifications, publications, information, and research.

ISM serves a community of over 50,000 firms in more than 100 countries. It offers three qualifications, the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM), Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD), and the Associate Professional in Supply Management (APSM), in partnership with CAPS Research.

==History==
Institute for Supply Management originated in 1915 as the &quot;National Association of Purchasing Agents&quot; (NAPA).

In the early twentieth century, the purchasing function typically did not enjoy the full support of management, which was typically indifferent to its potential. Prior to 1915, local purchasing associations had formed in at least 10 major cities in the U.S., including in Buffalo (one of the most active groups, founded in 1904). Some purchasing officials decided to form a national group to advance their profession and share useful information among members, but support was spotty. Organizers had to overcome distrust over concerns that their participation would reveal trade secrets. As Charles A. Steele, president of NAPA stated in 1923:

: ...it had been a sort of unwritten rule that purchasers were one body of men who should not communicate with each other for fear that they might do the other fellow some good and themselves some harm.

Elwood B. Hendricks, a salesman working for the Thomas Publishing Company, became the driving force behind forming a national purchasing association. In 1913, Hendricks&#x27;s plan began to bear fruit when he helped form the Purchasing Agents Association of New York that became the nucleus of the national organization. The New York group applied for and received a charter for NAPA in 1915. The first local groups to affiliate association were New York City and Pittsburgh in 1915 and Columbus in 1916. South Bend, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles followed in 1917. Buffalo affiliated with NAPA in 1918. By 1920 over 30 affiliates had joined and that number continued to grow. The group gave Hendricks an honorary lifetime membership.

The goals of NAPA were to:
* Impress the business world with the importance of the purchasing function to economic well-being.
* Encourage purchasing people to improve themselves and make greater contributions to the companies they serve.

NAPA held its first convention in New York in 1916 with 100 of its 250 members in attendance. That year NAPA launched a magazine, &quot;The Purchasing Agent&quot;, that was to have an immense impact on the success of the organization and eventually evolve into &quot;Inside Supply Management&quot; magazine. In 1918, approximately one thousand members were expected to attend that year&#x27;s national convention.

===World War I and the 1920s===
With the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, NAPA offered its services to the war effort. Materials were in short supply and procurement had become more complicated as the U.S. government &quot;attempted to guide economic activity via centralized price and production controls&quot;. During this period NAPA members helped establish purchasing courses at New York University and Harvard. The association began developing professional standards including a code of ethics for the purchasing profession.

During World War I, NAPA called for the centralization of War Department purchasing to reduce inefficiency and graft. The association advocated standardization in the purchase and use of coal and the prosecution of profiteers. Its crusade for ethical standards resulted in the &quot;Purchasing Agent’s Creed&quot; that observers hailed for decades as one of the outstanding moral statements in modern business. In 1928, it released the &quot;Standards for Buying and Selling&quot; with the recognition that buying and selling should be mutually profitable and that cooperation would reduce the cost of purchasing.

===Great Depression and World War II===
Harvard Business School published two purchasing textbooks and it developed case studies about purchasing problems, all under the auspices of NAPA. The association commissioned a two-volume work on purchasing practices and procedures.

In 1931, the association established the J. Shipman Gold Medal Award, the highest honor in the field, bestowed on an individual for exceptional performance in supply management.

NAPA created its Business Survey Panel in 1931 and began polling members on commodities. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce began using these reports when compiling information for the federal government. These reports eventually evolved into the association&#x27;s market-moving report now known as the ISM Report On Business.

When World War II broke out, NAPA kept its members updated on government requirements and regulations concerning wartime production. As the government placed controls on producers and consumers, many of NAPA’s members played a critical role.

===N.A.P.A rebranded as NAPM===

By the 1950s, memberships reached 15,000. In the U.S., purchasing had transformed into a vital management function. In 1968, NAPA renamed itself the National Association of Purchasing Management, Inc. (NAPM).

In 1974, NAPM introduced the Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M) qualification, the first professional certification in the field.

In 1976 NAPM conducted its first ever onsite plant training. NAPM was became involved in minority and women&#x27;s initiatives and elected May Warzocha as its first woman president in 1979. In 1987, it formed the Minority Business Development Group to assist members with their minority supplier programs.

The Report On Business continued to gain recognition as a reliable near-term economic barometer. In 1982, NAPM introduced the Purchasing Manager&#x27;s Index (PMI) and in 1988 it added diffusion indexes and introduced a graph format. In 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce began including NAPM&#x27;s data as a component of its Index of Leading Indicators and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve praised the Report. In 1998, the association developed the Non-Manufacturing Report On Business.

===Transformation to ISM===
Over time purchasing professionals were becoming more responsible for the larger function of supply of goods and services instead of strictly purchasing. To more accurately reflect this expanded scope, NAPM members voted in April 2001 to change the organization&#x27;s name to Institute for Supply Management (ISM).

In 2002, ISM launched its sustainability and social responsibility initiative and in 2004 issued its ISM Principles of Social Responsibility, a first for the supply management profession.

In 2005, ISM partnered with the R. Gene and Nancy D. Richter Foundation to expand the R. Gene Richter Scholarship Program into the largest national scholarship program in the field of supply management. Together, in 2008, they established the ISM R. Gene Richter Scholarship Program Fund with a goal of funding scholarships on an ongoing basis.

In 2008, ISM introduced a new professional qualification the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) to replace the C.P.M.

In 2011, ISM introduced the Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD) certification to create experts who could help guide their companies through supplier diversity issues, harness underutilized, innovative suppliers and tap new markets. That same year, ISM began its Corporate Program to help the employees of corporate members perform at a higher level.

In 2023, ISM introduced the Associate Professional in Supply Management (APSM) certification to create a pathway for students to achieve the CPSM earlier in their careers.

ISM introduced the ISM Mastery Model in 2015. Later renamed to ISM Capability Model, it covers 16 core competencies and 73 sub-competencies. The model and its assessment tool identify employee skills gaps and solutions to close them. It allows companies to benchmark team member skills and create a development roadmap and set job expectations.

==Supply Management==

ISM defines supply management as:

: ...the identification, analysis, determination, procurement and fulfillment of the goods and services an organization needs to meet short- and long-term objectives. By managing external partners&#x27; capabilities and linking them to organizational goals, supply management contributes to the strategic direction of an organization through total cost and capabilities management.

By effective oversight and engagement of people, processes and relationships, supply management creates competitive advantage through innovation, cost management, quality improvement, asset optimization, risk mitigation, social responsibility and sustainability.

Topics included as part of supply management:
* Purchasing/procurement
* Strategic sourcing
* Logistics
* Quality
* Inventory control

* Materials management
* Warehousing/stores
* Transportation/traffic/shipping
* Disposition/investment recovery
* Distribution

* Receiving
* Packaging
* Product/service development
* Manufacturing supervision
==Certification Programs==

=== Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) ===
The Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) certification addresses the changing demands of the profession and the international marketplace. According to ISM&#x27;s 2024 annual salary survey, the average salary for a CPSM holder is $160,316.

=== Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD) ===
ISM&#x27;s Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD) is the only certification for professionals whose responsibilities include supplier diversity. It is supported by various diversity organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women&#x27;s Business Enterprise National Council. According to ISM&#x27;s 2024 annual salary survey, the average salary for a CPSD holder is $227,887.

==Publications==

=== &quot;ISM Report On Business&quot; ===
The ISM Report On Business is one of the most reliable economic barometers of the U.S. economy. The Report is based on two national surveys of supply chain professionals tracking changes in the manufacturing, non-manufacturing sectors and hospital subsectors.

=== &quot;Inside Supply Management&quot; ===
ISM publishes a members-only monthly magazine &quot;Inside Supply Management&quot;.

==CAPS Research==
CAPS Research, or the Center for Advanced Procurement Strategy, is a B2B nonprofit research center at Arizona State University, serving supply management leaders at Fortune 1000 companies. CAPS was established in 1986 at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University in partnership with Institute for Supply Management. It uses supply management KPIs to provide comprehensive benchmarking so companies can see how they compare to other organizations.

==Controversies==
In 2013, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the early release of the June 2013 Manufacturing ISM &quot;Report On Business&quot; by mass media and information firm Thomson Reuters. According to a CNBC article high-speed trading surged 15 milliseconds before the report was scheduled to be released:

: ...ISM&#x27;s manufacturing data was inadvertently sent out early by Thomson Reuters on June 3rd to its high-speed clients, many of whom immediately traded on the information. There was a sharp market reaction to that burst of trading, which prompted downward moves in the SPY ETF, which serves as an investing tool for traders to bet on the overall direction of the market. That downward surge [allowed insiders] more than enough time to profit from early knowledge of market-moving information.

After a telephone inquiry from the SEC about the early release of the data, Thomson Reuters issued a statement explaining that the early release was due to a clock synchronization issue. At the SEC&#x27;s request, the firm voluntarily provided a redacted copy of its contract with ISM. In an interview with CNBC, ISM CEO Thomas Derry said that after speaking with Thomson Reuters about the mechanics of their release process, he was confident it was an isolated occurrence. He also indicated that “We have not been contacted by any government entity.”

On June 2, 2014, ISM released the ISM &quot;Report On Business&quot;, its closely followed monthly manufacturing report, and then revised it twice in the span of about two-and-a-half hours, a highly unusual event. The initial figure of 53.2 was lower than anticipated and indicated a slowing of the pace of factory-sector growth, and this caused stocks to dip immediately. Economists disputed the report&#x27;s accuracy.

ISM&#x27;s final correction of 55.4 was almost in line with Wall Street expectations, indicating brisk growth, and the stock market rebounded quickly and closed the day with a modest gain. In a statement, ISM attributed the errant report to a software glitch that &quot;incorrectly used the seasonal adjustment factor from the previous month.&quot;

<doc id="68038" wikidata="Q428414" url="?curid=68038" title="Circular definition">
<text>A circular definition is a type of definition that uses the term(s) being defined as part of the description or assumes that the term(s) being described are already known. There are several kinds of circular definition, and several ways of characterising the term: pragmatic, lexicographic and linguistic. Circular definitions are related to circular reasoning in that they both involve a self-referential approach.

Circular definitions may be unhelpful if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself.

In linguistics, a circular definition is a description of the meaning of a lexeme that is constructed using one or more synonymous lexemes that are all defined in terms of each other.

==Approaches to characterizing circular definitions==
===Classical===
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot;, several definitions of virtue are offered, the third of which states that virtue is the power of attaining good justly or with justice, where justice has already been defined as a form or aspect of virtue. Socrates, in response to Meno, states that the process of finding a definition will have to be started again because the wording offered defines virtue as a part of virtue.

===Pragmatic===
From a pragmatic point of view, circular definitions may be characterised in terms of new, useful or helpful information: a definition is deficient if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself. Such definitions lead to a need for additional information that motivated someone to look at the definition in the first place and, thus, violate the principle of providing new or useful information. Here are some examples:

* Suppose we define &quot;oak&quot; as a tree which has catkins and grows from an acorn, and then define &quot;acorn&quot; as the nut produced by an oak tree. To someone who does not know which trees are oaks, nor which nuts are acorns, the definition is inadequate.
* If someone wants to know what a cellular phone is, telling them that it is a &quot;phone that is cellular&quot; will not be especially illuminating. Much more helpful would be to explain the concept of a cell in the context of telecommunications, or at least to make some reference to portability.
* Similarly, defining dialectical materialism as &quot;materialism that involves dialectic&quot; is unhelpful.

Consequently, when constructing systems of definitions, authors should use good practices that avoid producing viciously circular definitions. In many learner&#x27;s dictionaries, circular definitions are greatly reduced by writing definitions using only the words in a constrained defining vocabulary.

===Lexicographic===
From a lexicographic point of view, the simplest form of circular definition in a dictionary is in terms of synonyms, and the number of steps for closing the definition chain into a circle is known as the &quot;depth&quot; of the circular definition: the circular definition &quot;object: a thing&quot; → &quot;thing: an object&quot; is a circular definition with a depth of two. The circular definition &quot;object: a thing&quot; → &quot;thing: an entity&quot; → &quot;entity: an object&quot; has a depth of three.
The classic &quot;genus-difference&quot; dictionary definition is in terms of nearest kind (&quot;genus proximum&quot;) and specific differences (&quot;differentia specifica&quot;). This genus-difference description may be involved in producing circular definitions of part and kind relationships, for example: &quot;rake: an implement with three or more tines&quot; → &quot;tine: a part of a rake&quot;. However, if more specific differences are added, then the effect of circularity may disappear: &quot;rake: a gardening implement with a long handle with three or more tines arranged on crossbar at 90° to the handle and the tines at 90° to both crossbar and handle&quot;; in this case, &quot;tine&quot; is most usefully defined with reference to &quot;rake&quot;, but with additional differences providing points of comparison, e.g.: &quot;tine: a sharp spike at the end of a rake&quot;. In practice, a pragmatic approach is often taken in considering the effects of circularity in dictionary definitions.

====Circular lexicographic (dictionary) definitions====

Dictionary entries are often given as examples of apparent circular definitions. Dictionary production, as a project in lexicography, should not be confused with a mathematical or logical activity, where giving a definition for a word is similar to providing an explanans for an explanandum in a context where practitioners are expected to use a deductive system. While, from a linguistic prescriptivist perspective, any dictionary might be believed to dictate correct usage, the linguistic descriptivist perspective recognizes that looking up words in dictionaries is not itself a rule-following practice independent of the give-and-take of using words in context. Thus, the example of a definition of oak given above (something that has catkins and grows from acorns) is not completely useless, even if &quot;acorn&quot; and &quot;catkin&quot; are defined in terms of &quot;oak&quot;, in that it supplies additional concepts (e.g., the concept of catkin) in the definition. 

While a dictionary might produce a &quot;circle&quot; among the terms, &quot;oak&quot;, &quot;catkin&quot;, and &quot;acorn&quot;, each of these is used in different (e.g., those related to plants, trees, flowers, and seeds) that generate ever-branching networks of usages. In another case it might produce a true circle. Taken as a whole, dictionaries are circular because each and every word is defined in terms of words that are also contained within the dictionary. ()

Definitions in lexicography can be broadly or narrowly circular. Narrowly circular definitions simply define one word in terms of another. A broadly circular definition has a larger circle of words. For example, the definition of the primary word is defined using two other words, which are defined with two other words, etc., creating a definitional chain. This can continue until the primary word is used to define one of the words used in the chain, closing the wide circle of terms. If all definitions rely on the definitions of other words in a very large, but finite chain, then all text-based definitions are ultimately circular. Extension (semantics) to the actual things that referring terms like nouns stand for, provided that agreement on reference is accomplished, is one method of breaking this circularity, but this is outside the capacity of a text-based definition.

====Examples of narrowly circular definitions in dictionaries====
The 2007 Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a &quot;hill&quot; and a &quot;mountain&quot; this way:

: hill - &quot;1: a usually rounded natural elevation of land lower than a mountain&quot;
: mountain - &quot;1a: a landmass that projects conspicuously above its surroundings and is higher than a hill&quot;

Merriam-Webster&#x27;s online dictionary provides another example of a circular definition with the words &quot;condescending&quot; and &quot;patronizing:&quot;

: Main Entry: condescending
: Function: adjective
: 1 : showing or characterized by condescension: patronizing

From &quot;condescension&quot;:

: Main Entry: condescension
: Function: noun
: 1 : voluntary descent from one&#x27;s rank or dignity in relations with an inferior
: 2 : patronizing attitude or behavior

To &quot;patronize&quot;:

: Main Entry: patronize
: Function: transitive verb
: 1 : to act as patron of: provide aid or support for
: 2 : to adopt an air of condescension toward: treat haughtily or coolly
From the Oxford Dictionary of English: 

* Punishment – &quot;a &quot;penalty&quot; inflicted as &quot;retribution&quot; for an offence&quot;.
* &quot;Penalty&quot; – &quot;a punishment imposed for breaking a law, rule, or contract&quot;.
* &quot;Retribution&quot; – &quot;punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act&quot;.
* Vengeance – &quot;punishment inflicted or retribution exacted for an injury or wrong&quot;.

Therefore, a punishment means &quot;a &quot;punishment imposed for breaking a law, rule, or contract&quot; inflicted as &quot;punishment inflicted on someone as&quot; punishment inflicted or retribution exacted for an injury or wrong &quot;for a wrong or criminal act&quot; for an offence&quot;. Obviously, this is not the final result of substitution as this would result in an endlessly long sentence.

==Mathematical theory==
Formal approaches to characterizing circular definitions are found in logic, mathematics and in computer science. A branch of mathematics called non-well-founded set theory allows for the construction of circular sets. Circular sets are good for modelling cycles, and, despite the field&#x27;s name, this area of mathematics is well founded. Computer science allows for procedures to be defined by using recursion. Such definitions are not circular as long as they terminate.

==Linguistics==
Linguistically, a circular definition is a description of the meaning of a lexeme that is constructed using one or more synonymous lexemes that are all defined in terms of each other.

<text>The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code as a method of standardizing industry classification for statistical purposes across agencies. Established in the United States in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. Similar SIC systems are also used by agencies in other countries, e.g., by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Companies House.

In the United States, the SIC system was last revised in 1987 and was last used by the Census Bureau for the 1992 Economic Census, and has been replaced by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997. Some U.S. government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), continue to use SIC codes.

The SIC code for an establishment, that is, a unique business with a registered U.S. headquarters, was determined by the industry appropriate for the overall largest product lines of the company or organization of which the establishment was a part. The later NAICS classification system has a different concept, assigning establishments into categories based on each one&#x27;s output.

==History==
The first edition of SIC was published in parts during 1938–1940, with revisions made in 1941–1942. The next edition was published in two parts in 1945 and 1949. Further revisions were issued in 1957, 1963, 1967, 1972, 1977, and 1987.

The SIC code system has been used since the 1930s. It was developed by the Interdepartmental Committee on Industrial Statistics, established by the Central Statistical Board who developed the List of Industries for manufacturing, published in 1938, and the 1939 List of Industries for non-manufacturing industries, which became the first Standard Industrial Classification for the United States. The SIC system was last revised in 1987 and was last used by the Census Bureau for the 1992 Economic Census.

The Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, was tasked with revising the SIC system to reflect changing economic conditions. The OMB established the Economic Classification Policy Committee in 1992 to develop a new system representative of the current industrial climate. The result was the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, a collaborative effort between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. NAICS replaced the four-digit SIC code with a six-digit code, and it provided more flexibility in handling emerging industries (for example, the NAICS system more generally allows for &quot;Other...&quot; categories across industry groups). The new codes were implemented in Canada and the United States in 1997 and in Mexico one year later.

NAICS classified establishments (workplace) by their main output, instead of classifying them with the larger firm or organization of which the establishment was a part. This gives more precise information on establishment and worker activities than the SIC system, but changed the meaning of the classifications somewhat, making some time series of data hard to sustain accurately. Fort and Klimek (2016) found using longitudinal data on establishments that the switch from SIC to NAICS reclassified large numbers of workers differently by industry/sector than NAICS does, notably by reclassifying some from the Manufacturing sector into Services.

==Purpose==
In the early 1900s, each branch of United States government agencies conducted business analysis using its own methods and metrics, unknown and meaningless to other branches. In the 1930s, the government needed standardized and meaningful methods to measure, analyze and share data across its various agencies. Thus, the Standard Industrial Classification system was born. SIC codes are four-digit numerical representations of major businesses and industries. SIC codes are assigned based on common characteristics shared in the products, services, production and delivery system of a business.

==Structure== 
SIC codes have a hierarchical, top-down structure that begins with general characteristics and narrows down to the specifics. The first two digits of the code represent the major industry sector to which a business belongs. The third and fourth digits describe the sub-classification of the business group and specialization, respectively. For example, &quot;36&quot; refers to a business that deals in &quot;Electronic and Other Equipment.&quot; Adding &quot;7&quot; as a third digit to get &quot;367&quot; indicates that the business operates in &quot;Electronic, Component and Accessories.&quot; The fourth digit distinguishes the specific industry sector, so a code of &quot;3672&quot; indicates that the business is concerned with &quot;Printed Circuit Boards.&quot;

==Uses==
The U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration utilize SIC codes in their reporting, although SIC codes are also used in academic and business sectors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updates the codes every three years and uses SIC to report on work force, wages and pricing issues. The Social Security Administration assigns SIC codes to businesses based on the descriptions provided by employers under the primary business activity entry on employer ID applications.

==Limitations==
Over the years, the U.S. Census has identified three major limitations to using the SIC system. The first limitation surrounds its definition and mistaken classification of employee groups. For example, administrative assistants in the automotive industry support all levels of the business, yet the SIC defines these employees as part of the &quot;Basic Sector&quot; of manufacturing jobs when they should be reported as &quot;Non-Basic.&quot; Secondly, SIC codes were developed for traditional industries prior to 1970. Business has changed considerably since then from manufacturing-based to mostly service-based. As a result, and thirdly the SIC has been slow to recognize new and emerging industries, such as those in the computer, software, and information technology sectors.

==Codes==
===Range===
The SIC codes can be grouped into progressively broader industry classifications: industry group, major group, and division. The first 3 digits of the SIC code indicate the industry group, and the first two digits indicate the major group. Each division encompasses a range of SIC codes:

To look at a particular example of the hierarchy, SIC code 2024 (ice cream and frozen desserts) belongs to industry group 202 (dairy products), which is part of major group 20 (food and kindred products), which belongs to the division of manufacturing.

===List===
The following table is from the SEC&#x27;s website, which allows searching for companies by SIC code in its database of filings. The acronym NEC stands for &quot;not elsewhere classified&quot;.

<doc id="68042" wikidata="Q724903" url="?curid=68042" title="Chess960">
<text>Chess960, also known as Fischer Random Chess, is a chess variant that randomizes the starting position of the pieces on the back rank. It was introduced by former world chess champion Bobby Fischer in 1996 to reduce the emphasis on opening preparation and to encourage creativity in play. Chess960 uses the same board and pieces as classical chess, but the starting position (&quot;SP&quot;) of the pieces on the players&#x27; is randomized, following certain rules. The random setup makes gaining an advantage through the memorization of openings unfeasible. Players instead must rely on their skill and creativity.

Randomizing the main pieces had long been known as &quot;shuffle chess&quot;, but Fischer introduced new rules for the initial random setup, &quot;preserving the dynamic nature of the game by retaining for each player and the right to castle for both sides&quot;. The result is 960 unique possible starting positions.

In 2008, FIDE added Chess960 to an appendix of the Laws of Chess. The first world championship officially sanctioned by FIDE, the FIDE World Fischer Random Chess Championship 2019, brought additional prominence to the variant. It was won by Wesley So. In 2022, Hikaru Nakamura became the new champion.

==Setup==
Before the game, a starting position is randomly determined and set up, subject to certain requirements. White&#x27;s pieces (not pawns) are placed randomly on the first , following two rules:
# The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares.
# The king must be placed on a square between the rooks.

Black&#x27;s pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to White&#x27;s pieces. (For example, if the white king is randomly determined to start on f1, then the black king is placed on f8.) Pawns are placed on the players&#x27; second ranks as in classical chess.

After setup, the game is played the same as classical chess in all respects, with the exception of castling from the different possible starting positions for king and rooks.

==Creating starting positions==
There are formula_1
legal starting positions:
* 4 light squares for one bishop;
* 4 dark squares for the other bishop;
* 6 remaining squares for the queen and formula_2 ways to place the two (identical) knights on the remaining 5 squares,
** or, equivalently, formula_3 ways to place the two (identical) knights on the remaining 6 squares and 4 remaining squares for the queen;
* 1 way to place the two rooks and king on the remaining 3 squares, since the king must be between the rooks.

Usually, the players accept the conditions of the organizer to generate the starting position with software, or if playing online, software can select a random starting position automatically.

If starting position software is unavailable or isn&#x27;t used, there are many other ways to generate a random starting position with equal probability for each position. In 1998, Ingo Althöfer proposed a method that requires only a standard six-sided die. Which goes as follows, first decide which tile the light square bishop will go to using only the four pips on the six sided dice because there are only four light squares available on the first rank, if the dice rolls 5 or 6, try again. Then do the same for the dark square bishop. Now we have six vacant squares left. The key idea is that there is no need to roll the dice for the King and the Rook pair, since when we have only three vacant squares left after the Queen and the Knight pair, the King and the Rook pair will take those squares no matter which square, in the order of “Rook King Rook” because the King has to be in between the Rooks. Now in any order, roll the dice and place the Queen and the Knight pair using from all six pips to five pips and then four pips. The squares for the King and the Rook pair will be decided in parallel. 

It&#x27;s also possible to select a starting position using polyhedral dice, coins, or cards, but with the prevalence of personal computers and similar devices, these methods have become outdated. A random number between 0 and 959 inclusive can also be used as an index to the Fischer random chess numbering scheme.

==Naming==

The variant has held a number of different names. It was originally known as &quot;Fischerandom&quot; or &quot;Fischerandom chess&quot;, the name given by Fischer. &quot;Chess960&quot; is used by FIDE in its &quot;Laws of Chess&quot;.

Hans-Walter Schmitt, chairman of the Frankfurt Chess Tigers e.V. and an advocate of the variant, started a brainstorming
process for creating a new name, which had to meet the requirements of leading grandmasters; specifically, the new name and its parts:
* should not contain part of the name of any grandmaster;
* should not include negatively biased or &quot;spongy&quot; elements (such as &quot;random&quot; or &quot;freestyle&quot;); and
* should be universally understood.
The name &quot;Chess960&quot; (pronounced &quot;Chess nine-sixty&quot;) was chosen to reflect the 960 possible starting positions in the game.

In conversations with Helgi Ólafsson, Bobby Fischer discussed the initiative that renamed the variant &quot;Chess960&quot; and remarked, &quot;They believe my image is so bad that they have given it another name.&quot; Fischer later expressed that he liked the name &quot;Chess960&quot; and sometimes used the name.

Chess960 tournaments hosted by the Saint Louis Chess Club since 2019 are branded as &quot;Chess 9LX&quot;, where the name is a combination of the Arabic numeral 9 and the Roman numerals LX (60). The name &quot;Freestyle chess&quot; has also been used by the Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge and the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour promoted by Magnus Carlsen and Jan Henric Buettner.

==Castling rules==
As in classical chess, each player may castle once per game, moving both the king and a rook in a single move; however, the castling rules were reinterpreted in Chess960 to support the different possible initial positions of king and rook. After castling, the final positions of king and rook are the same as in classical chess, namely:

* After &quot;a-side&quot; castling (/long castling in classical chess), the king finishes on the c- and the a-side rook finishes on the d-file. The move is notated 0-0-0 as in classical chess.
* After &quot;h-side&quot; castling (/short castling in classical chess), the king finishes on the g-file and the h-side rook finishes on the f-file. The move is notated 0-0 as in classical chess.

Castling prerequisites are the same as in classical chess, namely:
* The king and the castling rook must not have previously moved. Note that if the king did not move while castling on a previous move (i.e. the king is on c1 or c8 already while castling a-side or on g1 or g8 already while castling h-side), it may be possible for this condition to still hold for castling on the other side. However, the FIDE rules explicitly state that castling may be done only once per game per player.
* No square from the king&#x27;s initial square to its final square may be under attack by an enemy piece, even if the king is already on its final square.
* All the squares between the king&#x27;s initial and final squares (including the final square), and all the squares between the castling rook&#x27;s initial and final squares (including the final square), must be vacant except for the king and castling rook.

FIDE&#x27;s recommended procedure for castling unambiguously is first to move the king outside the playing area next to its final square, then to move the rook to its final square, then to move the king to its final square. Another recommendation is to verbally announce the intent to castle before doing so.

===Observations===
* In some starting positions, squares can remain occupied during castling that would be required to be vacant under standard rules. Castling a-side (0-0-0) could still be possible despite the home rank a-, b-, or e-file squares being occupied, and similarly for the e- and h-files for h-side castling (0-0). In other positions, it can happen that one of the king or rook does not move during the castling maneuver since it already occupies its destination square – e.g., an h-side rook that starts on the f-file; in this case, only the king moves. No initial position allows a castling where neither piece moves, as the king must start between the rooks.
* Another unusual possibility is for castling to be available as the first move of the game, as happened in the 11th game of the tournament match between Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen, Fischer Random Blitz 2018. The starting position had kings at f1/f8 and h-side rooks at g1/g8. Both players took the opportunity to castle on the first move (1.0-0 0-0).
* In standard chess, a rook can castle out of and through a threatened square but cannot castle into a threatened square because that would mean its king passes through check since, when castling, a king always passes its castling rook&#x27;s destination square. In Chess960, however, a rook can castle into a threatened square. This is discussed by Levon Aronian and Yasser Seirawan in Round 3 of St Louis&#x27; 2022 Chess 9LX tournament for move 18 of Aronian&#x27;s game against Leinier Domínguez Pérez which had starting position RKBBNQNR.
* There are exactly 90 starting positions where, unlike in standard chess, players have to give up castling rights on one side in order to castle on the other side. This is seen by calculating that this happens 18 times in each of five possible groups of starting positions namely RKRXXXXX, RKXRXXXX, XRKRXXXX, XXXXXRKR and RXKRXXXX. In only these positions, a rook has to be moved (or captured) on one side in order to castle on the other side. For example, in the starting position RKRBBNNQ, which is in the first group RKRXXXXX, a player intending to castle a-side must first move the c-file rook (or let it be captured).
** The Sesse evaluations (which used Stockfish 9) show that White has about, on average, a 7% increased advantage in these 90 positions (Evaluation is 0.1913) compared to the remaining 870 positions (Evaluation is 0.1790).

==Theory==

The study of openings in Chess960 is in its infancy, but fundamental opening principles still apply, including: protect the king, control the central squares (directly or indirectly), and develop rapidly, starting with the less valuable pieces.

Unprotected pawns may also need to be dealt with quickly. Many starting positions have unprotected pawns, and some starting positions have up to two that can be attacked on the first move. For example, in some Chess960 starting positions (see diagram), White can attack an unprotected black pawn on the first move, whereas in classical chess it takes two moves for White to attack, and there are no unprotected pawns.

===White&#x27;s advantage===
It has been argued that two games should be played from each starting position, with players alternating colors, since the advantage offered to White in some initial positions may be greater than in classical chess.

However, Sesse (which used Stockfish 9) evaluated the starting positions to be between 0.00 and 0.57, with an average of 0.18 advantage for White. BBNNRKRQ (SP 80) was the least balanced position with 0.57 advantage for White, while 27 different starting positions evaluate as equal, or 0.00 advantage for White or Black, ex. BBRNNQKR (SP 432). The standard chess starting position RNBQKBNR (SP 518) was evaluated at 0.22 advantage for White. Hence, on average, a Chess960 starting position is actually 18.2% more balanced than the standard starting position. 

==History==
===Van Zuylen van Nijevelt&#x27;s early contributions===
The concept of random chess, also known as shuffle chess, was first proposed by the Dutch chess enthusiast Philip Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt (1743-1826). In his renowned treatise on chess, &quot;La Supériorité aux Échecs&quot;, published in 1792, Van Zuylen van Nijevelt articulated his disdain for the repetitive patterns often found in standard chess openings. He proposed the idea of randomizing the starting positions of the main pieces to create a vast array of unique situations, eliminating the possibility of pre-game memorization or extensive opening theory. Van Zuylen van Nijevelt&#x27;s book, with its full title &quot;La Supériorité aux Échecs mise à la portée de tout le monde, et particulièrement des dames qui aiment cet amusement&quot; (&quot;Superiority in Chess brought into the reach of all, and particularly of ladies who love that amusement&quot;), gained significant popularity and was reprinted several times. Its influence extended beyond the Dutch-speaking world, as it was subsequently translated into multiple languages, spreading the idea of randomizing the initial positions of chess pieces to a wider audience. This early conception of random chess by Van Zuylen van Nijevelt laid the foundation for Chess960.

Van Zuylen van Nijevelt&#x27;s innovative approach to chess not only offered a solution to the repetitive nature of traditional openings but also paved the way for the exploration of chess variants that deviate from the conventional starting position. His quote within &quot;La Supériorité aux Échecs&quot; emphasizes the core principle behind random chess, stating, &quot;This produces a huge number of different situations, so that no one can study them beforehand,&quot; reflecting his desire to introduce an element of unpredictability and originality into the game of chess. The legacy of Van Zuylen van Nijevelt&#x27;s contributions to the evolution of chess remains significant, with his early insights serving as a cornerstone for the development of various randomized chess variants, including Chess960.

===Development and further evolution===
The pioneering work of Van Zuylen van Nijevelt found continued development through the efforts of his nephew, the Jonkheer Elias van der Hoeven (1778-1854), a Dutch diplomat. Van der Hoeven took the concept of shuffle chess further, potentially sharing his insights with Aaron Alexandre, evident from Alexandre&#x27;s incorporation of the theory into his Encyclopédie des échecs in 1837.

The earliest documented games of shuffle chess were played between Van der Hoeven and Alexandre in Mannheim in 1842, with Alexandre emerging as the victor with a score of 3-0. One of these games is preserved in Sissa, the Netherlands&#x27; first long-standing chess journal, demonstrating an initial position with two advanced pawns on each side. A later game played by Van der Hoeven was against Baron von der Lasa (1818-1899), adhering more closely to the contemporary rules of random chess, except for the monochromatic bishop pairs.

In 1851, Van der Hoeven visited Willem Verbeek, the editor-in-chief of Sissa. Verbeek and Hancock, Verbeek&#x27;s chess companion in Amsterdam during the 1850s, delved into shuffle chess, with their initial findings documented in the pages of the Sissa journal.

Van der Hoeven&#x27;s modifications to the original concept of random chess were published in Alexandre&#x27;s Encyclopédie in 1837 and later republished in Sissa by an individual known as T. Scheidius. This variant began to be referred to as &quot;schaakspel, naar de wijze van jhr. Van der Hoeven&quot; or &quot;schaakspel à la Van der Hoeven.&quot; 

Following Van der Hoeven&#x27;s visit, the Sissa Chess Society received an invitation from the Philidor Chess Society in Amsterdam, in collaboration with Van der Hoeven, to organize a shuffle chess tournament. The aim was to promote the dissemination and popularity of the chess variant attributed to Van der Hoeven. Originally intended as a tournament among the eight prize winners of the 1851 Philidor-organized event, logistical challenges led to invitations being extended to other chess societies. Ultimately, a tournament with seven players from Amsterdam, along with the 74-year-old Van der Hoeven, was organized. Notable participants included Maarten van &#x27;t Kruijs (Philidor), J. Seligmann (Philidor), H. Kloos (La Bourdonnais), M.M. Coopman, and F.G. Hijmans / S. Heijmans, supplemented by Mohr and J. van Praag. Van ’t Kruijs emerged as the winner of the tournament, reinforcing the growing sentiment that the removal of opening theory allows true chess talent to shine.

===Fischer&#x27;s influence and popularization===
Fischer&#x27;s modification &quot;imposes certain restrictions, arguably an improvement on the anarchy of the fully randomized game in which one player is almost certain to start at an advantage&quot;. Fischer started to develop his new version of chess after the 1992 return match with Boris Spassky. The result was the formulation of the rules of Fischer Random Chess in September 1993, introduced formally to the public on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Fischer&#x27;s goal was to eliminate what he considered the complete dominance of openings preparation in classical chess, replacing it with creativity and talent. In a situation where the starting position was random it would be impossible to fix every move of the game. Since the &quot;opening book&quot; for 960 possible opening systems would be too difficult to devote to memory, the players must create every move originally. From the first move, both players must devise original strategies and cannot use well-established patterns. Fischer believed that eliminating memorized book moves would level the playing field.

During summer 1993, Bobby Fischer visited László Polgár and his family in Hungary. All of the Polgar sisters (Judit Polgár, Susan Polgar, and Sofia Polgar) played many games of Fischer Random Chess with Fischer. At one point Sofia beat Fischer three games in a row. Fischer was not pleased when the father, László, showed Fischer an old chess book that described what appeared to be a forerunner of Fischer Random Chess. The book was written by Izidor Gross and published in 1910. Fischer then changed the rules of his variation in order to make it different. There are games of shuffle chess recorded as early as 1852 but Fischer is generally credited with fixing the colors of bishops alongside king placement between the rooks and defining the castling process. In a later radio interview, Fischer explained his reasoning for proposing a revision of shuffle chess, rather than a game with new pieces (and a larger board), as the “new chess“:
==Tournaments==

===First tournaments===
* 1996 – The first Fischer Random Chess tournament was held in Vojvodina, Yugoslavia, in the spring of 1996, and was won by Peter Leko with 9½/11, ahead of Stanimir Nikolić with 9/11.
* 2006–present – The first Fischer Random Championships of the Netherlands was held by Fischer Z chess club and has since been held annually. Dimitri Reinderman has won this title for five years, champion in 2010, 2014, 2015, 2023 en 2024. Two grandmasters have won the title twice, Yasser Seirawan and Dennis de Vreugt.
* 2010 – In 2010 the US Chess Federation sponsored its first Chess960 tournament, at the Jerry Hanken Memorial US Open tournament in Irvine, California. This one-day event, directed by Damian Nash, saw a first-place tie between Larry Kaufman and Mark Duckworth, which Kaufman won on tiebreaks.
* 2012 – The British Chess960 Championship was held at the Mind Sports Olympiad, won by Ankush Khandelwal.
* 2018 – The first edition of the European Fischer Random Cup was held in Reykjavík on March 9, 2018, on Fischer&#x27;s 75th birthday. It was won by Aleksandr Lenderman.
* 2019 – The Icelandic Chess Federation organized the European Fischer Random Championship on the rest day of 34th edition of The GAMMA Reykjavik Open on April 12, 2019. The tournament was won by the then 15-year-old Iranian prodigy Alireza Firouzja, a full point ahead of US&#x27;s Andrew Tang, who was second on tiebreaks.
* 2024 – The European Chess Union organized the European Blitz, Rapid and Random (Chess960) Championships in Skopje, North Macedonia. The Chess960 championship, held on December 10, was won by Vladimir Fedoseev, who also won the Rapid championship.

===Mainz Championships===
&quot;Note: None of the Mainz championships were recognized by FIDE. Furthermore, they were all played with rapid time controls.&quot;
* 2001 – Peter Leko defeated Michael Adams 4½ to 3½ in an eight-game Fischer Random Chess match at the Mainz Chess Classic, in what was regarded as one of the earliest serious tests of the chess variant.
* 2002 – In 2002 at Mainz, an open tournament was held which was attended by 131 players, with Peter Svidler taking first place. Fischer Random Chess was selected as the April 2002 &quot;Recognized Variant of the Month&quot; by &quot;The Chess Variant Pages&quot; (ChessVariants.org). The book &quot;Shall We Play Fischerandom Chess?&quot; was published in 2002, authored by Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić.
* 2003 – At the 2003 Mainz Chess Classic, Svidler beat Lékó in an eight-game match for the World Championship title by a score of 4½–3½. The Chess960 open tournament drew 179 players, including 50 grandmasters. It was won by Levon Aronian, the 2002 World Junior Champion. Svidler is the official first World New Chess Association (WNCA) world champion inaugurated on August 14, 2003, with Jens Beutel, Mayor of Mainz as the President and Hans-Walter Schmitt, Chess Classic organizer as Secretary. The WNCA maintains an own dedicated Chess960 rating list.
* 2004 – Aronian played Svidler for the title at the 2004 Mainz Chess Classic, losing 4½–3½. At the same tournament in 2004, Aronian played two Chess960 games against the Dutch computer chess program The Baron, developed by Richard Pijl. Both games ended in a draw. It was the first ever man against machine match in Chess960. Zoltán Almási won the Chess960 open tournament in 2004.
* 2005 – Almási and Svidler played an eight-game match at the 2005 Mainz Chess Classic. Once again, Svidler defended his title, winning 5–3. Levon Aronian won the Chess960 open tournament in 2005. During the Chess Classic 2005 in Mainz, initiated by Mark Vogelgesang and Eric van Reem, the first-ever Chess960 computer chess world championship was played. Nineteen programs, including the powerful Shredder, played in this tournament. As a result of this tournament, Spike became the first Chess960 computer world champion.
* 2006 – The 2006 Mainz Chess Classic saw Svidler defending his championship in a rematch against Levon Aronian. This time, Aronian won the match 5–3 to become the third ever Fischer Random Chess world champion. Étienne Bacrot won the Chess960 open tournament, earning him a title match against Aronian in 2007. Three new Chess960 world championship matches were held, in the women, junior and senior categories. In the women category, Alexandra Kosteniuk became the first Chess960 Women World Champion by beating Elisabeth Pähtz 5½ to 2½. The 2006 Senior Chess960 World Champion was Vlastimil Hort, and the 2006 Junior Chess960 World Champion was Pentala Harikrishna. Shredder won the computer championship, making it Chess960 computer world champion 2006.
* 2007 – In 2007 Mainz Chess Classic Aronian successfully defended his title of Chess960 World Champion over Viswanathan Anand, while Victor Bologan won the Chess960 open tournament. Rybka won the 2007 computer championship.
* 2008 – Hikaru Nakamura won the 2008 Finet Chess960 Open (Mainz). 
* 2009 – The last Mainz tournament was held in 2009. Hikaru Nakamura won the Chess960 World Championship against Aronian, while Alexander Grischuk won the Chess960 open tournament.

===Computers===
In 2005, chess program The Baron played two Fischer Random Chess games against Chess960 World Champion Peter Svidler, who won 1½–½. The chess program Shredder, developed by Stefan Meyer-Kahlen of Germany, played two games against Zoltán Almási from Hungary, where Shredder won 2–0.

TCEC has held TCEC FRC since 2019 where Stockfish has won every edition except the 2021 edition which was won by Komodo. Since 2022, they have also held tournaments for an additional variant called DFRC (Double Fischer Random Chess) or FRD (Fischer Random Double), which arrange the starting positions for White and Black separately instead of requiring them to be mirrored. There are thus 960 × 960 = 921,600 possible starting positions, and more potential for the positions to be unbalanced. These events have all been won by Stockfish.

===Miscellaneous matches===
From February 9 to 13, 2018, a Chess960 match between former classical World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen and the unofficial Fischer Random Chess world champion Hikaru Nakamura was held in Høvikodden, Norway. The match consisted of 8 rapid and 8 blitz games, with the rapid games counting double. Each position was used in two games, with colors reversed. Carlsen prevailed with a score of 14–10.

===Saint Louis Chess Club&#x27;s Champions Showdown: Chess 9LX===
2018 – From September 11 to 14, 2018, the Saint Louis Chess Club held a Chess960 event, but they did not yet call their event &#x27;Chess 9LX&#x27;. (They started next year.) The playing format consisted of individual matches, each pair of players facing the same five different starting positions, with 6 rapid games (counting 2 points each) and 14 blitz games (counting 1 point each). &quot;Players and scores:&quot;

# Veselin Topalov (14½–11½) defeated Garry Kasparov.
# Hikaru Nakamura (14–12) defeated Peter Svidler.
# Wesley So (14½–11½) defeated Anish Giri.
# Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (17½–8½) defeated Sam Shankland.
# Levon Aronian (17½–8½) defeated Leinier Domínguez.

2019 – The playing format once again consisted of individual matches. &quot;Players and scores:&quot;

# Fabiano Caruana (19–7) defeated Garry Kasparov.
# Wesley So (18–8) defeated Veselin Topalov.
# Peter Svidler (15½–10½) defeated Leinier Domínguez Pérez.
# Hikaru Nakamura (14½–11½) defeated Levon Aronian.

2020 – The playing format changed to a round robin. The event was won by both (There was no tiebreaker) former world (standard) chess champion Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura got 6/9. Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian got 5½/9. Wesley So scored 5/9, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Leinier Dominguez Perez got 4/9. Garry Kasparov scored 3½/9, Peter Svidler 3/9 and Alireza Firouzja 2½/9.

2021 – The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. The event was won by Leinier Domínguez Pérez.

2022 – The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. The event was won by Fabiano Caruana who defeated Alireza Firouzja in armageddon.

2023 – The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. Sam Sevian won with 7/9. Wesley So, Levon Aronian and Sam Shankland got 6/9. Fabiano Caruana scored 5½/9, Hikaru Nakamura 4/9, Jeffrey Xiong 3½/9, Garry Kasparov 3/9, Leinier Dominguez 2½/9 and Ray Robson 1½/9.

2024 – The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. The event was won by Fabiano Caruana.

===FIDE World Championships 2019 and 2022===

On April 20, 2019, the first world championship in Fischer Random Chess officially recognized by FIDE was announced. It ended on November 2, 2019. In the finals, Wesley So defeated the former and four-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen 13½–2½ (4 wins, 0 losses, 2 draws) to become the inaugural world Fischer Random Chess champion.

In the announcement, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich commented: It is an unprecedented move that the International Chess Federation recognizes a new variety of chess, so this was a decision that required to be carefully thought out. But we believe that Fischer Random is a positive innovation: It injects new energies and enthusiasm into our game, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t mean a rupture with our classical chess and its tradition. It is probably for this reason that Fischer Random chess has won the favor of the chess community, including the top players and the world champion himself. FIDE couldn&#x27;t be oblivious to that: It was time to embrace and incorporate this modality of chess.

On August 19, 2022, the second world championship was announced for later in 2022, in Iceland. This is exactly half a century after the World Chess Championship 1972 held in Iceland between Fischer and Boris Spassky. On October 30, Hikaru Nakamura played the finals against Ian Nepomniachtchi, who had earlier knocked out Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura won in the armageddon after drawing the match 2–2.

===Freestyle Chess===
The eight-player Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge was the first major Chess960 tournament that used classical chess time controls. It took place in Germany from February 9–16, 2024. Fischer Random world champion Nakamura was reportedly invited, but did not play in the event. Magnus Carlsen won the tournament by defeating Fabiano Caruana in the finals.

Following the success of the first tournament, organizers Carlsen and Jan Henric Buettner launched the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour in 2025, comprising five &quot;Grand Slam&quot; tournaments. The winner of the tour will be awarded the title of Freestyle Chess Champion.

==Coding games and positions==

Recorded games must convey the Fischer Random Chess starting position. Games recorded using the Portable Game Notation (PGN) can record the initial position using Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN), as the value of the &quot;FEN&quot; tag. Castling is notated the same as in classical chess (except PGN requires letter &quot;O&quot;, not number &quot;0&quot;). Note that not all chess programs can handle castling correctly in Fischer Random Chess games. To correctly record a Fischer Random Chess game in PGN, an additional &quot;Variant&quot; tag (not &quot;Variation&quot; tag, which has a different meaning) must be used to identify the rules; the rule named &quot;Fischerandom&quot; is accepted by many chess programs as identifying Fischer Random Chess, though &quot;Chess960&quot; should be accepted as well. This means that in a PGN-recorded game, one of the PGN tags (after the initial seven tags) would look like this: [Variant &quot;Fischerandom&quot;].

FEN is capable of expressing all possible starting positions of Fischer Random Chess; however, unmodified FEN cannot express all possible positions of a Chess960 game. In a game, a rook may move into the back row on the same side of the king as the other rook, or pawn(s) may be underpromoted into rook(s) and moved into the back row. If a rook is unmoved and can still castle, yet there is more than one rook on that side, FEN notation as traditionally interpreted is ambiguous. This is because FEN records that castling is possible on that side, but not &quot;which&quot; rook is still allowed to castle.

A modification of FEN, X-FEN, has been devised by Reinhard Scharnagl to remove this ambiguity. In X-FEN, the castling markings &quot;KQkq&quot; have their expected meanings: &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;q&quot; mean a-side castling is still legal (for White and Black respectively), and &quot;K&quot; and &quot;k&quot; mean h-side castling is still legal (for White and Black respectively). However, if there is more than one rook on the baseline on the same side of the king, and the rook that can castle is not the outermost rook on that side, then the file letter (uppercase for White) of the rook that can castle is used instead of &quot;K&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, or &quot;q&quot;; in X-FEN notation, castling potentials belong to the outermost rooks by default. The maximum length of the castling value is still four characters. X-FEN is upwardly compatible with FEN, that is, a program supporting X-FEN will automatically use the normal FEN codes for a traditional chess starting position without requiring any special programming. As a benefit, all 18 pseudo FRC positions (positions with traditional placements of rooks and king) still remain uniquely encoded.

The solution implemented by chess engines like Shredder and Fritz is to use the letters of the columns on which the rooks began the game. This scheme is sometimes called Shredder-FEN. For the traditional setup, Shredder-FEN would use HAha instead of KQkq.

==Similar variants==
There are several variants based on randomization of the initial setup. &quot;Randomized Chess, in one or other of its many reincarnations, continues to attract support even, or perhaps especially, that of top players.&quot;

Remarks

Any variant with N starting positions can exist with mirroring (or rotating) white and black otherwise it means another (double) variant with N2 starting positions. In any variant the castling is not possible in any case or is possible only when king and rook are on their traditional starting squares, or as follows:

After castling with the nearest rook to the column:

* &quot;h&quot;, the king will be in column &quot;g&quot; and the rook will be in column &quot;f&quot;.
* &quot;a&quot;, the king will be in column &quot;c&quot; and the rook will be in column &quot;d&quot;.

The double chess2880 without castling is known as Transcendental chess (or TC).

Chess18 is the subset of Chess960 in which the kings and rooks are fixed, so that castling is always orthodox, preserving more of the feel of ordinary chess. This allows some opening knowledge to still have practical relevance – one could practically learn a few short lines for each of the eighteen starting positions – though it does not reach the extent of orthodox chess, in which one has to memorize many long computer lines. Moreover, this excludes all starting positions where White has a large advantage, and makes early blunders less common by making it impossible for a bishop to attack an undefended pawn after White&#x27;s first move. However, due to having fewer starting positions and the requirement that the king and rooks must start on traditional starting squares, Chess18 has much less positional diversity than is offered by Chess960. Additionally, while memorizing openings is more difficult in Chess18 than in traditional chess, opening preparation has the potential to be a much more significant aspect of the game than in Chess960, especially for grandmasters and top players. Chess18 positions are more likely than Chess960 positions to resemble structures found in traditional chess due to the limited starting positions in Chess18 in comparison to the diversity of starting positions found in Chess960.
As discussed above in &#x27;Castling rules&#x27;, Chess870 and Chess90 are the partitioning subsets of Chess960 in which a player, respectively, never needs or may need to give up castling rights on one side to castle on the other side.

Chess480

In &quot;Castling in Chess960: An appeal for simplicity&quot;, John Kipling Lewis proposes alternative castling rules which Lewis has named &quot;Orthodoxed Castling&quot;.

The preconditions for castling are the same as in Chess960, but when castling,
... the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards (or over) the rook, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has just crossed (if it is not already there). If the king and rook are adjacent in a corner and the king cannot move two spaces over the rook, then the king and rook exchange squares.

Unlike Chess960, the final position after castling in Chess480 will usually &quot;not&quot; be the same as the final position of a castling move in traditional chess. Lewis argues that this alternative better conforms to how the castling move was historically developed.

Lewis has named this chess variation &quot;Chess480&quot;; it follows the rules of Chess960 with the exception of the castling rules. Although a Chess480 game can start with any of 960 starting positions, the castling rules are symmetrical (whereas the Chess960 castling rules are not), so that mirror-image positions have identical strategies; thus there are only 480 &quot;effectively&quot; different positions. The number of starting positions could be reduced to 480 without losing any possibilities, for example by requiring the white king to start on a light (or dark) square.

There are other claims to the nomenclature &quot;Chess480&quot;; Reinhard Scharnagl defines it as the white queen is always to the left of the white king.

David O&#x27;Shaughnessy argues in &quot;Castling in Chess480: An appeal for sanity&quot; that the Chess480 rules are often not useful from a gameplay perspective. In about 66% of starting positions, players have the options of castling deeper into the wing the king started on, or castling into the center of the board (when the king starts on the b-, c-, f-, or g-files). An example of poor castling options is a position where the kings start on g1 and g8 respectively. There will be no possibility of &quot;opposite-side castling&quot; where each player&#x27;s pawns are free to be used in pawn storms, as the kings&#x27; scope for movement is very restricted (it can only move to the h- or e-file). These &quot;problem positions&quot; play well with Chess960 castling rules.

<text>Richard Wigginton Thompson (June 9, 1809 – February 9, 1900) was an American politician.

Thompson was born in Culpeper County, Virginia. He left Virginia in 1831 and lived briefly in Louisville, Kentucky before finally settling in Lawrence County, Indiana. There, he taught school, kept a store, and studied law at night. Admitted to the bar in 1834, he practiced law in Bedford, Indiana, and served four terms in the Indiana General Assembly from 1834 to 1838. He served as President pro tempore of the Indiana Senate for a short time and briefly held the office of acting Lieutenant Governor. In the presidential election of 1840, he zealously advocated the election of William Henry Harrison. Thompson then represented Indiana in the United States Congress, serving in the United States House of Representatives from 1841 to 1843 and again from 1847 to 1849.

During the 1850s Thompson and some of his fellow Whigs (such as his friend Schuyler Colfax) transferred allegiance to the American Party, better known as the Know Nothing Party. They did so due to their suspicion of the increased immigration from Ireland and Germany, but also because of the view of the northern portion of the American Party to be opposed to slavery. In time Thompson and his allies would allow an alliance of their portion of the Whig Party (which was collapsing with the American Party to prevent victories in elections by the Democratic Party.

In the election of 1860 Thompson was his state&#x27;s leader of those who organized the Constitutional Union Party. At the May convention, Indiana first supported John McLean, but fell in behind John Bell on the second ballot. Thompson was placed on the National Committee, but gave up the on third party strategy in August and supported Abraham Lincoln so as not to risk a Democratic victory in Indiana.

Following the American Civil War, Thompson served as judge of the 18th Circuit Court of the state of Indiana from 1867 to 1869. Active in Republican politics, he was the Platform Committee chairman at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he offered Vice President Schuyler Colfax&#x27;s name for renomination at the 1872 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, and gave the nominating speech for Oliver H. P. Morton for president at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him Secretary of the Navy; and he held that office until December 1880.

==Secretary of the Navy==

Thompson, as Secretary of the Navy, had never been among the leading figures of the Cabinet (William Evarts, John Sherman, or Carl Schurz) nor had been even a close colleague and friend of President Hayes like Vice President William Wheeler. Even the Postmaster General, David Key, who was the second Confederate veteran to serve in a Federal Cabinet since the American Civil War was more notable. Reputedly Thompson was unprepared for his post. A popular (if suspect) story is that he was taken for a tour of one of our warships, and went below deck becoming thunderstruck and shouting, &quot;My God, the durned thing&#x27;s hollow!!&quot; Thompson (being from Indiana) was not from a state with a seacoast, but Indiana has several rivers running through it. It is not hard to believe Thompson was on a steamboat at some point and saw the inside of it.

When he assumed the role of Secretary of the Navy he was replacing Grant&#x27;s Secretary for nearly eight years, George Robeson. Whatever was the situation caused or allowed by Robeson&#x27;s handling of the Navy, Thompson offered little additional guidance. His most notable involvement in any naval activity was actually on the sidelines: when Lt. George Washington De Long and James Gordon Bennett Jr. set up the USS &quot;Jeannette&quot; Expedition to the North Pole in 1879, Thompson gave some advice to the preparations, but seemed determined to watch the extent of Government involvement in the project. His waffling (about escort vessels and later rescue vessels) were somewhat irritating. While not responsible for that tragedy, Thompson certainly did not help matters by his hair-splitting legalisms.

In 1880 a new matter arose that had a bearing with Thompson leaving his post. The French were in the process of funding the new Panama Canal Company under Comte Ferdinand de Lesseps. The Hayes administration, while willing to keep good relations with the French, were fully suspicious about a French-owned Canal across the Isthmus of Panama as a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Thompson was aware of this. But
Thompson was also approached by the American-based section of the Panama Company with a job offer. The American section was headed and funded by J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co., then headed by Jessie Seligman. The Seligmans were old friends of former President Ulysses S. Grant and had offered Grant the position of the Presidency of the Canal Company. But Grant refused it. Looking around for a replacement they turned to Thompson. He accepted and then resigned from the Cabinet. Later on, this whole matter became an issue before the Congressional Committee that questioned both Seligman and Thompson. Eventually, Thompson would leave the Panama Company, but his reputation was somewhat tarnished by the situation. He was not connected with it at the time of the great scandalous collapse of the enterprise in 1889.

Retiring to Indiana, Thompson lived out the remainder of his days in his adopted state. He died in 1900 at Terre Haute, Indiana.

The United States Navy destroyer USS &quot;Thompson&quot; (DD-305) was named in his honor.

He was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Alabama (Psi chapter), and an active Freemason and member of Terre Haute Lodge No. 19, F&amp;AM, serving as the Master of Terre Haute Lodge No. 19 in 1859 &amp; 1860.

<text>Robert Means Thompson (2 March 1849 – 5 September 1930) was a United States Navy officer, business magnate, philanthropist and a president of the American Olympic Association. He is the namesake of the destroyer USS &quot;Thompson&quot; (DD-627).

==Biography==
He was born in Corsica, Pennsylvania, to Judge of the Jefferson County PA court John Jamison Thompson and Agnes Kennedy.

===Navy days===
Thompson was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 30 July 1864. Graduating tenth in the class of 1868, Thompson first went to sea in &quot;Contoocook&quot; in the West Indian Squadron. He later served in &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Richmond&quot;, and &quot;Guard&quot; of the Mediterranean Squadron; as well as in USS &quot;Wachusett&quot; and at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island. Commissioned ensign on 19 April 1869, and promoted to master on 12 July 1870, he resigned from the Navy on 18 November 1871, to study law in his brother&#x27;s office. 

===Lawyer===
After he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1872, he was still not satisfied with his legal training so he studied law at Harvard, graduating in 1874. Thompson subsequently practiced law in Boston and was a member of the Boston Common Council from 1876 to 1878.

===Metallurgist===
Thompson later became interested in mining and smelting enterprises, by which he earned his fortune. He became president of Orford Copper and Nickel Company, and it was at his refinery in Constable Hook New Jersey where he earned , &quot;Method of obtaining sulphide of nickel&quot;.

A Boston entrepreneur named W. E. C. Eustis bought what was to become the Orford Nickel and Copper Company in 1865 in order to develop a mineral deposit discovered near Sherbrooke, Quebec, in Orford, Quebec. In March 1878 Eustis, Thompson, Robert Gilmour Leckie, Charles C. Colby and Walter W. Beckett established the Orford Nickel and Copper Company in Quebec. Thompson et al established the New Jersey refinery to process the ore from Orford there.

Orford Copper was the generatrix in 1900 of the Ontario Smelting Company and Orford Village which Thompson set up near what was to become known as Copper Cliff, at Cobalt Street. 

In 1902 Orford Copper merged with the Canadian Copper Company and American Nickel Works, into the International Nickel Company of Canada, of which he served as chairman for at least a decade.

===Residence===
In 1907 he lived in a stone mansion at 1607 23rd Street NW in Washington, D.C. which was recently built by New York attorney Frank Ellis. The mansion is in the Beaux-arts style and was designed by the firm of Carrère and Hastings which designed many significant buildings of the era. Ellis sold the mansion to Roumania in 1921 and it has been used as its embassy ever since.

===Philanthropy===
He was an organizer of the Navy Athletic Association and the donor of the Thompson Cup, which is awarded to the member of the Navy Midshipmen who contributes most to the advancement of athletics at the Naval Academy. His interest in sport then extended to the Olympic Games, and was twice president of the American Olympic Association, once for the 1912 Summer Olympics, and again for the 1924 games. In 1912, he was also elected president of the New York Athletic Club. He also helped to organize the New York Chapter of the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and served as its first president and as a trustee of the Naval Academy Alumni Association at Annapolis, Maryland.

Thompson was president of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers and president of the Navy League, and owner of the yacht &quot;Katrina&quot;. He also visited Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government and was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class, by the Emperor. He also received the Order of Vasa by the government of Sweden, and the Cross of Commander, French Legion of Honor, by the French government.

Thompson became a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) in 1874 through the Massachusetts commandery. He was active in MOLLUS affairs and was elected commander in chief October 27, 1927, and served in that capacity until his death.

He was also a companion of the Naval Order of the United States and a strong supporter of the Navy League of the United States.

He co-edited the &quot;Confidential Correspondence of Gustavus Vasa Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy&quot; for the Navy Historical Society.

===Death and family life===
Robert Means Thompson was married to Sarah Gibbs, daughter of Rhode Island governor, William C. Gibbs. They had one daughter, Sarah Gibbs Thompson. He maintained a summer residence at Southampton, Long Island and in winter he could be found in Washington DC.

He died while visiting his daughter and her husband, Stephen Hyatt Pell, at Fort Ticonderoga, New York, the commencement of the historic restored fortress being funded by his personal fortune in 1909. His memorial service was held at the chapel of the United States Naval Academy and he is buried with his wife in the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

<doc id="68047" wikidata="Q5435430" url="?curid=68047" title="The Caine Mutiny (1954 film)">
<text>The Caine Mutiny is a 1954 American military trial film directed by Edward Dmytryk, produced by Stanley Kramer, and starring Humphrey Bogart, José Ferrer, Van Johnson, Robert Francis, and Fred MacMurray. It is based on Herman Wouk&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1951 novel of the same name. Set in the Pacific theatre of World War II, the film depicts the events on board a U.S. Navy destroyer-minesweeper and the subsequent court-martial of its executive officer for mutiny.

The film was released by Columbia Pictures on June 24, 1954. It was well-received by critics and was the second highest-grossing film in the United States in 1954. At the 27th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Humphrey Bogart. Edward Dmytryk was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award.

==Plot==
During World War II, newly commissioned Ensign Willis Seward &quot;Willie&quot; Keith reports to the minesweeper USS &quot;Caine&quot;, where he meets career officer Lt. Stephen Maryk, the ship’s executive officer, and aspiring novelist and communications officer Thomas Keefer. Soon after, Lt. Commander Philip Francis Queeg is assigned command of the &quot;Caine&quot;. The eccentric Queeg instills strict discipline on the lax crew, making him unpopular with them, but admired by Keith.

During a gunnery target towing exercise, Queeg is distracted berating Keith and Keefer over a crewman’s appearance, resulting in the ship steering over the towline, setting the target adrift. Queeg tries to cover up the incident.

Assigned to escort a group of landing craft during an invasion of a small Pacific island, Queeg abandons his mission before he reaches the designated departure point, and instead orders the dropping of a yellow dye marker, leaving the landing craft to fend for themselves. Queeg asks his officers for their support, but they remain silent and nickname him &quot;Old Yellowstain&quot;, which implies cowardice.

Keefer, believing Queeg to be paranoid, encourages Maryk to consider relieving Queeg on the basis of mental incapacity under Article 184 of Navy Regulations. Though Maryk angrily rejects that possibility, he does begin keeping a medical log documenting the captain&#x27;s behavior.

When strawberries go missing from the officers&#x27; mess, Queeg convenes an elaborate investigation to determine the culprit. The investigation involves searching the ship and stripping all crew members. Convinced of Queeg&#x27;s instability, Maryk asks Keefer and Keith to go with him to see Admiral Halsey about the matter. Arriving aboard Halsey&#x27;s flagship, Keefer backs down and they return to the ship.

At the height of a typhoon, Maryk urges the captain to reverse course into the wind and take on ballast, but Queeg refuses and virtually freezes up on the bridge. Maryk, supported by Keith, relieves Queeg of command under Article 184. The &quot;Caine&quot; returns to San Francisco, where Maryk and Keith face a court-martial for mutiny. Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a temporarily grounded naval aviator and an attorney before entering the Navy, becomes Maryk&#x27;s defense counsel.

At the court-martial, Keefer claims he never observed any mental illness in Queeg and was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; when he was relieved. Under Greenwald&#x27;s relentless cross-examination, Queeg exhibits odd behavior on the stand, including his habit of rolling two steel balls in his hand symbolizing his mental instability, and Maryk is acquitted.

Following the acquittal, the officers of the &quot;Caine&quot; hold a party, where Keefer receives a frosty reception from Maryk. A drunken Greenwald arrives and berates all the officers for not appreciating Queeg&#x27;s long service and failing to give him the support he asked for, instead of deriding him as an incompetent. Greenwald claims their mistreatment of Queeg, who had been suffering from &quot;battle fatigue&quot; from his previous combat service in the Atlantic, caused the captain to ultimately become indecisive during the typhoon. He denounces Keefer as the real &quot;author&quot; of the mutiny and throws a glass of champagne, the &quot;yellow wine&quot;, in Keefer&#x27;s face. The rest of the officers walk out, leaving Keefer alone in the room.

Keith, now married to his girlfriend May Wynn, is promoted to lieutenant (junior grade), and assigned to a new &quot;Sumner&quot;-class destroyer commanded by now-Commander De Vriess, his first captain in the &quot;Caine&quot;.

== Cast ==


==Pre-production==
===Writing===
Herman Wouk had already adapted his novel as a stage play, &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in January 1954 and ran for more than a year. The play was directed by Charles Laughton and was a critical as well as a commercial success. Wouk was initially selected to write the screenplay, but director Dmytryk was disatisfied with his draft. He replaced the novelist with Stanley Roberts, an experienced screenwriter. Roberts later quit the production after being told to cut the screenplay so the film could be kept to two hours. The 50 pages worth of cuts were made by Michael Blankfort, who received an &quot;additional dialog&quot; credit.

The film differs from the novel, which focused on the Keith character, who became secondary in the film. The film instead focuses on Queeg. Independent producer Stanley Kramer &quot;mollified the Navy&quot; by modifying the Queeg characterization to make him less of a madman, as portrayed by Wouk, and more a victim of battle fatigue. Studios did not want to purchase the film rights to Wouk&#x27;s novel until cooperation of the U.S. Navy was settled. Kramer purchased the rights himself for an estimated $60,000 – $70,000. The Navy&#x27;s reluctance to cooperate led to an unusually long pre-production period.

===Casting and director===
Stanley Kramer and Columbia Pictures intended to cast Humphrey Bogart as Philip Queeg. Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn knew that Bogart wanted the part and took advantage of that fact, and he was eventually able to force Bogart to settle for much less than his usual $200,000 salary. &quot;This never happens to Cooper or Grant or Gable, but always to me&quot;, Bogart complained to his wife, Lauren Bacall.

Van Johnson was loaned to Columbia by MGM, where he was under contract. Being cast as Maryk was a breakthrough for the actor, who felt that he had been in a &quot;rut&quot; by being typecast in light roles. During the filming of the scene off Oahu in which Maryk swims fully clothed to retrieve a line, his character is warned that there are sharks in the water; these sharks do not appear on camera, but the actor&#x27;s life was saved when a real-life Navy rifleman shot one which was approaching. Lee Marvin was cast as one of the sailors, not only for his acting, but also because of his knowledge of ships at sea. Marvin had served in the U.S. Marines from the beginning of American involvement in World War II through the Battle of Saipan in 1944, during which he was wounded. As a result, he became an unofficial technical advisor for the film.

Before choosing Dmytryk for &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;, Kramer had hired the director for three low-budget films. Dmytryk had previously been blacklisted, and the success of the film helped revive his career.

&quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; would be the first feature role in Robert Francis&#x27;s short four-film Hollywood career, as he was killed when the private plane he was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff from Burbank Airport in California on July 31, 1955.

== Production ==

===Filming===
Principal photography took place between June 3 and August 24, 1953 under the initial working title of &quot;Authority and Rebellion&quot;.

In addition to the Pearl Harbor and San Francisco Bay Area locations, including the &quot;Caine&quot; steaming back and forth several times under the Golden Gate Bridge, the romantic subplot features scenes shot on location at Yosemite National Park.

The , a destroyer minesweeper, was one of the ships chosen to represent the USS &quot;Caine&quot; in the film. The &quot;Rodman&quot; had one less smokestack than the actual s on which Wouk served, and had more anti-aircraft guns. Completed in 1941, she was a much more modern ship than the 1918-manufactured &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyer minesweepers had been. True to the theme of the novel, the actual minesweepers of Wouk&#x27;s service, the and the , were both outdated ships by the time the film was made. The &quot;Zane&quot; was retired shortly after the war, and the &quot;Southard&quot; was scuttled in October 1945 after running aground in Okinawa with Wouk serving as Executive Officer. One of the primary inspirations for the book and the movie came from Wouk&#x27;s experience as second in command of the &quot;Southard&quot; when she ran aground in Okinawa as a result of Typhoon Ida in September 1945.

Columbia claimed that the film contained the longest continuous courtroom scene without a cut, running to 977 feet, surpassing a scene in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot;.

===Navy involvement===
The Navy was initially uncomfortable with both the portrayal of a mentally unbalanced man as the captain of one of its ships and the word &quot;mutiny&quot; in the film&#x27;s title. After Stanley Roberts&#x27; shooting script was completed and approved by the Navy after 15 months of negotiations, the Department agreed to cooperate with Columbia Pictures by providing access to its ships, planes, combat boats, Pearl Harbor, the port of San Francisco, and Naval Station Treasure Island for filming. Dmytryk recalled in his memoir that after &quot;noisy&quot; protests from the Navy subsided, the film production received wholehearted cooperation. This included the conversion of two soon to be decommissioned destroyer/destroyer minesweepers, and , as facsimiles to portray the USS &quot;Caine&quot;.

An epigraph appears on screen immediately following the opening credits that reads: &quot;There has never been a mutiny in a ship of the United States Navy. The truths of this film lie not in its incidents, but in the way a few men meet the crisis of their lives.&quot; In 1842, an incipient mutiny was quashed before it occurred on board the US Navy Brig USS &quot;Somers&quot;.

== Music ==
This was the last of a number of Bogart films scored by composer Max Steiner, mostly for Warner Bros. The main title theme, &quot;The Caine Mutiny March&quot;, was included in RCA Victor&#x27;s collection of classic Bogart film scores, recorded by Charles Gerhardt and the National Philharmonic Orchestra.

The lyrics of the song, &quot;Yellowstain Blues&quot;, which mocked Queeg&#x27;s perceived cowardice during the landing incident, were drawn from the source novel.

===Soundtrack===
The original soundtrack album for &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was not officially released until 2017, and copies of the soundtrack made before that are very rare. Perhaps a dozen copies survive. RCA Victor planned an LP release with musical excerpts on the first side and the complete dialogue of the climactic court-martial scene on side two, but Herman Wouk believed that including this scene was an infringement on his recently opened Broadway play dealing with the court-martial. He threatened to prohibit Columbia Pictures from making any further adaptations of his work. According to Wouk, &quot;Columbia head Harry Cohn looked into the matter, called me back, and said in his tough gravelly voice, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got you beat on the legalities, but I&#x27;ve listened to the record and it&#x27;s no goddamn good, so I&#x27;m yanking it.&#x27;&quot; Max Steiner&#x27;s score was finally released by Intrada Records in 2017 as Special Collection Volume ISC 382.

==Reception==

The film premiered in New York City on June 24, 1954, and went into general release on July 28. Made on a budget of $2 million, it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1954, earning $8.7 million in theatrical rentals in the United States. It was the most successful of Kramer&#x27;s productions, some of which had previously lost money, and put his entire production company – as well as Columbia Pictures – in the black.

The film got a major pre-release boost three weeks before its premiere when Bogart as Queeg appeared on the cover of the June 7, 1954 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The accompanying cover story (&quot;Cinema: The Survivor&quot;) praised Bogart&#x27;s portrayal of Queeg as &quot;a blustering, secretive figure in Navy suntans, who brings the hollow, driven, tyrannical character of Captain Queeg to full and invidious life, yet seldom fails to maintain a bond of sympathy with his audience. He deliberately gives Queeg the mannerisms and appearance of an officer of sternness and decision, and then gradually discloses him as a man who is bottling up a scream, a man who never meets another&#x27;s eyes. In the courtroom scene, Bogart&#x27;s Queeg seems oblivious of his own mounting hysteria. Then, suddenly, he knows he is undone; he stops and stares stricken at the court, during second after ticking second of dramatic and damning silence.&quot;

Director Edward Dmytryk felt &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; could have been better than it was and should have been three and a half to four hours long to fully portray all the characters and complex story, but Columbia&#x27;s Cohn insisted on a two-hour limit. Reviewing the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote that the job of condensing Wouk&#x27;s novel to two hours had been achieved &quot;with clarity and vigor, on the whole.&quot; His reservations concerned the studio&#x27;s attempt to &quot;cram&quot; in &quot;more of the novel than was required&quot;, such as the &quot;completely extraneous&quot; love affair between Keith and May Wynn, which Crowther found to be a plot diversion that weakened dramatic tension. Although he doubted whether the novel had a structure suited for film, he noted that Roberts had &quot;endeavored to follow it faithfully.&quot; The result, he argued, was that the court-martial became &quot;an anticlimax&quot; as it repeated Queeg&#x27;s visible collapse seen in the typhoon but still considered the core of the film &quot;smartly and stingingly played&quot; and &quot;though somewhat garbled&quot; was still &quot;a vibrant film.&quot;

==Legacy ==
In his book &quot;American Literature on Stage and Film&quot;, historian Thomas S. Hischak says that Dmytryk handled both the action sequences and character portrayals deftly, and calls Queeg&#x27;s breakdown during the trial &quot;the stuff of movie legend.&quot;

The film and novel influenced the drafters of the 25th Article Of Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which set forth conditions for removing the President of the United States. John D. Feerick, former dean of Fordham University School of Law, who assisted in drafting the amendment, told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2018 that the film was a &quot;live depiction&quot; of the type of crisis that could arise &quot;if a president ever faced questions about physical or mental inabilities but disagreed completely with the judgment&quot;, which was not dealt with in the Constitution. Lawmakers and lawyers drafting the amendment wanted no such &quot;Article 184 situation&quot; as depicted in the film, in which the Vice President of the U.S. or others could topple the President by merely saying that the President was &quot;disabled&quot;.

===Cultural influence===
When Michael Caine, born Maurice Micklewhite, first became an actor he adopted the stage name &quot;Michael White&quot;. He was later told by his agent that another actor was already using the same name, and that he had to come up with a new one immediately. Speaking to his agent from a telephone box in Leicester Square in London, he looked around for inspiration. Being a fan of Bogart, he noted that &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was being shown at the Odeon Cinema, and adopted a new name from the movie title. Caine has often joked in interviews that, had he looked the other way, he would have ended up as &quot;Michael One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;.

Vince Gilligan used a clip of the film in a &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; episode titled &quot;Madrigal&quot;, originally transmitted in 2012, and has stated that &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was one of his favorite movies as a child. The final scene of &quot;Chicanery&quot;, an episode of the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; spinoff series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, is an homage to the film&#x27;s climactic courtroom scene.

In &quot;&quot;, members of the human resistance serve aboard the submarine USS &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; piloted by a reprogrammed Terminator that has been named &quot;Queeg&quot; by the crew.

In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, the obsessive Commodore Matt Decker, portrayed by William Windom, fusses constantly with two futuristic tape cartridges, much as Captain Queeg rubs together two bearing balls. Windom publicly acknowledged that Decker&#x27;s behavior was based on Queeg&#x27;s.

<text>Nottinghamshire (; abbreviated &quot;Notts.&quot;) is a ceremonial county in the East Midlands of England. The county is bordered by South Yorkshire to the north-west, Lincolnshire to the east, Leicestershire to the south, and Derbyshire to the west. The largest settlement is the city of Nottingham (323,632), which is also the county town.

The county has an area of and a population of 1,154,195. The latter is concentrated in the Nottingham built-up area in the south-west, which extends into Derbyshire and has a population of 729,997. The north-east of the county is more rural, and contains the towns of Worksop (44,733) and Newark-on-Trent (27,700). For local government purposes Nottinghamshire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with seven districts, and the Nottingham unitary authority area. The East Midlands Combined County Authority includes Nottinghamshire County Council and Nottingham City Council.

The geography of Nottinghamshire is largely defined by the River Trent, which forms a wide valley which crosses the county from the south-west to the north-east. North of this, in the centre of the county, is Sherwood Forest, the remnant of a large ancient woodland.

==History==
Nottinghamshire lies on the Roman Fosse Way, and there are Roman settlements in the county; for example at Mansfield, and forts such as at the Broxtowe Estate in Bilborough. The county was settled by Angles around the 5th century, and became part of the Kingdom, and later Earldom, of Mercia. However, there is evidence of Saxon settlement at the Broxtowe Estate, Oxton, near Nottingham, and Tuxford, east of Sherwood Forest. The name first occurs in 1016, but until 1568, the county was administratively united with Derbyshire, under a single Sheriff. In Norman times, the county developed malting and woollen industries. 

King William I the Conqueror in 1066 made Sherwood Forest a Royal Forest for hunting which was frequently visited by the Mercian and later Kings.

William&#x27;s 1086 Domesday Book identified certain areas in Nottinghamshire being under the land of King Edward the Confessor these included Mansfield and Sutton in Ashfield, amongst other places including Skegby, Dunham-on-Trent, East Drayton, East Markham, Farnsfield, Warsop, Carburton, Edwinstowe, Carlton-on-Trent, Budby, Perlethorpe and Walesby. 

King John&#x27;s Palace ruin near Kings Clipstone was a royal residence for King John, the area being near to Sherwood Forest. King John&#x27;s Palace was a place where King William the Lion of Scotland met King Richard I of England to congratulate him on his return from the crusades. King John died at Newark Castle in 1216.

During the Industrial Revolution, the county held much needed minerals such as coal and iron ore, and had constructed some of the first experimental waggonways in the world; an example of this is the Wollaton wagonway of 1603–1616, which transported minerals from bell pitt mining areas at Strelley and Bilborough, this led to canals and railways being constructed in the county, and the lace and cotton industries grew. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mechanised deeper collieries opened, and mining became an important economic sector, though these declined after the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike.

Until 1610, Nottinghamshire was divided into eight Wapentakes. Sometime between 1610 and 1719, they were reduced to six – Newark, Bassetlaw, Thurgarton, Rushcliffe, Broxtowe, and Bingham, some of these names still being used for the modern districts. Oswaldbeck was absorbed in Bassetlaw, of which it forms the North Clay division, and Lythe in Thurgarton.

Nottinghamshire is famous for its involvement with the legend of Robin Hood. This is also the reason for the numbers of tourists who visit places like Sherwood Forest, City of Nottingham, and the surrounding villages in Sherwood Forest. To reinforce the Robin Hood connection, the University of Nottingham in 2010 has begun the Nottingham Caves Survey, with the goal &quot;to increase the tourist potential of these sites&quot;. The project &quot;will use a 3D laser scanner to produce a three dimensional record of more than 450 sandstone caves around Nottingham&quot;.

Nottinghamshire was mapped first by Christopher Saxton in 1576; the first fully surveyed map of the county was by John Chapman, who produced Chapman&#x27;s Map of Nottinghamshire in 1774. The map was the earliest printed map at a sufficiently useful scale (one statute mile to one inch) to provide basic information on village layout, and the existence of landscape features such as roads, milestones, tollbars, parkland, and mills.

Nottinghamshire saw a slight change to its overall boundary in the extreme northern part of the county in 1974, when the villages of Blaxton, Finningley and Auckley (part) were merged into the City of Doncaster in South Yorkshire.

==Physical geography==

Nottinghamshire, like Derbyshire, and South Yorkshire, sits on extensive coal measures, up to thick, and occurring largely in the north of the county. There is an oilfield near Eakring. These are overlaid by sandstones and limestones in the west, and clay in the east. The north of the county is part of the Humberhead Levels lacustrine plain. The centre and south west of the county, around Sherwood Forest, features undulating hills with ancient oak woodland. Principal rivers are the Trent, Idle, Erewash, and Soar. The Trent, fed by the Soar, Erewash, and Idle, composed of many streams from Sherwood Forest, run through wide and flat valleys, merging at Misterton. A point just north of Newtonwood Lane, on the boundary with Derbyshire is the highest point in Nottinghamshire; at , while Silverhill, a spoil heap left by the former Silverhill colliery, a human-made point often cited as the highest, reaches . The lowest is Peat Carr, east of Blaxton, at sea level; the Trent is tidal below Cromwell Lock.

Nottinghamshire is sheltered by the Pennines to the west, so receives relatively low rainfall at annually. The average temperature of the county is 8.8–10.1 degrees Celsius (48–50 degrees Fahrenheit). The county receives between 1321 and 1470 hours of sunshine per year.

===Green belt===

Nottinghamshire contains one green belt area, first drawn up from the 1950s. Completely encircling the Nottingham conurbation, it stretches for several miles into the surrounding districts, and extends into Derbyshire.

==Politics==

Nottinghamshire, including the city of Nottingham, is represented by eleven members of parliament; nine for the Labour Party, one Conservative and one Reform UK MP.

Following the 2021 County Council election, the Conservative Party make up a majority of councillors. The party gained full control after previously governing in coalition with the Mansfield Independent Forum since the 2017 election. The council was formerly Labour-controlled after the 2013 election. The County Council is currently made up of 34 Conservative councillors, 15 Labour, 10 Ashfield Independents and 7 independents.

Local government is devolved to seven local borough and district councils. Ashfield is controlled by the Ashfield Independents. Bassetlaw, Broxtowe, Gedling, and Mansfield are Labour-controlled. Newark and Sherwood is controlled by a coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors. Rushcliffe is Conservative-controlled. Nottingham City Council, which governs the Nottingham unitary authority and is independent of Nottinghamshire County Council, is majority Labour-controlled.

Elections to the county council take place every four years, with the first election taking place in 1973. Following each election, the county council has been controlled by the following parties:
==Economy and industry==
The regional economy was traditionally based on industries such as coal mining in the Leen Valley, and manufacturing. Since the invention of the knitting frame by local William Lee, the county, in particular Nottingham, became synonymous with the lace industry.

In 1998, Nottinghamshire had a gross domestic product (GDP) per-capita of £12,000, and a total GDP of £12,023 million. This is compared to a per-capita GDP of £11,848 for the East Midlands, £12,845 for England, and £12,548 for the United Kingdom. Nottingham had a GDP per-capita of £17,373, North Nottinghamshire £10,176, and South Nottinghamshire £8,448. In October 2005, the United Kingdom had 4.7% unemployment, the East Midlands 4.4%, and the Nottingham commuter belt area 2.4%.

==Education==
===Secondary education===
The county has comprehensive secondary education with 47 state secondary schools, as well as 10 private schools. The City of Nottingham local education authority (LEA) has 18 state schools and six independent schools, not including sixth form colleges.

A total of 9,700 pupils took GCSEs in the Nottinghamshire LEA in 2007. The best results were from the West Bridgford School, closely followed by Rushcliffe Spencer Academy and the Minster School in Southwell. In Nottingham, the best results came from the Trinity Catholic School and the Fernwood School in Wollaton.

At A-level, the highest performing institution was The Becket School, followed by the West Bridgford School. Some of Nottingham city best results tend to come from Nottingham High School, closely followed by the all-female Nottingham High School for Girls, both of which are privately run.

Worksop College is another private school near to Worksop.

===Higher education===
The University of Nottingham is a Russell Group university and well-renowned, offering one of the broadest selections of courses in the UK. Nottingham Trent University is one of the most successful post-1992 universities in the UK. Nottingham is home to a campus of the University of Law. All three of these institutions combine to make Nottingham one of England&#x27;s largest student cities. Nottingham Trent University also has an agricultural college near Southwell, while the University of Nottingham has one at Sutton Bonington.

==Culture==
While the overall county is officially in the East Midlands, northern parts of Nottinghamshire are considered to be geographically and culturally northern. Locals may personally refer to places such as Worksop and Bolsover as being in the &quot;north&quot;.

Nottinghamshire is home to the Sherwood Forest, known for its association with the legend of Robin Hood.

Nottinghamshire contains the ancestral home of the poet Lord Byron, Newstead Abbey, which he sold in 1818. It is now owned by Nottingham City Council, and is open to the public. The acclaimed author D. H. Lawrence was from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire. Toton was the birthplace and home of English folk singer-songwriter Anne Briggs, well known for her song &quot;Black Waterside&quot;. The north of the county is also noteworthy for its connections with the Pilgrim Fathers. William Brewster, for example, came from the village of Scrooby, and was influenced by Richard Clyfton, who preached at Babworth.

Nottinghamshire has international twinning arrangements with the province of Wielkopolska (Greater Poland) in western Poland, and with the province&#x27;s capital city, Poznań.

In 2002, &quot;Crocus nudiflorus&quot; (Autumn crocus) was voted by the public as the county flower of Nottinghamshire.

=== Sport ===
Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club (NCCC) are a first class county cricket club who play at Trent Bridge in West Bridgford. They won the County Championship in 2010.

The most successful football team within Nottinghamshire is Nottingham Forest, a Premier League club that won the 1978 English championship, and followed it up with winning the 1979 and 1980 European Cup titles although success has not been seen by most of their fans in living memory. Mansfield Town of League One and Notts County of League Two are the other professional teams in the county. Notts County are the world&#x27;s oldest professional football club, being formed in 1862 and are world renowned for giving Juventus their black and white striped kit and opening their new stadium in 2011. 

Other notable sporting teams are the Nottingham Rugby Football Club, and the Nottingham Panthers Ice Hockey Club.

=== Flag ===

An unofficial flag for Nottinghamshire was created through a design competition organised by BBC Radio Nottingham, and registered with the vexillological charity the Flag Institute in 2011. It consists of a green field, on which is a red cross fimbriated (bordered) with white, on which a white shield containing the green figure of an archer is superimposed.

==Districts and boroughs==

=== Areas ===

=== Settlements and features ===
The traditional county town, and the largest settlement in the historic and ceremonial county boundaries, is the City of Nottingham. The city is now administratively independent, but towns including Arnold, Carlton, West Bridgford, Beeston, and Stapleford are still within the administrative county, and West Bridgford is where the county council are based.

There are several market towns in the county. Newark-on-Trent is a bridging point of the Fosse Way and River Trent, but is actually an Anglo-Saxon market town with a now ruined castle. Mansfield, the second-largest settlement in the county after Nottingham, sits on the site of a Roman settlement, but grew after the Norman Conquest. Worksop, in the north of the county, is also an Anglo-Saxon market town which grew rapidly in the Industrial Revolution, with the arrival of canals and railways and the discovery of coal. Other market towns include Arnold, Bingham, Hucknall, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Tuxford, Retford and Sutton-in-Ashfield.

The main railway in the county is the Midland Main Line, which links London to Sheffield via Nottingham. The Robin Hood Line between Nottingham and Worksop serves several villages in the county. The East Coast Main Line from London to Doncaster, Leeds, York, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Scotland serves the eastern Nottinghamshire towns of Newark and Retford.

The M1 motorway runs through the county, connecting Nottingham to London, Leeds, and Leicester by road. The A1 road follows for the most part the path of the Great North Road, although in places it diverges from the historic route where towns have been bypassed. Retford was by-passed in 1961, and Newark-on-Trent was by-passed in 1964, and the A1 now runs between Retford and Worksop past the village of Ranby. Many historic coaching inns can still be seen along the traditional route.

East Midlands Airport is just outside the county in Leicestershire, while Doncaster Sheffield Airport lies within the historic boundaries of Nottinghamshire. These airports serve the county and several of its neighbours. Together, the airports have services to most major European destinations, and East Midlands Airport now also has services to North America and the Caribbean. As well as local bus services throughout the county, Nottingham and its suburbs have a tram system, Nottingham Express Transit.

Nottingham and its surrounding areas form part of the Nottingham Urban Area while Bassetlaw is a non-constituent part of the Sheffield City Region.

<doc id="68055" wikidata="Q28914" url="?curid=68055" title="Patron saint">
<text>A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy or Oriental Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family, or person.

The term may be applied to individuals to whom similar roles are ascribed in other religions.

==In Christianity==
Saints often become the patrons of places where they were born or had been active. However, there were cases in medieval Europe where a city which grew to prominence obtained for its cathedral the remains or some relics of a famous saint who had lived and was buried elsewhere, thus making them the city&#x27;s patron saint – such a practice conferred considerable prestige on the city concerned. In Latin America and the Philippines, Spanish and Portuguese explorers often named a location for the saint on whose feast or commemoration day they first visited the place, with that saint naturally becoming the area&#x27;s patron.

Occupations sometimes have a patron saint who had been connected somewhat with it, although some of the connections were tenuous. Lacking such a saint, an occupation would have a patron whose acts or miracles in some way recall the profession. For example, when the previously unknown occupation of photography appeared in the 19th century, Saint Veronica was made its patron, owing to how her veil miraculously received the imprint of Christ&#x27;s face after she wiped off the blood and sweat.

The veneration or commemoration and recognition of patron saints or saints in general is found in Catholicism (including Eastern Catholicism), Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and among some Lutherans and Anglicans. According to the Catholic catechism a person&#x27;s patron saint, having already attained the beatific vision, is able to intercede with God for their needs. 
Apart from Lutheranism and Anglicanism, it is, however, generally discouraged in other Protestant branches, such as Reformed Christianity, where the practice is considered a form of idolatry.

===Catholicism===
A saint can be assigned as a patron by a venerable tradition, or chosen by election. The saint is considered a special intercessor with God and the proper advocate of a particular locality, occupation, etc., and merits a special form of religious observance. A term in some ways comparable is &quot;titular&quot;, which is applicable only to a church or institution.

== In Islam ==
Although Islam has no codified doctrine of patronage on the part of saints, it has nevertheless been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic traditions that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. Martin Lings wrote: &quot;There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint.&quot; As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, in a manner different from Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, &quot;patron saints&quot; are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration. Traditionally, it has been understood that the patron saint of a particular place prays for that place&#x27;s wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein.

However, the Wahhabi and Salafi movements have latterly attacked the veneration of saints (as patron or otherwise), which they claim are a form of idolatry or &quot;shirk&quot;. More mainstream Sunni clerics have critiqued this argument since Wahhabism first emerged in the 18th century. 

== In Druze faith ==

Elijah and Jethro (Shuaib) are considered patron saints of the Druze people. In the Old Testament, Jethro was Moses&#x27; father-in-law, a Kenite shepherd and priest of Midian. Muslim scholars and the Druze identify Jethro with the prophet Shuaib, also said to come from Midian. Shuaib or Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of the Druze who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet.

Druze identify Elijah as &quot;al-Khidr&quot;. Druze, like some Christians, believe that the Prophet Elijah came back as Saint John the Baptist, since they believe in reincarnation and the transmigration of the soul, Druze believe that El Khidr and Saint John the Baptist are one and the same; along with Saint George.

Due to the Christian influence on the Druze faith, two Christian saints become the Druze&#x27;s favorite venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druzes and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druzes appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and the Prophet Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.

== In Eastern religions ==
In Hinduism, certain sects may devote themselves to the veneration of a saint, such as the Balmiki sect that reveres Valmiki.

Buddhism also includes the idea of protector deities, which are called &quot;Dharma protectors&quot; (Dharmapala).

<doc id="68056" wikidata="Q570516" url="?curid=68056" title="DIVX">
<text>DIVX (Digital Video Express) is a discontinued digital video format. Created in part by Circuit City, it was an unsuccessful attempt to create an alternative to video rental in the United States. The format&#x27;s poor reception from consumers resulted in major financial losses for Circuit City and is credited with being part of the company&#x27;s downfall.

==Format==
DIVX was a rental format variation on the DVD player in which a customer would buy a DIVX disc (similar to a DVD) for approximately US$4.50, which was watchable for up to 48 hours from its initial viewing. After this period, the disc could be viewed by paying a continuation fee to play it for two more days. Viewers who wanted to watch a disc an unlimited number of times could convert the disc to a &quot;DIVX silver&quot; disc for an additional fee. &quot;DIVX gold&quot; discs that could be played an unlimited number of times on any DIVX player were announced at the time of DIVX&#x27;s introduction, but no DIVX gold titles were ever released.

Each DIVX disc was marked with a unique barcode in the burst cutting area that could be read by the player, and used to track the discs. The status of the discs was monitored through an account over a phone line. DIVX player owners had to set up an account with DIVX to which additional viewing fees could be charged. The player would call an account server over the phone line to charge for viewing fees similar to the way DirecTV and Dish Network satellite systems handle pay-per-view.

In addition to the normal Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, DIVX discs used Triple DES encryption and an alternative channel modulation coding scheme, which prevented them from being read in standard DVD players. Most of the discs would be manufactured by United Kingdom-based Nimbus CD International.

DIVX players manufactured by Zenith Electronics (who would go bankrupt shortly before the launch of the format), Thomson Consumer Electronics (RCA and ProScan), and Matsushita Electric (Panasonic) started to become available in mid-1998. These players differed from regular DVD players with the addition of a security IC chip (powered by ARM RISC and manufactured by VLSI) that controlled the encode/decode of the digital content. Mail systems were included on some players as well. Because of widespread studio support, manufacturers anticipated that demand for the units would be high. Initially, the players were approximately twice as expensive as standard DVD players, but price reductions occurred within months of release.

==History==
===Development and launch===
DIVX was introduced on September 8, 1997 (after previously being made under the code name Zoom TV), with the format under development since 1995. The format was a partnership between Circuit City and entertainment law firm Ziffren, Brittenham, Branca &amp; Fischer, with the former company investing $100 million into the latter firm. One advertiser attempted to sign with the company, but was unable to do so, which spurred a lawsuit between the two.

The product made a quiet showing at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January 1998, but won the attention of 20th Century Fox which on February 20, 1998 signed a deal to release their titles on the format. After multiple delays, the initial trial of the DIVX format was run in the San Francisco, California and Richmond, Virginia areas starting on June 8, 1998. Initially, only a single Zenith player was available starting at $499, along with 20 to 50 titles. Very few players sold during this time period, with The Good Guys chain alleging that fewer than 10 players were sold during this time period. A nationwide rollout began three months later, on September 21, again with only one Zenith player and 150 titles available in 190 stores in the western U.S.

At the format&#x27;s launch, DIVX was sold primarily through the Circuit City, Good Guys, and Ultimate Electronics retailers. The format was promoted to consumers as an alternative to traditional video rental schemes with the promise of &quot;No returns, no late fees.&quot; Though consumers could just discard a DIVX disc after the initial viewing period, several DIVX retailers maintained DIVX recycling bins on their premises. On September 22, 1998, a fourth retailer, Canadian Future Shop, signed a contract with DIVX to stock the format, although only in 23 stores in the U.S. only. Thomson&#x27;s player, after multiple delays, arrived on October 3, 1998, followed by Panasonic&#x27;s on December 10. The format made its overall national debut on October 12, 1998. A marketing push began that November for the 1998 holiday season, with more than $1 million going into the campaign. The fortunes of the format would seemingly turn for the better in mid-December 1998, when a shortage of DVD players occurred. In total, 87,000 players were sold during the final quarter of 1998, with 535,000 discs across 300 titles being sold, although fewer than 17,000 accounts for DIVX were created.

===Opposition===
Almost immediately after the format&#x27;s reveal, a movement on the Internet was initiated against DIVX, particularly in home theater forums by existing owners of the then-still nascent DVD format. Broader groups of consumers had environmental concerns with the format, since under the advertised &quot;no returns&quot; model a disc would be discarded as waste once the initial user was done with it, rather than being reused as they were under the traditional rental model. Both companies that created the DVD format (Sony and Toshiba) also denounced DIVX, as did major studio distributor Warner Home Video (who was the first major American studio to distribute DVD) and the DVD Forum (a consortium of developers on the format who standardized DVDs). Titles in the DIVX catalog were released primarily in pan and scan format with limited special features, usually only a trailer (although a few widescreen titles did arrive on the format in early December 1998). This caused many home theater enthusiasts to become concerned that the success of DIVX would significantly diminish the release of films on the DVD format in the films&#x27; original aspect ratios and with supplementary material. Some early demos were also noted to have unique instances of artifacting on the discs that were not present on standard DVDs. Many people in various technology and entertainment communities were afraid that there would be DIVX exclusive releases, and that the then-fledgling DVD format would suffer as a result. DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures, for instance, initially released their films exclusively on the DIVX format (something that DIVX did not originally intend to happen). DIVX featured stronger encryption technology than DVD (Triple DES instead of CSS) which many studios stated was a contributing factor in the decision to support DIVX. Others cited the higher price of DIVX-compatible DVD players and rental costs as their reason for opposing the format, with one declaring DIVX as &quot;holding my VCR hostage&quot;. One online poll surveyed 786 people on the format, of which nearly 97% disapproved of the format&#x27;s concept, and another poll in December 1998 reflected 86% disapproval even if the format were free – a testament to the fierce online backlash the format received. As early as December 1997, news outlets were already calling the format a failure for Circuit City.

In addition to the hostile Internet response, competitors such as Hollywood Video ran advertisements touting the benefits of &quot;Open DVD&quot; over DIVX, with one ad in the Los Angeles Times depicting a hand holding a telephone line with the caption: &quot;Don&#x27;t let anyone feed you the line.&quot; The terminology &quot;Open DVD&quot; had been used by DVD supporters and later Sony themselves; in response to DIVX&#x27;s labeling of DVD as &quot;Basic DVD&quot; and DIVX/DVD players as &quot;DIVX-enhanced&quot;. Other retailers, such as Best Buy, also had their concerns, most of them citing possible customer confusion and cumbersomeness with the two formats. Pay-per-view companies were also concerned with the format intruding on their business sector, namely with their objective of single-use rentals of a film being offered to the consumer.

However, early concerns of alleged or feared constant usage of the phone line proved to be somewhat exaggerated, as all players needed to do was verify its usage twice a month. Despite this, informational-freedom advocates were concerned that the players&#x27; &quot;dial-home&quot; ability could be used to spy on people&#x27;s watching habits, as well as copyright and privacy concerns about its licensing of the media, with some alleging it violated fair-use laws entirely.

Allegations of anti-competitive vaporware, as well as concerns within the software industry prompted David Dranove of Northwestern University and Neil Gandal of Tel Aviv University and University of California, Berkeley, to conduct an empirical study designed to measure the effect of the DIVX announcement on the DVD market. This study suggests that the DIVX announcement slowed the adoption of DVD technology. According to Dranove and Gandal, the study suggests that the &quot;general antitrust concern about vaporware seems justified&quot;.

===Demise===
Right after the launch of the format, Circuit City announced that despite a gain of 4.1% in net profit, huge expenses of launching that format (among other issues) massively undercut that profit. As early as September 1998, Circuit City was looking for partners to share their losses from the format&#x27;s launch. Retailers such as Blockbuster Video did not carry the format at all. 

The format&#x27;s credibility suffered another blow when suspicions were raised about the nature of apparently independent pro-DIVX websites. Circuit City denied any involvement in creating these sites, one of which closed shortly after tech journalists tried to contact its webmaster.

DIVX and Thomson Consumer Electronics teamed up in January 1999 to create another format made for high-definition video using existing DVD technology, predating the development of both Blu-ray and HD DVD by many years. The market share for DIVX players was 23% in January 1999, and by that March, around 419 titles were available in the DIVX format. However, sales for the format quickly fell off after the 1998 holiday season, with all three third-party retailers pulling out of DIVX sales by that point. In May, studio support for DIVX would start to be phased out with Paramount refusing to convert their titles to &quot;Silver&quot; discs (and then later stopping DIVX releases entirely), and Disney increasing their DVD activity. By the format&#x27;s first anniversary, the future of the format was very grim - with only five DIVX-compatible players (and no DIVX-compatible computer drives), 478 titles, and only Circuit City selling DIVX discs.

The format was discontinued on June 16, 1999, because of the costs of introducing the format, as well as its very limited acceptance by the general public and retailers. At the end of the format&#x27;s life, Circuit City announced a $114 million after-tax loss, and Variety estimated the total loss on the scheme was around $337 million. Over the next two years, the DIVX system was phased out. Customers could still view all their DIVX discs and were given a $100 refund for every player that was purchased before June 16, 1999. All discs that were unsold at the end of the summer of 1999 were destroyed. The program officially cut off access to accounts on July 7, 2001. The player&#x27;s Security Module, which had an internal Real-Time Clock, ceased to allow DIVX functions after 30 days without a connection to the central system. Unsold players were liquidated in online auctions, but not before being modified to remove the DIVX Security Module. As a result, certain player models demonstrated lockups when DIVX menus were accessed.

On the company website to announce discontinuation of the product on June 16, 1999, it stated: &quot;All DIVX-featured DVD players are fully functional DVD players and will continue to operate as such. All DIVX discs, including those previously purchased by consumers and those remaining in retailer inventories, can be viewed on registered players anytime between now and June 30, 2001. Subsequent viewings also will be available during that period. Discs can no longer be upgraded to unlimited viewing, known as DIVX Silver. Customers who have converted discs to DIVX Silver can continue viewing the discs until June 30, 2001, or can receive a full refund of the conversion price at their request&quot;. This meant no DIVX discs could play any content after June 30, 2001, rendering the medium worthless.

DIVX appeared as a &quot;dishonorable mention&quot; alongside &quot;PC World&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;25 Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot; in 2006.

==Hardware==
A total of four DIVX players were released in 1998:
* Zenith DVX2100 (June 8, 1998)
* RCA RC-5230Z (October 3, 1998)
* Proscan PS8680Z (November 24, 1998)
* Panasonic DVD-X410 (December 10, 1998)

Several DIVX players from other manufacturers were announced for the year 1999, but cancelled. This includes Harman Kardon, JVC, Pioneer and Kenwood, with the latter cancelling a late 1999 to early 2000 release.

<text>Ronald Linn Rivest (;
born May 6, 1947) is an American cryptographer and computer scientist whose work has spanned the fields of algorithms and combinatorics, cryptography, machine learning, and election integrity.
He is an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
and a member of MIT&#x27;s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and its Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Along with Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, Rivest is one of the inventors of the RSA algorithm.
He is also the inventor of the symmetric key encryption algorithms RC2, RC4, and RC5, and co-inventor of RC6. (&quot;RC&quot; stands for &quot;Rivest Cipher&quot;.) He also devised the MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6 cryptographic hash functions.

==Education==
Rivest earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Yale University in 1969, and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Stanford University in 1974 for research supervised by Robert W. Floyd.

==Career==
At MIT, Rivest is a member of the Theory of Computation Group, and founder of MIT CSAIL&#x27;s Cryptography and Information Security Group.

Rivest was a founder of RSA Data Security (now merged with Security Dynamics to form RSA Security), Verisign, and of Peppercoin.

His former doctoral students include Avrim Blum, Benny Chor, Sally Goldman, Burt Kaliski, Anna Lysyanskaya, Ron Pinter, Robert Schapire, Alan Sherman,
and Mona Singh.

==Research==
Rivest is especially known for his research in cryptography. He has also made significant contributions to algorithm design, to the computational complexity of machine learning, and to election security.

===Cryptography===
The publication of the RSA cryptosystem by Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1978 revolutionized modern cryptography by providing the first usable and publicly described method for public-key cryptography. The three authors won the 2002 Turing Award, the top award in computer science, for this work. The award cited &quot;their ingenious contribution to making public-key cryptography useful in practice&quot;. The same paper that introduced this cryptosystem also introduced Alice and Bob, the fictional heroes of many subsequent cryptographic protocols. In the same year, Rivest, Adleman, and Michael Dertouzos first formulated homomorphic encryption and its applications in secure cloud computing, an idea that would not come to fruition until over 40 years later when secure homomorphic encryption algorithms were finally developed.

Rivest was one of the inventors of the GMR public signature scheme, published with Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali in 1988,
and of ring signatures, an anonymized form of group signatures invented with Shamir and Yael Tauman Kalai in 2001. He designed the MD4 and MD5 cryptographic hash functions, published in 1990 and 1992 respectively, and a sequence of symmetric key block ciphers that include RC2, RC4, RC5, and RC6.

Other contributions of Rivest to cryptography include chaffing and winnowing, the interlock protocol for authenticating anonymous key-exchange, cryptographic time capsules such as LCS35 based on anticipated improvements to computation speed through Moore&#x27;s law, key whitening and its application through the xor–encrypt–xor key mode in extending the Data Encryption Standard to DES-X, and the Peppercoin system for cryptographic micropayments.

===Algorithms===
In 1973, Rivest and his coauthors published the first selection algorithm that achieved linear time without using randomization. Their algorithm, the median of medians method, is commonly taught in algorithms courses. Rivest is also one of the two namesakes of the Floyd–Rivest algorithm, a randomized selection algorithm that achieves a near-optimal number of comparisons.

Rivest&#x27;s 1974 doctoral dissertation concerned the use of hash tables to quickly match partial words in documents; he later published this work as a journal paper. His research from this time on self-organizing lists became one of the important precursors to the development of competitive analysis for online algorithms. In the early 1980s, he also published well-cited research on two-dimensional bin packing problems, and on channel routing in VLSI design.

He is a co-author of &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; (also known as &quot;CLRS&quot;), a standard textbook on algorithms, with Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson and Clifford Stein. First published in 1990, it has extended into four editions, the latest in 2022.

===Learning===
In the problem of decision tree learning, Rivest and Laurent Hyafil proved that it is NP-complete to find a decision tree that identifies each of a collection of objects through binary-valued questions (as in the parlor game of twenty questions) and that minimizes the expected number of questions that will be asked. With Avrim Blum, Rivest also showed that even for very simple neural networks it can be NP-complete to train the network by finding weights that allow it to solve a given classification task correctly. Despite these negative results, he also found methods for efficiently inferring decision lists, decision trees, and finite automata.

===Elections===
A significant topic in Rivest&#x27;s more recent research has been election security, based on the principle of software independence: that the security of elections should be founded on physical records, so that hidden changes to software used in voting systems cannot result in undetectable changes to election outcomes. His research in this area includes improving the robustness of mix networks in this application, the 2006 invention of the ThreeBallot paper ballot based end-to-end auditable voting system (which he released into public domain in the interest of promoting democracy), and the development of the Scantegrity security system for optical scan voting systems.

He was a member of the Election Assistance Commission&#x27;s Technical Guidelines Development Committee.

==Honors and awards==
Rivest is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, and is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, the International Association for Cryptologic Research, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Together with Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, he has been awarded the 2000 IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award and the Secure Computing Lifetime Achievement Award. He also shared with them the Turing Award. Rivest has received an honorary degree (the &quot;laurea honoris causa&quot;) from the Sapienza University of Rome. In 2005, he received the MITX Lifetime Achievement Award. Rivest was named in 2007 the Marconi Fellow, and on May 29, 2008, he also gave the Chesley lecture at Carleton College. He was named an Institute Professor at MIT in June 2015.

<text>In rhetoric, a parenthesis (: parentheses; from the Ancient Greek word παρένθεσις &quot;parénthesis&quot; &#x27;injection, insertion&#x27;, literally &#x27;(a) putting in beside&#x27;) or parenthetical phrase is an explanatory or qualifying word, phrase, clause, or sentence inserted into a passage. The parenthesis could be left out and still form grammatically correct text. Parenthetical expressions are usually delimited by round brackets (also known as parentheses), square brackets, dashes, or commas. English-language style and usage guides originating in the news industry of the twentieth century, such as the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, recommend against the use of square brackets for parenthesis and other purposes, because &quot;They cannot be transmitted over news wires.&quot; Usage of parentheses goes back (at least) to the 15th century in English legal documents.

==Examples==
;Billy-bob, a great singer, was not a good dancer.:The phrase &quot;a great singer&quot;, set off by commas, is both an appositive and a parenthesis.
;A dog (not a cat) is an animal that barks.:The phrase &quot;not a cat&quot; is a parenthesis.
;My umbrella (which is somewhat broken) can still shield the two of us from the rain.:The phrase &quot;which is somewhat broken&quot; is a parenthesis.
;Please, Gerald, come here!: &quot;Gerald&quot; is both a noun of direct address and a parenthesis.
;People who eat broccoli are typically healthier—and happier—than people who don&#x27;t.: The phrase &quot;and happier&quot;, set off by dashes, is a parenthesis.

==Types==
The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:
*Introductory phrase: &quot;Once upon a time&quot;, my father ate a muffin.
*Interjection: My father ate the muffin, &quot;gosh damn it&quot;!
*Aside: My father, &quot;if you don&#x27;t mind me telling you this&quot;, ate the muffin.
*Appositive: My father, &quot;a jaded and bitter man&quot;, ate the muffin.
*Absolute phrase: My father, &quot;his eyes flashing with rage&quot;, ate the muffin.
*Free modifier: My father, &quot;chewing with unbridled fury&quot;, ate the muffin.
*Resumptive modifier: My father ate the muffin, &quot;a muffin which no man had yet chewed&quot;.
*Summative modifier: My father ate the muffin, &quot;a feat which no man had attempted&quot;.

Within each example sentence, the parenthetical phrase is the portion that is displayed in an &quot;italic font&quot;. It is called a &quot;parenthetical&quot; phrase even when it is not delimited by any brackets (such as round -- [or square] -- brackets).

<doc id="68062" wikidata="Q7312050" url="?curid=68062" title="Remodernism">
<text>Remodernism is an artistic and philosophical movement aimed at reviving aspects of modernism, particularly in its early form, in a manner that both follows after and contrasts against postmodernism. The movement was initiated in 2000 by stuckists Billy Childish and Charles Thomson, with a manifesto, &quot;Remodernism&quot; in an attempt to introduce a period of new &quot;spirituality&quot; into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in Albuquerque was accompanied by an essay from University of California, Berkeley art professor, Kevin Radley. Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.

In 2006, the Stedelijk Museum and the University of Amsterdam held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as authenticity, self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
 In 2008, London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three Turner Prize nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.

==History==
=== Origins and 2000 manifesto ===
Charles Thomson and Billy Childish, the founders of the stuckism art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism. Their &quot;Remodernism&quot; manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled &quot;towards a new spirituality in art&quot;. Its premise is that the potential of the modernist vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges formalism.

It has a short introduction, summing up: &quot;Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern .&quot; This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the &quot;brainless destruction of convention.&quot; Point 7 states:

Point 9 states: &quot;Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity&#x27;s quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists.&quot; Point 12 links its use of the word &quot;God&quot; to enthusiasm—from the Greek root &quot;en theos&quot; (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, &quot;It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry,&quot; and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because &quot;there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism&#x27;s mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now.&quot;

Childish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, who replied, &quot;You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto &quot;Remodernism&quot;.&quot;

=== Exhibitions (2000 – 2009) ===
In March 2000 the Stuckists declared themselves to be the first remodernist art group at a show &quot;The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota&quot;. In April, remodernism was quoted in &quot;The Gulf News&quot; (UAE). In May &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper announced a stuckist show: &quot;As the founding group of a self-named art movement called Remodernism, they stand on an art ticket that&#x27;s against clever conceptualism and in favour of a more emotional and spiritual integrity in art via figurative painting.&quot;

In June, Thomson and Childish gave a talk on stuckism and remodernism at the Salon des Arts, Kensington, promoted by the Institute of Ideas. The same month the &quot;Students for Stuckism&quot; also gave &quot;a Remodernist show and talk&quot;. The Institute of Remodernism was founded by Khatereh Ahmadi.

In 2001, Thomson stood in the UK general election, stating, &quot;The Stuckist Party aims to bring the ideas of Stuckism and Remodernism into the political arena.&quot;

In January 2002, Magnifico Arts presented a show ReMo: ReModernism of graduate students from the University of New Mexico. At an artists&#x27; talk, Kevin Radley, an art professor at the University of California, Berkeley said, &quot;Remodernism isn&#x27;t about going backwards, but about surging forward.&quot; In an essay that accompanied the exhibition, Radley wrote:
The show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said:
In 2003, an independent group, the Stuckist Photographers, was founded by Andy Bullock and Larry Dunstan with a statement of endorsement for remodernism.

In 2004, the Defastenists, a new group of creatives in Ireland, declared themselves remodernist. A Remodernist art gallery, The Deatrick Gallery was founded in Louisville, Kentucky.
American film makers/photographers Jesse Richards and Harris Smith co-founded a new group remodernist film and photography with an emphasis on emotional meaning and characterised by elements of new-wave, no-wave, expressionist and transcendental film-making.

Stuckist artist Bill Lewis, interviewed by the BBC at the 2004 Liverpool Biennial, said that remodernism was &quot;not a movement as such&quot;, but a return to the start of modernism in order to move forward with an art for a new paradigm. To &quot;&quot; is to go &quot;back to the root again, starting with painting ... and see where it goes&quot;. He said that this had been called reactionary, but it was radical &quot;in the true sense of the word&quot;. New York stuckist artist, Terry Marks said that remodernism posited that modernism had started in a good direction, but veered from that into &quot;pure idea&quot; and that it was necessary to return to the starting point to take an as-yet unexplored alternative direction: &quot;to pursue art-making that&#x27;s more concrete and accessible to more people, and find out where that leads us&quot;.

In 2004, Luke Heighton wrote in &quot;The Future&quot; magazine, &quot;Remodernism, it seems, is here to stay whether we like it or not.&quot; Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand declared 2004 &quot;a good year for remodernism—for having the gall to suggest that artists can have souls&quot;.

In August 2005 an art show &quot;Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism&quot; (a title taken from a line in the stuckist remodernism manifesto) was held at CBGBs 313 gallery in New York City. Artist and blogger Mark Vallen said, &quot;In the mid-1970s punk rock was born in a dank little New York nightclub called CBGB&#x27;s. It all started when rockers like Television, the Ramones and Patti Smith launched a frontal assault on the monolith of corporate rock &#x27;n roll. Now another artistic revolt, Remodernism, is about to widen its offensive from the birthplace of punk.&quot;

On 10 May 2006, the Stedelijk Museum and the University of Amsterdam staged a talk on remodernism by Daniel Birnbaum, contributing editor of &quot;Artforum&quot;, and Alison Gingeras, Assistant Curator, Guggenheim Museum. The summary is:
In 2006, artist Matt Bray said, &quot;I do not wish to be considered a Stuckist, as I find some of there (sic) antics unnecessary. The Stuckists are however the first and most famous Remodernist group, so for that, and for bringing this particular manifesto to my attention; I thank them.&quot; In May 2007, with punk singer Adam Bray, he created the Mad Monk Collective in Folkestone, England, to promote remodernism.

In January 2008, London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; critic, Ben Lewis, said the year would see &quot;the invention of a new word to describe the modernist revival: &#x27;remodernism,&#x27;&quot; which he applied later in the year to Turner Prize nominees Mark Leckey, Runa Islam and Goshka Macuga, as &quot;part of a whole movement reviving early 20th-century formalism&quot;, praising Macuga for her &quot;heartfelt, modest and generous-spirited aesthetic&quot;, of which he said there was more needed today. In April 2009, he described Catalina Niculescu, a Romanian artist using &quot;nostalgic&quot; 16mm film, as among a significant trend in art of fetishising the offcuts of modernism: &quot;Let&#x27;s call it Remodernism.&quot;

On 27 August 2008, Jesse Richards published a &quot;Remodernist Film Manifesto&quot;, calling for a &quot;new spirituality in cinema&quot;, use of intuition in filmmaking, as well as describing the remodernist film as being a &quot;stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking&quot;. The manifesto criticizes Stanley Kubrick, filmmakers who use digital video, and Dogme 95. Point 4 says: 

In 2009, Nick Christos and other students from Florida Atlantic University founded the Miami Stuckists group. Christos said,

<doc id="68064" wikidata="Q158148" url="?curid=68064" title="Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia">
<text>Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia (Tatiana Nikolaevna Romanova; ; – 17 July 1918) was the second daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, the last monarch of Russia, and of Tsarina Alexandra. She was born at Peterhof Palace, near Saint Petersburg.

Tatiana was the younger sister of Grand Duchess Olga and the elder sister of Grand Duchess Maria, Grand Duchess Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei. She was considered to be the most beautiful of all her sisters and the most aristocratic in appearance. She was known amongst her siblings as &quot;the governess&quot; for her domineering but also maternal ways. Tatiana was the closest of all the children to her mother (Tsarina Alexandra), often spending many hours reading to her. During World War I, she chaired many charitable committees and (along with her older sister, Grand Duchess Olga) trained to become a nurse. She tended to wounded soldiers on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo from 1914 to 1917. Her time as a nurse came to an end with her family&#x27;s arrest in 1917 after the first Russian Revolution.

Her murder by Communist revolutionaries on 17 July 1918 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. Tatiana and all her siblings were soon rumored to have survived the murder, and dozens of impostors claimed to be surviving Romanovs; author Michael Occleshaw speculated that a woman named Larissa Tudor might have been Tatiana. However, the deaths of all the last Tsar&#x27;s family, including Tatiana, at the hands of Bolsheviks have since been established by scientific evidence.

==Appearance and personality==
Tatiana was a famous beauty. She was tall, slender, and elegant. She had dark auburn hair, gray eyes, and fine features. Many viewed her as the most beautiful of the four grand duchesses and the one who resembled their mother most. Her mother&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden reflected that &quot;Tatiana was, to my mind, prettier than her sisters. She was taller than her mother, but so thin and so well built that her height was not a hindrance to her attractiveness. She had beautiful, regular features, and resembled some of the famous beauties among her royal relatives, whose family portraits decorated the walls of the palace.. She had dark hair, a rather pale complexion, and wide-apart eyes, that gave her a poetic far-away look.&quot; General Count Alexander Grabbe, Major-General of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Convoy, wrote that &quot;the prettiest of the Grand Duchesses was Tatiana, the Tsar&#x27;s second daughter. In her physical appearance and her serious and ardent nature, she most resembled her mother. Slender with auburn hair and clear gray eyes, she was strikingly good looking and enjoyed the attention her beauty commanded.&quot; According to Anna Vyrubova, &quot;when Tatiana grew up, she was the tallest and most graceful of all the Grand Duchesses, beautiful and romantic. Many officers fell in love with Tatiana, but there were no appropriate suitors for her.&quot; Meriel Buchanan described her beauty as &quot;almost mystical.&quot; Alexander Mossolov, head of the Imperial Chancellery, wrote that Tatiana was &quot;the best-looking of all the sisters.&quot; Her paternal aunt Xenia said that &quot;Tatiana and her mother are like as two peas in a pod!... so pretty.&quot; Her nanny Margaretta Eagar wrote that she was &quot;a very pretty child, remarkably like her mother, but delicate in appearance.&quot; In 1900, the British magazine, &quot;Woman at Home&quot;, wrote that &quot;the flower of the flock, as far as looks are concerned ... is Grand Duchess Tatiana.&quot; Nicholas wrote that Tatiana was &quot;a very beautiful child&quot; and he often remarked that she reminded him of Alexandra. When she was 8, her tutor Pierre Gilliard said that she &quot;was prettier than her sister.&quot;

Despite her high status, Tatiana did not use her Imperial title and her friends, family, and servants called her by her first name and patronym, Tatiana Nikolaevna. The only nicknames that can be found for her using primary sources are &#x27;Tanechka&#x27; in a postcard from her cousin Princess Irina Alexandrovna, and &#x27;Tan&#x27;ka&#x27; in some notes from her sister, Anastasia Nikolaevna. According to one story, Tatiana kicked her lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden for addressing her as &quot;Your Imperial Highness&quot; during a committee meeting, and she hissed, &quot;Are you crazy to speak to me like that?&quot; When she was 14, Tatiana called Chebotareva at her home on the telephone, and she spoke first to Chebotareva&#x27;s 16-year-old son. Unaware of her identity, Gregory asked her to identify herself. She replied, &quot;Tatiana Nikolaevna&quot;. He could not believe that he was speaking to a grand duchess, and he repeated his question. Again, Tatiana did not claim the imperial title of Grand Duchess and replied that she was &quot;Sister Romanova the Second&quot;.

Tatiana was a practical, nurturing leader. Her sisters gave her the nickname &quot;The Governess&quot; and sent her as their group representative when they wanted their parents to grant a favour. Olga was 18 months older than Tatiana, but she uncomplainingly allowed Tatiana to be the leader of their group. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden recalled that &quot;It was Tatiana Nicolaevna who took care of the little ones, and who was a constant help to the Household, always willing to help them in arranging that their official duties should not clash with their private engagements.&quot; 
Gilliard wrote that Tatiana was reserved and &quot;well balanced&quot; but less open and spontaneous than Olga. She was less naturally intelligent than Olga, but she was more hard-working and dedicated. Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky, the family&#x27;s guard at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk, claimed that Tatiana &quot;had no liking for art&quot; and that &quot;it would have been better for her had she been a man.&quot;

Tatiana was interested in fashion. According to Sophie Buxhoeveden, &quot;Tatiana Nicolaevna loved dress. Any frock, no matter how old, looked well on her. She knew how to put on her clothes, was admired and liked admiration.&quot; Her mother&#x27;s friend Anna Vyrubova wrote that Tatiana was talented in embroidery and crocheting and that she could dress her mother&#x27;s hair as well as a professional hair stylist. Sophie Buxhoeveden remembered that Tatiana once dressed her hair when her hairdresser was unavailable.

Tatiana was the most sociable of the four sisters. According to Sophie Buxhoeveden, &quot;friends would have been welcome, but no young girls were ever asked to the Palace.&quot; Vyrubova noted that Tatiana was the most famous of the sisters in their lifetimes because of her vivacious personality and sense of duty. Vyrubova and Lili Dehn claimed that Tatiana longed for friends of her own age but that her high rank and her mother&#x27;s distaste for society restricted her social life.

Like her mother, Tatiana was deeply religious. She read her Bible frequently, studied theology, and struggled with the meaning of &quot;good and evil, sorrow and forgiveness, and man&#x27;s destiny on earth&quot;. She decided that &quot;one has to struggle much because the return for good is evil, and evil reigns.&quot; A.A. Mosolov claimed that Tatiana&#x27;s reserved nature gave her a &quot;difficult&quot; character with more spiritual depth than that of her sister, Olga. Her English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, claimed that Tatiana viewed religion as a duty rather than a passion.

Only her closest friends and family were aware of her introspective side. &quot;With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent,&quot; Dehn recalled. &quot;She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers.&quot; Chebotareva loved the &quot;sweet&quot; Tatiana as if she were her daughter, and she claimed that Tatiana would hold her hand when she was nervous. &quot;I am so terribly embarrassed and frightened – I do not know whom I greeted and whom not,&quot; Tatiana told Chebotareva.

Like her sisters, Tatiana was unworldly and naive. When she was young, she was shocked to learn that her governess Margaretta Eagar was paid for taking care of her. When Eagar told her that &quot;you have seen me get my money every month,&quot; Tatiana replied that &quot;I always thought it was a present to you.&quot; When her lady-in-waiting sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went into one of the stores. The shopkeepers did not recognize them because they wore nurses&#x27; uniforms. They left the shop without buying anything, because they didn&#x27;t carry money with them and had no idea how to use it. The next day, they asked Chebotareva how to use money.

French tutor Pierre Gilliard wrote that Tatiana and Olga were &quot;passionately devoted to one another.&quot;

Tatiana was closer to her mother than any of her sisters, and many considered her to be Alexandra&#x27;s favorite daughter. &quot;It was not that her sisters loved their mother any less,&quot; recalled her French tutor Pierre Gilliard, &quot;but Tatiana knew how to surround her with unwearying attentions and never gave way to her own capricious impulses.&quot; On 13 March 1916, Alexandra wrote to Nicholas that Tatiana was the only one of their four daughters who &quot;grasped it&quot; when she explained her way of looking at things. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden wrote that Tatiana &quot;was closest in sympathy to her mother&quot; and &quot;the definite favorite of both her parents.&quot;

Tatiana was close to her father. Lili Dehn wrote that &quot;the Emperor loved her devotedly [and] they had much in common.&quot; She recalled that &quot;the sisters used to laugh, and say that, if a favour were required, &quot;Tatiana must ask Papa to grant it.&quot;&quot;

==Early life==
Tatiana was born on 10 June 1897. She was the second child and daughter of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra. She weighed 3.9 kg at birth, and Dr. Ott used forceps in her birth. When she regained consciousness from the chloroform used during the delivery, Alexandra saw the &quot;anxious and troubled faces&quot; around her and wept: &quot;My God, it is again a daughter. What will the nation say, what will the nation say?&quot; Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich wrote that &quot;everyone was very disappointed as they had been hoping for a son.&quot; Grand Duke George Alexandrovich, Nicholas&#x27; younger brother, told Nicholas &quot;I was already preparing to go into retirement, but it was not to be.&quot; Under the Pauline Laws, the Imperial throne of Russia could not pass to a woman unless all legitimate male lines died out. As such, Nicholas&#x27; heir was his brother George unless he had a son. Grand Duchess Tatiana&#x27;s siblings were Grand Duchesses Olga, Maria, Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. All of the children were close to one another and to their parents up until the end of their lives.

On 29 May 1897, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia recorded in his diary that Nicholas II had named Tatiana as an homage to the heroine in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s novel in verse &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. According to him, he wanted to name his daughter after Olga and Tatiana, the sisters in the famous poem.
Tatiana&#x27;s title was &quot;Grand Princess&quot;, but it was translated from Russian into English as &quot;Grand Duchess&quot;. As an &quot;imperial highness&quot;, she outranked the other European princesses, who were merely &quot;royal highnesses&quot;.

Like the other Romanov children, Tatiana was raised with austerity. She and her sisters slept on camp beds without pillows, took cold baths in the morning, and embroidered and knitted projects to be given as gifts or sold at charity bazaars.

In their household, Tatiana and Olga were known as &quot;The Big Pair&quot;. They shared a bedroom and were very close to each another from early childhood. In the spring of 1901, Olga had typhoid fever and was confined to the nursery for several weeks. When she began to recover, Tatiana was permitted to see her older sister for five minutes but didn&#x27;t recognize her. When her governess, Margaretta Eagar, told her that the sickly child was Olga, four-year-old Tatiana cried bitterly and protested that the pale, thin child couldn&#x27;t be her beloved older sister. Eagar had difficulty persuading Tatiana that Olga would recover.

==Relationship with Grigori Rasputin==
Tatiana doted on her younger brother, Tsarevich Alexei. However, the long-awaited heir had frequent, severe attacks of hemophilia. Tatiana, her mother, and her three sisters were all potential carriers of the hemophilia gene; the Tsarina was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who had passed down the hemophilia gene to her descendants. Tatiana&#x27;s paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia reported that Maria, Tatiana&#x27;s younger sister, hemorrhaged during an operation to remove her tonsils in December 1914. The operating doctor was so alarmed that the Tsarina needed to urge him to continue. Olga Alexandrovna claimed that all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and that they were carriers of the hemophilia gene. Symptomatic carriers of the gene are not hemophiliacs, but they can have symptoms of hemophilia, including an abnormally low blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding.

The Tsarina relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering &quot;starets&quot; or &quot;holy man&quot;, and she credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich. Tatiana and her siblings viewed Rasputin as &quot;Our Friend&quot; and confided in him. In the autumn of 1907, Tatiana&#x27;s father escorted his sister, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, to the nursery so that she could too meet Rasputin. Tatiana and her siblings all wore their long white nightgowns, and they were comfortable in Rasputin&#x27;s presence. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the Imperial children a telegram, advising them to &quot;Love the whole of God&#x27;s nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.&quot; In one letter, 11-year-old Tatiana asked Rasputin to visit her and lamented that she found it difficult to see her mother ill. &quot;But you know because you know everything,&quot; she wrote.

Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, one of the sisters&#x27; governesses, was horrified that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when they were in their nightgowns and requested that he be banned from the household. She told Grand Duchess Xenia that he visited Olga and Tatiana before them, spoke to them, and &quot;caressed&quot; them. The sisters hid Rasputin&#x27;s presence from Tyutcheva, and they were afraid to talk to their governess about him. Tatiana was aware of the tension and feared her mother&#x27;s reaction to Tyutcheva&#x27;s actions. On 8 March 1910, the 12-year-old Tatiana wrote to her mother, &quot;I am so afr(aid) that S.I. can speak ... about our friend something bad. I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.&quot; Alexandra dismissed Tyutcheva.

All accounts agree that Rasputin had an innocent relationship with the children, but Nicholas did ask Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. Grand Duchess Xenia was horrified by Tyutcheva&#x27;s story. On 15 March 1910, she wrote in her diary that she could not understand why her brother and his family regarded Rasputin, whom she saw as only a &quot;khlyst&quot;, as &quot;almost a saint&quot;.

Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, initially thought well of Rasputin, but she became disillusioned with him. In the spring of 1910, she claimed that Rasputin raped her, but the Tsarina refused to believe her because she saw Rasputin as holy. The Tsarina insisted to Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna that she had investigated Vishnyakova&#x27;s claim but that &quot;they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.&quot; In 1913, the Tsarina dismissed Vishnyakova.

There were malicious rumors that Rasputin had seduced the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses. Rasputin had released the letters that the Tsarina and the grand duchesses had sent to him; although they were innocent in nature, they fueled the rumors about his alleged affairs. Pornographic cartoons depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the Tsarina and her four daughters as Anna Vyrubova stood nude in the background. Much to the Tsarina&#x27;s displeasure, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Imperial family&#x27;s association with Rasputin continued until his murder in 1916. On 6 December 1916, the Tsarina wrote to Nicholas that &quot;Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy &#x27;courses&#x27; for their age and their souls have much developed.&quot;

Allegedly, Tatiana was present at the site of Rasputin&#x27;s murder, &quot;disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her&quot;. Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador to Russia, wrote that Tatiana had witnessed Rasputin&#x27;s castration, but he doubted the credibility of the rumor.

In his memoirs, A.A. Mordvinov reported that all four grand duchesses were &quot;cold and visibly terribly upset&quot; by Rasputin&#x27;s death. According to him, they sat &quot;huddled up closely together&quot; on a sofa when they received the news. He wrote that they seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. On 21 December 1916, Tatiana attended Rasputin&#x27;s funeral. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by Tatiana, her mother and her sisters.

Tatiana kept a notebook in which she recorded Rasputin&#x27;s sayings: &quot;Love is Light and it has no end. Love is great suffering. It cannot eat, it cannot sleep. It is mixed with sin in equal parts. And yet it is better to love. In love one can be mistaken, and through suffering he expiates for his mistakes. If love is strong—the lovers happy. Nature herself and the Lord give them happiness. One must ask the Lord that he teach to love the luminous, bright, so that love be not torment, but joy. Love pure, Love luminous is the Sun. The Sun makes us warm, and Love caresses. All is in Love, and even a bullet cannot strike Love down.&quot;

==Young adulthood and World War I==

As a young teenager, Tatiana was given the rank of honorary colonel and assigned a regiment of soldiers, the Vosnesensky (Ascension) Lancers. She and Olga inspected the soldiers regularly.

Tatiana enjoyed the company of soldiers, but she was often shocked by their behavior. On 11 July 1911, a group of officers aboard the Imperial yacht gave Olga a portrait of Michelangelo&#x27;s nude David, cut out from a newspaper. Indignant, the 14-year-old Tatiana wrote to her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, &quot;Olga laughed at it long and hard. And not one of the officers wishes to confess that he has done it. Such swine, aren&#x27;t they?&quot;

On 14 July 1911, Tatiana laughed at her distant cousin Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia&#x27;s engagement to Helen of Serbia. On 14 July 1911, she wrote to Olga, &quot;How funny if they might have children, can (she) be kissing him? What foul, fie!&quot;

In 1911, Tatiana and Olga witnessed the assassination of the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. On 10 September 1911, Nicholas later wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, that the event had upset both girls. Tatiana sobbed and both of them had trouble sleeping that night.

When World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse with her mother and Olga. They cared for wounded soldiers in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, &quot;Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases.&quot; Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. &quot;Why can you breathe carbolic acid and I can&#x27;t?&quot; she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee called the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was fiercely patriotic. On 29 October 1914, she apologized to her mother for disparaging the German in her presence; she explained that she thought of her mother as only Russian and that she had forgotten that the Tsarina was born in Germany. The Tsarina responded that she was offended by the Russian people&#x27;s gossip about her German connections because she considered herself as completely Russian.

On 15 August 1915, Tatiana wrote to her mother that she wished she could do more to support Russia during the war: &quot;I simply can&#x27;t tell you how awfully sorry I am for you, my beloved ones. I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I&#x27;m not a man.&quot; As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she undertook more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees.

===Romances with soldiers===

When she was 13, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her to leave her bed so that she could watch a soldier, with whom she was infatuated. On 20 April 1911, she wrote to the Tsarina, &quot;I would like so much to go the review of the second division as I am also the second daughter and Olga was at the first so now it is my turn...Yes, Mama, and at the second division I will see whom I &quot;must&quot; see ... you know whom ...&quot;.

In the December 2004 edition of the magazine &quot;Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record&quot;, Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914. De Malama claimed that Dmitri was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo, where he developed a romantic relationship with Tatiana. In September 1914, Dmitri gave Tatiana a French bulldog, which she named &quot;Ortipo&quot;. On 30 September 1914, she wrote to her mother, &quot;Forgive me about the little dog. To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything.&quot; When Ortipo died, Dmitri gave her another puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died with the rest of the family. Eighteen months after he gave Ortipo to Tatiana, Dmitri paid the Imperial family a visit. On 17 March 1916, the Tsarina wrote to Nicholas that &quot;my little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!&quot; In August 1919, Malama was killed while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.
According to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, Tatiana was fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared for when he was wounded in 1915 and 1916. She claimed that Tatiana sat beside &quot;Volodia&quot; at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked to her in a low voice. She claimed that Tatiana and Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. She feared that the grand duchesses&#x27; flirtations with the wounded officers would damage their reputations.

===Negotiations for marriage===
Allegedly, the Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for his younger son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić delivered a letter to Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but he noticed that the Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during family dinners on his recent trips to St. Petersburg. There were also reports that the Windsors wanted to marry her to the Prince of Wales, with the future Edward VIII insisting he was impressed by her beauty and the way she tended to her younger brother. She was too young for her parents to seriously consider her marriage when potential suitors first surfaced, and negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I.

==Captivity==

The family was arrested during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and imprisoned first at Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg, Siberia. The drastic change in circumstances and the uncertainty of captivity took its toll on Tatiana as well as on the rest of her family. &quot;She pines without work,&quot; wrote her fellow nurse Valentina Chebotareva after receiving a letter from Tatiana on 16 April 1917. &quot;It is strange to sit in the morning at home, to be in good health and not to go to the change of bandages!&quot; Tatiana wrote Chebotareva. Tatiana, apparently trying to advocate for her mother, asked her friend Margarita Khitrovo in a letter on 8 May 1917 why their fellow nurses did not write to Tsarina Alexandra directly. Chebotareva wrote in her journal that, while she pitied the family, she could not write directly to the Tsarina because she blamed her for the Revolution. &quot;If anyone wishes to write us, let them write directly,&quot; Tatiana wrote to &quot;my dear dove&quot; Chebotareva on 9 December 1917, after expressing concern for fellow nurses and a patient they had once treated together. Chebotareva&#x27;s son, Gregory P. Tschebotarioff, noted the grand duchess&#x27;s &quot;firm, energetic handwriting&quot; and how the letter &quot;reflected the nature which endeared her so much to my mother.&quot;

Tatiana&#x27;s English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, recalled that Tatiana had grown razor thin in captivity and seemed &quot;haughtier&quot; and more inscrutable to him than ever. In April 1918 the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria to Yekaterinburg. The remaining children remained behind in Tobolsk because Alexei, who had had another attack of haemophilia, could not be moved. It was Tatiana who persuaded her mother to &quot;stop tormenting herself&quot; and make a decision to go with her father and leave Alexei behind. Alexandra decided that level-headed Tatiana must be left behind to manage the household and look after Alexei.

During the month of separation from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Yekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Anna Demidova to Alexandra Tegleva gave the instructions on how to deal with the &#x27;medicines&#x27;, a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.

Pierre Gilliard later recalled his last sight of the imperial children at Yekaterinburg. &quot;The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ...&quot;

==Death==

At Yekaterinburg, Tatiana occasionally joined her younger sisters in chatting with some of the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, &quot;pale as death&quot;, and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She &quot;would be pleasant to the guards if she thought they were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner,&quot; recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family. She also spent a great deal of time sitting with her mother and ill brother, reading to her mother or playing games to occupy the time. At the Ipatiev House, Tatiana and her sisters were required to do their own laundry and make bread. Her nursing skills were called upon at the end of June 1918 when she gave an injection of morphine to Dr. Eugene Botkin to ease his kidney pain.

On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Tatiana and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead. The final entry in Tatiana&#x27;s final notebook at Yekaterinburg was a saying she had copied from the words of a well-known Russian Orthodox holy man, Father Ioann of Kronstadt: &quot;Your grief is indescribable, the Savior&#x27;s grief in the Gardens of Gethsemane for the world&#x27;s sins is immeasurable, join your grief to his, in it you will find consolation.&quot; The following day, on 15 July, Tatiana and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren&#x27;t looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was &quot;tumbled and disorderly&quot;. They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Tatiana sat with her mother and read from the Biblical Books of Amos and Obadiah, Alexandra noted in her diary. Later, mother and daughter sat and just talked. As the family was having dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family&#x27;s kitchen boy and Alexei&#x27;s playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him along with the rest of the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev&#x27;s absence. Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky&#x27;s office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated her by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.

Late that night, on the night of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms carrying pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to get out of this place.&quot; They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional photographer, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son&#x27;s left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar&#x27;s right, Tatiana and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard&#x27;s rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky&#x27;s command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.

The initial round of gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress&#x27; maidservant, Demidova. At that point the gunmen had to leave the room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had released from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy&#x27;s clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy&#x27;s head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room&#x27;s rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her in the back of her head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.

==Romanov graves and DNA proof==
For decades, conspiracy theorists suggested that one or more of the family somehow survived the slaughter. The theories were reduced in scale, but still persisted, when the bodies of most of the family were found and identified from a mass grave discovered in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. The remaining conspiracies hinged on the fact that two bodies were missing, Tsarevich Alexei and one of the four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. For example, author Michael Occleshaw made the claim in his 1995 book &quot;The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor&quot; that Tatiana might have been rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on studying the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discounted this claim and continued to say that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Yekaterinburg.

On 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky&#x27;s memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of twelve and fifteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years old. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and their brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassinations. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found &quot;shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber.&quot; The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes.

Preliminary testing indicated a &quot;high degree of probability&quot; that the remains belonged to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on 22 January 2008. On 30 April 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing proved that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters. With this result, all of the Tsar&#x27;s family are accounted for.

==Sainthood==


In 1981 Tatiana and her family were canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. In 2000, Tatiana and her family were canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church as a passion bearer.

The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years to the day after they were murdered.

<text>John Barrymore (born John Sidney Blyth; February 14 or 15, 1882 – May 29, 1942) was an American actor on stage, screen, and radio. A member of the Drew and Barrymore theatrical families, he initially tried to avoid the stage, and briefly attempted a career as an artist, but appeared on stage together with his father Maurice in 1900, and then his sister Ethel the following year. He began his career in 1903 and first gained attention as a stage actor in light comedy, then high drama, culminating in productions of &quot;Justice&quot; (1916), &quot;Richard III&quot; (1920), and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1922); his portrayal of Hamlet led to him being called the &quot;greatest living American tragedian&quot;.

After a success as &quot;Hamlet&quot; in London in 1925, Barrymore left the stage for 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, he was well received in such pictures as &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1920), &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Sea Beast&quot; (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and four of his works, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932), &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933), &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (1934), and &quot;Midnight&quot; (1939), have been inducted into the National Film Registry.

Barrymore&#x27;s personal life has been the subject of much attention before and since his death. He struggled with alcohol abuse from the age of 14, was married and divorced four times, and declared bankruptcy later in life. Much of his later work involved self-parody and the portrayal of drunken has-beens. His obituary in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed that &quot;with the passing of the years – and as his private life became more public – he became, despite his genius in the theater, a tabloid character.&quot; Although film historians have opined that Barrymore&#x27;s &quot;contribution to the art of cinematic acting began to fade&quot; after the mid-1930s, Barrymore&#x27;s biographer, Martin Norden, considers him to be &quot;perhaps the most influential and idolized actor of his day&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1882–1903===
Barrymore was born John Sidney Blyth in the Philadelphia home of his maternal grandmother Louisa Lane Drew and was known by family, friends and colleagues as &quot;Jack&quot;. Although the Barrymore family Bible puts his date of birth as February 15, 1882, his birth certificate shows February 14. He was the youngest of three children. His siblings were Lionel (1878–1954), and Ethel (1879–1959). His father was Maurice Barrymore, an Indian-born British actor who had been born Herbert Blyth, and had adopted &quot;Barrymore&quot; as a stage name after seeing it on a poster in the Haymarket Theatre in London. Barrymore&#x27;s mother, Georgie Drew Barrymore, was born into a prominent theatrical family. His maternal grandparents were Louisa Lane Drew, a well-known 19th-century American actress and the manager of the Arch Street Theatre, and John Drew, also an actor whose specialty was comedy. Barrymore&#x27;s maternal uncles were two more thespians, John Drew Jr. and Sidney.

Much of Barrymore&#x27;s early life was unsettled. In October 1882, the family toured in the US for a season with Polish actress Helena Modjeska. The following year his parents toured again with Modjeska but left the children behind. Modjeska was influential in the family, and she insisted that all three children be baptized into the Catholic Church. In 1884 the family traveled to London as part of Augustin Daly&#x27;s theatrical company, returning to the US two years later. As a child, Barrymore was sometimes badly behaved, and he was sent away to schools in an attempt to instill discipline. The strategy was not always successful, and he attended elementary schools in four states. He was sent first to the boys&#x27; annex of the Convent of Notre Dame in Philadelphia. One punishment that he received there was being made to read a copy of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;; he later recounted that, as he looked at the illustrations by Gustave Doré, &quot;my interest was aroused, and a new urge was born within me. I wanted to be an artist&quot;. He was expelled from the school in 1891 and was sent to Seton Hall Preparatory School in New Jersey, where Lionel was already studying. Barrymore was unhappy at Seton and was soon withdrawn, after which he attended several public schools in New York, including the Mount Pleasant Military Academy.

In 1892, his grandmother Louisa Drew&#x27;s business began to suffer, and she lost control of her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from tuberculosis; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he barely knew her, and he was mostly raised by his grandmother. The loss of their mother&#x27;s income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore&#x27;s father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at The Lambs, a New York actors&#x27; club.

In 1895, Barrymore entered Georgetown Preparatory School, then located on Georgetown University Campus, but he was expelled in November 1897, probably after being caught waiting in a brothel. One of his biographers, Michael A. Morrison, posits the alternate theory that Barrymore was expelled after the staff saw him inebriated. By the time he left Georgetown he was, according to Martin Norden in his biography of Barrymore, &quot;already in the early stages of a chronic drinking problem&quot;. In 1897, (by fifteen years old), it was an emotionally challenging year for Barrymore: he was molested by his step-mother, Mamie Floyd, and in August his grandmother, the main female role model in his life, died.

Barrymore traveled with his father to England in 1898, where he joined King&#x27;s College School, Wimbledon. A year later he joined the Slade School of Fine Art, to study literature and art. After a year of formal study, he left and &quot;devoted much of his subsequent stay in London to bohemianism and nocturnal adventures&quot;, according to family biographer Margot Peters. Barrymore returned to New York in the summer of 1900, and by November he found work as an illustrator on &quot;The New York Evening Journal&quot;, at a salary of $50 a week.
Barrymore had always professed a dislike of the acting profession, but in 1900 he was persuaded by his father to join him on stage for a few performances of a short play, &quot;A Man of the World&quot; which his father had produced in Fort Lee, New Jersey near his home in town. He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, rather than as a possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in &quot;Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines&quot; when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped in the middle of his dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, &quot;I&#x27;ve blown up. Where do we go from here?&quot;, which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.

An incident in 1901 had a major impact on Barrymore. In March, his father had a mental breakdown as a result of tertiary syphilis, and Barrymore, after a discussion with Ethel and gaining a court petition, took him to Bellevue Hospital. Maurice was later transferred to a private institution in Amityville, Long Island, where he suffered a &quot;rapid descent into madness&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopedia of World Biography&quot; states that Barrymore was constantly &quot;haunted by the bright and dark spell of his father&quot;, and his close friend Gene Fowler reported that &quot;the bleak overtone of this breaking of his parents&#x27; reason never quite died away in Barrymore&#x27;s mind, and he was haunted by fears he would suffer the same fate&quot;. The same year, Barrymore began an affair with a beautiful artists&#x27; model, &quot;&quot;Florodora&quot; girl&quot; and aspiring actress named Evelyn Nesbit, who was a mistress of architect Stanford White. Barrymore later described Nesbit as &quot;the most maddening woman. ... She was the first woman I ever loved&quot;, and he proposed marriage to her. Nesbit&#x27;s mother did not think that, as a struggling artist, Barrymore was a good match for her daughter. To break off their relationship her mother sent Nesbit away to school in New Jersey. In 1906, White was shot in public by Nesbit&#x27;s then-husband, Pittsburgh millionaire Harry K. Thaw. Barrymore expected to testify at Thaw&#x27;s murder trial on the issue of Nesbit&#x27;s morality; he worried that he might be asked whether he had arranged for Nesbit to have an abortion, disguised as an appendectomy, even though Nesbit had undergone two previous &quot;appendectomies&quot;. Barrymore was never called as a witness because Thaw pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

In May 1902, Barrymore was fired from his newspaper position after producing a poor illustration for the paper while hung over. He spent time as a poster designer but realized it was not lucrative enough for his lifestyle, which was being partly financed by Ethel, who was also paying for their father&#x27;s care. While discussing his future with his brother, Barrymore said &quot;it looks as though I&#x27;ll have to succumb to the family curse, acting&quot;, and he later admitted that &quot;there isn&#x27;t any romance about how I went on stage. ... I needed the money.&quot;
===Early stage career: 1903–1913===
Barrymore began to contact his family&#x27;s theatrical connections to find work and approached Charles Frohman, who had been the producer of &quot;Captain Jinks&quot; and had also been an employer of Barrymore&#x27;s mother Georgie a decade earlier. Frohman thought that Barrymore had comedic potential but needed more experience before making a Broadway debut. Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew&#x27;s father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in &quot;Magda&quot;, and in November when the troupe produced &quot;Leah the Forsaken&quot;, he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.

A year later Barrymore appeared in his first Broadway production, in a small role in the comedy &quot;Glad of It&quot;, which only had a short run. Afterwards he played the role of Charles Hyne in the farce &quot;The Dictator&quot; at the Criterion Theatre, which starred William Collier. During the play&#x27;s run and subsequent tour across the US, Collier became a mentor to the young actor, although his patience was continually tested by Barrymore&#x27;s drinking, which led to occasional missed performances, drunken stage appearances, and general misbehavior. Collier taught Barrymore much about acting, including coaching him in comic timing, but &quot;at times regretted his sponsorship&quot; of his apprentice. In March 1905, while &quot;The Dictator&quot; was playing in Buffalo, Barrymore&#x27;s father died in Amityville and was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Philadelphia. At the close of the US tour, &quot;The Dictator&quot; visited Britain from April 1905, where it played at the Comedy Theatre. The critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote that Barrymore &quot;admirably seconded&quot; Collier.

When he returned to America, Barrymore appeared at the Criterion Theatre in a double bill of works by J. M. Barrie; he played a clown in &quot;Pantaloon&quot; opposite his brother, and Stephen Rollo in &quot;Alice Sit-by-the-Fire&quot; opposite his sister. Both plays ran for 81 performances from December 1905, and then went on tour. Barrymore continued drinking and lacked discipline, which affected his performances. Ethel was angry with her brother and had the producers fire him from the show, but re-hire him the following day, to teach him a lesson. After a tour of the US and Australia with Collier in &quot;On the Quiet&quot; and &quot;The Dictator&quot;, Barrymore joined his sister in the 1907 comedy &quot;His Excellency the Governor&quot; at the Empire Theatre. He received mixed reviews for his performances, and &quot;The Wichita Daily Eagle&quot; commented that &quot;Barrymore seems to imitate John Drew too much ever to be a good actor. Why doesn&#x27;t young Barrymore imitate a real actor if he must copy someone.&quot;
Barrymore gained his first leading role in early 1907, in the comedy &quot;The Boys of Company B&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre. Although he was well received by the critics – &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that &quot;his work has been pronounced astonishingly clever by the critics wherever he played&quot; – at times he continued his unprofessional stage behavior, which led to a rebuke from John Drew, who attended a performance. After a short run in &quot;Toddles&quot; at the Garrick Theatre, Barrymore was given the lead role of Mac in &quot;A Stubborn Cinderella&quot;, both on tour and at the Broadway Theatre in Boston. He had previously been earning $50 a week during his sporadic employment but now enjoyed a wage increase to $175. He briefly appeared in &quot;The Candy Shop&quot; in mid-1909, before he played the lead role in Winchell Smith&#x27;s play &quot;The Fortune Hunter&quot; at the Gaiety Theatre in September the same year. It was his longest-held role, running for 345 performances until May 1911, initially at the Gaiety Theatre in New York, and then on tour. The critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought the play was, &quot;acted with fine comedy spirit by John Barrymore ... [who] gave indisputable signs last night of grown and growing powers.&quot;

In mid-1910 Barrymore met socialite Katherine Corri Harris, and the couple married in September that year. Harris&#x27; father objected to the relationship and refused to attend the wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, &quot;The Dictator&quot; went on tour, and Harris was given a small role in the play. According to Peters, Barrymore &quot;began to think of his marriage as a &#x27;bus accident. Film critic Hollis Alpert wrote that, within a week of the wedding, Katherine was complaining that she saw her new husband too infrequently. Barrymore&#x27;s increasing dependence on alcohol was also a cause of marital problems, and he explained that &quot;unhappiness increased the drink, and drink increased the unhappiness&quot;.
Barrymore&#x27;s next two plays – &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; and &quot;Princess Zim-Zim&quot;, both from 1911 – were critically and commercially weak, but the second work introduced him to playwright Edward Sheldon, who would &quot;reshape ... [Barrymore&#x27;s] entire career&quot;. In January 1912, Barrymore appeared together with his sister in &quot;A Slice of Life&quot; at the Empire Theatre on Broadway, which ran for 48 performances. Charles Darnton, a critic for &quot;The Evening World&quot;, observed that &quot;Barrymore takes delight in &#x27;kidding&#x27; his part not only to the limit, but perhaps beyond&quot;. A review in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; stated that &quot;Barrymore inimitably imitates his uncle John Drew&quot;.

Barrymore may have appeared in his first films in 1912. In four short films, a cast member is listed as &quot;Jack Barrymore&quot;; this is probably John Barrymore, although Norden notes that &quot;we may never know for certain if [these] are in fact Barrymore movies.&quot; The four films were &quot;Dream of a Motion Picture Director&quot;, &quot;The Widow Casey&#x27;s Return&quot;, &quot;A Prize Package&quot; (all 1912) and &quot;One on Romance&quot; (1913). The films were produced by the Philadelphia-based Lubin Manufacturing Company and were lost in an explosion and fire at the Lubin vaults in 1914.

In July 1912, Barrymore went to Los Angeles, where he appeared in three short-running plays at the Belasco Theatre. He returned to New York in October, where he took the lead role in 72 performances of the comedy &quot;The Affairs of Anatol&quot; at the Little Theatre. Although the critical response was lukewarm, Barrymore&#x27;s salary for the play was $600 a week. He began the following year by appearing in a short run of &quot;A Thief for a Night&quot; in McVicker&#x27;s Theatre, Chicago, before returning to New York, and the Thirty-Ninth St. Theatre, for a two-month run in &quot;Believe Me Xantippe&quot;.

===Entry into motion pictures, and theatrical triumphs: 1913–1924===
In late 1913, Barrymore made his first confirmed feature film, the romantic comedy &quot;An American Citizen&quot;, with Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Famous Players Film Company. When the film was released in January 1914, Barrymore &quot;delighted movie audiences with an inimitable light touch that made a conventional romance &#x27;joyous&#x27;,&quot; writes Peters. A reviewer for &quot;The Oregon Daily Journal&quot; thought that Barrymore gave a &quot;portrayal of unusual quality&quot;. The success of the picture led to further film work, including &quot;The Man from Mexico&quot; (1914), &quot;Are You a Mason?&quot;, &quot;The Dictator&quot; and &quot;The Incorrigible Dukane&quot; (all 1915). Except for &quot;The Incorrigible Dukane&quot;, all of these early films are presumed lost.

Despite the film work and the higher fees he earned from it, Barrymore continued to seek stage work, and in January 1914 he played the lead in &quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot; at New York&#x27;s Eltinge Theatre. The role marked a departure from the light comedy of his previous performances, a result of Sheldon urging him to turn towards more dramatic parts. &quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot; was not the breakthrough that Barrymore wanted. A few months before the outbreak of World War I, he took a vacation to Italy with Sheldon to enjoy a temporary break from his worsening marriage. He returned from Italy and accepted another serious stage role, that of an ex-convict in &quot;Kick In&quot;, at New York&#x27;s Longacre Theatre. The play was a success, and Barrymore received praise from the critics; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer thought that in a play that had &quot;uncommonly able and sincere playing&quot;, Barrymore acted his role with &quot;intelligence and vigor and impart[ed] to it a deal of charm&quot;.

Barrymore spent the second half of 1915 making three films, including &quot;The Red Widow&quot;, which he called &quot;the worst film I ever made&quot; in his 1926 autobiography. In April 1916, he starred in John Galsworthy&#x27;s prison drama &quot;Justice&quot;, again at the instigation of Sheldon. The play was a critical success, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought the audience saw &quot;Barrymore play as he had never played before, and so, by his work as the wretched prisoner in &quot;Justice&quot;, step forward into a new position on the American stage.&quot; The critic went on to say that Barrymore gave &quot;an extraordinary performance in every detail of appearance and manner, in every note of deep feeling ... a superb performance.&quot;
From early 1916, Barrymore had been living apart from Katherine, and she sued for divorce in November 1916. By the time the divorce was finalized in December 1917, he had taken the lead role in the film &quot;Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman&quot;. He had also tried to enlist in the U.S. Army following the country&#x27;s entry into World War I, but Army doctors discovered that he had varicose veins, and he was not accepted for military service. For over a year beginning in April 1917, he appeared together with Lionel in a stage version of George du Maurier&#x27;s 1891 novel &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot;. The play and the two Barrymores were warmly regarded by the critics. Around this time, Barrymore began a relationship with a married mother of two, Blanche Oelrichs, a suffragist from an elite Rhode Island family with what Peters calls &quot;anarchistic self-confidence&quot;. Oelrichs also published poetry under the name Michael Strange. While their relationship began in secret, it became more open after Oelrichs&#x27; husband was commissioned into the army and then posted to France.

Both Oelrichs and Sheldon urged Barrymore to take on his next role, Fedya Vasilyevich Protasov, in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s play &quot;Redemption&quot; at the Plymouth Theatre. The critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that, although Barrymore&#x27;s performance was &quot;marred by vocal monotony&quot;, overall the performance was &quot;a distinct step forward in Mr. Barrymore&#x27;s artistic development ... There is probably not another actor on our stage who has a temperament so fine and spiritual, an art so flexible and sure.&quot; In 1918, Barrymore starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;On the Quiet&quot;; the &quot;Iowa City Press-Citizen&quot; considered the film superior to the original Broadway performance.
In 1919, Barrymore portrayed a struggling lawyer in the film adaptation of the Broadway show &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot;, which he followed with &quot;The Test of Honor&quot;. The latter film marked his first straight dramatic role on screen after years of performing in comedy dramas. Later that year, when Barrymore again appeared on stage with Lionel in Sem Benelli&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The Jest&quot;, audience members &quot;agree[d] that the American stage had never witnessed finer acting&quot;, according to Peters. Alexander Woollcott, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, thought that &quot;John and Lionel Barrymore hold spellbound each breathless audience&quot;, and he commented that Barrymore &quot;contributes to that appeal by every step, every hand, every posture of a body grown unexpectedly eloquent in recent years&quot;. 

In November, Barrymore began filming &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, playing the dual leading role, and the film was released in theaters the following year. &quot;Wid&#x27;s Daily&quot; thought that &quot;it is the star&#x27;s picture from the very outset, and it is the star that makes it&quot;, going on to say that Barrymore&#x27;s portrayal was &quot;a thing of fine shadows and violent emotions&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was in agreement, and considered the performance to be &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, and &quot;a remarkable piece of work&quot;. The film was so successful that the US Navy used stills of Barrymore in its recruiting posters.

After planning for over a year – largely in secret – Barrymore played his first Shakespeare part, the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot;. Conscious of the criticism of his vocal range, he underwent training with Margaret Carrington, the voice and diction trainer, to ensure he sounded right for the part, and the pair worked together daily for up to six hours a day for six weeks. After the debut in March 1920, the critics were effusive in their praise. The &quot;Washington Herald&quot; observed that the audience were &quot;held by the sheer power of Barrymore&#x27;s performance&quot;, which was &quot;remarkable for ... [the actor&#x27;s] unexpected vocal richness&quot;, while Woollcott, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, thought the performance &quot;marked a measurable advance in the gradual process of bringing [Barrymore&#x27;s] technical fluency abreast with his winged imagination and his real genius for the theatre&quot;.
Although a commercial and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in &quot;Redemption&quot; he had worked ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, and by the time he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father&#x27;s friend, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore&#x27;s child, and a quick divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for &quot;Clair de Lune&quot;, which his wife had adapted from Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1869 novel &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;. Barrymore persuaded Ethel to play the role of the Queen – it was the first time the two had appeared on stage together in over a decade. The play was a critical flop, although the presence of the siblings ensured that it ran for over 60 performances.

In 1921, Barrymore portrayed a wealthy Frenchman in New York in the film &quot;The Lotus Eater&quot;, with Colleen Moore. In September, Barrymore and Oelrichs went to Europe on holiday; cracks were appearing in their relationship, and she fell in love with a poet during their extended stay in Venice. In October, Oelrichs returned to New York and Barrymore traveled to London to film the exterior scenes for his latest movie, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, in which he played the title role. He then returned to New York to work on the film&#x27;s interior scenes in January 1922. Barrymore became involved in the pre-production work for the film and provided designs for Moriarty&#x27;s lair. The film was released later that year and was generally thought &quot;a little dull and ponderous, with too many intertitles&quot;, although James W. Dean of &quot;The Evening News&quot; of Harrisburg opined that &quot;the personality of Barrymore is the film&#x27;s transcendent quality&quot;.
Barrymore decided next to star in &quot;Hamlet&quot; on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They spent six months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as &quot;a man&#x27;s man&quot;, according to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a &quot;normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him ... he was a great fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can you make a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?&quot; Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16, 1922. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, opined that it was &quot;an evening that will be memorable in the history of the American theater&quot;. while John Corbin, the drama critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, agreed, writing that &quot;in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;Brooklyn Life&quot; stated that Barrymore had &quot;doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian&quot;. In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as &quot;not so much princely – he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous&quot;.

Barrymore and Hopkins decided to end the run at 101 performances, just breaking the record of one hundred by Edwin Booth, before the play closed in February 1923. In November and December that year, a three-week run of the play was staged at the Manhattan Opera House, followed by a brief tour that closed at the end of January 1924.

===Films with the major studios: 1924–1932===
News of Barrymore&#x27;s success in &quot;Hamlet&quot; piqued the interest of Warner Bros., which signed him as the lead in the 1924 film &quot;Beau Brummel&quot;. Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore – aged 40 at the time – sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname &quot;the Great Profile&quot;, as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: &quot;The right side of my face looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that are to be found in almost any normal anthropological specimen, and those are the apples I try to keep on top of the barrel.&quot;
In February 1925, Barrymore staged &quot;Hamlet&quot; in London at the Haymarket Theatre, which the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; later said had &quot;the most memorable first night for years&quot;. The reviews were positive, and &quot;although none of the London critics found Barrymore superior to [Henry] Irving and [Johnston] Forbes-Robertson, many were favorable in their comparisons&quot;. Among the audience members was the 20-year-old actor John Gielgud, who wrote in his program &quot;Barrymore is romantic in appearance and naturally gifted with grace, looks and a capacity to wear period clothes, which makes his brilliantly intellectual performance classical without being unduly severe, and he has tenderness, remoteness, and neurosis all placed with great delicacy and used with immense effectiveness and admirable judgment&quot;. Looking back in the 1970s, he said: &quot;The handsome middle-aged stars of the Edwardian theatre romanticised the part. Even John Barrymore, whose Hamlet I admired very much, cut the play outrageously so that he could, for instance, play the closet scene all out for sentiment with the emphasis on the &#x27;Oedipus complex&#x27; – sobbing on Gertrude&#x27;s bosom. Yet Barrymore ... had a wonderful edge and a demonic sense of humour.&quot;

At the end of this run of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Barrymore traveled to Paris, where Oelrichs had stayed during his residence in London, but the reunion was not a happy one and the couple argued frequently. When he returned to America, she remained in Paris, and the couple drew up a separation agreement that provided Oelrichs with $18,000 a year and stated that neither could sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery. While he had been in London, Warner Bros and Barrymore entered into a contact for three further films at a salary of $76,250 per picture. He later claimed that his motivation for moving from stage to films was the &quot;lack of repetition—the continual playing of a part, which is so ruinous to an actor, is entirely eliminated&quot;.
Barrymore&#x27;s first film under the contract was &quot;The Sea Beast&quot; (1926), loosely based on the 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, in which he played Captain Ahab Ceeley. This was one of the biggest money-makers of the year for Warner Bros. Although Barrymore wanted Astor to play the female lead, she was unavailable, and Dolores Costello was cast in her place. He later said that &quot;I fell in love with her instantly. This time I knew I was right&quot;, and the couple began an affair. Costello&#x27;s father was angered by the relationship, but his complaints were ignored by both Costello and her mother: Costello&#x27;s parents separated and were divorced as a result. The film was well received by critics, and Mordaunt Hall, the film critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the &quot;energy, earnestness and virility&quot; Barrymore displayed in the role of Ceeley.

As filming finished on &quot;The Sea Beast&quot;, work began on &quot;Don Juan&quot;, the first feature-length film with synchronized Vitaphone sound effects and a musical soundtrack. Although Barrymore wanted to play opposite Costello again, Jack L. Warner, the film&#x27;s producer, signed Astor. After completing his Warner Bros. contract with &quot;When a Man Loves&quot;, with Costello, Barrymore joined United Artists (UA) under a three-film deal. For the next three years, according to Morrison, he &quot;enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and spent lavishly&quot;. Nevertheless, he received some harsh reviews. Critic and essayist Stark Young wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that Barrymore&#x27;s films were &quot;rotten, vulgar, empty, in bad taste, dishonest, noisome with a silly and unwholesome exhibitionism, and odious with a kind of stale and degenerate studio adolescence. Their appeal is cheap, cynical and specious&quot;.

In 1927, Barrymore planned to revive &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl, but in August he canceled the production, without explanation, and began filming the third of the UA pictures, &quot;Eternal Love&quot;, for which he was paid $150,000. In February 1928, Barrymore obtained a quiet divorce from Oelrichs; she eagerly agreed to the separation, as she was in a relationship with a lawyer, Harrison Tweed, whom she later married. Barrymore and Costello married in November that year; their daughter, Dolores, was born in April 1930 and a son, John Drew Barrymore, followed in June 1932. Barrymore purchased and converted an estate in the Hollywood Hills into 16 different buildings with 55 rooms, gardens, skeet ranges, swimming pools, fountains and a totem pole.
By the late 1920s, sound films had become common, following the 1927 sensation, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. Actors with trained voices were in demand by the studios, and Barrymore was offered a five-film deal with Warner Bros. at $150,000 per picture, and a share of the profits. Before he began this contract, he played his first speaking role on film: a one-off section in &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929), playing Richard, Duke of Gloucester in &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;. His first two films under contract were &quot;General Crack&quot; and &quot;The Man from Blankley&#x27;s&quot;, each of which were modestly successful. As he had been frustrated at the inability of making &quot;The Sea Beast&quot; as a sound film, Barrymore returned to &quot;Moby Dick&quot; as the source for a 1930 film of the same name. Peters thinks little of the film, describing it as &quot;a seesaw between the cosmic and the comic, a travesty of Melville as well as a silly film all on its own&quot;.

The following year, Barrymore played the title role of a manipulative voice coach in &quot;Svengali&quot;, opposite Marian Marsh. Martin Dickstein, the critic for the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, wrote that Barrymore &quot;registers a personal triumph in the role&quot;, calling his performance &quot;brilliant ... one of the best of his movie career&quot;. Later in 1931, he played a crippled puppeteer, who tries to fulfill his frustrated ambitions by manipulating the life of a young male ballet dancer and the dancer&#x27;s lover (also Marsh) in &quot;The Mad Genius&quot;; the film was a commercial failure. With disappointing box office returns from their five-film deal, Warner Bros. decided not to offer Barrymore a contract renewal. Instead, Barrymore signed a non-exclusive contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and took a $25,000 salary cut per film.

===Years of transition: 1932–1936===
Barrymore&#x27;s first film for MGM was the 1932 mystery &quot;Arsène Lupin&quot;, in which he co-starred with his brother Lionel. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hall called Barrymore&#x27;s performance &quot;admirable&quot; and wrote that &quot;it is a pleasure to see [him] again in something in a lighter vein.&quot; The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore&#x27;s acting was divided; John Gilbert&#x27;s biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming &quot;more like ... [Garbo&#x27;s] affectionate father than her lover&quot;, while George Blaisdell of &quot;International Photographer&quot; praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be &quot;deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking.&quot; &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the National Film Registry.
In 1932, Barrymore went to RKO Pictures where he played a borderline-alcoholic lawyer in &quot;State&#x27;s Attorney&quot;, and an escaped lunatic in &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot;, opposite Katharine Hepburn in her screen debut. Film scholar Daniel Bernardi later noted the humanism demonstrated between Barrymore&#x27;s character and his family, particularly the &quot;close bond&quot; between father and daughter. In his final film of the year, he returned to MGM for &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot;, Barrymore, Ethel and Lionel co-starred. Physically, Barrymore had deteriorated since filming &quot;Svengali&quot;, and he had gained weight because of his drinking. Peters notes the &quot;dissipation of the once ascetic face, a dissipation only underlined by the studio&#x27;s attempt to reconstruct with lights, filters and make-up a spiritual beauty that had been corrupted.&quot; The film was a critical and commercial failure, and MGM lost significant amounts of money. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; thought the three Barrymores had produced their worst work.

The year 1933 was a busy one for Barrymore, and his decline began to be evident. He appeared in five films during the year, including as a meek schoolteacher-turned-businessman in &quot;Topaze&quot;, opposite Myrna Loy, and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, with Lionel. Peters opines that Barrymore&#x27;s portrayal of a washed-up alcoholic actor &quot;could well have fixed ... in the public&#x27;s and MGM&#x27;s mind that John Barrymore was a drunken has-been.&quot; After the run of films with MGM, the company ended its contact with Barrymore amid its financial woes caused by the Great Depression. He then signed with Universal Studios to portray a troubled Jewish lawyer in &quot;Counsellor at Law&quot;. During filming he struggled to remember his lines for even small scenes. Filming was stopped on one occasion after more than 25 takes when he struggled to recall the right lines; it was a problem with which he began to suffer regularly. Despite the problems, Norden believes that this was &quot;one of his best film performances&quot;.
In December 1933, Barrymore agreed with RKO to film &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He underwent screen tests and hired Carrington to act as vocal coach again, but during one session, his memory failed him again, and the project was eventually scrapped. Barrymore starred in two films released in 1934, the drama &quot;Long Lost Father&quot; and the screwball comedy &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;. In the latter film, Barrymore played madcap Broadway impresario Oscar Jaffe, a role in which he demonstrated a &quot;rare genius as a comedian&quot;. Morrison writes that the portrayal was one &quot;that many consider to be his finest contribution to film&quot;. In 2011, the picture was added to the National Film Registry, where it was described as Barrymore&#x27;s &quot;last great film role&quot;.

In May 1934, Barrymore was filming &quot;Hat, Coat and Glove&quot; for RKO when, during the filming of one scene, he again forgot his lines and even the name of his character. Filming was postponed until the following day, but the result was the same. After he took a break for a few days, he returned to the set, but he still could not remember any of the script, and RKO replaced him with Ricardo Cortez. Soon afterwards, he suffered a mental and physical breakdown and was hospitalized. Costello confirmed that his drinking over the previous two years had worsened, and she described him as a &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot;. Barrymore&#x27;s relationship with Costello was deeply troubled and, believing she was going to declare him mentally incompetent, he left their home in Los Angeles and traveled first to London and then to India. He returned to the U.S. in early 1935 and settled in New York, leaving his wife in Los Angeles. Shortly after his return, he was hospitalized for a month with bronchitis and influenza. A 19-year-old fan, Elaine Jacobs, visited him, and the two became good friends. On his release from the hospital, her mother invited him to recuperate at their house. She changed her name to Elaine Barrie, which she explained was to get &quot;as near to Barrymore as I dared&quot;, and they began a relationship. In May, the couple underwent the first of several professional collaborations, when they appeared on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; radio show. Costello filed for a divorce from Barrymore on May 25, 1935, citing mental cruelty, habitual intemperance, and desertion.

The new relationship was widely reported in the tabloid press, who labeled the couple Caliban and Ariel. After a series of arguments with Barrie, Barrymore considered the relationship with Barrie to be at an end, and he left for Los Angeles. A newspaper editor chartered a plane and flew Barrie to Chicago, to meet Barrymore&#x27;s train; she broadcast a plea for him to return, and her pursuit became national news. Costello&#x27;s divorce from Barrymore became final in October 1935. Morrison thinks that the headlines established a new reputation for Barrymore of &quot;the aging satyr, the has-been alcoholic, the much-married ham&quot;. This was a blow to his self-respect, but he faced his troubles &quot;with aplomb and a sense of humor&quot;, according to Morrison. To escape from the spotlight, Barrymore took vacations on his yacht, &quot;Infanta&quot;; it cost him over $35,000 a year to run, and so he sold it in 1938 after encountering financial difficulties.

===Decline and death: 1936–1942===

Barrymore&#x27;s alcohol dependence meant most studios were unwilling to employ him, but MGM risked casting him in the role of Mercutio in their 1936 film &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley&#x27;s Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that &quot;he was drinking and unreliable on the set ... It was sad to see him in such a state.&quot; Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the &quot;Hollywood Spectator&quot;, thought &quot;Barrymore is an acting gem&quot;, although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that &quot;Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should really have been shot.&quot;

Word about Barrymore&#x27;s problems on and off the set spread around the industry, and he did not work on another film for over a year until he had a supporting role in the musical film &quot;Maytime&quot;. His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterward, and he again spent time in Kelley&#x27;s Rest Home and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When he came out, he collapsed on the &quot;Maytime&quot; set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.

Barrymore decided to work on more Shakespeare roles. In June 1937, he signed with NBC Radio to produce a series of six episodes under the name &quot;Streamlined Shakespeare&quot;, which also featured Barrie. The first program was &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which was well received by critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s lines uttered dramatically by the voice of John Barrymore sweep through the &#x27;ether&#x27; with a sound of finality; it seems that they are his words and no one else could speak them with such lifelike force&quot;. Peters disagrees however, and considers that &quot;because he was desperate he pressed too hard and ended by caricaturing, not capturing, his great Shakespearean acting&quot;.
Throughout the NBC series, Barrymore had been reliable, sober, and responsible, and the studios reacted positively with offers of work. This led to appearances in nine films in 1937 and 1938, including as Colonel Nielson in three Bulldog Drummond films, and roles in &quot;True Confession&quot; and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;. He was offered predominantly supporting roles, but he worked conscientiously on the films and as a result was able to honor his debts. His memory was still problematic, and he used cue cards as an aid; his fellow actors and the directors of the films were sympathetic to his condition. When he filmed his last serious role, Gregory Vance in the 1939 film &quot;The Great Man Votes&quot;, the director, Garson Kanin, ensured that the cast and crew addressed him as &quot;Mr. Barrymore&quot; as a mark of respect.
Barrymore and his wife both appeared in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy &quot;Midnight&quot;, her only film role. &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought the film was &quot;one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season&quot; and that Barrymore, &quot;the [Lou] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect&quot;. The film was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore and his wife appeared together in the stage farce &quot;My Dear Children&quot;, which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University&#x27;s McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. 

Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;People flock to see [Barrymore], not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight [drunk]. Usually he forgets his lines. But he always puts on a great show.&quot; When the show reached Broadway, &quot;Life&quot; wrote that &quot;Barrymore&#x27;s return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph&quot;. Brooks Atkinson, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought Barrymore was &quot;still the most gifted actor in this country. ... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody&#x27;s fool in &quot;My Dear Children&quot; but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday.&quot; Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play&#x27;s run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.

In 1940, Barrymore appeared in &quot;The Great Profile&quot;, a spoof of his life in the months prior to &quot;My Dear Children&quot;. Barrymore played Evans Garrick, closely modeled on his own experience, and Mary Beth Hughes played his wife. The critics reacted harshly to the film, and to Barrymore&#x27;s association with it. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;As a play it is a feeble thing, hardly matching the spectacular public accounts of his amours ... for all of Mr. Barrymore&#x27;s shenanigans and devastating wit, &quot;The Great Profile&quot; is more than a little pathetic. In the Winter of his Discontent Mr. Barrymore is selling his talent at cut-rate&quot;. Worse was to come in his final film, &quot;Playmates&quot; (1941), which &quot;amply illustrated the depths to which he had fallen; he played an alcoholic Shakespearean ham named John Barrymore&quot;.

In October 1940, Barrymore returned to the NBC Radio network to work on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s show, now called the &quot;Sealtest Show&quot;. Barrymore recorded 74 episodes of the program, continuing in the vein of self-parody, with jokes about his drinking, declining career, and marital issues. On May 19, 1942, while recording a line from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for the show, Barrymore collapsed. He was taken to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and died there on May 29, from cirrhosis of the liver and kidney failure, complicated by pneumonia. 

Shortly before his death, Barrymore returned to his childhood Catholic faith. Although Errol Flynn&#x27;s memoirs claim film director Raoul Walsh &quot;borrowed&quot; Barrymore&#x27;s body before burial to leave his corpse propped in a chair for a drunken Flynn to discover when he returned home, Gene Fowler, a close friend of Barrymore, stayed with the body all night and denied the story. However, in a 2020 interview for the YouTube series &quot;Hot Ones&quot;, John&#x27;s granddaughter Drew Barrymore claimed the Flynn account was accurate. Barrymore was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles on June 2. In 1980, Barrymore&#x27;s son had his father&#x27;s body reinterred in the family plot in Philadelphia&#x27;s Mount Vernon Cemetery.

==Legacy==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary stated that during the period when Barrymore performed in &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the actor &quot;was accepted by most critics as the foremost English-speaking actor of his time ... equipped both by nature and by art.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; agreed, noting that during his stage triumphs and early years in film, &quot;he was the great profile, the darling of the &#x27;royal family&#x27; of the stage.&quot; Many of the obituaries made the point that Barrymore fell short of his potential. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; thought that he &quot;might with some self-discipline have added his name to the list of truly great actors ... yet he dissipated his energies&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that he could twist his abilities &quot;to parody, burlesque himself and play the clown&quot;, and they considered that it was &quot;unfortunate that the public in recent years saw him in ... [that] mood. It was a mood of careless abdication&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed that &quot;with the passing of the years – and as his private life became more public – he became, despite his genius in the theater, a tabloid character.&quot;

According to Morrison, Barrymore&#x27;s stage portrayals of &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; were a model for modern performances of these roles. His interpretation along psychological lines was innovative, and his &quot;dynamic portrayals ... changed the direction of subsequent revivals.&quot; Barrymore&#x27;s natural acting style reversed the stage conventions of the time; his &quot;&#x27;colloquial&#x27; verse speaking introduced to the stage the vocal manner of a postwar gentleman.&quot;
Barrymore, while alive, was honored on few occasions by the entertainment industry and its members. Although both his brother and sister won Academy Awards, the only award Barrymore ever received for his screen work was from Rudolph Valentino in 1925 for &quot;Beau Brummel&quot;. Valentino created an award in his own name and felt that his fellow actors should receive accolades for their screen work. When Barrymore attended his ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in 1940, he left more than the customary hand and footprints in the theater&#x27;s forecourt: aided by the owner, Sid Grauman, Barrymore left a cement imprint of his facial profile. In February 1960, for his contribution to the motion picture industry, Barrymore was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a star at 6667 Hollywood Boulevard; Barrymore, along with his two siblings, is included in the American Theater Hall of Fame. The Barrymore &quot;Royal Family&quot; of actors continued through two of his children – his son with Costello, John Drew Barrymore and his daughter with Oelrichs, Diana – both of whom became actors, as did John Jr.&#x27;s daughter Drew. Barrymore&#x27;s brother Lionel died on November 15, 1954, and their sister Ethel died on June 18, 1959.
Barrymore&#x27;s achievements and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, &quot;Confessions of an Actor&quot;. Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, authorized by the subject, &quot;John Barrymore: The Legend and the Man&quot;; Fowler, wrote &quot;Good Night, Sweet Prince: The Life and Times of John Barrymore&quot; (1943); Alpert published &quot;The Barrymores&quot; (1964); and John Kobler wrote &quot;Damned in Paradise: The Life of John Barrymore&quot; (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 that many of these earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters&#x27; 1990 history, &quot;The House of Barrymore&quot;, and his own study of the actor&#x27;s work in &quot;John Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography&quot; (1995). Subsequent to Norden&#x27;s comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed &quot;John Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor&quot; in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore&#x27;s stage work.

There were several celebratory events in 1982, on the centenary of Barrymore&#x27;s birth. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Museum of Modern Art jointly hosted a commemorative program of his work, which included numerous excerpts from his films and interviews with some who knew him, including Barrie and his one-time co-star Myrna Loy. The same year, in celebration of the centenary of the Actors Fund of America, the US Postal Service issued a postage stamp featuring Barrymore and his siblings. In February 2010, an intersection in Fort Lee, New Jersey, was renamed John Barrymore Way on what would have been the actor&#x27;s 128th birthday. The intersection marked the spot of the former Buckheister&#x27;s Hotel, where Barrymore had his 1900 stage debut in &quot;A Man of the World&quot;.

Barrymore has been used as the inspiration for characters on stage and film. He performed as himself in a number of works (including &quot;The Great Profile&quot;, &quot;My Dear Children&quot; and &quot;Playmates&quot;), and in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; of 1921 he was played by his friend W. C. Fields. In 1927 the Barrymore family was parodied in &quot;The Royal Family&quot; in which a character based on him was portrayed by Fredric March, whose performance Barrymore admired. The play was staged in London in 1934 as &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;, with Laurence Olivier in the Barrymore role, and adapted as a film in 1930, with March reprising his performance.

In 1991, Paul Rudnick&#x27;s comedy &quot;I Hate Hamlet&quot;, performed at the Walter Kerr Theatre, was set in Barrymore&#x27;s former apartment. He returns after a séance, dressed in his &quot;Hamlet&quot; costume. Nicol Williamson played the Barrymore role. Three years later, a London production, &quot;Jack: A Night on the Town with John Barrymore&quot;, ran for 60 performances at the Criterion Theatre, and Williamson again played the lead. &quot;Barrymore&quot;, a two-person play by William Luce, premiered in 1996 and depicts Barrymore shortly before his death in 1942 as he is rehearsing a revival of his Richard III. Christopher Plummer played the title role. A film version was released in 2011, with Plummer again taking the main role.

Barrymore had been a friend and drinking companion of Fields. In the 1976 film &quot;W.C. Fields and Me&quot;, Barrymore was played by Jack Cassidy. Barrymore&#x27;s friend, Errol Flynn, played him in a 1958 film &quot;Too Much, Too Soon&quot;, an adaptation of the autobiography of Diana Barrymore, with Dorothy Malone playing the female lead. Howard Thompson, the film critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;Flynn, as the late John Barrymore, a moody, wild-drinking ruin of a great actor, steals the picture, lock, stock and keg. It is only in the scenes of his savage disintegration, as the horrified girl hangs on, that the picture approaches real tragedy.&quot;

<doc id="68066" wikidata="Q1134410" url="?curid=68066" title="Northern League (baseball, 1993–2010)">
<text>The Northern League was an independent minor professional baseball league. It was not affiliated with Major League Baseball or the organized minor leagues. The league was founded in 1993 and folded after its 2010 season when financial stability became a problem. The three teams remaining in the league when it folded joined with the remaining teams in United League Baseball and the Golden Baseball League to form a new independent organization called the North American League.

==History==
The modern Northern League was founded by Miles Wolff. Wolff started the league after many midwestern cities contacted him (through his affiliation with &quot;Baseball America&quot;) asking how they could get a minor league team. After visiting some of them, most notably Duluth, Minnesota, and its Wade Stadium, he began contacting potential owners to start the league. The league was structured to where teams were not allowed to load their rosters with ex-pros. Players with five or more years of professional experience were labeled &quot;veterans&quot; and teams could carry no more than four. At least the same number of &quot;rookies&quot; (players with less than a year of experience) had to be on a team&#x27;s roster. The rest of the roster was made up of &quot;limited service&quot; or &quot;LS&quot; players, each having a number from 1 through 5 attached to the LS depending on how long they had been in pro baseball.

The league began in 1993 with six teams: Duluth–Superior Dukes (Duluth, Minnesota), Rochester Aces (Rochester, Minnesota), St. Paul Saints (St. Paul, Minnesota), Sioux Falls Canaries (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), Sioux City Explorers (Sioux City, Iowa) and Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks (Thunder Bay, Ontario). The prospects for the league were originally &quot;cloudy.&quot; Many forecast an early demise especially in St. Paul where competition with the Minnesota Twins led many local sportswriters to consider it a &quot;beer league.&quot; The league, however, was a relatively moderate success, with only the Rochester franchise struggling to draw crowds to their games. The first league title was won by St. Paul. After the season, the Aces were sold to an ownership group led by future Winnipeg, Manitoba mayor Sam Katz and the team relocated to the city and became known as the Winnipeg Goldeyes, taking the name of the Winnipeg team that played in the original Northern League. The Goldeyes won the league championship in their first season in the new city.

The first wave of expansion to the league came in 1996 as the Northern League entered Wisconsin and North Dakota. The Madison Black Wolf, based in the capital of Wisconsin, and Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, based in Fargo, North Dakota, but named for the metropolitan area that includes Moorhead, Minnesota, joined the league. The second wave of expansion came in 1999. First, the Whiskey Jacks left Canada and moved to Schaumburg, Illinois, where they became known as the Schaumburg Flyers. The bigger news, however, was that the Northeast League, an independent league in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states also founded by Wolff, would merge with the Northern League and become the Northern League&#x27;s East Division. The rest of the Northern League teams comprised the Central Division, and both division champions would meet in a league championship series. The merger lasted until 2002, and Northeast League teams won all four of the Northern League&#x27;s championships in that time. Meanwhile, Madison&#x27;s team moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2001 to become the Lincoln Saltdogs while teams were awarded to Joliet, Illinois, and Gary, Indiana, in 2002. The Joliet JackHammers made the playoffs in their first season while the Gary SouthShore RailCats were forced to play an entire season on the road because the city of Gary did not have their stadium completed on time.

At the end of the 2002 season Miles Wolff resigned as commissioner of the Northern League to focus on his duties with the now-reinstated Northeast League. Mike Stone became league commissioner in 2003. Over the next two years the league entered three new markets. Charter member Duluth-Superior left Minnesota in 2003 to move to Kansas City, Kansas, and became known as the Kansas City T-Bones. For 2004, the league expanded its Canadian operations into the province of Alberta and added the Calgary Vipers and Edmonton CrackerCats to the league.

Mike Stone left the commissioner&#x27;s position in 2005 shortly after a dramatic move by several of the league&#x27;s teams. Following the season&#x27;s conclusion St. Paul, Sioux City, Sioux Falls, and Lincoln announced they were leaving the league to form a new independent league with five teams from the folded Central Baseball League in the southern United States; the new league was to be known as the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Stone was replaced by Jim Weigel, who in turn was replaced by Clark C. Griffith after one year in charge. Following the 2007 season, the league was left with six teams as Calgary and Edmonton left to join the Golden Baseball League. This number grew to seven in 2009 as Zion, Illinois, was granted an expansion team known as the Lake County Fielders. In 2010 an eighth team was added when the Rockford RiverHawks moved from the Frontier League.

Following the 2010 season, the Northern League announced that Winnipeg, Kansas City, Fargo-Moorhead, and Gary SouthShore would be leaving the league to join the American Association. This left Rockford, Lake County, Joliet, and Schaumburg with decisions to make. The JackHammers were sold and renamed to the Joliet Slammers, and moved to the Frontier League. The other three franchises merged with the Golden Baseball League and United League Baseball franchises to form the North American League. However, things did not work out as planned. The Flyers were evicted from Alexian Field, their home stadium, due to a large amount of debt owed to their home town of Schaumburg and eventually suspended operations. The RiverHawks decided to decline the invitation in the league and return to the Frontier League for 2011. The Fielders were the only team remaining from the original three merged into the new league but have since folded, meaning there are no longer any Northern League teams remaining in the North American League. As of the end of the 2011 season only one member of the North American League has, in fact, played in the Northern League – the Edmonton Capitals (the former Cracker-Cats). The fate of the North American League was also soon decided with the Golden Baseball League&#x27;s teams disbanding and the United Baseball League decided to re-adopt their league name due to only UBL teams remaining in the ill-fated NAL after the 2012 season. The UBL itself folded after the 2014 season.

Over 12 seasons, over two dozen former Northern League players have played in Major League Baseball. These include players such as J. D. Drew, Kevin Millar, Chris Coste, Jeff Zimmerman, and Rey Ordóñez. Several former MLB players played in the league including Dennis &quot;Oil Can&quot; Boyd, Darryl Strawberry, Jack Morris, Pedro Guerrero, Jermaine Allensworth, Ken Harvey, Mike Caruso, Bo Hart, Leon &quot;Bull&quot; Durham, and Brant Brown. Former MLB players and coaches have also coached or managed in the Northern League including Terry Bevington, &quot;Dirty&quot; Al Gallagher, Jackie Hernández, Danny Jackson, Maury Wills, Tim Johnson, Ron Kittle, Hal Lanier, Darryl Motley, Matt Nokes, and Wayne Terwilliger.

==League structure==
When the Northern League consisted of between eight and twelve teams, it played a split season 96-game schedule with two divisions from late May until early September. The division winners in each half qualified for the post-season, though if a team were to win both halves, the team with the best overall record, regardless of division, qualified as a wild card. Both the league semi-finals and Championship Series were best of five.

When the league dropped to six teams in 2008, it still played a 96-game schedule, but did not split the season and did not have divisions. Instead, the top four teams qualified for the playoffs. The first round consisted of a best-of-five series between the first and fourth-place finishers and between second and third-place finishers. The winners of the first round then played a best-of-five championship series.

In October 2009 the Northern League voted to expand from its 96-game season to a 100-game schedule, effective for the 2010 season. The playoff format was to remain the same, with the top four clubs making the playoffs.

===Rosters===
During the season, rosters were limited to 22 players, broken into seven classes based on a players years of service. One year of service was defined as one National Association (affiliated) season, or two independent league seasons.

*Rookie: A player with less than one year service. Each team must carry a minimum of five Rookies.
*LS-1: &quot;Limited Service&quot;, a player with less than two years.
*LS-2: A player with less than three years.
*LS-3: A player with less than four years.
*LS-4: A player with less than five years. Only four players may be LS-4&#x27;s.
*LS-5: A player with less than six years.
*Veteran: A player with six or more years. A maximum of four players may be veterans.

==All-Star Game==
The Northern League hosted an annual All-Star Game starting in 1997. The venue changed annually. Its format pitted the all-stars from each division against each other. In 2008 and 2009, there were no divisions during the regular season so the league temporarily split to have the &quot;Chicagoland&quot; clubs play the &quot;I-29&quot; clubs in 2008 and the &quot;Great Lakes&quot; clubs play the &quot;Great Plains&quot; clubs in 2009. In 2010, the Northern League played the Golden League all-stars.

<text>Avalon Hill Games Inc. is a game company that publishes wargames and strategic board games. It has also published miniature wargaming rules, role-playing games and sports simulations. It is a subsidiary of Hasbro, and operates under the company&#x27;s &quot;Hasbro Gaming&quot; division.

Avalon Hill introduced many of the concepts of modern recreational wargaming, including the use of a hexagonal grid (a.k.a. hexgrid) overlaid on a flat folding board, zones of control (ZOC), stacking of multiple units at a location, and board games based upon historical events.

== History ==
=== The Avalon Game Company ===

Avalon Hill was started in 1952 outside Baltimore in Catonsville, Maryland, by Charles S. Roberts under the name of &quot;The Avalon Game Company&quot; for the publication of his game &quot;Tactics&quot;. It is considered the first of a new type of war game, consisting of a self-contained printed map, pieces, rules and box designed for the mass-market. Other war games published over the prior half-century, from which Roberts drew inspiration, were either not designed for the commercial market and/or used miniatures with self-made maps/terrain. Roberts sold &quot;Tactics&quot; by mail from his home in the Avalon neighborhood of Catonsville; his house overlooked the Patapsco River valley and B&amp;O Railroad for which Roberts, his father and grandfather worked. 

Following the success of &quot;Tactics&quot;, Roberts changed the name upon incorporation from &quot;The Avalon Game Company&quot; to &quot;Avalon Hill&quot; in 1958 because of a naming dispute with another company, and the Avalon house was on a hill. The number of games released per year was erratic until 1964 as the company released anywhere from 1 to 7 games.5-8

The first game published by the company under the name of &quot;Avalon Hill&quot; was &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, published in 1958, it was also the first board wargame to simulate a historical battle. AH published two other games that year, the second edition of &quot;Tactics&quot;, titled &quot;Tactics II&quot;, and the railroad game &quot;Dispatcher&quot;. 

In 1959, Roberts moved Avalon into an office space on Gay Street in Baltimore and took on its first outside designed game, &quot;Verdict&quot;, by two corporate lawyers. After another office move, in Thomas N. Shaw, a high school friend of Roberts, was hired to design games.6

In 1960, Avalon published the first mostly dice-less sports game in &quot;Football Strategy&quot; designed by Thomas N. Shaw which was followed by two sister games, &quot;Baseball Strategy&quot; and &quot;Basketball Strategy&quot;. Of this sports strategy line, the football and baseball versions were previously privately published by Shaw in 1959.7 With a recession occurring, debt began to pile up starting in 1961.

Avalon launched a pre-school children&#x27;s line in 1963 with four games, &quot;Imagination&quot;, &quot;What Time Is It?&quot;, &quot;Doll House&quot; and &quot;Trucks, Trains, Boats &amp; Planes&quot;, which flopped. Roberts gave up and planned to file bankruptcy on .p7 Instead his creditors, Monarch Office Services and J.E. Smith &amp; Co., interceded and took over. Monarch had printed all but the boxes, which were done by J.E. Smith. The company was reorganized by retaining only one staff member, Shaw, moving, cutting costs and appointing J.E. Sparling as president.p7,8 In 1964, AH set a two-game per year release schedule.5-8

Avalon Hill published &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; in 1965. This game was an abstract combat game, featuring two sides (red and blue) and some neutral countries. Many rules variants were created for &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;. The company also published simulations of actual battles and campaigns, such as &quot;Midway,&quot; &quot;Afrika Korps,&quot; and &quot;The Battle of the Bulge.&quot;

Avalon Hill published &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; in 1970, designed for the company by Jim Dunnigan&#x27;s Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) on a royalty basis from SPI&#x27;s &quot;Tac Force 3&quot; game.p9

=== Monarch Avalon division ===
Monarch bought out J.E. Smith &amp; Co., Avalon Hill&#x27;s co-owner, on . Thus the company became a division of a renamed Monarch Office Services, Monarch Avalon.p10 Coinciding with the purchase, an additional warehouse was opened in historic downtown Baltimore at 1501 Guilford Ave., complementing the original building at 4517 Harford Road. Don Greenwood joined in 1972.

The company acquired several successful games including &quot;Acquire&quot;, &quot;TwixT&quot;, and &quot;Feudal&quot; from the purchase of 3M Games in .p5,12 Sports Illustrated (SI) line of sports games were purchased in . Both lines increased the retail outlets that would take AH games. The Aladdin Industries game line was another acquisition in . With the SI line, the company started a sports game division in with Bruce Milligan hired to head the division and launch &quot;All Star Replay&quot; sport games magazine. While from the 3M line, &quot;Facts in Five&quot; became its top selling game.p5,12

During the 1970s, Avalon Hill published a number of popular games such as &quot;Outdoor Survival&quot;, &quot;Panzer Blitz&quot;, &quot;Squad Leader&quot;, the &quot;Statis Pro&quot; sports line, and &quot;&quot;.

Avalon Hill also purchased many games from smaller companies and republished them. Heritage Models sold AH its Battleline Publications in .p5,15 Much of the Battleline line, including &quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot; and &quot;Machiavelli&quot; (a variant of &quot;Diplomacy&quot; set in Renaissance Italy), was republished by Avalon Hill, along with the popular &quot;Diplomacy&quot;. AH also acquired Jedko Games&#x27; &quot;The Russian Campaign&quot; and &quot;War at Sea&quot;, and Hartland Trefoil&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot;. &quot;1830&quot; was developed by Avalon Hill, but based on Francis Tresham&#x27;s &quot;1829&quot;.

&quot;Gulf Strike&quot; was introduced by the company in . It was based on the Iran–Iraq War, then updated after the cease-fire in 1988. &quot;Dr. Ruth&#x27;s Game of Good Sex&quot; was released in 1985. A Baltimore distributor said: &quot;I&#x27;m going to have to compare this to &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. The orders overshadow anything we&#x27;ve had in our company&#x27;s 100-year history.&quot; It then dropped off.

Facing an economic downturn in 1990 and a three-year period of losses, Monarch Avalon closed its New York office, sold its toy division and reduced inventory. AH also published its timely game expansion, &quot;Desert Shield&quot;, that sold out in weeks after its release such that a second print run hit the market in . In 1991, Hobbycraft Canada was sharing office space with Monarch Avalon.

The AvalonCon World Boardgaming Championships was first held by AH in 1991.

===Roleplaying games===
In 1974, a new game developer attempted to pitch his concept to Avalon Hill. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson had co-developed a new type of co-operative game that used role-playing. But when Gygax pitched &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; to AH, the largest company in wargaming did not understand the concept of role-playing, and turned down his offer. Gygax responded by founding TSR Inc to self-publish his game. In less than five years, TSR would be the dominant player in the new RPG market.

Avalon Hill entered the role-playing game market a decade later by publishing &quot;Powers and Perils&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Lords of Creation&quot; in 1984. The licenses to &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and the board games &quot;White Bear &amp; Red Moon&quot; (republished as &quot;Dragon Pass&quot;) and &quot;Elric&quot;, were acquired in a complex agreement in 1983 with Chaosium, and Avalon Hill published the 3rd Edition in 1984. None of these role-playing games achieved the popularity of the long-established competitor, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

===Video games===

Avalon Hill became an early publisher of computer games in 1980 with its video game division Microcomputer Games, adapting some of its boardgame titles to various computer platforms (TRS-80, Vic-20, Commodore 64, Apple II, etc.) on several data formats (cassette tape and 5¼&quot; disk). Sales of these products were decent, but the only outstanding success was &quot;Achtung Spitfire!&quot;, published relatively late in the company history.

In December 1992, AH hired Jim Rose to lead its computer game division, with the goal of reviving this part of the business in the face of flagging board game sales. AH reentered the computer game market in 1994 with a good review of &quot;Flight Commander 2&quot;. The company added Pogs to its game line up in 1995. By June 1995, Rose had left the company to found TalonSoft. In 1995, Monarch Avalon placed Avalon Hill up for sale but it was later withdrawn. Avalon Hill&#x27;s return to computer games proved unsuccessful: Terry Coleman of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported in late 1998 that &quot;no AH game in the past five years [had] sold even 50,000 units worldwide&quot;.

=== Hasbro subsidiary ===
Monarch sold Avalon Hill to Hasbro on August 4, 1998, for $6 million. Coinciding with the purchase, Hasbro laid off AH&#x27;s entire staff. Hasbro, seeking popular board games that could be converted to computer versions, purchased the rights to the Avalon Hill trademarks, copyrights, inventory, tooling and divisions, Avalon Hill Software and Victory Games, and placed them under its video game subsidiary, Hasbro Interactive. Avalon Hill Games, Inc. was incorporated by Hasbro on .

In 2001, Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames; Avalon Hill was not included in the sale and Hasbro later transferred control of the company to its subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast, in 2004.

Hasbro has released new titles under the Avalon Hill name, and added the Avalon Hill imprint to older titles such as &quot;Axis and Allies&quot; that were not originally made by Avalon Hill.

On September 8, 2020, Hasbro announced that it would move the management of Avalon Hill from Wizards of the Coast to Hasbro Gaming in January 2021.

== Game rights ==
The rights to many of Avalon Hill&#x27;s more complex games have been licensed or sold to other game publishers, or have reverted to their original owners and been republished by other companies:

* Multi-Man Publishing acquired a license to &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; and the &quot;Great Campaigns of the American Civil War&quot; series, and has since published new materials for these. 
* Valley Games published new versions of &quot;Titan&quot;, &quot;Hannibal: Rome versus Carthage&quot;, and &quot;Republic of Rome&quot;.
* GMT Games published new editions of Avalon Hill&#x27;s early card-driven wargames &quot;We the People&quot; (retitled &quot;Washington&#x27;s War&quot;), &quot;Successors&quot;, and &quot;For the People&quot;, and a descendant of &quot;Advanced Third Reich&quot;/&quot;Empire of the Rising Sun&quot; named &quot;A World at War&quot;.
* Mayfair Games now has the rights to &quot;1830&quot; (one of several 18XX games they publish).

== Victory Games ==
One of Avalon Hill&#x27;s competitors, Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI), produced wargames that were more complex and realistic simulations than those that Avalon Hill published. In 1982, after SPI&#x27;s assets were acquired by TSR, Avalon Hill hired away some of SPI&#x27;s design staff and formed them into a subsidiary company, Victory Games. When Victory Games released a line of SPI-style games, it met with critical and commercial acclaim. In 1989, Victory Games brought on Leonard Quam, a veteran from West End Games, and hired Kevin Boylan as a product developer. Victory Games continued to develop and release new products, including &quot;3rd Fleet&quot;, &quot;5th Fleet&quot;, and &quot;Carrier&quot;. The New York office closed in early 1991 after Quam left the company. Victory&#x27;s final two games, &quot;Flashpoint Golan&quot; and &quot;Across Five Aprils&quot;, were developed by Boylan alone, who worked remotely in collaboration with Avalon Hill&#x27;s art department. 

In addition from 1983 to 1987, the imprint also published an officially licensed tabletop role-playing game of the &quot;James Bond&quot; spy fiction media franchise, &quot;James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.

== Magazines ==
=== &quot;The General&quot; ===
Avalon Hill also had its own house organ which promoted sale and play of its games, &quot;The General Magazine&quot;, which was published regularly between 1964 and 1998. The magazine offered a wide array of features, including articles on both strategies of play and tactics for specific situations, historical analyses, semi-regular features devoted to individual games, columns on sports and computer games by AH, listings of vendors and opponents, answers to questions on game rules, ratings for both games and players, discount coupons for mail orders, and insider information on future AH projects.

=== &quot;All-Star Replay&quot; ===
This magazine was for Avalon Hill&#x27;s sports games. A total of 19 issues were published quarterly (later bi-monthly) from 1977 to 1981.

=== &quot;Heroes&quot; ===
In early 1984, on the occasion of the release of third edition &quot;RuneQuest&quot;, Avalon Hill included in all &quot;RuneQuest&quot; boxes a single advertising flyer announcing the launch of &quot;HEROES&quot;, its own role-playing magazine. &quot;HEROES&quot; ran for ten issues from 1984 to 1986 and had the main purpose to promote all four of Avalon Hill&#x27;s role-playing games: &quot;James Bond 007&quot;, &quot;Lords of Creation&quot;, &quot;Powers and Perils&quot;, and &quot;RuneQuest&quot;.

<doc id="68073" wikidata="Q156926" url="?curid=68073" title="Welwitschia">
<text>Welwitschia is a monotypic genus (that is, a genus that contains a single recognised species) of gymnosperm, the sole described species being the distinctive Welwitschia mirabilis, endemic to the Namib desert within Namibia and Angola. &quot;Welwitschia&quot; is the only extant genus of the family Welwitschiaceae and order Welwitschiales in the division Gnetophyta, and is one of three extant genera in Gnetophyta, alongside &quot;Gnetum&quot; and &quot;Ephedra&quot;. Informal sources commonly refer to the plant as a &quot;living fossil&quot;.

==Naming==

&quot;Welwitschia&quot; is named after Austrian botanist and doctor Friedrich Welwitsch, who described the plant in Angola in 1859. Welwitsch was so overwhelmed by the plant that he &quot;could do nothing but kneel down [...] and gaze at it, half in fear lest a touch should prove it a figment of the imagination.&quot; Joseph Dalton Hooker of the Linnean Society of London described the species, using Welwitsch&#x27;s description and collected material along with material from artist Thomas Baines who had independently recorded the plant in Namibia. Welwitsch proposed calling the genus &quot;Tumboa&quot; after what he believed to be the local name, &quot;tumbo&quot;. Hooker asked Welwitsch for permission to name the genus &quot;Welwitschia&quot; instead. Welwitsch concurred and supplied some well-preserved material from which Hooker was able to make substantial progress in determining its botanical affinities. 

The taxonomy of &quot;Welwitschia&quot; subsequently changed intermittently with the development of new classification systems (see Flowering plants: History of classification); however, its current taxonomic status is essentially the same as Hooker&#x27;s placement. Most botanists have treated &quot;Welwitschia&quot; as a distinct monotypic genus in a monotypic family or even order. Most recent systems place &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot; in its own family Welwitschiaceae in the gymnosperm order Gnetales, although other extinct species have been placed in this family. The plant is commonly known simply as welwitschia in English, but the name tree tumbo is also used. It is called or in Nama, (&#x27;two leaves; can&#x27;t die&#x27;) in Afrikaans, in Damara, and in Herero.

==Biology==
After germination, the seedling produces two cotyledons which grow to in length, and have reticulate venation. Subsequently, two foliage leaves are produced at the edge of a woody bilobed crown. The permanent leaves are opposite (at right angles to the cotyledons), amphistomatic (producing stomata on both sides of the leaf), parallel-veined and ribbon-shaped. Shortly after the appearance of the foliage leaves, the apical meristem dies and meristematic activity is transferred to the periphery of the crown.

The two (rarely three) foliage leaves grow continuously from a basal meristem around the circumference of the trunk, reaching lengths up to . The tips of the leaves split and fray into several well-separated strap-shaped sections by the distortions of the woody portions surrounding the apical slit, and also by wind and adventitious external injuries. The largest specimens (such as the &quot;Husab Giant&quot; which is five meters in circumference (about five feet in diameter)) may be no more than tall above ground, but the circumference of the leaves in contact with the sand may exceed .

&quot;Welwitschia&quot; has an elongated shallow root system consisting of &quot;a tapering taproot with one or more non-tapering extensions, some pronounced lateral roots, and a network of delicate spongy roots&quot; and a woody fibrous unbranched main stem. The roots extend to a depth roughly equal to the span of the living leaves from tip to tip. The main stem consists of an unbranched woody crown roughly shaped like an inverted cone. The only branching in the shoot system occurs in the reproductive branches, which bear strobili.

The species is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Fertilization is carried out by insects including flies and true bugs. The most common of the true bugs attending &quot;Welwitschia&quot; is a member of the family Pyrrhocoridae, &quot;Probergrothius angolensis&quot;, but a hypothesized role in pollination has so far not been demonstrated. Infrequently, wasps and bees also play a role as pollinators of &quot;Welwitschia&quot;. At least some of the pollinators are attracted by &quot;nectar&quot; produced on both male and female strobili.

&quot;Welwitschia&quot; has been classified as a CAM plant (crassulacean acid metabolism) after reconciliation of some initially contradictory and confusing data. There are however some very puzzling aspects to the matter; for example, the employment of the CAM metabolism is very slight, which was part of the reason that it took so long to establish its presence at all; it is not understood why this should be.

The age of individual plants is difficult to assess, but many plants may be over 1,000 years old. Some individuals may be more than 2,000 years old. As the species does not produce yearly rings, plant age is determined by radiocarbon dating. However, other reports suggest that the plant does produce a kind of yearly ring. The &quot;trunk&quot; continues to expand with age. The largest known is in diameter ( in circumference).

Because &quot;Welwitschia&quot; only produces a single pair of foliage leaves, the plant was thought by some to be neotenic, consisting essentially of a &quot;giant seedling.&quot; However, research showed that its anatomy is not consistent with the giant seedling idea. Instead, the plant is more accurately thought to achieve its unusual morphology as a result of having &quot;lost its head&quot; (apical meristem) at an early stage.

==Genetics==
In July 2021, the genome of &quot;Welwitschia&quot; was 98% sequenced, totaling 6.8 Gb on 21 chromosomes. There is evidence of a whole genome duplication followed by extensive reshuffling, probably caused by extreme stress due to a time of increased aridity and prolonged drought some 86 million years ago. As a result of this duplication, the genome contains more &quot;junk&quot; self-replicating DNA sequences. This increase in retrotransposon activity was counteracted with a silencing DNA methylation process allowing to lower the metabolic cost of such a large genetic material and improve resilience.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;W. mirabilis&quot; is endemic to the desert bordering the Angolan and Namibian coast, between and inland, and from 14.12°S, near the Bentiaba River in Angola, to 23.64°S, near the Kuiseb River in Namibia, a distance of . The area is arid; the coast is recorded as having almost zero rainfall, while less than of rain falls annually below the escarpment in the wet season from February to April. Populations tend to occur in ephemeral watercourses, indicating a dependence on groundwater in addition to precipitation from fog.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot; grows readily from seed, which may be bought from specialty seed dealers. The seeds have been shown to display orthodox seed behavior, which in general means that they may be stored for long periods at suitably low humidity and temperature. &quot;Welwitschia&quot; seeds naturally develop suitably low water concentrations as they ripen. Removal of the outer seed coverings enhances germination performance, which suggests that the seeds may display non-deep physiological dormancy. On planting the seed it is necessary to keep it moist but not immersed in water for the first two weeks of cultivation; it has been suggested that soaking the seeds in water before planting interferes with germination.

Seeds collected from the wild often are heavily contaminated with spores of the fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger var. phoenicis&quot;, which causes them to rot shortly after they germinate. The fungal inoculum infects the growing cones of &quot;W. mirabilis&quot; early during their development, and a sharp increase in infection occurs when the pollination drops appear; through those drops the fungal spores may gain access to the interior of the developing seed. Seeds in the wild may therefore be obliterated through fungal action even before they are fully developed. Seeds from botanical gardens or other cultivated sources are much cleaner and less likely to rot. The fungicide tebuconazole may be useful in controlling limited &quot;A. niger&quot; seed infection.

== As food ==
Indigenous people eat the cone of this plant by eating it raw or baking it in hot ashes. One of its names, &quot;onyanga&quot;, translates to &#x27;onion of the desert&#x27;.

==Conservation==
The population of &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot; in the wild is reasonably satisfactory at present. The international trade in the plant is controlled under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Plants in Angola are better protected than those in Namibia, because the relatively high concentration of land mines in Angola keep collectors away.

Although &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot; is not at present immediately threatened, there being abundant populations over a large area, its status is far from secure; its recruitment and growth rates are low, and its range, though wide, covers only a single compact, ecologically limited and vulnerable area. The remarkable longevity of Welwitschia favours its survival of temporary periods adverse to reproduction, but it offers no protection against circumstances of direct threat, such as overgrazing and disease. Fungal infection of female cones severely reduces seed viability, reducing already inherently low recruitment. Other threats include injury from off-road vehicles, collection of wild plants and overgrazing by zebras, rhinos, and domestic animals.

<text>Incheon is a city located in northwestern South Korea, bordering Seoul and Gyeonggi Province to the east. Inhabited since the Neolithic, Incheon was home to just 4,700 people when it became an international port in 1883. As of February 2020, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea&#x27;s third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.

The city&#x27;s growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital. It is part of the Seoul Metropolitan Area, along with Seoul itself and Gyeonggi Province, forming the world&#x27;s fourth-largest metropolitan area by population.

Incheon has since led the economic development of South Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of South Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as South Korea&#x27;s first free economic zone. Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, including Samsung which chose Songdo International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.

As an international city, Incheon has held numerous large-scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair &amp; Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon is also a major transportation hub in northeast Asia, with Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port. The large volume of port traffic makes Incheon a Large-Port Metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.

==History==
The first historical record of the Incheon area dates back to 475 AD, during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo, by the name of Michuhol, which is supposed to be located on modern Munhak Hill (). The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In Goryeo era, Incheon was called Gyeongwon () or Inju (). The current name was turned to Incheon in 1413. Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, ). Old Incheon consisted of modern southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu District, and Namdong District) and the northern part of Siheung. The city center was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office () and the local academy (hyanggyo, ) were located. The &quot;original&quot; two remaining buildings of the Incheon prefecture office are located in Munhak Elementary School, while the newly built (in 2001) prefecture office buildings are right across from Munhak Baseball Stadium.

===Modern history===

Another historical name of the city, Jemulpo (alternatively Romanized as Chemulpo), was not widely used until the opening of the port in 1883. It was frequently used until the Japanese annexation. After the opening of the Incheon port, the city center moved from Gwangyo to Jemulpo. Today, either Jemulpo or Gwangyo-dong is considered &quot;Original Incheon&quot; (). It was internationally known as Jinsen during Japanese rule, based on the Japanese pronunciation of Incheon&#x27;s Sino-Korean name.

In 1914, the Japanese colonial government merged outer parts of old Incheon (including the former center of Gwangyo) with Bupyeong County, forming Bucheon County. Between 1936 and 1940, some part of Bucheon County was recombined into Incheon, by which some part of &quot;old&quot; Bupyeong was annexed into Incheon.

Incheon was originally part of Gyeonggi Province, but was granted &quot;Directly Governed&quot; (now Metropolitan) City status on 1 July 1981; the city officially separated from the province. In 1989, neighboring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo County were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo County and two counties of Ganghwa and Onjin were annexed to Incheon.

Incheon was known as Inchon prior to South Korea&#x27;s adoption of a new Romanization system in 2000.
=== Major events ===
The city was the site of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, where the first shots of the Russo-Japanese War were fired.

During the Korean War, Incheon was occupied by North Korean troops on 4 July 1950. Incheon was the site of the Battle of Inchon when the United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the Pusan Perimeter and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory and it was recaptured on 19 September 1950. was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.

Prior to and during the June Democratic Movement in 1987, Incheon was the site of several pro-democracy protests.

Incheon has also hosted a series of major international events. The Global Fair &amp; Festival 2009 Incheon was held in the Songdo District in August 2009. It was open from 7 August to 25 October for a period of 80 days. It was a comprehensive international event with global institutions and corporations as participants. Various musicians and artists performed during the event.
The city hosted a meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers in February 2010. Incheon was the site of the third Global Model United Nations Conference, held from 10 to 14 August 2011.

It first hosted the Incheon Women Artists&#x27; Biennale in 2004 which expanded into welcoming international artists in its subsequent 2007, 2009 and 2011.

Incheon hosted the Asian Games in 2014. It hosted the 6th OECD World Forum in 2018.

Incheon was designated as the World Book Capital for the year 2015 by UNESCO.

==Education==
On 27 February 2007, Incheon declared itself an &quot;English City&quot;, and inaugurated the &quot;Incheon Free English Zone&quot; program. The goal of the program is to make the city as proficient in English as Singapore. This is for the ultimate purpose of establishing Incheon as a commercial and business hub of northeast Asia (see Free Economic Zone below). The official slogan of the program is &quot;Smile with English&quot;.

===Higher education===

Incheon is home to a number of colleges and universities:
* George Mason University Korea Campus
* Ghent University Global Campus
* Gyeongin National University of Education Incheon campus
* Inha University (formerly Inha Institute of Technology)
* Gachon University Medical·Ganghwa campus
* Gyeongin Women&#x27;s College
* Inha Technical College
* Incheon Catholic University
* Incheon City College
* Incheon National University
* Jaineung College
* University of Utah Asia Campus
* SUNY South Korea
* Anyang University Ganghwa campus
* Yonsei University International campus
* Korea Polytechnics II
* Seongsan Hyo University
* Juan International University

== Climate ==
Incheon has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm, and humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;, respectively) using the isotherm. Like other metropolitan cities, Incheon has a strong urban heat island effect. Incheon&#x27;s climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.

Incheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.


==Economy==
Incheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.

In recent years, bio industry is emerging as a new growth industry of the city. Currently, with the total production capacity of 330kℓ per year, the city ranks 2nd in the world by production capacity along with San Francisco, United States. The capacity is under expansion, and after completion in 2018, the city will rank 1st with the production capacity of 510kℓ. Also, logistics industry is also experiencing a rapid growth, thanks to Incheon Airport, which was ranked fourth in the world by cargo traffic, and the expansion of Incheon Port.

==Transportation==
Incheon is a major domestic and international transport hub for Korea.
=== Air ===
Incheon International Airport is South Korea&#x27;s primary international airport and a regional air hub. In 2015, it was the world&#x27;s 22nd busiest airport by passenger traffic, with 49,412,750 passengers.

There were a total of 305,446 flights (300,634 international, 4,812 domestic) to and from Incheon International Airport in 2015, an average of 837 flights (824 international, 13 domestic) daily. Korea&#x27;s two main carriers, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, serviced 50.9% of flights, while low-cost and foreign carriers serviced the remaining 49.1% of flights. The airport is experiencing a rapid increase in passengers, and the opening of Terminal 2 in December 2017 spurred additional traffic.

The airport was also featured in the Korean drama series, &quot;Air City&quot;.

Incheon International Airport ranked &quot;5th in the world&quot; among international airports in late 2018.

=== Sea ===
Incheon&#x27;s sea port is the second largest port in Korea after Busan Port.

The International Passenger Terminal located at the port offers ferries to five cities in China: Dalian, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dandong, and Weihai. There are also ferries to Incheon&#x27;s outlying islands as well as Baengnyeongdo inside of the Northern Limit Line.

=== Buses ===
Incheon Bus Terminal, located at its eponymous subway stop, offers express bus transportation to all parts of Korea. Many city bus lines offer transportation within city limits as well as to the neighboring cities of Bucheon, Gimpo, Seoul, and Siheung.

=== Trains ===

Local service to Guro, Seoul, Cheongnyangni, Uijeongbu and Soyosan is offered by Seoul&#x27;s subway Line 1. The line has 11 stations within Incheon and connects to the Incheon Subway at Bupyeong and Juan stations.

Rapid service on the same line to Yongsan station in Seoul depart from Dongincheon station and stops at major stations.

The Airport Express (AREX) line runs from Incheon International Airport to Seoul Station via Gimpo International Airport. The Incheon-Gimpo section was opened in March 2007 and was extended to Seoul station in December 2010. Passengers can choose a high-speed service stopping only at Incheon airport and Seoul, which takes 43 minutes but departs only every half-hour; or the all-station service which takes 53 minutes but leaves every six minutes.

KTX service was introduced on the AREX line on 30 June 2014, with stops at Incheon International Airport station and Geomam station. There are additional plans to use the newly built Suin Line to bring KTX service to Incheon station by 2021.

=== Subway ===
The Incheon Subway has two subway lines serving the city. The first line connects to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system at Bupyeong station (Seoul Subway Line 1), and AREX line at Gyeyang station. It connects International Business District station in Songdo to Gyeyang station. The line has 28 stations on of track. The line also has transfer stations with the Suin Line at Woninjae station, with the Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station, and with Seoul Subway Line 7 at Bupyeong-gu Office station. Incheon Subway Line 2 opened in July 2016 and runs from Geomdan Oryu station to Unyeon station. The automated line is long, and has 27 stations, including transfer stations at Geomam station with the AREX line, Juan station with Seoul Subway Line 1 and Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station.

The Incheon subway is operated by the Incheon Rapid Transit Corporation (IRTC).

Korail has also constructed a new commuter rail line named Suin Line. The line opened in 2012 from Oido station in Siheung to Songdo station in Incheon. It was then extended in 2016, and now reaches Incheon station where passengers can transfer to Seoul Subway Line 1. In 2020, the line was extended from Oido station to Suwon Station.

SMRT (one of three operating companies of Seoul Metropolitan Subway) has extended Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 7 to Bupyeong-gu office by 2011 and provided transfers to the Incheon Subway system. It has 3 stations within Incheon. By 2020, the line will further be extended westwards to Seoknam station where it will be possible to transfer to Incheon Subway Line 2.

The designation of &quot;Free Economic Zone&quot; refers to efforts to enhance the business environment for foreign enterprises and improve living conditions for expatriates. It was the first zone of its kind in South Korea, formally designated in August 2003. The region includes infrastructure for air and sea transportation, logistics, international business, financial services, and residential facilities, alongside educational, medical, and leisure amenities.

<text>All That Jazz is a 1979 American musical drama film directed by Bob Fosse and starring Roy Scheider as an obsessive film and stage director. It is a semi-autobiographical fantasy based on aspects of Fosse&#x27;s life and career as a dancer, choreographer and filmmaker. It was also the final work of its producer Robert Alan Aurthur, who wrote the screenplay with Fosse and died a year before its release.

The story draws from Fosse&#x27;s experience editing his 1974 film &quot;Lenny&quot; while simultaneously staging the Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, which he directed, choreographed and co-wrote. Like Fosse, Scheider&#x27;s character attempts to stage an ambitious Broadway musical while supervising the editing of a film he directed and which, like &quot;Lenny&quot;, centers around a stand-up comedian. Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking, Leland Palmer, Cliff Gorman and Ben Vereen co-star in supporting roles. The film borrows its title from the song of the same name from &quot;Chicago&quot;.

&quot;All That Jazz&quot; was released on December 20, 1979 to commercial and critical success, being praised by critics for its creativity, ambition, choreography, and Scheider&#x27;s performance, although it was labelled by some as pretentious or &quot;egomaniacal&quot;, in particular in regard to its autobiographical nature. It jointly won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival together with Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Kagemusha&quot; and received a leading nine nominations at the 52nd Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for Scheider, winning four: Best Original Score, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Film Editing. Following its release, Stanley Kubrick called it &quot;[the] best film I think I have ever seen&quot;, and in 2001 it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Joe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer attempting to balance staging his latest Broadway musical, &quot;NY/LA&quot;, while editing a Hollywood film he has directed, &quot;The Stand-Up&quot;. He is an alcoholic, a driven workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and a womanizer constantly flirting and engaging in sexual encounters with a stream of women. Each morning, he begins his day by playing a tape of Vivaldi while taking doses of Visine, Alka-Seltzer, and Dexedrine, always concluding by looking at himself in the mirror and saying, &quot;It&#x27;s showtime, folks!&quot; Joe&#x27;s ex-wife, Audrey Paris, is involved with the production of the show but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger and daughter Michelle keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique in a nightclub setting, discussing his life with her.

As Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he vents his anger on the dancers and in his choreography. This leads to a highly sexualized number of topless women during a rehearsal, frustrating the show&#x27;s penny-pinching backers. One of the few moments of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of &quot;The Stand-Up&quot;, moving him to tears. During a table-read of &quot;NY/LA&quot;, Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe angina.

Joe brushes off his symptoms, attempting to leave for rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor&#x27;s office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from exhaustion. &quot;NY/LA&quot; is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, smoking and drinking while hosting endless streams of women in his room. As he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie remaining by his side for support. A negative review for &quot;The Stand-Up&quot;, released during Joe&#x27;s hospitalization, comes in despite the film&#x27;s financial success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event.

While Joe undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery, the producers of &quot;NY/LA&quot; realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon&#x27;s death: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant musical dream sequences in his head starring his daughter, wife, and girlfriend, all berating him for his behavior. He realizes he cannot avoid his death and has another heart attack.

As the doctors try to save him, Joe runs away from his hospital bed behind their backs, exploring the basement of the hospital and the autopsy ward before allowing himself to be taken back. He goes through the five stages of grief—anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing. As he gets closer to death, his dream sequences become more and more hallucinatory. As the doctors try one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (&quot;Bye Bye Life&quot;, a whimsical parody of &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;). In his dying dream, Joe can thank his family and acquaintances, as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation. Joe finally dreams of himself traveling down a hallway to meet Angelique at the end. Meanwhile, his corpse is zipped up in a body bag.

==Production==
While trying to edit &quot;Lenny&quot; and choreograph &quot;Chicago&quot; in 1974, Fosse suffered a massive heart attack and underwent open heart surgery. After recovering, Fosse became interested in the subject of life and death and hospital behavior. Alongside his friend Robert Alan Aurthur, they set out to make a film adaption of &quot;Ending&quot; by Hilma Wolitzer which had similar themes of death and marital problems. However, after completing the screenplay, Fosse decided against making it a film as he found the material too depressing and felt he wasn&#x27;t strong enough to stick with it for over a year. Still wanting to stick with the subject matter of death and wanting to use what he felt were his best tools of song and dance, he instead decided to make a film based on his own experiences with making &quot;Lenny&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. The story&#x27;s structure closely mirrors Fosse&#x27;s own health issues at the time and is often compared to Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot;, another thinly veiled autobiographical film with fantastical elements.

The part of Audrey Paris—Joe&#x27;s ex-wife and continuing muse, played by Leland Palmer—closely reflects that of Fosse&#x27;s wife, the dancer and actress Gwen Verdon, who continued to work with him on projects including &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;All That Jazz&quot; itself.

Gideon&#x27;s rough handling of chorus girl Victoria Porter closely resembles Bob Fosse&#x27;s own treatment of Jennifer Nairn-Smith during rehearsals for &quot;Pippin&quot;. Nairn-Smith herself appears in the film as Jennifer, one of the &quot;NY/LA&quot; dancers.

Ann Reinking was one of Fosse&#x27;s sexual partners at the time and was more or less playing herself in the film, but nonetheless she was required to audition for the role as Gideon&#x27;s girlfriend, Kate Jagger.

Cliff Gorman was cast in the titular role of &quot;The Stand-Up&quot;—the film-within-a-film version of &quot;Lenny&quot;—after having played the role of Lenny Bruce in the original theatrical production of the show (for which he won a Tony Award), but was passed over for Fosse&#x27;s film version of the production in favor of Dustin Hoffman.

The part of Joe Gideon was offered to Paul Newman, who turned it down as he didn&#x27;t feel the character was redeemable and also didn&#x27;t take Fosse into consideration. Newman would later call it a &quot;dumb mistake&quot;.

With increasing production costs and a loss of enthusiasm for the film, Columbia brought in Fox to finance completion, and the latter studio acquired domestic distribution rights in return.

==Critical reception==

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called the film &quot;an uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego&quot; and &quot;an essentially funny movie that seeks to operate on too many levels at the same time... some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun... A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon... With an actor of less weight and intensity, &quot;All That Jazz&quot; might have evaporated as we watched it. Mr. Scheider&#x27;s is a presence to reckon with.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film&quot; and added, &quot;Roy Scheider gives a superb performance as Gideon, creating a character filled with nervous energy... The film&#x27;s major flaw lies in its lack of real explanation of what, beyond ego, really motivates [him].&quot;

Gene Siskel praised the film on &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; finding it fresh and entertaining describing it as &quot;an obituary of a creative man who&#x27;s afraid his work just might be trivial.&quot; His colleague Roger Ebert however, initially gave the film a mixed review when he first saw it, praising Fosse&#x27;s choreography though criticizing the story finding it discombobulated and self-indulgent. He also found it inferior to &quot;8½&quot; stating, &quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of ironic Bob Fosse makes a film about his own life and it turns out to be Fellini&#x27;s life.&quot; Years later in 2003, Ebert admitted that he changed his mind on the film and gave it praise stating that he was &quot;wrong&quot; about it at the time and felt it was unfair of him to compare it to Fellini.

Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote &#x27;Except for one brief flashback, it&#x27;s a latter-day self destructive agon in which the protagonist is beginning a complex Broadway show,&#x27;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; said, &quot;The dancing is frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate, with non-showman Scheider an illustrious example of casting against type . . . &quot;All That Jazz&quot; is great-looking but not easy to watch. Fosse&#x27;s indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing.&quot;

Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half stars (out of four) in his 2009 movie guide; he said that the film was &quot;self-indulgent and largely negative,&quot; and that &quot;great show biz moments and wonderful dancing are eventually buried in pretensions&quot;; he also called the ending &quot;an interminable finale which leaves a bad taste for the whole film.&quot;

&quot;Time Out London&quot; states, &quot;As translated onto screen, [Fosse&#x27;s] story is wretched: the jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song &#x27;n&#x27; dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; Fellini-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal.&quot;

Upon release in 1979, director Stanley Kubrick, who is mentioned in the movie, reportedly called it &quot;[the] best film I think I have ever seen&quot;.
In 2001, &quot;All That Jazz&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was also preserved by the Academy Film Archive in the same year. In 2006, the film was ranked #14 by the American Film Institute on its list of the Greatest Movie Musicals.

The film would be the last musical nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture until Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was nominated in 1992, and was the last live-action musical to compete in the category until Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; was nominated in 2002.

==Home media==
The DVD issued in 2003 features scene-specific commentary by Roy Scheider and interviews with Scheider and Fosse. Fox released a &quot;Special Music Edition&quot; DVD in 2007, with an audio commentary by the film&#x27;s Oscar-winning editor, Alan Heim. Blu-ray and DVD editions were released in August 2014 with all the old special features, as well as new supplements through The Criterion Collection brand.

== Legacy ==
The final dance sequence of &quot;All That Jazz&quot; is depicted in FX&#x27;s &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot; starring Sam Rockwell as Bob Fosse. The series&#x27; executive producer and Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda played the dual role of Joe Gideon/Roy Scheider. The &quot;Get Happy&quot; dream sequence musical number in the season 7 &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;Bombshells&quot; was also inspired by this dance sequence.

The film is referenced heavily in the &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; episode: &quot;Mijo&quot;. During the episode, there is a montage in which Jimmy&#x27;s (Bob Odenkirk) routine is revealed: Grabbing his coffee, defending clients, collecting his check, and his ongoing battle with the parking attendant, Mike (Jonathan Banks). During his routine he always looks in the mirror and says &quot;It&#x27;s showtime, folks!&quot;, a line from &quot;All That Jazz&quot;.

Season 3 Episode 5 of &quot;GLOW&quot;, &quot;Freaky Tuesday&quot;, opens with the same Vivaldi concerto music while the character Tammé is shown struggling, with the help of pills and wine and hot showers, to wake up every morning and tamp down her back pain while continuing to perform as a wrestler each night.

Season 3 Episode 10 of &quot;Get a Life&quot;, &quot;Zoo Animals on Wheels&quot;, features a rehearsal montage set to &quot;On Broadway&quot;. During this sequence, Chris Peterson (Chris Elliott) mimics Joe Gideon&#x27;s cigarette smoking and use of Visine before saying, &quot;It&#x27;s showtime, folks!&quot; to himself in his dressing room mirror. Elliott would again reference the film in the finale of the Adult Swim series &quot;Eagleheart&quot;, which concludes with a recreation of the &quot;Bye Bye Life&quot; sequence, with his character Chris Monsanto as Joe Gideon.

The David Fincher–directed music video for Paula Abdul&#x27;s song &quot;Cold Hearted&quot; is inspired by the &quot;Take Off With Us&quot; dance sequence in &quot;All That Jazz&quot;.

The 2006 film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; written and directed by Sofia Coppola reuses the Vivaldi concerto in a montage depicting the daily routine of Marie&#x27;s life with her husband.

<doc id="68079" wikidata="Q384397" url="?curid=68079" title="The African Queen (film)">
<text>The African Queen is a 1951 adventure film adapted from the 1935 novel of the same name by C. S. Forester. The film was directed by John Huston and produced by Sam Spiegel and John Woolf. The screenplay was adapted by James Agee, John Huston, John Collier and Peter Viertel. It was photographed in Technicolor by Jack Cardiff and has a music score by Allan Gray. The film stars Humphrey Bogart (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor, his only Oscar) and Katharine Hepburn with Robert Morley, Peter Bull, Walter Gotell, Richard Marner and Theodore Bikel.

&quot;The African Queen&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1994, and the Library of Congress deemed it &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==
Samuel Sayer and his sister Rose are English Methodist missionaries in German East Africa in August 1914. Their mail and supplies are delivered by a small steamboat named the &quot;African Queen&quot;, helmed by the rough-and-ready Canadian mechanic Charlie Allnut, whose coarse behavior they stiffly tolerate.
When Charlie warns the Sayers that war has broken out between Germany and Britain, they choose to remain in Kungdu, only to witness German colonial troops burn down the village and herd the villagers away to be pressed into service. When Samuel protests, he is struck by a soldier and soon becomes delirious with fever, dying shortly afterward. Charlie helps Rose bury her brother and they escape in the &quot;African Queen&quot;.

Charlie mentions to Rose that the British are unable to attack the Germans because of the presence of a large gunboat, the , patrolling a large lake downriver. Rose comes up with a plan to convert the &quot;African Queen&quot; into a torpedo boat and sink the . After some persuasion, Charlie goes along with the plan.

Charlie encourages Rose to navigate the river by rudder while he tends the engine, and she is emboldened after they pass the first set of rapids with minimal flooding in the boat. When they pass the German fortress, the soldiers begin shooting at them, damaging the boiler. Charlie manages to reattach a pressure hose just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding on the deck. While celebrating their success, Charlie and Rose find themselves in an embrace and kiss. The third set of rapids damages the boat&#x27;s propeller shaft. They rig up a primitive forge on shore and Charlie straightens the shaft and welds a new blade onto the propeller, allowing the two to set off again.
All appears lost when the boat becomes mired in the mud and dense reeds near the mouth of the river. With no supplies left and short of potable water, Rose and a feverish Charlie pass out, both accepting that they will soon die. Rose says a quiet prayer. As they sleep, torrential rains raise the river&#x27;s level and float the &quot;African Queen&quot; into the lake.

Over the next two days, Charlie and Rose prepare for their attack. The returns and Charlie and Rose steam the &quot;African Queen&quot; out onto the lake in darkness, intending to set her on a collision course. A strong storm strikes, causing water to pour into the &quot;African Queen&quot; through the torpedo holes. Eventually the boat capsizes, throwing Charlie and Rose into the water. Charlie loses sight of Rose in the storm.

Charlie is captured and taken aboard the &quot;Königin Luise&quot;, where he is interrogated by German officers. Believing that Rose has drowned, he makes no attempt to defend himself against accusations of spying and the German captain sentences him to death by hanging. Rose is brought aboard the ship just after Charlie&#x27;s sentence is pronounced. The captain questions her, and Rose proudly confesses the plot to sink the &quot;Königin Luise&quot;, deciding that they have nothing to lose. The captain sentences her to be executed with Charlie, both as British spies. Charlie asks the German captain to marry them before they are executed. The captain agrees, and after conducting the briefest of marriage ceremonies, is about to carry out the execution when the is rocked by a series of explosions, quickly capsizing. The ship has struck the overturned submerged hull of the &quot;African Queen&quot; and detonated the torpedoes. The newly married couple is able to escape the sinking ship and swim to safety together.

== Production ==

Production censors objected to several aspects of the original script, such as the two unmarried characters cohabiting the boat (as in the book), and some changes were made before the film was completed. Another change followed the casting of Bogart; his character&#x27;s lines in the original screenplay were rendered with a thick Cockney dialect, but the script had to be completely rewritten because he was unwilling to attempt the accent. The rewrite made the character Canadian.

The film was partially financed by John and James Woolf of Romulus Films, a British company. Michael Balcon, an advisor to the National Film Finance Corporation, advised the NFFC to refuse a loan to the Woolfs unless the film starred his former Ealing Studios actors John McCallum and Googie Withers rather than Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, whom the Woolfs wanted. The Woolfs persuaded NFFC chairman Lord Reith to overrule Balcon, and the film went ahead. The Woolfs provided £250,000 and were so pleased with the completed film that they convinced John Huston to direct their next picture, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952).

Much of the film was shot in Lake Albert, Uganda and the in Belgian Congo in Africa. This was rather novel for the time, especially for a Technicolor picture that used large, cumbersome &quot;Three-Strip&quot; cameras. The cast and crew endured sickness and spartan living conditions during their time on location. In the early scene in which Hepburn plays an organ in the church, a bucket was placed off-camera in which she could vomit between takes because she was sick. Bogart later bragged that he and Huston were the only members of the cast and crew who escaped illness, which he credited to having drunk whiskey on location rather than the local water.
About half of the film was shot in the UK. The scenes in which Bogart and Hepburn are seen in the water were all shot in studio tanks at Worton Hall Studios in Isleworth, near London. These scenes were considered too dangerous to shoot in Africa. All of the foreground plates for the process shots were also filmed in studio. A myth has grown that the scenes in the reed-filled riverbank were filmed in Dalyan, Turkey, but in her book about the filming, Hepburn stated: &quot;We were about to head... back to Entebbe but John [Huston] wanted to get shots of Bogie and me in the miles of high reeds before we come out into the lake...&quot;. The sequence was shot on location in Africa and at the London studios. The shots of the German-occupied Fort Shona were all filmed at Worton Hall, where a fortress set was constructed from tubular scaffolding and covered with plaster.

Scenes on the boat were filmed using a large raft with a mockup of the boat on top. Sections of the boat set could be removed to make room for the large Technicolor camera. This proved hazardous on one occasion when the boat&#x27;s boiler, a heavy copper replica, almost fell on Hepburn. It was not secured to the deck because it also had to be moved to accommodate the camera. The small steamboat used to depict the &quot;African Queen&quot; was built in 1912 in Britain for service in Africa. At one time it was owned by actor Fess Parker. The boat was restored in April 2012 and is now on display as a tourist attraction in Key Largo, Florida.

Because of the dangers involved with shooting the rapids scenes, a small-scale model was used in the studio tank in London. The vessel used to portray the German gunboat &quot;Königin Luise&quot; was the steam tug &quot;Buganda&quot;, owned and operated on Lake Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation. Although fictional, the was inspired by the World War I vessel (also known as ), which operated on Lake Tanganyika until she was scuttled in 1916 during the Battle for Lake Tanganyika. The British refloated the in 1924 and placed her in service on Lake Tanganyika in 1927 as the passenger ferry and she is still operating with continuing maintenance agreed in 2023.

The name &quot;Königin Luise&quot; was taken from a German steam ferry that operated from Hamburg before being taken over by the on the outbreak of World War I. She was used as an auxiliary minelayer off Harwich before being sunk on 5 August 1914 by the cruiser .

A persistent rumour holds that London&#x27;s population of feral ring-necked parakeets originated from birds that escaped or were released during filming of &quot;The African Queen&quot;.

== Premiere ==
&quot;The African Queen&quot; opened on December 26, 1951, at the Fox Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills in time to qualify for the 24th Academy Awards. The film opened in New York City on February 20, 1952, at the Capitol Theatre.

== Reception and box office ==
Contemporary critical reviews were mostly positive. Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;should impress for its novelty both in casting and scenically,&quot; and found the ending &quot;rather contrived and even incredible, but melodramatic enough, with almost a western accent, to be popularly effective.&quot; Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a slick job of movie hoodwinking with a thoroughly implausible romance, set in a frame of wild adventure that is as whopping as its tale of off-beat love ... This is not noted with disfavor.&quot; Crowther added that &quot;Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly, polite kidding and generally keeping it there, while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;The African Queen&quot; &quot;an engrossing motion picture ... Performance-wise, Bogart has never been seen to better advantage. Nor has he ever had a more knowing, talented film partner than Miss Hepburn.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; declared that &quot;Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart come up with a couple of remarkable performances, and it&#x27;s fortunate that they do, for the movie concentrates on them so single-mindedly that any conspicuous uncertainty in their acting would have left the whole thing high and dry.&quot; Richard L. Coe wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;Huston has tried a risky trick and most of the time pulls it off in delicious style. And from both his stars he has drawn performances which have rightly been nominated for those Academy Awards on the [20th].&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; printed a negative review, writing that the film &quot;has its moments of comedy and excitement, but on the whole the dialogue is childish, the action silly, and the story bereft of human appeal. The characters act as childishly as they talk, and discriminating picture-goers will, no doubt, laugh at them. There is nothing romantic about either Katharine Hepburn or Humphrey Bogart, for both look bedraggled throughout.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was also negative, writing: &quot;Huston seems to have been aiming at a measured, quiet, almost digressive tempo, but the material does not support it, and would have benefited by the incisiveness his previous films have shown. In spite of Hepburn&#x27;s wonderful playing, and some engaging scenes, the film must be accounted a misfire.&quot;

The film earned an estimated £256,267 at UK cinemas in 1952, making it the 11th-most-popular film of the year. It earned an estimated $4 million in North American theatrical rentals and $6 million worldwide.

On review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 96% rating based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Perfectly cast, smartly written, and beautifully filmed, &quot;The African Queen&quot; remains thrilling, funny, and effortlessly absorbing even after more than half a century&#x27;s worth of adventure movies borrowing liberally from its creative DNA.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 91% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

== Differences from the novel ==
In 1935, when the novella &quot;The African Queen&quot; by C. S. Forester was published, many British people believed that World War I was a grievous mistake that could have been avoided. In the novella, the Germans are the antagonists, not the villains, and are depicted as noble and chivalrous opponents of the British, who are likewise equally noble and honorable. The overall message of the novella was that the war was a tragedy in which decent people killed one another for unfathomable reasons and that both sides suffered equally. The British historian Antony Barker wrote in the book there is a strong sense of the shared suffering of the European characters in Africa during the war including the Germans who are presented as having only a &quot;limited responsibility&quot; for the war. By contrast, when the film version of &quot;The African Queen&quot; came out in 1951, memories of the Second World War were still fresh and the German characters were far more villainous and disagreeable than in the novella. Unlike the memory of the First World War, the Second World War was remembered as a crusade against evil, which influenced the script of &quot;The African Queen&quot;. In the novella, the Germans capture Rose and Charlie, but release them in a magnanimous gesture, unaware of the failed plot. Likewise, in the film they capture Rose and Charlie, but are on the verge of hanging them when the &quot;Königin Luise&quot; is sunk by the wreck of &quot;The African Queen&quot;.

In the novella, Charlie and Rose fail in their attempt to sink the &quot;Königin Luise&quot; as the message in the book is: &quot;What appears to be an impossible mission for a private citizen is shown to be just that--it remains a job best left for the professionals&quot;. The &quot;Königin Luise&quot; is instead sunk in a lake battle by a Royal Navy gunboat as Rose and Charlie watch from the shore. The film presented the efforts of Charlie and Rose in a more favorable light as their struggle to bring &quot;The African Queen&quot; to the lake causes the sinking of the &quot;Königin Luise&quot;, and the Royal Navy gunboat does not appear in the film. In the novella, the character of Charlie was British; in the film, he becomes Canadian to accommodate Bogart&#x27;s American accent. In 1915, there was a successful expedition commanded by Geoffrey Spicer-Simson where the British dragged two Royal Navy gunboats across the African wilderness to Lake Tanganyika to challenge German naval mastery of the lake, which served as the inspiration for the novella. C. S. Forester, the author of &quot;The African Queen&quot; did not focus on the story of the real life expedition, which he incorporated into his novella as the Royal Navy gunboat in the book is clearly supposed to be one of the two real life gunboats, largely because of the tremendous suffering endured by the African porters who had to drag the two gunboats across the wilderness, an aspect of the expedition that Forester did not wish to dwell upon.

During the campaign in East Africa, the German forces were quite ruthless in forcibly conscripting Africans to work as porters; seizing animals and food for themselves; and in carrying out a scorched earth strategy meant to deny the pursuing British forces the use of the countryside. Barker wrote that the heroic way that the crew of the &quot;Königin Luise&quot; go down fighting in the book &quot;cancelled&quot; out the brutal behavior of the German forces earlier while in the film the sinking of the &quot;Königin Luise&quot; is the just punishment of the German characters. Both the book and the film accurately depict the scorched earth tactics of the German &quot;Schutztruppe&quot;, which had a devastating effect on the African peoples as thousands of Africans starved to death as a result of the destruction of crops and farm animals. However, the focus in both the film and the book are on the white characters and both the film and book treats the Africans as mere extras in the story. Despite the fact that both the book and the novella are set in the Great Lakes region of Africa, there are no important African characters in either the book or the film. Both the book and the film present Africa as a exotic and dangerous locale where white people have adventures and romances, with the Africans themselves just in the background.

Both the book and the film treat Africa as a place where it is possible to find happiness in a way that would be impossible in Europe. In both the book and the film, Rose is a prim, proper missionary from a middle class English family who is dominated by her bossy older brother Samuel, and it is during the voyage of the &quot;African Queen&quot; that she finds romance and happiness with Charlie along with the courage to assert herself. In the book, Charlie is a coarse and somewhat disreputable working class Cockney who marries a middle class woman that he would be unlikely to marry in England. The film changes Charlie into a Canadian, but has the same message that a working class man is able to marry a middle class woman that he would be unlikely to marry in a place other than Africa. In the book, it is strongly implied that Rose and Charlie are engaged in a sexual relationship before marriage, an aspect of the book that was toned down in the film because of the Hays Code, which forbade any depiction of a pre-marital sexual relationship. Unlike the book which was a straight adventure story, the film borrows much from American romantic comedies of the 1930s-1940s which portray a &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; that ends with a man and a woman finding love on the basis of &quot;equality and symmetry&quot;. The book is set in a thinly disguised version of Lake Tanganyika, on whose eastern shores was the colony of German East Africa (modern Tanzania), but the parts of the film shot on location were filmed in the Belgian Congo (modern Democratic Republic of the Congo) because director Huston had heard that the Belgian Congo was better for hunting elephants.

== Subsequent releases ==
The film was released on Region 2 DVD in the United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. The British DVD includes a theatrical trailer and an audio commentary by cinematographer Jack Cardiff in which he details many of the hardships and challenges involved in filming in Africa.

Prior to 2010, the film had been released in the United States on VHS video, LaserDisc and as a Region 1 DVD.

=== 2009 digital restoration ===
In 2009, Paramount Pictures (the current owner of the film&#x27;s American rights) completed restoration work for Region 1, and a 4K digitally restored version from the original camera negative was issued on DVD and Blu-ray on March 23, 2010. The film was restored with its original mono soundtrack from original UK film elements under the sole supervision of Paramount, and had as an extra a documentary on the film&#x27;s production, &quot;Embracing Chaos: The Making of The African Queen&quot;. Romulus Films and international-rights holder ITV Studios were acknowledged in the restoration credits.

ITV released the restoration in Region 2 on June 14, 2010.

== Adaptations in other media ==
&quot;The African Queen&quot; was adapted as a one-hour Lux Radio Theater play on December 15, 1952. Bogart reprised his film role and was joined by Greer Garson. This broadcast is included as a bonus CD in the commemorative box-set version of the Paramount DVD.

The March 26, 1962 episode of &quot;The Dick Powell Theater&quot;, titled &quot;Safari&quot;, was based on the story, with James Coburn and Glynis Johns in the lead roles.

A 1977 television film continued the adventures of Charlie and Rose, with Warren Oates and Mariette Hartley in the lead roles. Though intended as the pilot for a series, it was not picked up. An elliptic commentary on the making of &quot;The African Queen&quot; can be found in the 1990 film &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood.

&quot;The African Queen&quot; partially inspired the Jungle Cruise attraction at Disneyland. Imagineer Harper Goff referenced the film frequently in his ideas, and his designs for the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film.

== The &quot;African Queen&quot; ==

One of the two boats used as the &quot;African Queen&quot; is actually the 35-foot (10 m) L.S. &quot;Livingston&quot;, which had been a working diesel boat for 40 years; the steam engine was a prop and the real diesel engine was hidden under stacked crates of gin and other cargo. Florida attorney and Humphrey Bogart enthusiast Jim Hendricks Sr. purchased the boat in 1982 in Key Largo, Florida. After falling into a state of disrepair following Hendricks&#x27; 2001 death, the ship was discovered rusting in a Florida marina in 2012 by Suzanne Holmquist and her engineer husband Lance. The couple repaired and refurbished the ailing ship and made it available to tourists and film enthusiasts, providing cruises around the Florida Keys.

<text>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is a 1948 American horror comedy film directed by Charles Barton. The film features Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), who has partnered with Dr. Sandra Mornay (Lenore Aubert) in order to find a brain to reactivate Frankenstein&#x27;s monster (Glenn Strange), and they find Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello), the ideal candidate.

The film was developed and production started with misgivings by Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, who disliked the script. Barton faced difficulty during the production of the film, with Abbott and Costello often absent from the set. However, the film was successful at the box office and became one of Universal&#x27;s top films of the year. Several follow-up films ensued involving Abbott and Costello meeting other horror film actors and monsters. The film was mostly well received by critics on its release and in 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry; it also placed at number 56 on the list of the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Funniest American Movies.

==Plot==
Larry Talbot makes an urgent phone call to a railway station in Florida, where Chick Young and Wilbur Grey work as baggage clerks. Talbot tries to warn Wilbur of a shipment due to arrive for &quot;McDougal&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot;. However, before he finishes, the moon rises and Talbot transforms into a werewolf, causing Wilbur to think the call is a prank. Meanwhile, McDougal demands the crates be personally delivered to his wax museum.

Chick and Wilbur deliver the crates after hours. They open the first one and find Dracula&#x27;s coffin. When Chick leaves the room to retrieve the second crate, Wilbur reads the Dracula legend and the coffin suddenly opens, and Dracula sneaks out. Wilbur is so frightened he can barely articulate his call for help. When Chick returns, he refuses to believe the story. The boys open the second crate, and Chick goes to greet McDougal. Dracula hypnotizes Wilbur, finds Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster in the second crate, and reanimates him. Both leave and McDougal finds the crates empty and has Wilbur and Chick arrested.

That night, Dr Sandra Mornay welcomes Dracula and the Monster to her island castle. Sandra has seduced Wilbur as part of Dracula&#x27;s plan to give the monster a more obedient brain. Meanwhile, Wilbur and Chick are bailed out of jail by Joan Raymond, an undercover insurance investigator who feigns love for Wilbur, hoping to gain information. Wilbur invites Joan to a masquerade ball that evening. Talbot takes the apartment across the hall from Wilbur and Chick and asks them to help him find and destroy Dracula and the Monster. Wilbur agrees, but Chick remains sceptical.

Wilbur, Chick and Joan go to Sandra&#x27;s castle to pick her up for the ball. Wilbur answers a telephone call from Talbot, who informs them that they are in fact in the &quot;House of Dracula&quot;. Wilbur reluctantly agrees to search the castle and soon stumbles upon a basement staircase, where he has a few close encounters with the monsters. Meanwhile, Joan discovers Dr Frankenstein&#x27;s notebook in Sandra&#x27;s desk, and Sandra finds an Insurance Investigator ID in Joan&#x27;s purse.

Dracula, under the alias of Dr Lejos, introduces himself to Joan and the boys. Also working at the castle and attending the ball is the naïve Professor Stevens, who questions some of the specialized equipment that has arrived. After Wilbur says that he was in the basement, Sandra feigns a headache and tells the others to attend the ball without her. In private, Sandra admits to Dracula that she feels they are not safe to conduct the experiment. Dracula then turns her into a vampire.

At the masquerade ball, Talbot accuses Lejos of being Dracula, but no one takes him seriously. Joan soon disappears. Sandra lures Wilbur into the woods and attempts to bite him, but fails. While looking for Joan, Talbot becomes the Wolfman and attacks McDougal. Since Chick&#x27;s costume is a wolf, McDougal accuses Chick, who escapes and witnesses Dracula hypnotizing Wilbur. Chick is also hypnotized and rendered helpless, while Dracula and Sandra bring Wilbur, Stevens, and Joan back to the castle. The next morning, Chick and Talbot meet up in the bayou and set out to rescue Wilbur and Joan.

Wilbur is quickly freed, but Dracula uses hypnotism to call him back. As Sandra prepares to cut into Wilbur&#x27;s brain, Talbot and Chick burst in. Chick knocks out Sandra with a chair and Talbot tries to release Wilbur but turns into the Wolfman again. Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster breaks free of his bonds and Sandra tries to control him, but he throws her out the window. After a chase through the house between Chick, Wilbur and the Monster and a face-off between Dracula and The Wolf Man, Dracula transforms into a bat but is pounced on by the Wolfman, who drags the two of them to their deaths. Chick and Wilbur escape in boats; while Joan and Stevens set the pier ablaze while the Monster is standing on it, and he dies in the flames.

Wilbur scolds Chick for his earlier scepticism, and Chick remarks they have nothing to fear now. The Invisible Man addresses them from the boat&#x27;s thwart, and they flee in terror.

===Background and development===
On November 28, 1945, Universal Pictures joined with British entrepreneur J. Arthur Rank, who bought a one-fourth interest in the studio. In 1946, Universal reported a profit of only $4.6 million. They responded by dropping many actors from their contract roster, including Chaney. On July 31, 1946, an official merger began. The company, now called Universal–International, had only Deanna Durbin, Maria Montez, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello and a few other actors remaining on their payroll. Since the February 1941 release of &quot;Buck Privates&quot; starring Abbott and Costello, the duo were among the most powerful stars at Universal. By 1945 however, the duo were close to splitting due to in-fighting with each other and personal issues; Abbott suffered from severe epilepsy and Costello had nearly died of rheumatic heart disease in 1943.

In their first year of operation, the studio nearly went bankrupt. By 1948, William Goetz had been in charge of production since the merger and Abbott and Costello&#x27;s popularity was waning. According to director Charles Barton, who was among the top comedy film directors at Universal between 1945 and 1952, Goetz did not want anything to do with Abbott and Costello after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had dropped their option for more films and Camel Cigarettes dropped their radio show in 1947.

===Preproduction===
Robert Arthur, a former writer and associate producer of MGM musicals along with veteran Abbott and Costello writers Frederic Rinaldo and Robert Lees, developed a script that involved Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Count Dracula and the Wolf Man. Their original script also included Kharis the Mummy, Dracula&#x27;s son Count Alucard and the Invisible Man, and involved the Monster becoming Dracula&#x27;s slave and the search for the brain of a simpleton to be placed into the Monster&#x27;s body. Kharis and Alucard were dropped from the script and the Invisible Man was only included as a small gag at the end of the film. On reading the script, initially titled &quot;The Brain of Frankenstein&quot;, Lou Costello responded negatively, stating &quot;You don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do that crap do you? My 5-year-old daughter can write something better than that&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; made the first public announcement of &quot;The Brain of Frankenstein&quot; in July 1947.

Arthur felt strongly about the project and offered Costello a $50,000 advance on his percentage if he agreed to do the film. Among the cast was Glenn Strange, who had previously played the Monster in &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945). Strange had only been in a handful of roles since that film, including Monogram&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Bandit&quot; (1946), Eagle-Lion&#x27;s &quot;Frontier Fighters&quot; (1947) and two for Universal: &quot;Brute Force&quot; (1947) and another Abbott and Costello film, &quot;The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap&quot; (1947). Other actors were called back to reprise roles from previous Universal horror films, including Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. Chaney had been doing stage work on &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. Returning as Dracula was Bela Lugosi, who had not worked in a Hollywood studio since 1946 with &quot;Scared to Death&quot;. Universal-International had Lugosi, Chaney and Strange sign their contracts for the film on January 16, 1948. Lugosi spoke positively about the role during production, glad that the script was not &quot;unbecoming to Dracula&#x27;s dignity&quot; and that &quot;all I have to do is frighten the boys, a perfectly appropriate activity. My trademark will be unblemished&quot;.

===Production===

Production began on February 5, 1948. According to Barton, Abbott and Costello were not happy with working on the project, noting that the two would &quot;fight me like hell. But I stood my ground with them, and so did Bob Arthur&quot;. Barton continued that both the comedians would leave home several times during shooting the film, not show up, or spend about three days playing cards on set. Abbott and Costello improvised some dialogue in the film. Other script alterations were made in the film, such as a week within shooting when producer Robert Arthur decided to change the ending of the film to include a cameo by the Invisible Man.

The film had a new make-up department instead of the old one headed by Jack Pierce. Emile LaVigne tended to Chaney&#x27;s make-up while Jack Kevan worked on Glenn Strange. Both Chaney and Strange required one hour each in the make-up chair each morning, although Strange&#x27;s make-up was mostly a rubber mask.

An accident happened on set when Strange was supposed to throw Lenore Aubert through a window. An invisible wire was attached to her to help Strange lift her, but when she was thrown, she swung back into camera range. Strange tried to catch her, causing him to fall and break his foot. As Strange&#x27;s injury was being treated, Chaney took to applying the make-up and portrayed the monster throwing Aubert through the window. By the end of February, the film&#x27;s title had changed to one closer resembling its final release title. Filming completed on March 20, 1948. A new scene was filmed after production wrapped with Jane Randolph on April 9.

Post-production started immediately on the film. Frank Skinner, who had previously scored &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939) and worked on the score of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, (1941) composed the original score for the film. Some effect shots were filmed in late March. Special effects for the film were developed by David Horsley and Jerome Ash and included the bats that could be seen in the eyes of Miss Aubert and the animation that transformed Lugosi into a bat.

==Release==

Contemporary sources vary on the first release of &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;. The AFI Catalog of Feature Films and Rhodes book &quot;No Traveller Returns&quot; declare it was released on June 15, 1948, with no information on when or where this release took place. Historian Gregory W. Mank has stated in three separate books that the film premiered in Los Angeles at the Forum Theatre on June 25, 1948. Earliest reviews of the film appear in publications such as &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; only on June 28, 1948. Universal-International also did not copyright the film until August 1948.

The film went on to become the most successful film in the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; series since the original release of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931). Along with &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948) and &quot;Tap Roots&quot; (1948), it became one of Universal-International&#x27;s highest grossing features of the year. To promote the film, Universal paid Boris Karloff&#x27;s New York hotel bill to pose outside of Loew&#x27;s Criterion Theatre in New York. Karloff agreed, stating &quot;as long as I don&#x27;t have to see the movie!&quot; Box office was particularly strong in New York City, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles. According to &quot;Variety&quot; the film earned $2.2 million in the US in 1948.

It was initially banned in British Columbia and then later allowed for release after most of the scenes involving the Wolf Man were removed. On the film&#x27;s release in Australia, nearly all the scenes with a monster were removed. In England, the film was released as &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Ghosts&quot;. The film was reissued on March 23, 1956, on a double-bill with &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff&quot;.

===Home media===
On the film&#x27;s release on Laserdisc, Douglas Pratt, author of &quot;The Laser Video Disc Companion&quot; described the disc as &quot;highly sought after&quot; as only a few hundred copies were issued (MCA DiscoVision label release among the first videodisc titles produced in 1978). It was reissued as an Encore Edition afterwards. It was first released on DVD on August 29, 2000, and was re-released several times as part of different Abbott and Costello collections, &quot;The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume Three&quot;, on August 3, 2004, on October 28, 2008, as part of &quot;Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection&quot;, and in 2015 in the &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters Collection&quot;. The film&#x27;s Blu-ray debut and DVD re-release was on September 4, 2012, as part of Universal&#x27;s 100th Anniversary series. It was also included in &quot;Frankenstein: Complete Legacy Collection&quot; (2014) along with seven other Universal Frankenstein films. Because this film includes characters and people featured in their own collections, it is part of the legacy collections of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, and &quot;The Best of Abbott and Costello&quot;.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, trade papers praised the film. A review in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; proclaimed it as a &quot;crazy giddy show&quot; noting that &quot;Robert Arthur&#x27;s production spells out showmanship right down the line, and Charles T. Barton&#x27;s direction keeps things moving at a lively, vigorous pace&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; echoed this praise, stating that Arthur and Barton &quot;can chalk it up as one of the best for [Abbott and Costello]&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Philip K. Scheuer praised the film as &quot;put together with enormous ingenuity. Its comic inventiveness seldom falters, yet it never seriously violates the tradition of the three celebrated creatures who are its antagonists&quot;. The reviews continued to be positive from other industry press papers, including &quot;Film Daily&quot;, &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, and &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot;. On the film&#x27;s release in New York City&#x27;s Lowe&#x27;s Criterion Theatre, the film predominantly received negative reviews from the Manhattan critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that he found the idea of the film amusing but ultimately found it to be an &quot;assembly-line comedy&quot;. The &quot;New York Sun&quot; found the story was a &quot;grand idea, but it was too bad that it could have been attended by persons capable of satire rather than pie-throwing comedy only&quot;. A review from &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; warned audiences that if they did not have the palate for Abbott and Costello&#x27;s comedy the film would be a &quot;painful experience&quot;. The negative response to the film in New York made a review in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; refer to the New York critics as &quot;the &quot;BOO-geymen of Broadway&quot;. One positive mention in New York came from the &quot;New York Star&quot;, which declared that &quot;it&#x27;s heart-warming to see all our favorite monsters once more, each inexorably expressing his individuality, all at the same time. It&#x27;s kind of like a class reunion. They look a little older now, and a little tired. Dracula seems to creak a bit with arthritis as he emerges from his coffin these days, but his bite has lost some of its depth&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, Carlos Clarens wrote about the monster rally films, such as &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944) and &quot;House of Dracula&quot;, in his book &quot;An Illustrated History of the Horror Film&quot; (1967) summarizing that &quot;the sole charm of these films resides in the very proficient contract players that populated them&quot;, but by the time of &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; was released, the film&#x27;s &quot;unconscious parody finally gave way to deliberate spoof&quot; and, at this point, &quot;Universal was flogging a dead horse&quot;.

A later review from Kim Newman writing for &quot;Empire&quot; described it as not one of Abbott and Costello&#x27;s better films, finding they do a lot of &quot;whining and slapping business&quot;. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; stated similar reactions, noting that Abbott and Costello &quot;never got the hang of the kiddie slapstick Universal assigned to them&quot; and that the film was &quot;probably the last of their watchable films, though it&#x27;s a long way from their best&quot;. On reviewing Abbott and Costello&#x27;s output at Universal in 2010, Nick Pinkerton in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; summarized that the duo&#x27;s work was an &quot;all-or-nothing proposition, something you either take or leave&quot; and that described the duo&#x27;s general reception, finding them &quot;stuck somewhere beneath Laurel and Hardy and just above, say, the Ritz Brothers.&quot;

==Legacy==
Following the success of the film, Universal-International paired Abbott and Costello in similar scenarios. The first was &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff&quot; (1949), followed by &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man&quot; (1951), &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1953), and their last film for Universal: &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; (1955). The duo only made one more film afterwards, &quot;Dance with Me, Henry&quot; (1956), which was directed by Barton and made for United Artists.

Lon Chaney Jr. did not have positive things to say about the feature, later proclaiming that he &quot;used to enjoy horror films when there was thought and sympathy involved. Then they became comedies. Abbott and Costello ruined the horror films: they made buffoons out of the monsters...&quot;

Kim Newman declared that &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;, unlike that of &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;House of Dracula&quot;, set a precedent that in films where there are multiple monsters, Dracula will be their leader. This plot element would be replicated in later films such as &quot;The Monster Squad&quot; (1987), &quot;The Creeps&quot; (1997), &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004), &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; (2012) and &quot;Monster Family&quot; (2017).

In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed this film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, The film is number 56 on the list of the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest American Movies&quot;.

Jerry Garcia, of The Grateful Dead, acknowledged the movie as one that &quot;changed my life&quot; and was an inspiration for his art and music.

<text>Adam&#x27;s Rib is a 1949 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by George Cukor from a screenplay written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. It stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as married lawyers who come to oppose each other in court. Judy Holliday co-stars as the third lead in her second credited movie role. Also featured are Tom Ewell, David Wayne, and Jean Hagen. The music was composed by Miklós Rózsa, and the song &quot;Farewell, Amanda&quot; was written by Cole Porter.

The film was well received upon its release and is considered a classic romantic comedy. It ranked at No. 22 on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list. In 1992, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Doris Attinger follows her husband with a gun in Manhattan one day, suspecting he is having an affair with another woman. In her rage, she fires wildly and blindly around the room and at the couple multiple times. One of the bullets hits her husband in the shoulder. His lover escapes unscathed.

The following morning, the married New York lawyers Adam and Amanda Bonner read about the incident in the newspaper. Adam is an assistant district attorney, while Amanda is a solo-practicing defense attorney. They argue over the case. Amanda sympathizes with the woman, particularly noting the double standard that exists for men and women regarding adultery. Adam thinks Doris is guilty of attempted murder. When Adam arrives at work, he learns that he has been assigned to prosecute the case. When Amanda hears this, she seeks out Doris and becomes her defense lawyer.

Amanda bases her case on the belief that women and men are equal, and that Doris had been forced into the situation by her husband&#x27;s adultery and emotional and physical abuse. Adam thinks Amanda is showing contempt for the law, since there should never be any excuse for such criminal behavior. Tension increasingly builds at home as the two battle each other in court. The situation comes to a head as Adam feels humiliated during the trial when Amanda encourages one of her witnesses, a woman weightlifter, to lift him overhead. Later at home that evening, Adam still angry, gives Amanda an earful; he doesn&#x27;t want to be married to a liberated &quot;new woman.&quot; Having just packed his bags, he storms out of their apartment. When the verdict is returned, Amanda&#x27;s plea to the jury to &quot;judge this case as you would if the sexes were reversed&quot; proves successful, and Doris is acquitted.

That night, Adam, who has left their upper-floor apartment, looks through its window and sees the silhouettes of his wife Amanda and their neighbor Kip Lurie, a popular singer, songwriter and piano player who has shown a keen interest in Amanda all along, and repeatedly taunted Adam, as the two of them seem to be dancing and drinking together. Adam breaks into the apartment enraged, pointing a gun at the pair. Amanda is horrified and says to Adam, &quot;You&#x27;ve no right to do thisnobody does!&quot; Adam feels he has proven his point about the injustice of Amanda&#x27;s line of defense. He puts the gun in his mouth, as Amanda and Kip scream in terror. Then Adam bites a large piece off the gun and chews it. It is made of licorice. Amanda is furious with this prank and a three-way fight ensues.

Now in the midst of a divorce, Adam and Amanda reluctantly reunite for a meeting with their tax accountant. Going through their expenses for the year, they talk about their relationship in the past tense. They talk about the farm they own and recall burning the mortgage. Tears begin to roll down Adam&#x27;s cheeks. Astonished and touched, Amanda gently bundles her sobbing husband out of the office and to the farm. That night, Adam announces that he has been selected as the Republican nominee for County Court Judge. Amanda jokes about running for the post as the Democratic candidate. Adam says it would make him cry and demonstrates how easily he can turn on the tears, remarking that men can use crocodile tears to manipulate people too. Amanda says there really isn&#x27;t any difference between the sexes as Adam jumps in bed and closes the curtains, exclaiming otherwise.

==Production==

The screenplay was written specifically as a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle (their sixth film together) by Garson Kanin and actress Ruth Gordon, married script writers who were friends of the couple. Kanin claimed that Judy Holliday initially declined her role because her character is called &quot;fatso&quot; in the script. According to Kanin, the story of &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; was based on the lives of Gordon&#x27;s friends Dorothy and William Dwight Whitney, and of actor Raymond Massey. The Whitneys were married lawyers who represented opposing sides in Massey&#x27;s high-profile divorce from actress Adrienne Allen before pursuing their own divorce in order to marry their clients from the Massey case. Kanin and Gordon saw great potential in the idea of married lawyers as adversaries, and the plot for &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; was developed. Other titles for the film were &quot;Love is Legal&quot; and &quot;Man and Wife&quot;. The MGM front office quickly vetoed the latter as dangerously indiscreet.

Kanin also recalled that Cole Porter refused to write a song for Madelaine, as Hepburn&#x27;s character was originally named, but proceeded when the character&#x27;s name was changed to Amanda. The change allowed Porter to quickly revise a tune he had written during his 1940 adventure in the South Pacific and later discarded as mediocre — &quot;So Long, Samoa.&quot; In June 1949, &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Porter and MGM agreed to donate all profits from the song, rechristened &quot;Farewell, Amanda,&quot; to the Runyon Cancer Fund.

Although set in New York, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; was filmed mainly on MGM&#x27;s stages in Culver City, California. However, location shooting occurred in various parts of New York City, including at the Women&#x27;s House of Detention where Doris Attinger is imprisoned after shooting her husband, and at Gordon and Kanin&#x27;s farm in Connecticut.

Hepburn and Kanin encouraged Judy Holliday to play the role of Doris, and Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn considered her performance a screen test for the lead role in the planned film adaptation of Kanin&#x27;s play &quot;Born Yesterday,&quot; in which Holliday had starred during its Broadway run. Receiving positive notices for &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;, Holliday was cast in the &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; film, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Reception==

According to MGM records, the film earned $2,971,000 in the US and Canada and $976,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $826,000.

Variety staff reviewing the film on December 31, 1949, praised the &quot;...bright comedy success, belting over a succession of sophisticated laughs...This is the sixth Metro teaming of Tracy and Hepburn, and their approach to marital relations around their own hearth is delightfully saucy. A better realization on type than Holliday&#x27;s portrayal of a dumb Brooklyn femme doesn&#x27;t seem possible.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; has a &quot;Fresh&quot; score of 96% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 8.04/10; the consensus for the film says: &quot;Matched by Garson Kanin&#x27;s witty, sophisticated screenplay, George Cukor, Spencer Tracy, and Hepburn are all in top form in the classic comedy Adam&#x27;s Rib.&quot;

Leonard Maltin gives the film four out of four stars, describing it as &quot;[o]ne of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest comedies about the battle of the sexes, with peerless Tracy and Hepburn supported by movie newcomers Holliday, Ewell, Hagen, and Wayne.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Ruth Gordon (later of &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; fame) and Garson Kanin were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story and Screenplay in 1951.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #22
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** #7 Romantic Comedy Film

AFI has also honored the film&#x27;s stars, naming Katharine Hepburn the greatest American screen legend among females and Spencer Tracy #9 among males.
