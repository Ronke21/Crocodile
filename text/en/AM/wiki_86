<text>The Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs, purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, Jehovah 1, is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs&#x27;s followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.

Ivan Stang, who co-founded the Church in the 1970s, serves as its leader and publicist. He has imitated actions of other religious leaders, using the tactic of culture jamming in an attempt to parody better-known faiths. Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in absolute truths. The group holds that the quality of &quot;Slack&quot; is of utmost importance, but it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church&#x27;s message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to Discordianism. Journalists often consider the Church an elaborate joke, but some academics have defended it as a real system of deeply held beliefs.

==Origins==
The Church of the SubGenius was founded by Ivan Stang (born Douglas St. Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox) as the SubGenius Foundation. Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group&#x27;s inception. The organization&#x27;s first recorded activity was the publication of a photocopied document, &quot;Sub Genius Pamphlet #1&quot;, disseminated in Dallas, Texas in 1979. The document announced the impending end of the world and the possible deaths of its readers. It criticized Christian conceptions of God and New Age perceptions of spirituality.

Church leaders maintain that a man named J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs founded the group in 1953. SubGenius members constructed an elaborate account of Dobbs&#x27;s life, which commentators describe as fictional. The members assert that he telepathically contacted Drummond in 1972, before meeting him in person the next year, and that Drummond persuaded Stang to join shortly afterward. Stang has called himself Dobbs&#x27;s &quot;sacred scribe&quot; and a &quot;professional maven of weirdness&quot;.

==Online history==
The popularization of the Internet in the mid-1990s brought a new surge of interest in the church, resulting in dozens of homemade, elaborately decorated websites and two Usenet newsgroups, &quot;alt.slack&quot; and &quot;alt.binaries.slack.&quot; A third newsgroup, &quot;alt.binaries.multimedia.slack,&quot; was created later, in 2005. Ivan Stang currently maintains the official SubGenius home page. The church&#x27;s weekly radio program, the &quot;Hour of Slack&quot;, is a staple of many college radio stations. It draws from live broadcasts by Stang, his wife Princess Wei R. Doe and voice comic &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Dave&quot; (comedian/musician Dave DeLuca), as well as from other SubGenius radio shows. 

==Beliefs==

===Deities===

The Church of the SubGenius&#x27;s ostensible beliefs defy categorization or a simple narrative. The group has an intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants. Its primary deity, generally known as Jehovah 1, is an extraterrestrial who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah 1 gave him supernatural knowledge of the past and future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.

Jehovah 1 and his spouse Eris, regarded by the Church as &quot;relatively evil&quot;, are classified as &quot;rebel gods&quot;. SubGenius leaders note that Jehovah 1 is wrathful, a quality expressed by his &quot;stark fist of removal&quot;. The Church teaches that they are part of the Elder Gods, who are committed to human pain, but that Jehovah 1 is &quot;relatively good&quot; in comparison. Yog-Sothoth, a character from H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, is the Elder Gods&#x27; leader. In her 2010 study of the Church of the SubGenius, religious scholar Carole M. Cusack of the University of Sydney states that Lovecraft&#x27;s work is a &quot;model for the Church of the SubGenius&#x27;s approach to scripture&quot;, in that aspects of his fiction were treated as real by some within paganism, just as the Church appropriates aspects of popular culture in its spirituality.

===J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs===
SubGenius leaders teach that J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs&#x27;s nature is ineffable and consequently stylize his nickname &quot;Bob&quot; with quotation marks even when used alone. They call him a &quot;World Avatar&quot; and hold that he has died and been reborn many times. The Church&#x27;s primary symbol is an icon of his face in which he smokes a pipe. Stang has said the image was taken from Yellow Pages clip art, and it has been likened to Ward Cleaver, Mark Trail, or a 1950s-era salesman. The Church&#x27;s canon contains references to aspects of United States culture in that decade; religious scholar Danielle Kirby of RMIT University argues that this type of reference &quot;simultaneously critiques and subverts&quot; the American dream.

In one version of the Church&#x27;s mythology, Jehovah 1 intended Dobbs to lead a powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused; instead, he infiltrated and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders have taught that he was a very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet, where he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis; the Church teaches that SubGenius members are descended from them. Originally, the only relative of Dobbs the Church identified was his mother, Jane McBride DobbsChurch leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother&#x27;s husband as the reason for not revealing his father.

In another version, as a child &quot;Bob,&quot; then known as Bobby, was not highly intelligent, but incredibly lucky. He copied the homework of Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Marsh, who later became a model, actress, and finally his wife as Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Marsh Dobbs SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs&#x27;s occupation as &quot;drilling equipment&quot; or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe he is capable of time travel, and that this results in occasional changes to doctrine (the &quot;Sacred Doctrine of Erasability&quot;). Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.

===Conspiracy and &quot;Slack&quot;===
The Church of the SubGenius&#x27;s literature incorporates many aspects of conspiracy theories, teaching that there is a grand conspiracy at the root of all lesser ones. It says that there are many UFOs, most of which are used by the conspiracy leaders to monitor humans, though a few contain extraterrestrials. In the Church&#x27;s view, this conspiracy uses a façade of empowering messages but manipulates people so that they become indoctrinated into its service. The Church calls these individuals &quot;pinks&quot; and states that they are blissfully unaware of the organization&#x27;s power and control. SubGenius leaders teach that most cultural and religious mores are the conspiracy&#x27;s propaganda. They maintain that their followers, but not the pinks, are capable of developing an imagination; the Church teaches that Dobbs has empowered its members to see through these illusions. Owing to their descent from Yetis, the Church&#x27;s followers have a capacity for deep understanding that the pinks lack. Cultural studies scholar Solomon Davidoff states that the Church develops a &quot;satiric commentary&quot; on religion, morality, and conspiracies.

SubGenius members believe that those in the service of the conspiracy seek to bar them from &quot;Slack&quot;, a quality promoted by the Church. Its teachings center on &quot;Slack&quot; (always capitalized), which is never concisely defined, though Dobbs is said to embody it. Church members seek to acquire Slack and believe it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) they claim as an entitlement. Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain Slack. Davidoff believes that Slack is &quot;the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals&quot;. Cusack states that the Church&#x27;s description of Slack as ineffable recalls the way that Tao is described, and Kirby calls Slack a &quot;unique magical system&quot;.

==Members==

The Church of the SubGenius&#x27;s founders were based in Dallas when they distributed their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1999. In 2009, Stang claimed the Church had 40,000 members, but the actual number may have been much lower. As of 2022, becoming a minister in the Church costs $50, but is on sale for $44.99. Stang has estimated that there are 10,000 ministers and that the Church&#x27;s annual income has reached $100,000. In October 2017, the Church moved to Glen Rose, Texas.

Most SubGenius members are male, and, according to Stang, many are social outcasts. He maintains that those who do not fit into society will ultimately triumph over those who do. The Church has experienced success &quot;converting&quot; college students, particularly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including San Francisco, Little Rock, and Cleveland. A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult followers, the very concept the SubGenius parodies. Stang has expressed concern that the Church&#x27;s doctrines could exacerbate preexisting psychoses of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents.

Notable associates of the Church include Mark Mothersbaugh, Mojo Nixon, Zoogz Rift, Paul Mavrides, Paul Reubens, members of Negativland, David Byrne, and R. Crumb. Crumb provided early publicity for the church by reprinting &quot;Sub Genius Pamphlet&quot; #1 in his comics anthology &quot;Weirdo&quot;. References to the Church are present in several works of art, including the Internet-based collaborative fiction &quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat&quot;, the comic book &quot;The Middleman&quot;, the band Sublime&#x27;s album &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot;, and the television program &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

===Instructions===
Church leaders have issued instructions to their followers; Robert Latham of the University of California, Riverside, calls their ideology &quot;anarcholibertarian&quot;. Five commands embody the group&#x27;s values:
* Shun regular employment and stop working. This encapsulates the Church&#x27;s view that to repent is to &quot;SLACK OFF&quot;, as opposed to working for a living. SubGenius leaders say it is permissible for members to collect public assistance in lieu of maintaining employment.
* Purchase products sold by the Church, which its leaders say Dobbs founded to gain wealth. Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly admits it is for-profit (presumably mocking religious groups that seem to have ulterior financial motives). Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the &quot;greed is good&quot; mentality of the 1980s, and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes &quot;the consumption of popular cultural artefacts&quot;, this consumption is &quot;simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix&quot;.
* Rebel against &quot;law and order&quot;. Specifically, the Church condemns security cameras and encourages computer hacking. Cusack notes that this instruction recalls Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s critique of law and order.
* Rid the world of everyone who did not descend from yetis. SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs hopes to rid the Earth of 90% of humanity, making the Earth &quot;clear&quot;. The group praises drug abuse and abortion as effective methods of culling unneeded individuals.
* Exploit fear, specifically that of people who are part of the conspiracy. Church leaders teach conspiracy members to fear SubGenius devotees.

==Events==

===Devivals===

Local groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as &quot;clenches&quot;. They host periodic events known as &quot;devivals&quot;, which include sermons, music, and other art forms. The term is used by both the Church of the SubGenius and Discordianism for a gathering or festival of followers. The name is a pun on Christian revivals.

At devivals, leaders take comical names and give angry rants. Many take place at bars or similar venues. Cusack compares the style of the services to Pentecostal revivalism; David Giffels of the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; calls them &quot;campy preaching sessions&quot;. Cusack posits that these events are examples of Peter Lamborn Wilson&#x27;s concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended. On one occasion, the presence of a Church leader&#x27;s wife at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. But the publicity surrounding the event was a boon to the Church&#x27;s recruitment efforts.

The Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters from fiction and popular culture, such as Monty Python, Dracula, and Klaatu. The Association for Consciousness Exploration and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events. Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church&#x27;s focus on individualism, though the &quot;Book of the SubGenius&quot; discusses community.

SubGenius devivals are not regularly scheduled, but are recorded on the SubGenius website. Devivals have been held in multiple U.S. states, as well as China, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Church has also held Devivals at non-SubGenius events, such as Burning Man and the Starwood Festival.
&quot;The Cyclone of Slack&quot; was a devival in Portland, Oregon, in October 2009 put on by the Church of the SubGenius and the organizers of Esozone. One of its more bizarre moments was when the alcohol and fire-and-brimstone sermon-fueled crowd in front of the stage began to sit down in twos and threes when the Duke of Uke began to play his ukulele.

===X-Day===
In early SubGenius literature, July 5, 1998, was introduced as a significant date, later becoming known as &quot;X-Day&quot;. The Church held that Dobbs identified the date&#x27;s significance in the 1950s, claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet X, would arrive on Earth. SubGenius leaders said their paying members would be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed, though a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell. In anticipation of the event, X-Day &quot;drills&quot; were held in 1996 and 1997.

In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a &quot;clothing-optional&quot; campground in Sherman, New York, attended by about 400 members. The event was ostensibly to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at the time, Stang produced a sacred piece of paper with &quot;Bob&quot;s handwritten date of X-day, proving judgment was officially scheduled for 1998. However, Papa Joe Mama (the &quot;Minister of Sinister&quot;) snatched the paper from Stang&#x27;s hands and turned it upside down, declaring that Stang must have read it backward (8661); this has been interpreted by the authors David Beard and Joshua Gunn as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics dismissed the event as a prank or &quot;performance art&quot;. Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack calls the productions carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays.

==Publishing==

=== Online ===
The Church of the SubGenius established a website in May 1993, and its members were very active on Usenet in the 1990s.

=== Print ===
Although it has gained a significant online presence, it was successful before the advent of Internet communities. The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of zines; Cusack notes that its use of the medium can be seen as a rejection of the alienation of labor practices.

The SubGenius Foundation published several official teachings, as well as non-doctrinal works by Stang. The &quot;Book of the SubGenius&quot;, which discusses Slack at length, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster and sold 30,000 copies in its first five years in print. Kirby calls it a &quot;call to arms for the forces of absurdity&quot;. Its juxtaposition, visual style, and content mirror the group as a whole. It draws themes from fiction as well as established and new religions, parodying a number of topics, including the Church of the SubGenius itself.

A number of SubGenius members have written stories to build their mythology, which have been compiled and published. Their core texts are disordered, presented in the style of a collage. Kirby notes that the group&#x27;s texts are a bricolage of cultural artifacts remixed into a new creation. In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which she calls a &quot;web of references&quot;.

=== Video ===
The group was promoted by a video Stang produced in 1992. 

=== Radio ===
The Church of the SubGenius hosts several radio shows throughout the world, including broadcasters in Atlanta, Ohio, Maryland, and California. Several radio stations in the United States and two in Canada broadcast &quot;The Hour of Slack&quot;, the Church&#x27;s most popular audio production.

=== Podcast ===
&quot;The Hour of Slack&quot; can also be heard in podcast form.

==Analysis and commentary==

===Comparative religion===
The Church&#x27;s teachings have been perceived as satirizing Christianity and Scientology, earning the Church a reputation as a parody religion. Church leaders have said that Dobbs met L. Ron Hubbard, and SubGenius narratives echo extraterrestrial themes found in Scientology. Cusack notes Jehovah 1 bears similarities to Xenu, a powerful alien found in some Scientologist writings. The Church&#x27;s rhetoric text has also been described as a satirical imitation of the televangelism of the 1980s. Cusack sees the Church&#x27;s faux commercialism as culture jamming targeting prosperity theology, calling the faux commercialism &quot;a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion&quot;. Religious scholar Thomas Alberts of the University of London views the Church as attempting to &quot;subvert the idea of authenticity in religion&quot; by mirroring other religions to create a sense of both similarity and alterity.

Cusack compares the Church of the SubGenius to the Ranters, a radical 17th-century pantheist movement in England that made statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has &quot;legitimate pedigree in the history of Western religion&quot;. The American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight likens the Church to the Moorish Orthodox Church of America, a 20th-century American syncretic religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.

There are a number of similarities between the Church of the SubGenius and Discordianism. Eris, the goddess of chaos worshiped by adherents of the latter, is believed by members of the Church of the SubGenius to be Jehovah 1&#x27;s wife and an ally to humans. Like Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius rejects absolute truth and embraces contradictions and paradoxes. Religious scholar David Chidester of the University of Cape Town views the Church as a &quot;Discordian offshoot&quot;, and Kirby sees it as &quot;a child of the Discordians&quot;. Both groups were heavily influenced by the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, whom SubGenius members call &quot;Pope Bob&quot;. Kirby states that the two groups have elements of bricolage and absurdity in common, but the Church of the SubGenius more explicitly remixes pop culture.

===Categorization===
According to Carole M. Cusack, scholars often have difficulty defining the Church. Commentators generally place the Church in the category of &quot;joke religions&quot;, which is often seen as pejorative. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of the faith. Other terms used to describe the Church include &quot;faux cult&quot;, &quot;[postmodern] cult&quot;, &quot;satirical pseudoreligion&quot;, &quot;sophisticated joke religion&quot;, &quot;anti-religion religion&quot;, and &quot;high parody of cultdom&quot;. Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion. Stang described the group as both &quot;satire and a real stupid religion&quot;, and contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions.

Cusack states that the Church &quot;must be accorded the status of a functional equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not &#x27;authentic&#x27; religion&quot;. She sees it as &quot;arguably a legitimate path to liberation&quot;, citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism. Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony. Alberts believes there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term &quot;fake religion&quot; to describe it. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as part of a group of &quot;popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence, and arbitrariness seem to mock religion&quot;. Knight characterizes the Church as &quot;at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right&quot;.

===Appraisal===
Kirby argues that the Church forms a counterpart to Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s concept of hyperreality, arguing, &quot;they create, rather than consume, popular culture in the practice of their spirituality&quot;. She calls their remixing of popular culture sources an &quot;explicitly creative process&quot;, maintaining that it prompts the reader to adopt some of the group&#x27;s views by forcing &quot;the individual to reconsider normative methods of approaching the content&quot;. She states that the group attempts to &quot;strip references of their original meaning without necessarily losing their status as icons&quot;.

Kirby also sees the Church&#x27;s goal as deconstructing &quot;normative modes of thought and behavior&quot; in American culture; she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people. She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness as a measure of devotion, an approach she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that irony is a commonplace value that most religions have ignored. By embracing the quality of irony, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups.

Literature scholar Paul Mann of Pomona College is critical of the Church of the SubGenius. He notes that the Church purports to present the truth through absurdity and faults it for insufficiently examining the concept of truth itself. In addition, he believes that the group responds to criticism in a &quot;hysterical, literal, fantastic&quot; way.

Anarchist writer Bob Black, a former member, criticized the Church, alleging that it has become conformist and submissive to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper &quot;Bedfordshire on Sunday&quot; after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.

<text>St Albans Cathedral, officially the Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban, also known as &quot;the Abbey&quot;, is a Church of England cathedral in St Albans, England.

Much of its architecture dates from Norman times. It ceased to be an abbey following its dissolution in the 16th century and became a cathedral in 1877. Although legally a cathedral church, it differs in certain particulars from most other cathedrals in England, being also used as a parish church, of which the dean is rector with the same powers, responsibilities and duties as those of any other parish. At 85 metres long, it has the longest nave of any cathedral in England.

Probably founded in the 8th century, the present building is Norman or Romanesque architecture of the 11th century, with Gothic and 19th-century additions.

==Britain&#x27;s first Christian martyr==
According to Bede, whose account of the saint&#x27;s life is the most elaborate, Alban lived in Verulamium, some time during the 3rd or 4th centuries. At that time Christians began to suffer cruel persecution. The legend proceeds with Alban meeting a Christian priest (known as Amphibalus) fleeing from persecutors, and sheltering him in his house for a number of days. Alban was so impressed with the priest&#x27;s faith and piety that he soon converted to Christianity. Eventually Roman soldiers came to seize the priest, but Alban put on his cloak and presented himself to the soldiers in place of his guest. Alban was brought before a judge and was sentenced to beheading. As he was led to execution, he came to a fast flowing river, commonly believed to be the River Ver, crossed it and went about 500 paces to a gently sloping hill overlooking a beautiful plain When he reached the summit he began to thirst and prayed that God would give him drink, whereupon water sprang up at his feet. It was at this place that his head was struck off. Immediately after one of the executioners delivered the fatal stroke, his eyes fell out and dropped to the ground alongside Alban&#x27;s head. Later versions of the tale say that Alban&#x27;s head rolled downhill and that a well gushed up where it stopped. St Albans Cathedral stands near the supposed site of Alban&#x27;s martyrdom, and references to the spontaneous well are extant in local place names. The nearby river was called Halywell (Middle English for &#x27;Holy Well&#x27;) in the medieval era, and the road up to Holmhurst Hill on which the Abbey now stands is now called Holywell Hill but has been called Halliwell Street and other variations at least since the 13th century. The remains of a well structure have been found at the bottom of Holywell Hill. However, this well is thought to date from no earlier than the 19th century.

The date of Alban&#x27;s execution has never been firmly established. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; lists the year 283, but Bede places it in 305. Original sources and modern historians such as William Hugh Clifford Frend and Charles Thomas indicate the period of 251–259 (under the persecutors Decius or Valerian) as more likely.

The tomb of St Amphibalus is in the cathedral.

==History of the abbey and cathedral==
===Romano-British Shrine===

A &quot;memoria&quot; over the execution point holding the remains of Alban existed at the site from the mid-4th century (possibly earlier). According to Bede, a Christian shrine together with its martyr cult survived from Roman times until the eighth century, although this may be due to British control of this area. Bede also mentions a church and Gildas a shrine. Bishop Germanus of Auxerre visited in 429. This is seen as evidence of the continuation of Christianity in heavily Saxonised south and east Britain. The style of this structure is unknown; the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris (see below) said the Saxons destroyed the building in 586.

===Saxon buildings===
Offa II of Mercia, is said to have founded a double monastery at St Albans in 793. It followed the Benedictine rule. The Abbey was built on Holmhurst Hill—now Holywell Hill—across the River Ver from the ruins of Verulamium. Again there is no information to the form of the first abbey.

Abbot Ulsinus founded St Albans Market outside of the Waxhouse Gate, on what is now Market Place, in to generate income for the Abbey and to form the centre of a new town.

The Abbey was probably sacked by the Danes around 890 and, despite Paris&#x27;s claims, the office of abbot remained empty from around 920 until the 970s when the efforts of Dunstan reached the town.

There was an intention to rebuild the Abbey in 1005 when Abbot Ealdred was licensed to remove building material from Verulamium. With the town resting on clay and chalk, the only tough stone is flint. This was used with a lime mortar and then either plastered over or left bare. With the great quantities of brick, tile and other stone in Verulamium, the Roman site became a prime source of building material for the Abbey and other projects in the area. Sections demanding worked stone used Lincolnshire limestone (Barnack stone) from Verulamium; later worked stones include Totternhoe freestone from Bedfordshire, Purbeck marble, and different limestones (Ancaster, Chilmark, Clipsham, etc.).

Renewed Viking raids from 1016 stalled the Saxon efforts and very little from the Saxon abbey was incorporated in the later forms.

===Norman abbey===
Much of the current layout and proportions of the structure date from the first Norman abbot, Paul of Caen (1077–1093). The 14th abbot, he was appointed by his uncle, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc.

Building work started in the year of Abbot Paul&#x27;s arrival. The design and construction was overseen by the Norman Robert the Mason. The plan has very limited Anglo-Saxon elements and is clearly influenced by the French work at Cluny, Bernay and Caen, and shares a similar floor plan to Saint-Étienne in Caen and Lanfranc&#x27;s Canterbury—although the poorer quality building material was a new challenge for Robert and he clearly borrowed some Roman techniques, which were learned while gathering material in the ruins of Verulamium.

To make maximum use of the hilltop the Abbey was oriented to the south-east. The cruciform abbey was the largest built in England at that time, it had a chancel of four bays, a transept containing seven apses, and a nave of ten bays—fifteen bays long overall. Robert gave particular attention to solid foundations, running a continuous wall of layered bricks, flints and mortar below and pushing the foundations down to twelve feet to hit bedrock. Below the crossing tower special large stones were used.

The tower was a particular triumph—it is the only 11th-century great crossing tower still standing in England. Robert began with special thick supporting walls and four massive brick piers. The four-level tower tapers at each stage with clasping buttresses on the three lower levels and circular buttresses on the fourth stage. The entire structure masses 5,000 tons and is 144 feet high. The tower was probably topped with a Norman pyramidal roof; the current roof is flat. The original ringing chamber had five bells—two paid for by the Abbot, two by a wealthy townsman, and one donated by the rector of Hoddesdon. None of these bells has survived.

There was a widespread belief that the Abbey had two additional, smaller towers at the west end. No remains have been found.

The monastic abbey was completed in 1089 but not consecrated until Holy Innocents&#x27; Day (28 December), 1115, by the Archbishop of Rouen. King Henry I attended as did many bishops and nobles.

A nunnery (Sopwell Priory) was founded nearby in 1140.

Internally the Abbey church was bare of sculpture, almost stark. The plaster walls were coloured and patterned in parts, with extensive tapestries adding colour. Sculptural decoration was added, mainly ornaments, as it became more fashionable in the 12th century—especially after the Gothic style arrived in England around 1170.

In the current structure the original Norman arches survive principally under the central tower and on the north side of the nave. The arches in the rest of the building are Gothic, following medieval rebuilding and extensions, and Victorian era restoration.

The Abbey was extended in the 1190s by Abbot John de Cella (also known as John of Wallingford) (1195–1214); as the number of monks grew from fifty to over a hundred, the Abbey church was extended westwards with three bays added to the nave. The severe Norman west front was also rebuilt by Hugh de Goldclif—although how is uncertain; it was very costly but its &#x27;rapid&#x27; weathering and later alterations have erased all but fragments. A more prominent shrine and altar to Saint Amphibalus were also added. The work was very slow under de Cella and was not completed until the time of Abbot William de Trumpington (1214–1235). The low Norman tower roof was demolished and a new, much higher, broached spire was raised, sheathed in lead.

The St Albans Psalter (–1145) is the best known of a number of important Romanesque illuminated manuscripts produced in the Abbey scriptorium. Later, Matthew Paris, a monk at St Albans from 1217 until his death in 1259, was important both as a chronicler and an artist. Eighteen of his manuscripts survive and are a rich source of contemporary information for historians.

Nicholas Breakspear was born near St Albans, reportedly at Abbots Langley, and applied to be admitted to the Abbey as a novice, but he was turned down. He eventually managed to be accepted into an abbey in France. In 1154 he was elected Pope Adrian IV, the only English Pope there has ever been. The head of the Abbey was confirmed as the premier abbot in England also in 1154.

The Abbey had a number of daughter houses, ranging from Tynemouth Priory in the north to Binham Priory near the Norfolk coast.

===13th to 15th centuries===

An earthquake shook the Abbey in 1250 and damaged the eastern end of the church. In 1257 the dangerously cracked sections were knocked down — three apses and two bays. The thick Presbytery wall supporting the tower was left. The rebuilding and updating was completed during the rule of Abbot Roger de Norton (1263–90) who founded an additional market in Watford.

On 10 October 1323 two piers on the south side of the nave collapsed dragging down much of the roof and wrecking five bays. Mason Henry Wy undertook the rebuilding, matching the Early English style of the rest of the bays but adding distinctly 14th-century detailing and ornaments. The shrine to St Amphibalus had also been damaged and it was remade.


Richard of Wallingford, abbot from 1297 to 1336 and a mathematician and astronomer, designed a celebrated astronomical clock, which was completed by William of Walsham after his death, but apparently destroyed during the Reformation. In 1334 he founded two additional markets in Codicote and High Barnet.

A new gateway, now called the Abbey Gateway, was built to the Abbey grounds in 1365, which was the only part of the monastery buildings (besides the church) to survive the dissolution, later being used as a prison and now (since 1871) part of St Albans School. The other monastic buildings were located to the south of the gateway and church.

In the 15th century a large west window of nine main lights and a deep traced head was commissioned by John of Wheathampstead. The spire was reduced to a &#x27;Hertfordshire spike&#x27;, the roof pitch greatly reduced and battlements liberally added. Further new windows, at £50 each, were put in the transepts by Abbot Wallingford (also known as William of Wallingford), who also had a new high altar screen made.

===Dissolution and after===
After the death of Abbot Ramryge in 1521 the Abbey fell into debt and slow decay under three weak abbots. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and its surrender on 5 December 1539 the income was £2,100 annually. The abbot and remaining forty monks were pensioned off and then the buildings were looted. All gold, silver and gilt objects were carted away with all other valuables; stonework was broken and defaced and graves opened to search for riches. The Abbey became part of the diocese of Lincoln in 1542 and was moved to the diocese of London in 1550. 

The buildings suffered—neglect, second-rate repairs, even active damage. Richard Lee purchased all the buildings, except the church and chapel and some other Crown premises, in 1538, 1539, or 1540. In 1549, Lee began systematic demolition, including the removal and sale of the stone, except for what may have been retained to improve Lee Hall at Sopwell. In March 1550, Lee returned the land to the abbot by grant. The area was named Abbey Ruins for the next 200 years or so.

In 1553 the Lady chapel was used as a school, the Great Gatehouse as a town jail, some other buildings passed to the Crown, and the Abbey Church was sold to the town for £400 in 1553 by King Edward VI to be the church of the parish.

The cost of upkeep fell upon the town, although in 1596 and at irregular intervals later the Archdeacon was allowed to collect money for repairs by Brief in the diocese. After James I visited in 1612 he authorised another Brief, which collected around £2,000—most of which went on roof repairs. The English Civil War slashed the monies spent on repairs, while the Abbey Church was used to hold prisoners of war and suffered from their vandalism, as well as that of their guards. Most of the metal objects that had survived the Dissolution were also removed and other ornamental parts were damaged in Puritan sternness. Another round of fund-raising in 1681–1684 was again spent on the roof, repairing the Presbytery vault. A royal grant from William III and Mary II in 1689 went on general maintenance, &#x27;repairs&#x27; to conceal some of the then considered unfashionable Gothic features, and on new internal fittings. There was a second royal grant from William in 1698.

By the end of the 17th century the dilapidation was sufficient for a number of writers to comment upon it.

In 1703, from 26 November to 1 December, the Great Storm raged across southern England; the Abbey lost the south transept window which was replaced in wood at a cost of £40. The window was clear glass with five lights and three transoms in an early Gothic Revival style by John Hawgood. Other windows, although not damaged in the storm, were a constant drain on the Abbey budget in the 18th century.

A brief written in 1723–1724, seeking £5,775, notes a great crack in the south wall, that the north wall was eighteen inches from vertical, and that the roof timbers were decayed to the point of danger. The money raised was spent on the nave roof over ten bays.

Another brief was not issued until 1764. Again the roof was rotting, as was the south transept window, walls were cracked or shattered in part and the south wall had subsided and now leant outwards. Despite a target of £2,500 a mere £600 was raised.

In the 1770s the Abbey came close to demolition; the expense of repairs meant a scheme to destroy the Abbey and erect a smaller church almost succeeded.

A storm in 1797 caused some subsidence, cracking open graves, scattering pavement tiles, flooding the church interior and leaving a few more arches off-vertical.

===19th century===

This century was marked with a number of repair schemes. The Abbey received some money from the 1818 &quot;Million Act&quot;, and in 1820, £450 was raised to buy an organ—a second-hand example made in 1670.

The major efforts to revive the Abbey Church came under four men—L. N. Cottingham, H. J. B. Nicholson (Rector), and, especially, George Gilbert Scott and Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe.

In February 1832 a portion of the clerestory wall fell through the roof of the south aisle, leaving a hole almost thirty feet long. With the need for serious repair work evident, the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham was called in to survey the building. His &quot;Survey&quot; was presented in 1832 and was worrying reading: everywhere mortar was in a wretched condition and wooden beams were rotting and twisting. Cottingham recommended new beams throughout the roof and a new steeper pitch, removal of the spire and new timbers in the tower, new paving, ironwork to hold the west transept wall up, a new stone south transept window, new buttresses, a new drainage system for the roof, new ironwork on almost all the windows, and on and on. He estimated a cost of £14,000. A public subscription of £4,000 was raised, of which £1,700 vanished in expenses. With the limited funds the clerestory wall was rebuilt, the nave roof re-leaded, the tower spike removed, some forty blocked windows reopened and glazed, and the south window remade in stone.

Henry Nicholson, rector from 1835 to 1866, was also active in repairing the Abbey Church—as far as he could, and in uncovering lost or neglected Gothic features.

In 1856 repair efforts began again; £4,000 was raised and slow moves started to gain the Abbey the status of cathedral. George Gilbert Scott was appointed the project architect and oversaw a number of works from 1860 until his death in 1878.
Scott began by having the medieval floor restored, necessitating the removal of tons of earth, and fixing the north aisle roof. From 1872 to 1877 the restored floors were re-tiled in matching stone and copies of old tile designs. A further 2,000 tons of earth were shifted in 1863 during work on the foundation and a new drainage system. In 1870 the tower piers were found to be badly weakened with many cracks and cavities. Huge timbers were inserted and the arches filled with brick as an emergency measure. Repair work took until May 1871 and cost over £2,000. The south wall of the nave was now far from straight; Scott reinforced the north wall and put in scaffolding to take the weight of the roof off the wall, then had it jacked straight in under three hours. The wall was then buttressed with five huge new masses and set right. Scott was lauded as &quot;saviour of the Abbey.&quot; From 1870 to 1875 around £20,000 was spent on the Abbey.

In 1845 St Albans was transferred from the Diocese of Lincoln to the Diocese of Rochester. Then, in 1875, the Bishopric of St Albans Act was passed and on 30 April 1877 the See of St Albans was created, which comprises about 300 churches in the counties of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. Thomas Legh Claughton, then Bishop of Rochester, elected to take the northern division of his old diocese and on 12 June 1877 was enthroned first Bishop of St Albans, a position he held until 1890. He is buried in the churchyard on the north side of the nave.

George Gilbert Scott was working on the nave roof, vaulting and west bay when he died on 27 March 1878. His plans were partially completed by his son, John Oldrid Scott, but the remaining work fell into the hands of Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe, whose efforts have attracted much controversy—Nikolaus Pevsner calling him a &quot;pompous, righteous bully.&quot; However, he donated much of the immense sum of £130,000 the work cost.

Whereas Scott&#x27;s work had clearly been in sympathy with the existing building, Grimthorpe&#x27;s plans reflected the Victorian ideal. Indeed, he spent considerable time dismissing and criticising the work of Scott and the efforts of his son.

Grimthorpe first reinstated the original pitch of the roof, although the battlements added for the lower roof were retained. Completed in 1879, the roof was leaded, following on Scott&#x27;s desires.

His second major project was the most controversial. The west front, with the great Wheathampstead window, was cracked and leaning, and Grimthorpe, never more than an amateur architect, designed the new front himself—attacked as dense, misproportioned and unsympathetic: &quot;His impoverishment as a designer ... [is] evident&quot;; &quot;this man, so practical and ingenious, was utterly devoid of taste ... his great qualities were marred by arrogance ... and a lack of historic sense&quot;. Counter proposals were deliberately substituted by Grimthorpe for poorly drawn versions and Grimthorpe&#x27;s design was accepted. During building it was considerably reworked in order to fit the actual frontage and is not improved by the poor quality sculpture. Work began in 1880 and was completed in April 1883, having cost £20,000.
Grimthorpe was noted for his aversion to the Perpendicular—to the extent that he would have sections he disliked demolished as &quot;too rotten&quot; rather than remade. In his reconstruction, especially of windows, he commonly mixed architectural styles carelessly (see the south aisle, the south choir screen and vaulting). He spent £50,000 remaking the nave. Elsewhere he completely rebuilt the south wall cloisters, with new heavy buttresses, and removed the arcading of the east cloisters during rebuilding the south transept walls. In the south transept he completely remade the south face, completed in 1885, including the huge lancet window group—his proudest achievement—and the flanking turrets; a weighty new tiled roof was also made. In the north transept Grimthorpe had the Perpendicular window demolished and his design inserted—a rose window of circles, cusped circles and lozenges arrayed in five rings around the central light, sixty-four lights in total, each circle with a different glazing pattern.

Grimthorpe continued through the Presbytery in his own style, adapting the antechapel for Consistory Courts, and into the Lady Chapel. After a pointed lawsuit with Henry Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham, over who should direct the restoration, Grimthorpe had the vault remade and reproportioned in stone, made the floor in black and white marble (1893), and had new Victorian arcading and sculpture put below the canopy work. Externally the buttresses were expanded to support the new roof, and the walls were refaced.

As early as 1897, Grimthorpe was having to return to previously renovated sections to make repairs. His use of over-strong cement led to cracking, while his fondness for ironwork in windows led to corrosion and damage to the surrounding stone.

Grimthorpe died in 1905 and was interred in the churchyard. He left a bequest for continuing work on the buildings.

During this century the name &quot;St Albans Abbey&quot; was given to one of the town&#x27;s two railway stations.

===20th century===
John Oldrid Scott (died 1913) (George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s son), despite frequent clashes with Grimthorpe, had continued working within the cathedral. Scott was a steadfast supporter of the Gothic revival and designed the tomb of the first bishop; he had a new bishop&#x27;s throne built (1903), together with commemorative stalls for Festing (a bishop) and two archdeacons, and new choir stalls. He also repositioned and rebuilt the organ (1907). Further work was interrupted by the war.

A number of memorials to the war were added to the cathedral, notably the painting &quot;The Passing of Eleanor&quot; by Frank Salisbury (stolen 1973) and the reglazing of the main west window, dedicated in 1925.

Following the Enabling Act of 1919, control of the buildings passed to a Parochial Church Council (replaced by the Cathedral Council in 1968), who appointed the woodwork specialist John Rogers as Architect and Surveyor of the Fabric. He uncovered extensive death watch beetle damage in the presbytery vault and oversaw the repair (1930–31). He had four tons of rubbish removed from the crossing tower and the main timbers reinforced (1931–32), and invested in the extensive use of insecticide throughout the wood structures. In 1934, the eight bells were overhauled and four new bells added to be used in the celebration of George V&#x27;s silver jubilee.
Cecil Brown was architect and surveyor from 1939 to 1962. At first he merely oversaw the lowering of the bells for the war and established a fire watch, with the pump in the slype. After the war, in the 1950s, the organ was removed, rebuilt and reinstalled, and new pews added. His major work was on the crossing tower. Grimthorpe&#x27;s cement was found to be damaging the Roman bricks: every brick in the tower was replaced as needed and reset in proper mortar by one man, Walter Barrett. The tower ceiling was renovated as were the nave murals. Brown established the Muniments Room to gather and hold all the church documents.

In 1972, to encourage a closer link between celebrant and congregation in the nave, the massive nine-tonne pulpit along with the choir stalls and permanent pews was dismantled and removed. The altar space was enlarged and improved. New &#x27;lighter&#x27; wood (limed oak) choir stalls were put in, and chairs replaced the pews. A new wooden pulpit was acquired from a Norfolk church and installed in 1974. External floodlighting was added in 1975.

A major survey in 1974 revealed new leaks, decay and other deterioration, and a ten-year restoration plan was agreed. Again the roofing required much work. The nave and clerestory roofs were repaired in four stages with new leading. The nave project was completed in 1984 at a total cost of £1.75 million. The clerestory windows were repaired with the corroded iron replaced with delta bronze and other Grimthorpe work on the clerestory was replaced. Seventy-two new heads for the corbel table were made. Grimthorpe&#x27;s west front was cracking, again due to the use originally of too strong a mortar, and was repaired.

A new visitors&#x27; centre was proposed in 1970. Planning permission was sought in 1973; there was a public inquiry and approval was granted in 1977. Constructed to the south side of the cathedral, close to the site of the original chapter house of the Abbey, the new &#x27;Chapter House&#x27; cost around £1 million and was officially opened on 8 June 1982 by Queen Elizabeth II. The main building material was 500,000 replica Roman bricks.

Other late 20th-century works include the restoration of Alban&#x27;s shrine, with a new embroidered canopy, and the stained glass designed by Alan Younger for Grimthorpe&#x27;s north transept rose window, unveiled in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2015 seven new painted stone statues by Rory Young were installed in the medieval niches in the nave screen. This was a rare occurrence, as the last painted figures placed in a church screen were put there before the Reformation and the English Civil War.

=== 21st century ===
The shrine of St Amphibalus was restored between 2019 and 2021, funded by a grant and the contribution of over a thousand donors. Due to be unveiled in 2020, work was delayed due to the Covid pandemic, and a new figure wearing a face mask was added to commemorate this.

==Modern times==
The bishop of St Albans is Alan Smith, installed in September 2009. Jonathan Smith is Archdeacon of St Albans, installed in October 2008. On 4 December 2021, Jo Kelly-Moore became the tenth dean of the cathedral.

Robert Runcie, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was Bishop of St Albans from 1970 to 1980 and returned to live in the city after his retirement; he is commemorated by a gargoyle on the cathedral as well as being buried in the graveyard. Colin Slee, former dean of Southwark Cathedral, was sub-dean at St Albans under Runcie and the then dean, Peter Moore. The bishop&#x27;s residence, Abbey Gate House, is in Abbey Mill Lane, St Albans, as is the house of the bishop of Hertford. Eric James, Chaplain Extraordinary to the Queen, was canon at St Albans for many years.

==Music and choirs==
===Organ===
*Details of the organ from the National Pipe Organ Register.
*Details of the restoration of the organ being undertaken 2007–09; article on the Cathedral&#x27;s website dated August 2007 by Andrew Lucas, the Master of the Music.
*Details of the new specification following the major restoration by Harrison &amp; Harrison completed in March 2009.

===Organists===

The master of the music and the assistant master of the music share the responsibility of directing the St Albans Cathedral Choir and the St Albans Cathedral Girls&#x27; Choir respectively.

The earliest known name of an organist at St Albans is Adam from the early 13th century. Robert Fayrfax, the prominent English Renaissance composer, is recorded as being organist from 1498 to 1502, and was buried there following his death some 20 years later. Since 1820 the post of organist and master of the music has been held by a number of well-known musicians, including Peter Hurford, Stephen Darlington and Barry Rose. The current master of the music, since 1998, is Andrew Lucas. The assistant master of music at the cathedral is sometimes also the master of music at St Albans School — for example, Simon Lindley and Andrew Parnell.

Since 1963 the cathedral has been home to the St Albans International Organ Festival, founded by Peter Hurford, and winners of which include Dame Gillian Weir, Thomas Trotter and Naji Hakim.

=== Bells ===
In total, there are 23 bells housed in the tower. The main ring of 12 bells (with a sharp 2nd) was cast in 2010 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. These replaced the previous ring, 8 of which still remain in the tower and are used for the clock chime and carillon; the carillon plays a different tune every day of the week.

In the 17th century the cathedral housed a ring of 5 bells, until they were recast and augmented to 6 in 1699. In 1731 the bells were augmented to a ring of 8 by adding two new bells. Finally, in 2010 the 13 new bells were cast, and were rung for the first time at Easter 2011. The oldest bell in the tower was cast in c.1290 and is still used today as the sanctus bell.

<text>J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs is the figurehead of the parody religion
the Church of the SubGenius. His image is derived from a collection of clip art distributed by the Bell Telephone Company of West Texas in 1946.

According to SubGenius dogma, &quot;Bob&quot; was a salesman who, in 1953, saw a vision of the god JHVH-1 on a television set he had built. The vision inspired him to write or dictate the &quot;PreScriptures&quot; (as described in the &quot;Book of the SubGenius&quot;) and found the Church. The theology holds that &quot;Bob&quot; is the greatest salesman who ever lived, and has cheated death a number of times. He is also revered for his great follies and believed to be a savior of &quot;Slack&quot;. He was assassinated in San Francisco in 1984, though the Church claims that he has come back from the dead several times since then.

The quotation marks in &quot;Bob&quot;&#x27;s name are always included when spelling his name, according to the Church.

==Personal history==
According to &quot;Revelation X; The &quot;Bob&quot; Apocryphon&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot; was born in Dallas, Texas, to Xinucha-Chi-Xan M. Dobbs (a pharmacist) and Jane McBride Dobbs. At an early age, he possessed a talent for making large amounts of money by playing the stock market over the telephone. He married his wife Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Marsh in Las Vegas in 1955 and worked as a photographer&#x27;s model while inventing and patenting novelty gag items. In 1957, he worked weekends doing Evangelical Christian preaching &quot;strictly for the money&quot;.

==Connie Dobbs==

Constance &quot;Connie&quot; Marsh Dobbs, the wife of &quot;Bob&quot;, has become nearly as legendary in SubGenius circles as &quot;Bob&quot;. Although &quot;Bob&quot; has been married to other women, spirits, deities, and inanimate objects, Connie is described in the SubGenius documentary &quot;Arise!&quot; as &quot;his first, and &quot;still&quot; his primary wife.&quot; Connie, an actress and model who formed the Home for Slackless Children, is the patron of SubGenius women, and she is seen as a vision of true liberation for women. She refuses to submit to anyone (especially &quot;Bob&quot;). She is just as free-wheeling and promiscuous as her husband, although she has a more level head on her shoulders when it comes to domestic issues.

Connie has been described as the &quot;brains&quot; of the couple who wrote at a 4th grade level when in 1st grade and let &quot;Bob&quot; copy her homework when they were children. She is also said to be a shapeshifter who celebrated her 100th birthday, and sang, danced, and spoke, at a gathering in 2022.

==Dobbstown==
According to Church lore, &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Connie&quot; travelled to Sarawak, Malaysia, and founded his headquarters, a secret enclave there, called Dobbstown, where he often stays.

==Images of &quot;Bob&quot;==
&quot;Bobs image first appeared in the original SubGenius publication, &quot;SubGenius Pamphlet #1&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die&quot;; 1979). The Church of the SubGenius maintains the trademark and copyright on &quot;Bobs image, though it has tried to avoid taking legal action unless absolutely necessary. &quot;Bobs image is commonly seen on the Usenet newsgroup alt.binaries.slack, where he appears regularly in images by many artists. Proper etiquette on the newsgroup dictates that credit be given where it is due, and acknowledgement of the ownership of &quot;Bobs image by the Church is accepted by the regular newsgroup participants.

The picture of &quot;Bob&quot; is also used in one of the earliest Linux distribution, Slackware, which the creator of Slackware, Patrick Volkerding is a practiser of the religion.

==Sacred Ikon==

Around 2002, the Church adopted a new symbol called the &quot;Sacred Ikon&quot;, which is a stylized cross consisting of three bars and a pipe, placed in a pattern that matches the eyes, nose, mouth, and pipe of &quot;Bobs image.

== In popular culture ==
Since his initial appearance, his face has appeared in numerous places around the world, and it has made cameo appearances on everything from graffiti art on highway overpasses and as part of the graphical character set of the Atari ST operating system, to musical albums by many underground bands (and several popular mainstream rock bands, ranging from Devo to Sublime) and the occasional film (&quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;), TV show (&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;) and cartoon (&quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;). There are also two German comics with &quot;Bob&quot; (&quot;Future Subjunkies&quot; and &quot;Space Bastards&quot;, both by Gerhard Seyfried and Ziska Riemann).

Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s short story &quot;The Horror on Howth Hill&quot; involves a conversation between Dobbs and the mad scientist De Selby.

J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs served as the inspiration for the character of Professor Utonium in the cartoon &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. The DC Comics character Doc Magnus also bears a strong visual resemblance to &quot;Bob&quot;.

In its January 1, 2000 issue, a &quot;Time&quot; Internet-based poll named J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs the &quot;Phoney or Fraud&quot; of the 20th century, with noted journalist Geraldo Rivera placing second.

<text>Juniata College () is a private liberal arts college in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1876 as a co-educational normal school, it was the first college started by members of the Church of the Brethren. It was originally founded as a center for vocational learning for those who could not afford formal education. As of 2015, Juniata College has about 1,600 students from 42 states and territories and 45 countries.

==History==
===19th century===

Huntingdon Normal School, a normal school, was established by a young Huntingdon physician, Dr. Andrew B. Brumbaugh, and his two cousins, Henry and John Brumbaugh. Henry provided a second-story room over his local print shop for classes, while John lodged and fed the college&#x27;s first teacher, Jacob M. Zuck. Andrew was to &quot;provide students and furniture&quot;. Juniata&#x27;s first classes were held on April 17, 1876, with professor Zuck teaching Rebecca Cornelius, Maggie D. Miller, and Gaius M. Brumbaugh, (the only son of physician Andrew Brumbaugh).

In 1877, the school changed its name to the Brethren Normal School. At this time Zuck also discussed adding a &quot;Scientific Course&quot; and issuing &quot;Certificates of Graduation&quot;. In 1879, classes were moved into Founder&#x27;s Hall, the school&#x27;s first permanent building on the present-day campus then only known as &quot;The Building&quot;. On May 11 of same year, Jacob Zuck died from pneumonia at age 32, which he probably caught from sleeping in the then unfinished Founders Hall without a heater. James Quinter was then chosen to lead the school as the school&#x27;s first president.

In 1894, due to a ruling at the Brethren Church&#x27;s Annual Meeting against using the term &quot;Brethren&quot; in naming a school, the college was then renamed Juniata College for the nearby Juniata River, one of the principal tributaries from the west of the central Susquehanna River, which empties further south into the Chesapeake Bay. The name of Juniata College was made the school&#x27;s legal name two decades later in 1896.

In 1895, Dr. Martin Grove Brumbaugh (1862-1930), of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, an 1881 graduate from the Brethren Normal (Huntingdon Normal), took over the active presidency of now renamed Juniata College, leading the growing institution for 15 years until 1910. 

He later became the 26th Governor of Pennsylvania, serving 1915-1919 at the newly-completed nine years earlier of the third Pennsylvania State Capitol in the state capital town of Harrisburg on the east bank of the central Susquehanna River. 

Shortly after assuming the governorship in Harrisburg in January 1915, Dr. Brumbaugh also was recruited as a potential Republican Party presidential candidate in the following year&#x27;s 1916 United States presidential election. He receiving more cast votes than any other in the several states party primary elections that spring and early summer of 1916. However the party&#x27;s nomination went to Judge Charles Evans Hughes (1862-1941), then the associate justice of the United States Supreme Court at the 1916 Republican National Convention, meeting later that year in Chicago, Illinois. Unfortunately, Republican candidate and Justice Hughes lost the 1916 election to his opponent, the Democratic Party candidate and incumbent 28th President Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924, served 1913-1921), who was the victor and reelected to a second term. However, now former Associate Justice Hughes was later appointed by subsequent 31st President Herbert Hoover to later become the 11th Chief Justice of the United States serving again and heading the U.S. Supreme Court from 1930 to his death in 1941.

Governor Brumbaugh returned to Huntingdon and Juanita College after his 1915-1919 governorship five years later in 1924 to again assume the office of college president until his death while on vacation in North Carolina later in March 1930, after a second tenure of six years at his beloved Juanita.

===20th century===
During and after his tenure, Brumbaugh remained intimately connected to the college and reacquired the college&#x27;s presidency in 1924, after having served as Governor of Pennsylvania from 1915 to 1919 and as commissioner of education in 1900 in the newly-acquired American possession of the former Kingdom of Spain/ Spanish Empire&#x27;s island of Puerto Rico, after the Spanish-American War of 1898. M. G. Brumbaugh died unexpectedly in 1930 while on vacation in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and was succeeded in his presidency by a former pupil at Juniata, Dr. Charles Calvert Ellis.

Founders Hall, the first building on campus, has also been renovated recently. Construction was finished in the summer of 2009 and uses underground geothermal energy to heat and cool the building. This building is recognized as a LEED Gold building.

Other off-campus sites include the Baker Peace Chapel, designed by Maya Lin, and the cliffs, which have views of the Juniata River. The college also owns the Raystown Field Station, a 365-acre (1.48 km2) reserve on Raystown Lake, which includes a LEED Gold building and two lodges for semester-long residential programs, often focused on environmental topics.

<text>Mark Allen Mothersbaugh (; born May 18, 1950) is an American musician and composer. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder, lead vocalist and keyboardist of the new wave band Devo, whose &quot;Whip It&quot; was a top 20 single in the US in 1980, peaking at No. 14, and which has since maintained a cult following. Mothersbaugh was one of the primary composers of Devo&#x27;s music.

In addition to his work with Devo, Mothersbaugh has made music for television series, films and video games via his production company, Mutato Muzika. He composed the music for the 13-year run of the animated series &quot;Rugrats&quot; and its three related theatrical films. He has created film scores for Wes Anderson and for Marvel Comics films. As a solo musician, Mothersbaugh has released four studio albums: &quot;Muzik for Insomniaks&quot;, &quot;Muzik for the Gallery&quot;, &quot;Joyeux Mutato&quot; and &quot;The Most Powerful Healing Muzik in the Entire World&quot;.

In 2004, he received the Richard Kirk award at the BMI Film and TV Awards for his contributions to film and television music. In 2008, Mothersbaugh received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University, his alma mater.

== Early years ==
Mark Allen Mothersbaugh was born on May 18, 1950, in Akron, Ohio. His parents are Mary Margaret (&quot;Mig&quot;) and Robert Mothersbaugh, Sr. He grew up with two younger brothers, Bob and Jim, who are both musicians, and two sisters, Amy and Susan, and graduated from Woodridge High School in Peninsula, Ohio.
His father appeared in early Devo films and fan events as the character General Boy and his brothers participated in the band, although Jim&#x27;s tenure was brief, appearing only on several early demos.

== Career ==
=== Devo ===

Mothersbaugh attended Kent State University as an art student, where he met Devo co-founders Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis. In early 1970, Lewis and Casale formed the idea of the &quot;devolution&quot; of the human race after Casale&#x27;s friends Jeffrey Miller and Allison Krause were killed by Ohio National Guardsmen on university grounds during what came to be known as the Kent State shootings. Intrigued by the concept, Mothersbaugh joined them, building upon it with elements of early post-structuralist ideas and oddball arcana, most notably unearthing the infamous &quot;Jocko-Homo Heavenbound&quot; pamphlet (the basis for the song &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;). This association culminated in 1973, when the trio started to play music as Devo.
Following the commercial failure of their sixth studio album &quot;Shout&quot;, Warner Bros. dropped Devo. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, drummer Alan Myers left the band, causing the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a &quot;Shout&quot; video LP, as well as a tour.

In 1987, Devo reformed with new drummer David Kendrick, formerly of Sparks, to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film &quot;Slaughterhouse Rock&quot;, starring Toni Basil and they released the studio albums &quot;Total Devo&quot; (1988) and &quot;Smooth Noodle Maps&quot; (1990), on Enigma.

Devo had a falling-out and played two shows in 1991 before breaking up. Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; (1990), except for Bob Mothersbaugh. In 1989, Mark Mothersbaugh established Mutato Muzika, a commercial music production studio, hiring Ryan Moore and Bob Casale; Bob Mothersbaugh was also involved.

In 2006, Devo worked with Disney on the Devo 2.0 project: a band of child performers was assembled to re-record Devo songs. The &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Devo recently finished a new project in cahoots with Disney called Devo 2.0, which features the band playing old songs and two new ones with vocals provided by children. Their debut studio album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled &quot;DEV2.0&quot;, was released on March 14, 2006. The lyrics of some of the songs were changed for family-friendly airplay, which has been claimed by the band to be a play on irony of the messages of their classic hits. Mothersbaugh doesn&#x27;t rule out the idea of the band gathering in the studio, eventually, to record a new Devo album.&quot; The studio album, &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; was eventually released in June 2010, preceded by a 12&quot; single of &quot;Fresh&quot;/&quot;What We Do&quot;.

Devo was awarded the first Moog Innovator Award on October 29, 2010, during Moogfest 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. The award aims to celebrate &quot;pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog&quot;. Devo was scheduled to perform at Moogfest, but canceled three days beforehand after Mark&#x27;s brother Bob Mothersbaugh (lead guitar) injured his hand. He and Gerald Casale collaborated with Austin, Texas, band the Octopus Project to perform &quot;Girl U Want&quot; and &quot;Beautiful World&quot; at the event instead.

=== Other work ===
In 1989, Mothersbaugh and other members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled extended play (EP) on the New Rose label in 1990. The group featured his then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob&#x27;s daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh co-wrote some of the songs, and produced the album with Bob Casale. A promotional video was filmed for the song &quot;Trilobites&quot;. Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Rockula&quot;, as well as on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

Since Devo, Mothersbaugh has developed a successful career writing musical scores for film and television. In film, he has worked frequently with filmmaker Wes Anderson, scoring four of his feature films: &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1996), &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998), &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004). He composed for &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2017).

His music has been a staple of the children&#x27;s television shows &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Santo Bugito&quot; and &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot;. He wrote the new theme song for the original &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; show when it was sold to Broadway Video, some music for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; in 1986–1990 and the theme song for the &quot;Super Mario World&quot; TV series for DIC Entertainment in 1991. The character design for Chuckie on &quot;Rugrats&quot; was loosely based on him. Along with Bob Casale, he produced &quot;Heroes &amp; Villains&quot; (2000), a soundtrack album with music inspired by &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. Mothersbaugh originally sought out to be the show&#x27;s main composer, but his demo was rejected by creator Craig McCracken, who despite being a Devo fan, had concerns about his cartoon being pushed aside if a big feature film came to Mothersbaugh&#x27;s production company.

Mothersbaugh produces music for video games, including Sony&#x27;s &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; and &quot;Jak and Daxter&quot; series (both music scores were created by Josh Mancell), and for EA Games&#x27; &quot;The Sims 2&quot; (2004). This work is often performed with Mutato Muzika, the music production company he formed with several other former members of Devo including his brother, Bob Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh composed the original score for &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&quot; (2021).

Mothersbaugh composed:

* &quot;Having Trouble Sneezing&quot;, the distinctive music in the award-winning &quot;Get a Mac&quot; commercials for Apple Inc.
* The score for the first season of the television series &quot;Big Love,&quot; though he was replaced after one season by David Byrne of Talking Heads.
* The theme music for the American television show &quot;Eureka&quot;, broadcast on the Syfy channel.
* The score of the Cartoon Network&#x27;s TV series &quot;Regular Show&quot;.
* The score for HBO&#x27;s &quot;Close Enough&quot; alongside John Enroth and Albert Fox.
* The score for HBO&#x27;s &quot;Our Flag Means Death&quot;.

In 2013, Mothersbaugh appeared on an episode of &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, an action-comedy series by the creators of &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; starring the Devo-influenced band the Aquabats, playing the eccentric scientist father of one of the main characters, Jimmy the Robot.

Mothersbaugh and Casale have produced music for other artists, including Toni Basil.

=== Visual art and exhibitions ===
Mothersbaugh has also been successful as a visual artist. In November 2014, Mothersbaugh said, &quot;I&#x27;ve done over 150 art gallery shows in the last 20 years.&quot;

On February 6, 2014, the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver (MCA Denver) announced a retrospective exhibition to bring together the first comprehensive presentation of Mothersbaugh&#x27;s art and music. This nationally touring exhibition was accompanied by a publication, &quot;Mark Mothersbaugh: Myopia&quot;, published by Princeton Architectural Press. 50 selections of postcard art from &quot;Myopia&quot; were published as a postcard book titled &quot;Mark Mothersbaugh: Collected Facts &amp; Lies&quot; in 2015.

As a prelude to the &quot;Myopia&quot; exhibit opening in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mothersbaugh held a concert gathering which included Devo songs and movie scores played in a classical style, an address to the audience with anecdotes, and musical pieces he specifically composed for a six-keyboard hybrid originally used for teaching lessons, that was refurbished by his brother Bob and contained a counter in the center for keeping time. The instrument was played by six people simultaneously.

Mothersbaugh hosted a drawing segment on the Nick Jr. Channel television series &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; called Mark&#x27;s Magic Pictures, teaching children how to draw simple pictures. The pictures often come alive at the end of the segment through animation.

== Personal life ==

At the age of seven, Mothersbaugh began wearing glasses to correct his severe myopia and astigmatism. Over the years, he took an interest in designing his own distinctive eyewear for use in Devo shows. He favored a set of stainless steel frames for regular use made by a Los Angeles shop called LA Eyeworks and says he purchased as many pairs as he could find because they tended to break or get stolen by fans. In a joint venture with eyewear manufacturer Shane Baum, Mothersbaugh has designed his own branded frames for sale, made of beryllium with a stainless steel chrome finish, in three different styles as of 2015. The Baumvision press release states that the unisex model &quot;Francesca&quot; is named for one of Mothersbaugh&#x27;s pug dogs which is a simultaneous hermaphrodite that is also called Frank.

In a 2016 interview, Mothersbaugh mentioned having attention deficit disorder (ADD).

He has been married twice. His first wife was actress Nancye Ferguson, who can be seen briefly performing with him in the 1999 superhero comedy film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;. His current wife is Anita Greenspan, who runs the film music managing company Greenspan Kohan Management with Neil Kohan. The couple has two daughters from China, adopted after Greenspan learned of the practice in that country of female children being abandoned because of their gender.

Mothersbaugh is a collector and connoisseur of song poems and unusual or vintage musical devices. He is the owner of Raymond Scott&#x27;s Electronium (although it is currently not functional).

Mothersbaugh contracted COVID-19 in May 2020, and was placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for 18 days. In August 2020, Mothersbaugh recounted that he &quot;nearly died&quot; of the disease, and was in a delusional state while infected; he came to believe that he had been hospitalized after being hit by a brick in Little Tokyo, and repeatedly urged his family members to search for his attackers. He described having lasting neuropathic pain as a result of the illness.

Mothersbaugh was once a member of the parody religion the Church of the SubGenius.

== Honors and awards ==
Mothersbaugh was honored with the Richard Kirk Award at the 2004 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer of film and television music.

On May 10, 2008, Mothersbaugh was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University.

On May 28, 2016, Mothersbaugh was awarded the key to the city of Akron during a ceremony at the Akron-Summit County Public Library.

The denomination 267 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Maria Kondratyevna Gorokhovskaya (, ; 17 October 1921 – 22 July 2001) was a Soviet gymnast of Jewish descent. At the 1952 Summer Olympics, she was the first woman to win seven medals at one Olympics. That is the highest number of medals won by a woman in a single Olympics, which is an achievement shared by only one other female athlete, the Australian swimmer Emma McKeon, who achieved that at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021.

Competing for &quot;Budivelnyk Kharkov&quot;, Gorokhovskaya won her first USSR title on the balance beam in 1948. She came to the Helsinki Olympics as the twofold national champion. Soviet gymnastics had never competed at major international tournaments before, and it was the first Olympics in which the country participated.

The Soviet gymnasts dominated the competition, with Gorokhovskaya leading them. In all four individual apparatus events – the balance beam, floor exercise, the vault and the uneven bars – Gorokhovskaya finished second. This performance earned her the gold medal in the all-around competition, finishing ahead of team-mate Nina Bocharova by eight tenths of a point.

With seven of the eight Soviet gymnasts finishing in the top ten, it was clear that the team gold medal would go to them. Gorokhovskaya won her seventh medal in the now discontinued team exercise with portable apparatus, where the Soviet team finished second behind Sweden.

Gorokhovskaya made one more international appearance as a part of the winning Soviet team at the 1954 World Championships, and retired afterwards. She then worked as a judge (international since 1964) and a lecturer.

In 1990, Gorokhovskaya, who was Jewish, emigrated to Israel, where she worked as a gymnastics coach until her death. In 1991 she was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>The Place du Tertre () is a square in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, France. Only a few streets away from the Basilica of the Sacré Cœur and the Lapin Agile cabaret, it is near the summit of the city&#x27;s elevated Montmartre quarter.

==History==
The Place du Tertre was the heart of the prestigious Benedictine Montmartre Abbey, established in 1133 by King Louis VI. Montmartre Abbey thrived through the centuries and until the French Revolution under the patronage of the Kings of France. The Place du Tertre was opened to the public in 1635 as Montmartre village central square. From the end of the 18th century until World War I, the whole Montmartre Bohème could be seen there: painters, songwriters and poets.

With its many artists setting up their easels each day for the tourists, the Place du Tertre is a reminder of the time when Montmartre was the mecca of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, many painters including Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, and Maurice Utrillo were living there, some at the nearby . The Musée de Montmartre, the former home and studio of Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Suzanne Valadon, and the L&#x27;Espace Salvador Dalí, a museum principally dedicated to the sculpture and drawings of Salvador Dalí, can be found near the Place du Tertre.

<doc id="73087" wikidata="Q104919" url="?curid=73087" title="Gabriel Fauré">
<text>Gabriel Urbain Fauré 12 May 1845 – 4 November 1924) was a French composer, organist, pianist and teacher. He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his &quot;Pavane&quot;, Requiem, &quot;Sicilienne&quot;, nocturnes for piano and the songs &quot;Après un rêve&quot; and &quot;Clair de lune&quot;. Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Fauré composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style.

Fauré was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a young boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the École Niedermeyer music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Saëns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Fauré earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the Église de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, he was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic. Outside France, Fauré&#x27;s music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.

Fauré&#x27;s music has been described as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré&#x27;s death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Fauré was born in Pamiers, Ariège, in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honoré Fauré (1810–85) and Marie-Antoinette-Hélène Lalène-Laprade (1809–87). According to the biographer Jean-Michel Nectoux, the Fauré family dates to the 13th century in that part of France. The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced. The composer&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Gabriel, was a butcher whose son became a schoolmaster. In 1829 Fauré&#x27;s parents married. His mother was the daughter of a minor member of the nobility. He was the only one of the six children to display musical talent; his four brothers pursued careers in journalism, politics, the army and the civil service, and his sister had a traditional life as the wife of a public servant.

The young Fauré was sent to live with a foster mother until he was four years old. When his father was appointed director of the École Normale d&#x27;Instituteurs, a teacher training college, at Montgauzy, near Foix, in 1849, Fauré returned to live with his family. There was a chapel attached to the school, which Fauré recalled in the last year of his life:

An old blind woman, who came to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré&#x27;s gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Fauré play and advised Toussaint-Honoré to send him to the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music), better known as the École Niedermeyer de Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris. After reflecting for a year, Fauré&#x27;s father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.

Helped by a scholarship from the bishop of his home diocese, Fauré boarded at the school for 11 years. The régime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Fauré&#x27;s tutors were Clément Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition.

When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Saëns took charge of piano studies and introduced contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. Fauré recalled in old age, &quot;After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life.&quot;

Saint-Saëns took great pleasure in his pupil&#x27;s progress, which he helped whenever he could; Nectoux comments that at each step in Fauré&#x27;s career &quot;Saint-Saëns&#x27;s shadow can effectively be taken for granted.&quot; The close friendship between them lasted until Saint-Saëns died sixty years later.

Fauré won many prizes while at the school, including a &quot;premier prix&quot; in composition for the &quot;Cantique de Jean Racine&quot;, Op. 11, the earliest of his choral works to enter the regular repertory. He left the school in July 1865, as a &quot;Laureat&quot; in organ, piano, harmony and composition, with a &quot;Maître de chapelle&quot; diploma.

===Organist and composer===
On leaving the École Niedermeyer, Fauré was appointed organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He took up the post in January 1866. During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving &quot;countless piano lessons&quot;. At Saint-Saëns&#x27;s regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive. He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted Fauré&#x27;s religious conviction. Fauré was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon for a cigarette, and in early 1870, when he turned up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been out all night at a ball, he was asked to resign. Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-Saëns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris. He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the siege of Paris, and saw action at Le Bourget, Champigny and Créteil. He was awarded a &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot;.
After France&#x27;s defeat by Prussia, there was a brief, bloody conflict within Paris from March to May 1871 during the Commune. Fauré escaped to Rambouillet where one of his brothers lived, and then travelled to Switzerland, where he took up a teaching post at the École Niedermeyer, which had temporarily relocated there to avoid the violence in Paris. His first pupil at the school was André Messager, who became a lifelong friend and occasional collaborator. Fauré&#x27;s compositions from this period did not overtly reflect the turmoil and bloodshed. Some of his colleagues, including Saint-Saëns, Gounod and Franck, produced elegies and patriotic odes. Fauré did not, but according to his biographer Jessica Duchen, his music acquired &quot;a new sombreness, a dark-hued sense of tragedy ... evident mainly in his songs of this period including &quot;L&#x27;Absent&quot;, &quot;Seule!&quot; and &quot;La Chanson du pêcheur&quot;.&quot;

When Fauré returned to Paris in October 1871, he was appointed choirmaster at the Église Saint-Sulpice under the composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor. In the course of his duties, he wrote several canticles and motets, few of which have survived. During some services, Widor and Fauré improvised simultaneously at the church&#x27;s two organs, trying to catch each other out with sudden changes of key. Fauré regularly attended Saint-Saëns&#x27;s musical salons and those of Pauline Viardot, to whom Saint-Saëns introduced him.

Fauré was a founding member of the Société Nationale de Musique, formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of Romain Bussine and Saint-Saëns, to promote new French music. Other members included Georges Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d&#x27;Indy, Henri Duparc, César Franck, Édouard Lalo and Jules Massenet. Fauré became secretary of the society in 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society&#x27;s concerts.
In 1874 Fauré moved from Saint-Sulpice to the Église de la Madeleine, acting as deputy for the principal organist, Saint-Saëns, during the latter&#x27;s many absences on tour. Some admirers of Fauré&#x27;s music have expressed regret that although he played the organ professionally for four decades, he left no solo compositions for the instrument. He was renowned for his improvisations, and Saint-Saëns said of him that he was &quot;a first class organist when he wanted to be&quot;. Fauré preferred the piano to the organ, which he played only because it gave him a regular income. Duchen speculates that he positively disliked the organ, possibly because &quot;for a composer of such delicacy of nuance, and such sensuality, the organ was simply not subtle enough.&quot;

The year 1877 was significant for Fauré, both professionally and personally. In January his first violin sonata was performed at a Société Nationale concert with great success, marking a turning-point in his composing career at the age of 31. Nectoux counts the work as the composer&#x27;s first great masterpiece. In March, Saint-Saëns retired from the Madeleine, succeeded as organist by Théodore Dubois, his choirmaster; Fauré was appointed to take over from Dubois. In July Fauré became engaged to Pauline Viardot&#x27;s daughter Marianne, with whom he was deeply in love. To his great sorrow, she broke off the engagement in November 1877, for reasons that are not clear. To distract Fauré, Saint-Saëns took him to Weimar and introduced him to Franz Liszt. This visit gave Fauré a liking for foreign travel, which he indulged for the rest of his life. From 1878, he and Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; at the Cologne Opera; the complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at the Hofoper in Munich and at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London; and &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw &quot;Parsifal&quot;. They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent &quot;Souvenirs de Bayreuth&quot;. This short, up-tempo piano work for four hands sends up themes from &quot;The Ring&quot;. Fauré admired Wagner and had a detailed knowledge of his music, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner&#x27;s musical influence.

===Middle years===
In 1883 Fauré married Marie Fremiet, the daughter of a leading sculptor, Emmanuel Fremiet. Nectoux comments that Marie was &quot;without beauty, wit or a fortune ... narrow and cold&quot;, but records that &quot;in spite of everything [Fauré] still felt a tenderness towards her&quot;. The marriage was affectionate, but Marie was, in Nectoux&#x27;s phrase, &quot;a stay-at-home&quot;, and she did not share her husband&#x27;s wish to go out in the evenings, and became resentful of his frequent absences, his dislike of domestic life – &quot;horreur du domicile&quot; – and his love affairs, while she remained at home. Though Fauré valued Marie as a friend and confidante, writing to her often – sometimes daily – when away from home, she did not share his passionate nature, which found fulfilment elsewhere. Fauré and his wife had two sons. The first, born in 1883, Emmanuel Fauré-Fremiet (Marie insisted on combining her family name with Fauré&#x27;s), became a biologist of international reputation. The second son, Philippe, born in 1889, became a writer; his works included histories, plays, and biographies of his father and grandfather.

Contemporary accounts agree that Fauré was extremely attractive to women; in Duchen&#x27;s phrase, &quot;his conquests were legion in the Paris salons.&quot; After a romantic attachment to the singer Emma Bardac from around 1892, followed by another to the composer Adela Maddison, in 1900 Fauré met the pianist Marguerite Hasselmans, the daughter of Alphonse Hasselmans. This led to a relationship which lasted for the rest of Fauré&#x27;s life. He maintained her in a Paris apartment, and she acted openly as his companion.

To support his family, Fauré spent most of his time in running the daily services at the Madeleine and giving piano and harmony lessons. His compositions earned him a negligible amount, because his publisher bought them outright, paying him an average of 60 francs for a song, and Fauré received no royalties. During this period, he wrote several large-scale works, in addition to many piano pieces and songs, but he destroyed most of them after a few performances, only retaining a few movements in order to re-use motifs. Among the works surviving from this period is the Requiem, begun in 1887 and revised and expanded, over the years, until its final version dating from 1901. After its first performance, in 1888, the priest in charge told the composer, &quot;We don&#x27;t need these novelties: the Madeleine&#x27;s repertoire is quite rich enough.&quot;

As a young man Fauré had been very cheerful; a friend wrote of his &quot;youthful, even somewhat child-like, mirth.&quot; From his thirties he suffered bouts of depression, which he described as &quot;spleen&quot;, possibly first caused by his broken engagement and his lack of success as a composer. In 1890 a prestigious and remunerative commission to write an opera with lyrics by Paul Verlaine was aborted by the poet&#x27;s drunken inability to deliver a libretto. Fauré was plunged into so deep a depression that his friends were seriously concerned about his health. Winnaretta de Scey-Montbéliard, always a good friend to Fauré, invited him to Venice, where she had a &quot;palazzo&quot; on the Grand Canal. He recovered his spirits and began to compose again, writing the first of his five &quot;Mélodies de Venise&quot;, to words by Verlaine, whose poetry he continued to admire despite the operatic debacle.
About this time, or shortly afterwards, Fauré&#x27;s liaison with Emma Bardac began; in Duchen&#x27;s words, &quot;for the first time, in his late forties, he experienced a fulfilling, passionate relationship which extended over several years&quot;. His principal biographers all agree that this affair inspired a burst of creativity and a new originality in his music, exemplified in the song cycle &quot;La bonne chanson&quot;. Fauré wrote the &quot;Dolly Suite&quot; for piano duet between 1894 and 1897 and dedicated it to Bardac&#x27;s daughter Hélène, known as &quot;Dolly&quot;. Some people suspected that Fauré was Dolly&#x27;s father, but biographers including Nectoux and Duchen think it unlikely. Fauré&#x27;s affair with Emma Bardac is thought to have begun after Dolly was born, though there is no conclusive evidence either way.

During the 1890s Fauré&#x27;s fortunes improved. When Ernest Guiraud, professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, died in 1892, Saint-Saëns encouraged Fauré to apply for the vacant post. The faculty of the Conservatoire regarded Fauré as dangerously modern, and its head, Ambroise Thomas, blocked the appointment, declaring, &quot;Fauré? Never! If he&#x27;s appointed, I resign.&quot; However, Fauré was appointed to another of Guiraud&#x27;s posts, inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces. He disliked the prolonged travelling around the country that the work entailed, but the post gave him a steady income and enabled him to give up teaching amateur pupils.
In 1896 Ambroise Thomas died, and Théodore Dubois took over as head of the Conservatoire. Fauré succeeded Dubois as chief organist of the Madeleine. Dubois&#x27; move had further repercussions: Massenet, professor of composition at the Conservatoire, had expected to succeed Thomas, but had overplayed his hand by insisting on being appointed for life. He was turned down, and when Dubois was appointed instead, Massenet resigned his professorship in fury. Fauré was appointed in his place. He taught many young composers, including Maurice Ravel, Florent Schmitt, Charles Koechlin, Louis Aubert, Jean Roger-Ducasse, George Enescu, Paul Ladmirault, Alfredo Casella and Nadia Boulanger. In Fauré&#x27;s view, his students needed a firm grounding in the basic skills, which he was happy to delegate to his capable assistant André Gedalge. His own part came in helping them make use of these skills in the way that suited each student&#x27;s talents. Roger-Ducasse later wrote, &quot;Taking up whatever the pupils were working on, he would evoke the rules of the form at hand ... and refer to examples, always drawn from the masters.&quot; Ravel always remembered Fauré&#x27;s open-mindedness as a teacher. Having received Ravel&#x27;s String Quartet with less than his usual enthusiasm, Fauré asked to see the manuscript again a few days later, saying, &quot;I could have been wrong&quot;. The musicologist Henry Prunières wrote, &quot;What Fauré developed among his pupils was taste, harmonic sensibility, the love of pure lines, of unexpected and colorful modulations; but he never gave them [recipes] for composing according to his style and that is why they all sought and found their own paths in many different, and often opposed, directions.&quot;

Fauré&#x27;s works of the last years of the century include incidental music for the English premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1898) and &quot;Prométhée&quot;, a lyric tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at Béziers. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at Béziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Opéra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter.

From 1903 to 1921, Fauré regularly wrote music criticism for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Fauré&#x27;s natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the positive aspects of a work.

===Head of Paris Conservatoire===
In 1905 a scandal erupted in French musical circles over the country&#x27;s top musical prize, the Prix de Rome. Fauré&#x27;s pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Fauré radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Fauré was dubbed &quot;Robespierre&quot; by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, &quot;where Auber, Halévy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme ... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner – up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire&#x27;s walls&quot;. The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy.

Fauré&#x27;s new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, &quot;Pénélope&quot; (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle &quot;La chanson d&#x27;Ève&quot;, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).
Fauré was elected to the Institut de France in 1909, after his father-in-law and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d&#x27;Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société musicale indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d&#x27;Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire&#x27;s move to new premises in the rue de Madrid.

During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.

The turn of the 20th century saw a rise in the popularity of Fauré&#x27;s music in Britain, and to a lesser extent in Germany, Spain and Russia. He visited England frequently, and an invitation to play at Buckingham Palace in 1908 opened many other doors in London and beyond. He was in London for the premiere of Elgar&#x27;s First Symphony in 1908 and dined with the composer. Elgar later wrote to their mutual friend Frank Schuster that Fauré &quot;was such a real gentleman – the highest kind of Frenchman and I admired him greatly.&quot; Elgar tried to get Fauré&#x27;s Requiem put on at the Three Choirs Festival, but it did not finally have its English premiere until 1937, nearly fifty years after its first performance in France. Composers from other countries also loved and admired Fauré. In the 1880s Tchaikovsky had thought him &quot;adorable&quot;; Albéniz and Fauré were friends and correspondents until the former&#x27;s early death in 1909; Richard Strauss sought his advice; and in Fauré&#x27;s last years, the young American Aaron Copland was a devoted admirer.

The outbreak of the First World War almost stranded Fauré in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris. He remained in France for the duration of the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Saëns. Fauré did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art &quot;a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation.&quot; Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting Frankfurt and Cologne for concerts of his music, he had written, &quot;The criticisms of my music have been that it&#x27;s a bit cold and too well brought up! There&#x27;s no question about it, French and German are two different things.&quot;

===Last years and legacy===
In 1920, at the age of 75, Fauré retired from the Conservatoire because of his increasing deafness and frailty. In that year he received the Grand-Croix of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, an honour rare for a musician. In 1922 the president of the republic, Alexandre Millerand, led a public tribute to Fauré, a national &quot;hommage&quot;, described in &quot;The Musical Times&quot; as &quot;a splendid celebration at the Sorbonne, in which the most illustrious French artists participated, [which] brought him great joy. It was a poignant spectacle, indeed: that of a man present at a concert of his own works and able to hear not a single note. He sat gazing before him pensively, and, in spite of everything, grateful and content.&quot;
Fauré suffered from poor health in his later years, brought on in part by heavy smoking. Despite this, he remained available to young composers, including members of Les Six, most of whom were devoted to him. Nectoux writes, &quot;In old age he attained a kind of serenity, without losing any of his remarkable spiritual vitality, but rather removed from the sensualism and the passion of the works he wrote between 1875 and 1895.&quot;

In his last months, Fauré struggled to complete his String Quartet. Twenty years earlier he had been the dedicatee of Ravel&#x27;s String Quartet. Ravel and others urged Fauré to compose one of his own. He refused for many years, on the grounds that it was too difficult. When he finally decided to write it, he did so in trepidation, telling his wife, &quot;I&#x27;ve started a Quartet for strings, without piano. This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be &quot;terrified&quot; of it.&quot; He worked on the piece for a year, finishing it on 11 September 1924, less than two months before he died, working long hours towards the end to complete it. The quartet was premiered after his death; he declined an offer to have it performed privately for him in his last days, as his hearing had deteriorated to the point where musical sounds were horribly distorted in his ear.

Fauré died in Paris from pneumonia on 4 November 1924 at the age of 79. He was given a state funeral at the Église de la Madeleine and is buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris.

After Fauré&#x27;s death, the Conservatoire abandoned his radicalism and became resistant to new trends in music, with Fauré&#x27;s own harmonic practice being held up as the farthest limit of modernity, beyond which students should not go. His successor, Henri Rabaud, director of the Conservatoire from 1922 to 1941, declared &quot;modernism is the enemy&quot;. The generation of students born between the wars rejected this outdated premise, turning for inspiration to Bartók, the Second Viennese School, and the latest works of Stravinsky.

In a centenary tribute in 1945, the musicologist Leslie Orrey wrote in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, &quot;&#x27;More profound than Saint-Saëns, more varied than Lalo, more spontaneous than d&#x27;Indy, more classic than Debussy, Gabriel Fauré is the master &quot;par excellence&quot; of French music, the perfect mirror of our musical genius.&#x27; Perhaps, when English musicians get to know his work better, these words of Roger-Ducasse will seem, not over-praise, but no more than his due.&quot;

==Music==
Aaron Copland wrote that although Fauré&#x27;s works can be divided into the usual &quot;early&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;late&quot; periods, there is no such radical difference between his first and last manners as is evident with many other composers. Copland found premonitions of late Fauré in even the earliest works, and traces of the early Fauré in the works of his old age: &quot;The themes, harmonies, form, have remained essentially the same, but with each new work they have all become more fresh, more personal, more profound.&quot; When Fauré was born, Berlioz and Chopin were still composing; the latter was among Fauré&#x27;s early influences. In his later years Fauré developed compositional techniques that foreshadowed the atonal music of Schoenberg, and, later still, drew discreetly on the techniques of jazz. Duchen writes that early works such as the &quot;Cantique de Jean Racine&quot; are in the tradition of French nineteenth-century romanticism, yet his late works are as modern as any of the works of his pupils.

Influences on Fauré, particularly in his early work, included not only Chopin but Mozart and Schumann. The authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot; (1955), Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, &quot;and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.&quot; His work was based on the strong understanding of harmonic structures that he gained at the École Niedermeyer from Niedermeyer&#x27;s successor Gustave Lefèvre. Lefèvre wrote the book &quot;Traité d&#x27;harmonie&quot; (Paris, 1889), in which he sets out a harmonic theory that differs significantly from the classical theory of Rameau, no longer outlawing certain chords as &quot;dissonant&quot;. By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Fauré anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers.

In contrast with his harmonic and melodic style, which pushed the bounds for his time, Fauré&#x27;s rhythmic motives tended to be subtle and repetitive, with little to break the flow of the line, although he used discreet syncopations, similar to those found in Brahms&#x27;s works. Copland referred to him as &quot;the Brahms of France&quot;. The music critic Jerry Dubins suggests that Fauré &quot;represents the link between the late German Romanticism of Brahms ... and the French Impressionism of Debussy.&quot;

To Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, Fauré&#x27;s later works do not display the easy charm of his earlier music: &quot;the luscious romantic harmony which had always been firmly supported by a single tonality, later gave way to a severely monochrome style, full of enharmonic shifts, and creating the impression of several tonal centres simultaneously employed.&quot;

===Vocal music===
Fauré is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or &quot;mélodie&quot;. Ravel wrote in 1922 that Fauré had saved French music from the dominance of the German &quot;Lied&quot;. Two years later the critic Samuel Langford wrote of Fauré, &quot;More surely almost than any writer in the world he commanded the faculty to create a song all of a piece, and with a sustained intensity of mood which made it like a single thought&quot;. In a 2011 article the pianist and writer Roy Howat and the musicologist Emily Kilpatrick wrote:
In Copland&#x27;s view, the early songs, written in the 1860s and 1870s under the influence of Gounod, except for isolated songs such as &quot;Après un rêve&quot; or &quot;Au bord de l&#x27;eau&quot;, show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of &quot;the real Fauré&quot;. He instanced &quot;Les berceaux&quot;, &quot;Les roses d&#x27;Ispahan&quot; and especially &quot;Clair de lune&quot; as &quot;so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America&quot;, and drew attention to less well known mélodies such as &quot;Le secret&quot;, &quot;Nocturne&quot;, and &quot;Les présents&quot;. Fauré also composed a number of song cycles. &quot;Cinq mélodies &quot;de Venise&quot;&quot;, Op. 58 (1891), was described by Fauré as a novel kind of song suite, in its use of musical themes recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle &quot;La bonne chanson&quot;, Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Fauré. He also wrote that &quot;La bonne chanson&quot; was his most spontaneous composition, with Emma Bardac singing back to him each day&#x27;s newly written material. Among later works were cycles drawn from the poems of Charles van Lerberghe, &quot;La chanson d&#x27;Ève&quot; (1910) and &quot;Le jardin clos&quot; (1914). 

The Requiem, Op. 48, first performed in 1888, was not composed to the memory of a specific person but, in Fauré&#x27;s words, &quot;for the pleasure of it.&quot; It has been described as &quot;a lullaby of death&quot; because of its predominantly gentle tone. Fauré omitted the Dies irae, though reference to the day of judgment appears in the Libera me, which, like Verdi, he added to the normal liturgical text. Fauré revised the Requiem over the years, and a number of different performing versions are now in use, from the earliest, for small forces, to the final revision with full orchestra.

Fauré&#x27;s operas have not found a place in the regular repertoire. &quot;Prométhée&quot; is the more neglected of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered &quot;Pénélope&quot; (1913) a fascinating work, and one of the best operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, &quot;distinctly non-theatrical.&quot; The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Fauré&#x27;s late style, &quot;tonality is stretched hard, without breaking.&quot; On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, &quot;A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre. ... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective.&quot; However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, &quot;Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Pénélope&quot; is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer&#x27;s theatrical touch was.&quot;

===Piano works===

Fauré&#x27;s major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across the decades of his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are &quot;Romances sans paroles&quot;, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, &quot;Thème et variations&quot; in C minor, and &quot;Huit pièces brèves&quot;. For piano duet, Fauré composed the &quot;Dolly Suite&quot; and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite &quot;Souvenirs de Bayreuth&quot;.

The piano works often use arpeggiated figures, with the melody interspersed between the two hands, and include finger substitutions natural for organists. These aspects make them daunting for some pianists. Even a virtuoso like Liszt said that he found Fauré&#x27;s music hard to play. The early piano works are clearly influenced by Chopin. An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other. In Copland&#x27;s view, it was with the sixth Nocturne that Fauré fully emerged from any predecessor&#x27;s shadow. The pianist Alfred Cortot said, &quot;There are few pages in all music comparable to these.&quot; The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the charming earlier piano works, such as the Impromptu No. 2, rather than the later piano works, which express &quot;such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation&quot; that listeners are left uneasy. In his piano music, as in most of his works, Fauré shunned virtuosity in favour of the classical lucidity often associated with the French. He was unimpressed by purely virtuoso pianists, saying, &quot;the greater they are, the worse they play me.&quot;

===Orchestral and chamber works===
Fauré was not greatly interested in orchestration, and on occasion asked his former students such as Jean Roger-Ducasse and Charles Koechlin to orchestrate his concert and theatre works. In Nectoux&#x27;s words, Fauré&#x27;s generally sober orchestral style reflects &quot;a definite aesthetic attitude ... The idea of timbre was not a determining one in Fauré&#x27;s musical thinking&quot;. He was not attracted by flamboyant combinations of tone-colours, which he thought either self-indulgent or a disguise for lack of real musical invention. He told his students that it should be possible to produce an orchestration without resorting to glockenspiels, celestas, xylophones, bells or electrical instruments. Debussy admired the spareness of Fauré&#x27;s orchestration, finding in it the transparency he strove for in his own 1913 ballet &quot;Jeux&quot;; Poulenc, by contrast, described Fauré&#x27;s orchestration as &quot;a leaden overcoat ... instrumental mud&quot;. Fauré&#x27;s best-known orchestral works are the suites &quot;Masques et bergamasques&quot; (based on music for a dramatic entertainment, or &quot;divertissement comique&quot;), which he orchestrated himself, &quot;Dolly&quot;, orchestrated by Henri Rabaud, and &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; which draws on incidental music for Maeterlinck&#x27;s play; the stage version was orchestrated by Koechlin, but Fauré himself reworked the orchestration for the published suite.

In the chamber repertoire, his two piano quartets, in C minor and G minor, particularly the former, are among Fauré&#x27;s better-known works. His other chamber music includes two piano quintets, two cello sonatas, two violin sonatas, a piano trio and a string quartet. Copland (writing in 1924 before the string quartet was finished) held the second quintet (in C minor, Opus 115) to be Fauré&#x27;s masterpiece: &quot;... a pure well of spirituality ... extremely classic, as far removed as possible from the romantic temperament.&quot; Other critics have differed somewhat: &quot;The Record Guide&quot; commented, &quot;The ceaseless flow and restricted colour scheme of Fauré&#x27;s last manner, as exemplified in this Quintet, need very careful management, if they are not to become tedious.&quot; Fauré&#x27;s last work, the String Quartet, has been described by critics in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine as an intimate meditation on the last things, and &quot;an extraordinary work by any standards, ethereal and other-worldly with themes that seem constantly to be drawn skywards.&quot;

===Recordings===
Fauré made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. Well over a hundred recordings of Fauré&#x27;s music were made between 1898 and 1905, mostly of songs, with a few short chamber works, by performers including the singers Jean Noté and Pol Plançon and players such as Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot. By the 1920s a range of Fauré&#x27;s more popular songs were on record, including &quot;Après un rêve&quot; sung by Olga Haley, and &quot;Automne&quot; and &quot;Clair de lune&quot; sung by Ninon Vallin. In the 1930s better-known performers recorded Fauré pieces, including Georges Thill (&quot;En prière&quot;), and Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot (Violin Sonata No. 1 and Berceuse). The Sicilienne from &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; was recorded in 1938.

By the 1940s there were a few more Fauré works in the catalogues. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by Kathleen Long (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Thème et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by Boyd Neel), the Requiem conducted by Ernest Bourmauck, and seven songs sung by Maggie Teyte. Fauré&#x27;s music began to appear more frequently in the record companies&#x27; releases in the 1950s. &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the String Quartet, both Violin Sonatas, the Cello Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles &quot;La bonne chanson&quot; and &quot;La chanson d&#x27;Ève&quot;.

In the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies have built up a substantial catalogue of Fauré&#x27;s music, performed by French and non-French musicians. Several modern recordings of Fauré&#x27;s music have come to public notice as prize-winners in annual awards organised by &quot;Gramophone&quot; and the BBC. Sets of his major orchestral works have been recorded under conductors including Michel Plasson (1981) and Yan Pascal Tortelier (1996). Fauré&#x27;s main chamber works have all been recorded, with players including the Ysaÿe Quartet, Domus, Paul Tortelier, Arthur Grumiaux, and Joshua Bell. The complete solo piano works have been recorded by Kathryn Stott (1995), Paul Crossley (1984–85) and Lucas Debargue (2021-2022) with substantial sets of the major piano works from Germaine Thyssens-Valentin, Jean-Philippe Collard (1982–84), Pascal Rogé (1990), and Kun-Woo Paik (2002). Fauré&#x27;s songs have all been recorded for CD, including a complete set (2005), anchored by the accompanist Graham Johnson, with soloists Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, Felicity Lott, John Mark Ainsley and Jennifer Smith, among others. The Requiem and the shorter choral works are also well represented on disc. &quot;Pénélope&quot; has been recorded twice, with casts headed by Régine Crespin in 1956, and Jessye Norman in 1981, conducted respectively by Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht and Charles Dutoit. &quot;Prométhée&quot; has not been recorded in full, but extensive excerpts were recorded under Roger Norrington (1980).

===Modern assessment===
A 2001 article on Fauré in &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot; concludes thus:
Fauré&#x27;s biographer Nectoux writes in the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; that Fauré is widely regarded as the greatest master of French song, and that alongside the &quot;mélodies&quot;, the chamber works rank as &quot;Fauré&#x27;s most important contribution to music&quot;. The critic Robert Orledge writes, &quot;His genius was one of synthesis: he reconciled such opposing elements as modality and tonality, anguish and serenity, seduction and force within a single non-eclectic style, as in the &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; suite, his symphonic masterpiece. The quality of constant renewal within an apparently limited range ... is a remarkable facet of his genius, and the spare, elliptical style of his single String Quartet suggests that his intensely self-disciplined style was still developing at the time of his death&quot;.

<text>Bærum () is a municipality in the Greater Oslo Region in Akershus County, Norway. It forms an affluent suburb of Oslo on the west coast of the city. Bærum is Norway&#x27;s fifth largest municipality with a population of 128,760 (2021). The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838.

Bærum has the highest income per capita in Norway and the highest proportion of university-educated individuals. Bærum, particularly its eastern neighbourhoods bordering West End Oslo, is one of Norway&#x27;s priciest and most fashionable residential areas, leading Bærum residents to be frequently stereotyped as snobs in Norwegian popular culture. The municipality has been voted the best Norwegian place to live in considering governance and public services to citizens.

==Name==
The name (Old Norse: &quot;Bergheimr&quot;) is composed of &quot;berg&quot;, which means &quot;mountain&quot;, and &quot;heimr&quot;, which means &quot;homestead&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;. It probably originally belonged to a farm located at the base of the prominent mountain of Kolsås. In Old Norse times, the municipality was often called &quot;Bergheimsherað&quot;, meaning &quot;the &quot;herað&quot; (parish/district) of &quot;Bergheimr&quot;&quot;.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms was granted on 9 January 1976. They show an old silver-colored lime kiln on a green background. That was an important aspect of the local economy from the Middle Ages until around 1800. There are still some original ovens visible in the municipality.

==History==
The area known today as Bærum was a fertile agricultural area as far back as the Bronze Age, and several archeological finds stem from the Iron Age. The first mention of the name is from the saga of Sverre of Norway, from about 1200. There are ruins of stone churches from the 12th century at Haslum and Tanum.

The pilgrim road to Trondheim, established after 1030, went through Bærum, and there is evidence that lime kilns were in use in the area in 850. There were shipping ports for the quicklime at Slependen and Sandvika. The lime kiln is the main motif for the municipality&#x27;s coat of arms.

In the 17th century, iron ore was discovered in Bærum and the ironworks at Bærums Verk were founded. Industries such as paper mills, nail factories, sawmills, glassworks, and brickworks were established along the rivers Lysakerelven and Sandvikselva in the following centuries. There were orchards and other agricultural concerns throughout the area, remnants of which still exist today.

A number of artists established themselves in Bærum, particularly around the art school run by Johan Fredrik Eckersberg. Among the artists who did much of their work in Bærum are Frits Thaulow, Christian Skredsvig, Harriet Backer, Kitty Lange Kielland, Otto Sinding, Eilif Pettersen, Gerhardt Munthe, and Erik Werenskiold.

Starting in the mid-20th century, Bærum&#x27;s agricultural base gradually gave way to residential construction. Still, only a third of the area, , is built up for residential use; over half is productive forestry; and nearly is still agricultural.

In 2010, the Eurovision Song Contest was hosted in Bærum.

On 10 August 2019, a gunman opened fire on congregants at the Al-Noor Islamic Centre, after shooting and killing his ethnically Chinese adopted stepsister at their home.

==Geography==

The physical geography of Bærum is dominated by a craggy coastline along the Oslofjord and inland, hilly areas rising to the north and east, where there are large forested areas. The mountain of Kolsås forms a natural center, but the municipality also includes the secluded valley of Lommedalen. Four major rivers flow through the municipality: Lysakerelven, Sandvikselva, Lomma, and Øverlandselva, and there are numerous lakes, both in residential and forested areas. The official municipality flower is &quot;Anemone ranunculoides&quot;.

The geology of Bærum is part of the Oslo Graben and includes Rhomb porphyry at Kolsås.

Since nearly two-thirds of Bærum&#x27;s area consists of forests, there are rich opportunities for outdoor activities, such as skiing, hiking, and fishing. The forests are considered part of Marka, the forested areas in and around Greater Oslo. Areas within the municipality of Bærum include Bærumsmarka, Vestmarka, and Krokskogen.

The highest point in Bærum is Vidvangshøgda at with an altitude of . The largest lake is Stovivatnet with an area of at 


==Economy==
Bærum&#x27;s industrial base has since the 1950s given way to service industries, including retailing, engineering, public services, etc. It derives much of its tax base by being a bedroom community to Oslo. It is one of the most affluent areas in Norway.

Two of Norway&#x27;s busiest highways (E18 and E16) and one railroad traverse the municipality. There has been considerable development of office parks along E18, especially around Lysaker in the last 20–30 years, reducing some of the pressure on downtown areas of Oslo.
Scandinavian Airlines System Norway has its offices in Fornebu, Bærum. The airline Widerøe has some administrative offices in Lysaker, Bærum. Norwegian Air Shuttle has its head office in Fornebu.

Partnair, a charter airline, was headquartered at Fornebu Airport. When the airline Busy Bee of Norway existed, its head office was on the grounds of Fornebu Airport. Braathens and SAS Braathens had their head office facilities in a building on the grounds of Fornebu Airport. In 2010, Norwegian Air Shuttle bought the former Braathens head office.

<text>Henri Farman (26 May 1874 – 17 July 1958) was a British-French aviator and aircraft designer and manufacturer with his brother Maurice Farman. Before dedicating himself to aviation he gained fame as a sportsman, specifically in cycling and motor racing. Henri acquired French nationality in 1937.

==Family and early life==
Henri Farman was born in Paris, France, and was baptised as Harry Edgar Mudford Farman. He was a son of Thomas Frederick Farman, the Paris correspondent of the &quot;London Standard.&quot; His father was born in 1845 at Layer Marney, Essex, England. His mother, Sophia Ann Louisa Mudford, was born in Canterbury, Kent, on 9 September 1841. She was baptised on 16 July 1844 at St Pancras Old Church in London, and was a daughter of the author William Mudford, who by the time of Sophia&#x27;s baptism was living at Harrington Square. Sophia and Thomas were married at St George&#x27;s Hanover Square Church London, on 31 August 1868.

Henri trained as a painter at the École des Beaux Arts, but soon became interested in the new mechanical inventions that were appearing at the end of the 19th century. He was able to pursue this interest as an amateur sportsman.

==Cycling==
He took part in cycle races from the age of fourteen, and started winning some races. Brother Maurice Farman also began cycle racing at the same age and started winning prizes. Henri became a championship cyclist, and won the Paris - Clermont-Ferrand race on 6 June 1892. On 6 October 1892 he won the French Championship, at the Vélodrome Buffalo in Paris, over a distance of 100 kilometres.

On 25 June 1893, Henri went by bicycle from Paris to Madrid with the journalist, author, and French cyclist Edouard de Perrodil. Edouard had written an account of this journey, and a book was published by MM. C. Marpon and Flammarion, titled &quot;Vélo ! Toro! Paris-Madrid bicyclette en 1893,&quot; which included drawings by Farman. They were received by the French Ambassador, among others upon reaching Madrid.

He then took part in tandem races with his brother Maurice Farman, forming a successful partnership.
On 31 January 1895, at the Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver, the Farman brothers broke the tandem bicycle record, covering 44.906 kilometres in an hour.
They announced their retirement from cycling in November 1896.

==Motor racing==
At around the same time as his brother Maurice, Henri discovered motor racing. On 17 February 1901, he won the light car class (400 – 650 kg) &quot;Grand Prix du Palais d&#x27;Hiver,&quot; of the &quot;Circuit du sud-ouest.&quot; Maurice Farman won the heavy car class of the race. On 29 May 1901, Henri took part in the Paris-Bordeaux race and finished in seventh place. This was an open-entry race held concurrently with the 1901 Gordon Bennett Cup, and over the same course. Fifth place was taken in the 1901 Paris to Berlin Race. Henri won the heavy class section of the 1902 Paris - Vienna race. Marcel Renault came first in the general classification of this race. He took third place in the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup.

He had an accident during the elimination trials for the 1905 Gordon Bennett Cup, on 16 June, over the hilly Auvergne circuit. While on the last round of this circuit, descending the Clermont Ferrand hill, on one of the turns in that descent, his car skidded. Henri and his chauffeur were lifted from the car, and ended up on top of a tree. Many onlookers believed he had been killed. But Henri was unharmed, came down from the tree and smoked a cigarette. He believed his car had ended up at the bottom of a ravine after this accident, but was not certain about the final destination of it.

==Aviation==
He started practicing in 1907 with a homemade biplane glider on the sandhills of Le Touquet, after first experimenting with model aeroplanes of different sizes.
Henri then decided he wanted a machine powered plane, and ordered a Voisin 1907 biplane on 1 June 1907. He used this aircraft to set many official records for both distance and duration.

On 26 October 1907, at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, he made flights, among others, of 363, 403, and 771 metres in the plane. And he also started to turn the plane in the air on this date. The distance of 771 metres was completed in 52 seconds. It was the longest flight in the world that year, and won Farman the Ernest Archdeacon Cup. He made a complete circular flight of 1,030 metres, in 1 minute 14 seconds on 10 November 1907 at Issy. This was the first time that a European aeroplane had completed a full circle. And the first time that an aeroplane, other than a Wright brothers one, had stayed in the air for longer than a minute.

The &quot;Voisin-Farman I&quot; was also the first biplane in Europe to fly a circular circuit of 1 kilometre, over a predetermined course, on 13 January 1908. This again occurred at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, and won Henri the 50,000 franc Grand Prix d&#x27;Aviation offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe. And on 21 March 1908, at the same place, he made a flight of 2.004 kilometres.

On 30 October 1908, Farman went on to make the first cross-country flight in Europe. Henri flew from his hangars at Camp de Châlons, Bouy, to Reims, landing at the cavalry ground. It was a distance of 27 kilometres.

By early 1909, Farman fell out with Gabriel Voisin because Voisin had sold an aircraft that had been built to Farman&#x27;s specifications to J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon. This aircraft was named the &quot;Bird of Passage&quot; by Brabazon. So Henri started manufacturing aircraft to his own design. The first of these, the Farman III, first flew in April 1909. It was an immediate success and widely imitated.

In 1909, he opened a flying school at Châlons-sur-Marne at which George Bertram Cockburn was the first pupil. In this same year he made further record breaking flights. One of 180 kilometres in just over 3 hours, at Reims on 27 August. And one of 232 kilometres in 4 hours 17 minutes and 53 seconds, at Mourmelon-le-Grand on 3 November. In October 1909 he appeared at the Blackpool Aviation Week, Britain&#x27;s first air show, at which he won over £2000 in prizes.

In partnership with his two brothers Maurice and Richard (Dick), he built a highly successful and innovative aircraft manufacturing plant. Their 1914 model was used extensively for artillery observation and reconnaissance during World War I. The Farman Aircraft company&#x27;s &quot;Goliath&quot; was the first long-distance passenger airliner, beginning regular Paris-London (Croydon Airport) flights on 8 February 1919.

He was made a chevalier of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1919. Along with Maurice, he retired in 1937 when the French Popular Front government nationalised the aircraft industry; Farman&#x27;s company becoming part of the &quot;Societe Nationale de Constructions Aeronautiques du Centre&quot;.

Henry Farman took French nationality in 1937.

He died in Paris on 17 July 1958 and is buried in the Cimetière de Passy in Paris.

In 1988, Farman was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<text>Baby Gramps is an American guitar performer, who, though born in Miami, Florida, has been based in the Northwest U.S. for at least the last 40 years. He is famous for his palindromes. Baby Gramps started performing in 1964 and is still playing professionally as of 2018.

==Style==

Baby Gramps plays a mixture of styles and eras including traditional blues, children&#x27;s and labor songs, and his own compositions. His busy and unusual guitar style includes flat and finger picking, and &quot;chording&quot; with the back of his hand and his elbow. His singing styles include throat singing. His performance is based in part on improvisation and he often encourages audience participation. Baby Gramps has performed as a street musician, and has toured with Artis the Spoonman, Béla Fleck and the Flecktones and Phish. His rendition of &quot;The Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; was featured in Martin Bell&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated documentary film, &quot;Streetwise&quot;.

==Popularity==

Writer Patrick Ferris said he has &quot;a mass appeal in the sense that any audience between the age of 2 and 102 are captivated by his vaudeville antics, hilarious lyrics and animated guitar playing... His voice is a cross between Popeye the Sailor and a Didgeridoo and the plinkity plink of his VERY worn National steel guitar, sounds like a wind up jack in the box. If you listen closely and know anything about music, you&#x27;ll realize Gramps is an absolutely incredible guitar player. Being a professional musician for over 40 years can&#x27;t help but give you some sort of chops, but Gramps is a modern day Robert Johnson; a revolutionary guitarist that, like Thelonious Monk on piano, can play the notes &#x27;between the cracks.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="73096" wikidata="Q436010" url="?curid=73096" title="John Nelson Darby">
<text>John Nelson Darby (18 November 1800 – 29 April 1882) was an Anglo-Irish Bible teacher, one of the influential figures among the original Plymouth Brethren and the founder of the Exclusive Brethren. He is considered to be the father of modern dispensationalism and futurism. Pre-tribulation rapture theology was popularized extensively in the 1830s by John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren, and further popularized in the United States in the early 20th century by the wide circulation of the Scofield Reference Bible.

He produced translations of the Bible in German, the &quot;Elberfelder Bibel&quot;, in French, the &quot;Pau&quot; Bible, the Dutch New Testament, and the famous and influential English translation (finished posthumously) based on the Hebrew and Greek texts called &quot;The Holy Scriptures: A New Translation from the Original Languages by J. N. Darby&quot;. It has furthermore been translated into other languages in whole or part.

==Biography==

===Early years===
John Nelson Darby was born in Westminster, London, and christened at St Margaret&#x27;s on 3 March 1801. He was the youngest of the six sons of John Darby and Anne Vaughan. The Darbys were an Anglo-Irish landowning family seated at Leap Castle, King&#x27;s County, Ireland, (present-day County Offaly). He was a nephew of Admiral Henry D&#x27;Esterre Darby who served with Lord Nelson at the Battle of the Nile, and it was in recognition of this family connection that John was given his middle name.

Darby was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College Dublin where he graduated Classical Gold Medallist in 1819. Darby embraced Christianity during his studies, although there is no evidence that he formally studied theology. He joined an inn of court, but felt that being a lawyer was inconsistent with his religious belief. The future Bishop of Meath and evangelical Joseph Singer tutored him at Trinity. He, therefore, chose ordination as an Anglican clergyman in Ireland, &quot;lest he should sell his talents to defeat justice&quot;. In 1825, Darby was ordained deacon of the established Church of Ireland and the following year as priest.

===Middle years===
Darby became a curate in the Church of Ireland parish of Delgany, County Wicklow, and distinguished himself by persuading Roman Catholic peasants in the Calary district within this parish to abandon the Catholic Church. The well-known gospel tract &quot;How the Lost Sheep was Saved&quot; gives his personal account of a visit he paid to a dying shepherd boy in this area, painting a vivid picture of what his work among the poor people involved. He later claimed to have won hundreds of converts to the Church of Ireland. However, the conversions ended when William Magee, the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, ruled that converts were obliged to swear allegiance to George IV as the rightful king of Ireland.

Darby resigned his curacy in protest. Soon afterwards, in October 1827, he fell from a horse and was seriously injured. He later stated that it was during this time that he began to believe that the &quot;kingdom&quot; described in the Book of Isaiah and elsewhere in the Old Testament was entirely different from the Christian church.

Over the next five years, he developed the principles of his mature theology – most notably his conviction that the very notion of a clergyman was a sin against the Holy Spirit, because it limited the recognition that the Holy Spirit could speak through any member of the Church. During this time (1827–28) he joined an interdenominational meeting of believers (including Anthony Norris Groves, Edward Cronin, J. G. Bellett, and Francis Hutchinson) who met to &quot;break bread&quot; together in Dublin as a symbol of their unity in Christ. By 1832, this group had grown and began to identify themselves as a distinct Christian assembly. As they travelled and began new assemblies in Ireland and England, they formed the movement now known as the Plymouth Brethren.

It is believed that John Nelson Darby left the Church of Ireland around 1831. He participated in the 1831–33 Powerscourt Conference, an annual meeting of Bible students organized by his friend, the wealthy widow Lady Powerscourt. At the conference, Darby publicly described his ecclesiological and eschatological views, including the pre-tribulation rapture. For about 40 years William Kelly (1821–1906) was his chief interpreter and continued to be a staunch supporter until his own death. Kelly in his work &quot;John Nelson Darby as I knew him&quot; stated that &quot;a saint more true to Christ&#x27;s name and word I never knew or heard of&quot;.

Darby defended Calvinist doctrines when they came under attack from within the Church in which he once served. His biographer Goddard states, &quot;Darby indicates his approval of the doctrine of the Anglican Church as expressed in Article XVII of the Thirty-Nine Articles&quot; on the subject of election and predestination. Darby said:

===Later years===
Darby travelled widely in Europe and Britain in the 1830s and 1840s, and established many Brethren assemblies. He gave 11 significant lectures in Geneva in 1840 on the hope of the church (&quot;L&#x27;attente actuelle de l&#x27;église&quot;). These established his reputation as a leading interpreter of biblical prophecy. America did not embrace Darby&#x27;s ecclesiology as it did his eschatology, which is still being propagated (in various forms) at such places as Dallas Theological Seminary, and by authors and preachers such as Hal Lindsey and John Hagee.

In 1848, Darby became involved in a complex dispute over the proper method for maintaining shared standards of discipline in different assemblies that resulted in a split between Open Brethren, which maintained a congregational form of government and Exclusive Brethren. After that time, he was recognized as the dominant figure among the Exclusives, who also came to be known as &quot;Darbyite&quot; Brethren. He made at least 5 missionary journeys to North America between 1862 and 1877. He worked mostly in New England, Ontario, and the Great Lakes region, but took one extended journey from Toronto to Sydney by way of San Francisco, Hawaii, and New Zealand. A Geographical Index of his letters is currently available and lists where he travelled. He used his classical skills to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek texts into several languages. In English, he wrote a Synopsis of the Bible and many other scholarly religious articles. He wrote hymns and poems, the most famous being, &quot;The Man of Sorrows&quot;, (not to be confused with &quot;Man of Sorrows, What a name&quot; by Philip Bliss (1838-1876)). He was also a Bible commentator. His writings were collected in his lifetime and published from January 1866 as &quot;The Collected Writings of J. N. Darby&quot;; there were 32 volumes published – two per year 1866–81 and two more soon after. He translated the Bible with the help of various brethren in different countries into German, French and English. He declined, however, to contribute to the compilation of the Revised Version of the King James Bible even though the revisers consulted Darby&#x27;s work.

He died 1882 in Sundridge House, Bournemouth and is buried in Bournemouth, Dorset, England.

Darby is noted in the theological world as the father of &quot;dispensationalism&quot;, whose eschatology was adopted and later made popular in the United States by Cyrus Scofield&#x27;s Scofield Reference Bible.

Charles Henry Mackintosh, 1820–1896, with his popular style spread Darby&#x27;s teachings to humbler elements in society and may be regarded as the journalist of the Brethren Movement. Mackintosh popularised Darby more than any other Brethren author. In the early twentieth century, the Brethren&#x27;s teachings, through Margaret E. Barber, greatly influenced the Little Flock or Church Assembly Hall of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.

Darby has been credited with originating the &quot;pre-tribulational rapture theory&quot; wherein Christ will suddenly remove His bride, the Church, from this world to its heavenly destiny before the judgments of the tribulation. Thus the prophetic program resumes with Israel&#x27;s earthly destiny. Dispensationalist beliefs about the fate of the Jews and the re-establishment of the Kingdom of Israel put dispensationalists at the forefront of Christian Zionism, because &quot;God is able to graft them in again,&quot; and they believe that in His grace he will do so according to their understanding of Old Testament prophecy. They believe that, while the ways of God may change, His purposes to bless Israel will never be forgotten, just as He has shown unmerited favour to the Church, He will do so to a remnant of Israel to fulfil all the promises made to the genetic seed of Abraham.

==Criticism==
Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle and contemporary of Darby, published criticism of Darby and Brethrenism. His main criticism was that Darby and the Plymouth Brethren rejected the vicarious purpose of Christ&#x27;s obedience as well as imputed righteousness. He viewed these of such importance and so central to the Gospel that it led him to publish this statement about the rest of their belief in the Sword and Trowel.

James Grant wrote: &quot;With the deadly heresies entertained and taught by the Plymouth Brethren, in relation to some of the most momentous of all the doctrines of the Gospel, and to which I have adverted at some length, I feel assured that my readers will not be surprised at any other views, however unscriptural and pernicious they may be, which the Darbyites have embraced and zealously seek to propagate&quot;

<doc id="73100" wikidata="Q319723" url="?curid=73100" title="Tex Avery">
<text>Frederick Bean &quot;Tex&quot; Avery (; February 26, 1908 – August 26, 1980) was an American animator, cartoonist, director, and voice actor. He was known for directing and producing animated cartoons during the golden age of American animation. His most significant work was for the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, where he was crucial in the creation and evolution of famous animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Droopy, Screwy Squirrel, The Wolf, Red Hot Riding Hood, and George and Junior.

He gained influence for his technical innovation, directorial style, and brand of humor. Avery&#x27;s attitude toward animation was opposite that of Walt Disney and other conventional family cartoons at the time. Avery&#x27;s cartoons were known for their sarcastic, ironic, absurdist, irreverent, and sometimes sexual tone in nature. They focused on sight gags, surrealist humor, rapid pacing, racial stereotypes, and violent humor, with wacky characters who broke the fourth wall.
==Early life and education==

Avery was born to Mary Augusta &quot;Jessie&quot; (née Bean; 1886–1931) and George Walton Avery (1867–1935) in Taylor, Texas. His father was born in Alabama and his mother was born in Chickasaw County, Mississippi.

Avery graduated in 1926 from North Dallas High School. A popular catchphrase at his school was &quot;What&#x27;s up, doc?&quot;, which he later used for Bugs Bunny in the 1940s. Interested in becoming a newspaper cartoonist, he took a three-month summer course at the Chicago Art Institute but left after a month.

==Animation career==
On January 1, 1928, Avery arrived in Los Angeles. He spent the next few months working in menial jobs. According to animation historian Michael Barrier, these jobs included working in a warehouse, working on the docks at night, loading fruits and vegetables, and painting cars. He began his animation career when hired by the Winkler studio (named after producer Margaret J. Winkler and later known as Screen Gems). He was an inker, inking cels for animated short films in the &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; series; the character had been created by Walt Disney. Avery then moved to a new studio, Universal Cartoon Studios (later known as Walter Lantz Productions). He was again employed as an inker, but moved rapidly up the studio&#x27;s hierarchy. By 1930, Avery had been promoted to the position of animator.

Avery continued working at the Walter Lantz Studio into the early 1930s. He worked on most of the &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons from 1931 to 1935. He is shown as &quot;animator&quot; on the original title card credits on the Oswald cartoons. He later claimed to have directed two cartoons during this time.

===Accident to eye===
During some office horseplay at the Lantz studio, a thumbtack or paper clip flew into Avery&#x27;s left eye and caused him to lose sight in that eye. Some speculate it was his lack of depth perception that gave him his unique look at animation and bizarre directorial style, but it did not stop his creative career. The incident is described in some detail by Barrier, based in part on old interviews with Avery. Part of the typical crude horseplay at the Universal studio was using a rubber band or a paper spitball to target the back of a colleague&#x27;s head. An animator called Charles Hastings decided to take the game one step further, by using a wire paper clip, instead. Avery heard one of his colleagues telling him to look out. He reacted by turning around. Instead of the back of his head, the paper clip hit Avery in his left eye. He instantly lost the use of his eye.

===From inker to storyboards===
As an animator, Avery worked under director Bill Nolan. Nolan reportedly delegated work to Avery, whenever Avery had to animate a sequence. Nolan&#x27;s instructions for a scene involving Oswald being chased by bees were reportedly simple. He would describe in which direction Oswald was running (&quot;right to left&quot;) and for how many feet. The rest of the details were left up to Avery. Avery started handing out work to other animators working under Nolan.

Avery wanted still greater control over the creative process and served as a &quot;de facto&quot; director for a couple of films. Based on Avery&#x27;s recollections, here is a description of how this happened. He was submitting sight gags for use in the short films. Some of them were used in the actual films, and some funny ones were left out. He wanted to somehow get all his gags in the finished film. So, he asked Nolan to let him create the entire storyboard for a film. Nolan instructed Avery to not only draw the storyboard, but also to work on the timing and the layout on his own. Avery completed two films using this process. An older Avery recalled that both films &quot;were terrible&quot;, though they got accepted for release.

Avery was reportedly displeased with his salary and had started giving up on his work. After about six weeks of substandard work, his superiors let him go. In April 1935, Avery lost his job at the Universal studio.

=== &quot;Termite Terrace&quot; ===
Later in 1935, Avery applied for a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions (the company later known as Warner Bros. Cartoons). Avery reportedly managed to convince producer Leon Schlesinger that he was an experienced director, a false claim. In Avery&#x27;s own words:

By 1935, when Avery was hired, the Schlesinger studio had only two full-time, regular film directors: Friz Freleng and Jack King. Avery became the third regular director. The staff of the Schlesinger studio had become too large to be housed in a single building, at the Warner Bros. backlot on Sunset Boulevard. The new Avery unit of the studio was granted their own building, a five-room bungalow. The unit staff dubbed their quarters &quot;Termite Terrace&quot;, due to its significant termite population. &quot;Termite Terrace&quot; later became the nickname for the entire Schlesinger/Warner Bros. studio, primarily because Avery and his unit were the ones who defined what became known as &quot;the Warner Bros. cartoon&quot;.

Avery was granted exclusive use of four animators: Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Sid Sutherland, and Virgil Ross. The first animated short film produced by this unit was &quot;Gold Diggers of &#x27;49&quot; (1935), the third &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; film starring Beans. Beans was also featured in the film&#x27;s title card, signifying that he was the intended protagonist. The film had a Western setting and cast Beans as a gold miner. Also featured in the film was a redesigned Porky Pig, making his second appearance. The Avery unit was assigned to work primarily on the black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; instead of the Technicolor &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, but was allowed to make color &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; beginning with &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot; from 1936.

Avery stopped using Beans following &quot;Gold Diggers of &#x27;49&quot;, but continued using Porky as a star character. According to Michael Barrier, Beans was more of a straight man. However, Porky had to be redesigned again. The early Porky was decidedly &quot;piglike&quot; in appearance. In Michael Barrier&#x27;s description, Porky was very fat, had small eyes, a large snout, and pronounced jowls. He was like a porcine version of Roscoe Arbuckle. Starting with &quot;Porky the Rainmaker&quot; (1936), his fourth animated short starring Porky, Avery introduced a cuter version of Porky. The new design gave Porky more prominent eyes and a smaller snout. The jowls were replaced by chubby cheeks. Porky&#x27;s body now had a rounder shape; its defining trait was not fatness, but softness. Barrier notes that the new design by Avery departed from the &quot;Disneyish&quot; realism in the previous drawing style. Porky became a less realistic pig and looked more like a cartoon character.

According to Martha Sigall, Avery was one of the few directors to visit the ink and paint department — where he would answer questions and was always in good humor — as he liked to see how his cartoons were developing. When some of the artists humorously criticized the wild action in his animated shorts, Avery would take time to explain his rationale. He recalled that while working at Warner Bros., the animators had a great deal of liberty, and were subject to very little censorship.

===Creation of Looney Tunes stars===
Avery, with the assistance of Clampett, Jones, and the new associate director Frank Tashlin, laid the foundation for a style of animation that rivaled The Walt Disney Studio as the leader in animated short films, and created a group of cartoon characters that are still known today. Avery, in particular, was deeply involved. He crafted gags for the shorts, and sometimes provided voices for them (including his trademark belly laugh) and held such control over the timing of the shorts that he would add or cut frames out of the final negative if he felt a gag&#x27;s timing was not quite right.

&quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; (1937) introduced the character of Daffy Duck, who possessed a new form of &quot;lunacy&quot; and zaniness that had not been seen before in animated cartoons. Daffy was an almost completely crazy &quot;darn fool duck&quot; who frequently bounced around the film frame in double-speed, screaming &quot;Hoo-hoo!&quot; in a high-pitched, sped-up voice provided by voice artist Mel Blanc, who, with this cartoon, also took over providing the voice of Porky Pig. Avery directed two more Daffy Duck cartoons: &quot;Daffy Duck &amp; Egghead&quot; and &quot;Daffy Duck in Hollywood&quot;. Egghead was a character inspired by comedian Joe Penner and first appeared in Avery&#x27;s &quot;Egghead Rides Again&quot;. 

&quot;Little Red Walking Hood&quot; first introduced the early character of Elmer Fudd as a character mostly taking part of some running gag. Elmer in this early form had green clothes, a brown bowler hat, and a pink nose. He was also named &quot;Elmer&quot; on the lobby cards for &quot;The Isle of Pingo Pongo&quot; (1938), his second appearance, &quot;Cinderella Meets Fella&quot; (1938), his third appearance, and was fully called &quot;Elmer Fudd&quot; on screen in &quot;A Feud There Was&quot; (1938), also his fourth appearance. Elmer even appears on early merchandise and in the early Looney Tunes books in 1938 and 1939 and was later promoted as &quot;Egghead&#x27;s Brother&quot; on the Vitaphone Release Sheet for &quot;Cinderella Meets Fella&quot; because Elmer was also voiced by Danny Webb in his Joe Penner voice that was also use for Egghead.

Ben Hardaway, Cal Dalton, and Chuck Jones directed a series of shorts that featured a Daffy Duck-like rabbit, created by Ben &quot;Bugs&quot; Hardaway. As is the case with most directors, each puts his own personal stamp on the characters, stories, and overall feel of a short. So, each of these cartoons treated the rabbit differently. The next to try out the rabbit, known around Termite Terrace as &quot;Bugs&#x27; bunny&quot; (named after Hardaway), was Avery. Since the recycling of storylines among the directors was commonplace, &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; was a double throwback. Avery had directed the short &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; featuring Porky Pig, which also introduced Daffy Duck.

Hardaway remade it as &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot;, introducing the rabbit. So, Avery went back to the &quot;hunter and prey&quot; framework, incorporating Jones&#x27;s &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Candid Camera&quot; gag for gag and altering the new design of Elmer Fudd, polishing the timing, and expanding the Groucho Marx smart-aleck attitude already present in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot;; he made Bugs a kind of slick Brooklynesque rabbit who was always in control of the situation. Avery has stated that it was very common to refer to folks in Texas as &quot;doc&quot;, much like &quot;pal&quot;, &quot;dude&quot;, or &quot;bud&quot;. In &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, Bugs adopts this colloquialism when he casually walks up to Elmer, who is &quot;hunting wabbits&quot; and while carefully inspecting a rabbit hole, shotgun in hand, the first words out of Bugs&#x27;s mouth is a coolly calm, &quot;What&#x27;s up, doc?&quot; Audiences reacted riotously to the juxtaposition of Bugs&#x27;s nonchalance and the potentially dangerous situation. &quot;What&#x27;s up, doc?&quot; instantly became the rabbit&#x27;s catchphrase. Originally, Avery wanted Bugs Bunny to be called Jack E. Rabbit because he hunted for jack rabbits when he was a kid. Numerous suggestions for names came up, but publicist Rose Horsely liked the name that was on Thorson&#x27;s model sheet, saying that it was cute and they will &quot;play it two ways.&quot; Avery argued on his stance for the name &quot;Jack E. Rabbit&quot; saying that &quot;Mine&#x27;s a rabbit! A tall, lanky, mean rabbit. He isn&#x27;t a fuzzy little bunny.&quot; He also said the name Bugs Bunny sounded like a Disney character. Nevertheless, Schlesinger settled on Bugs Bunny.

Avery ended up directing only four Bugs Bunny cartoons: &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, &quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot;, &quot;The Heckling Hare&quot;, and &quot;All This and Rabbit Stew&quot;. During this period, he also directed a number of one-shot shorts, including travelogue parody (&quot;The Isle of Pingo Pongo&quot;, which is the second cartoon to feature an early character that evolved into Elmer Fudd); fractured fairy-tales (&quot;The Bear&#x27;s Tale&quot;); Hollywood caricature films (&quot;Hollywood Steps Out&quot;); and cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny clones (&quot;The Crackpot Quail&quot;).

Avery&#x27;s tenure at the Schlesinger studio ended in late 1941 when the producer and he quarreled over the ending to &quot;The Heckling Hare&quot;. In Avery&#x27;s original version, Bugs and the hunting dog were to fall off a cliff &quot;three times&quot;, making it an early example of the wild take. According to a DVD commentary for the cartoon, historian and animator Greg Ford explained that the problem Schlesinger had with the ending was that, just before falling off the third time, Bugs and the dog were to turn to the screen, with Bugs saying, &quot;Hold on to your hats, folks, here we go again!&quot;, a punchline to a potentially risqué joke of the day. However, Barrier uncovered a typewritten dialogue transcript of the cartoon that mentions the three falls at the end, but the &quot;Hold on to your hats&quot; line is absent, with the rest of the dialogue in the cartoon transcribed accurately. This inferred that Avery either misremembered or embellished the story and Schlesinger made the cut not because of any risqué content, but because he did not think that it was funny that Avery was killing Bugs three times, and the ending simply dragged on for too long. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported on the quarrel on July 2, 1941. Avery was slapped with a four-week, unpaid suspension.

===&quot;Speaking of Animals&quot;===
While at Schlesinger, Avery created a concept of animating lip movement to live-action footage of animals. Schlesinger was not interested in Avery&#x27;s idea, so Avery approached Jerry Fairbanks, a friend of his who produced the &quot;Unusual Occupations&quot; series of short subjects for Paramount Pictures. Fairbanks liked the idea and the &quot;Speaking of Animals&quot; series of shorts was launched. When Avery left the Schlesinger studio in mid-1941, he went straight to Paramount to work on the first three shorts in the series before joining Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The series continued without him, lasting seven years.

=== Avery at MGM ===

On September 2, 1941, the &quot;Reporter&quot; announced that Avery had signed a five-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was to form his own animation unit and direct shorts in Technicolor. By 1942, Avery was in the employ of MGM, working in their cartoon division under the supervision of Fred Quimby. Avery felt that Schlesinger had stifled him. When asked if he missed the Looney Tunes characters, he responded: &quot;Sometimes, but I don&#x27;t miss anything else. MGM is a heck of a better place to work, in every way, and the people here are just as great.&quot;

At MGM, Avery&#x27;s creativity reached its peak. His cartoons became known for their sheer lunacy, breakneck pace, and penchant for playing with the medium of animation and film in general that few other directors dared to approach. MGM also offered him larger budgets and a higher quality production level than the Warner Bros. studio; plus, his unit was filled with talented ex-Disney artists such as Preston Blair and Ed Love. These changes were evident in Avery&#x27;s first short released by MGM, &quot;Blitz Wolf&quot;, an Adolf Hitler parody of the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; story, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) in 1942. Avery&#x27;s cartoons at MGM somewhat felt like Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons done during that same period at Warner Bros., albeit the Bros.&#x27; series gained more popularity than Avery&#x27;s MGM cartoons.

Avery&#x27;s best-known MGM character debuted in &quot;Dumb-Hounded&quot; (1943). Droopy (originally &quot;Happy Hound&quot;) was a small, calm, slow-moving, and slow-talking dog who always won out in the end, whatever difficulties he faced. He also created a series of risqué cartoons, beginning with &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; (also 1943), featuring a sexy female star who never had a set name, but has been unofficially referred to as &quot;Red&quot; by fans. Her visual design and voice varied somewhat between shorts. Other Avery characters at MGM included Screwy Squirrel and the &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;-inspired duo of George and Junior.

Other MGM cartoons directed by Avery include &quot;Bad Luck Blackie&quot;, &quot;Cellbound&quot;, &quot;Magical Maestro&quot;, &quot;Lucky Ducky&quot;, &quot;Ventriloquist Cat,&quot; and &quot;King-Size Canary&quot;. Avery began his stint at MGM working with lush colors and realistic backgrounds, but he slowly abandoned this style for a more frenetic, less realistic approach. The newer, more stylized look reflected the influence of the up-and-coming UPA studio, the need to cut costs as budgets grew higher, and Avery&#x27;s own desire to leave reality behind and make cartoons that were not tied to the real world of live action. During this period, he made a series of films that explored the technology of the future: &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Car of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Farm of Tomorrow,&quot; and &quot;TV of Tomorrow&quot; (spoofing common live-action promotional shorts of the time). He also introduced a slow-talking wolf character, who was the prototype for MGM associates Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Huckleberry Hound character, right down to the voice by Daws Butler.

Avery took a year&#x27;s sabbatical from MGM beginning in 1950 (to recover from overwork), during which time Dick Lundy, recently arrived from the Walter Lantz studio, took over his unit and made one &quot;Droopy&quot; cartoon, as well as a string of shorts featuring Barney Bear. Avery returned to MGM in October 1951 and began working again. Avery&#x27;s last two original cartoons for MGM were &quot;Deputy Droopy&quot; and &quot;Cellbound&quot;, completed in 1953 and released in 1955. They were co-directed by the Avery unit animator Michael Lah. Lah began directing a handful of CinemaScope Droopy shorts on his own. On March 1, 1953, Avery&#x27;s unit was terminated and he was fired from MGM. Fred Quimby spoke of bringing back the unit, but in December of that year, Walter Lantz announced that Avery would be working for him.

===Return to Walter Lantz Productions===
Avery directed four cartoons for Walter Lantz Productions in 1954–55: &quot;Crazy Mixed Up Pup&quot;, &quot;Sh-h-h-h-h-h&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Cold&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Rockabye Point&quot;, in which he defined the character of Chilly Willy the penguin. He brought his signature wild gags and fast pacing to the Lantz studio, and the Lantz cartoons received new energy and recognition. &quot;The Legend of Rockabye Point&quot; and &quot;Crazy Mixed Up Pup&quot; were nominated for Academy Awards. 

Avery had agreed to a salary and a percentage of the profits. He did not realize that his share came out of the &quot;net&quot; profits: &quot;I made about four cartoons for [Lantz], then I started thinking about the contract. I took it to an attorney, and he said, &#x27;Oh, brother! You&#x27;ll never get a dime out of this. You&#x27;re getting charged for everything but the paving out in front of the studio.&#x27; I was getting my percentage off the bottom instead of off the top. By the time all the charges went in, why, my goodness, there was nothing left. So, I gave up there.&quot; Avery left behind three new Chilly Willy storyboards, which were later made into cartoons by director Alex Lovy.
===Cascade Studios===
Avery turned to animated television commercials at Cascade Studios, including those for Raid (1950s through 1970s), in which cartoon insects, confronted by the bug killer, screamed &quot;RAID!&quot; and died flamboyantly, and Frito-Lay&#x27;s controversial mascot, the Frito Bandito. Avery also produced ads for Kool-Aid fruit drinks starring the Looney Tunes characters he had once helped create during his Termite Terrace days. Funnily enough, the Cascade executives did not even know that he created the characters. 

During the 1960s and 1970s, Avery became increasingly reserved and depressed due to the suicide of his son and the break-up of his marriage, although he continued to draw respect from his peers. After Cascade, he briefly animated commercials for his own company, Tex Avery Cartoons, from June to July 1973. Avery then went back to Cascade, and closed the cartoon department in 1978. He had an offer from Friz Freleng, to write for DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, but was not interested.

===Hanna-Barbera Productions===
From 1979 until his death, his final employer was Hanna-Barbera Productions, where he wrote gags for Saturday morning cartoons such as the Droopy-esque &quot;Kwicky Koala&quot;. According to an interview by John Dunn in his diary, Avery did not like the late animation industry at the time, feeling that it lacked quality.

== Innovation ==
Gary Morris described Avery&#x27;s innovative approach:

== Directing style ==
Avery had developed a distinct, signature style at Warner Bros. Studio, which had breakneck pacing, outlandish, over-the-top acting from his characters, and seemingly nonstop jokes and gags. Avery&#x27;s style of directing encouraged animators to stretch the boundaries of the medium to do things in a cartoon that could not be done in the world of a live-action film. An often-quoted line about Avery&#x27;s cartoons was, &quot;In a cartoon, you can do anything.&quot; He also performed a great deal of voice work in his cartoons, usually throwaway bits. He also occasionally filled in for Bill Thompson as Droopy.

==Personal life and death==
Two days after being fired from Universal in spring 1935, Avery married his girlfriend, Patricia. She was also employed at Universal Studios as an inker. The newlyweds spent a long honeymoon in Oregon, but had to return to Los Angeles when they ran out of money.

On Tuesday, August 26, 1980, Avery died of lung cancer at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Burbank, California, at the age of 72. At the time of his death, he was developing a character named &quot;Cave Mouse&quot; for a new &quot;Flintstones&quot; series. According to Chuck Jones, when watching a baseball game with another animator, Avery&#x27;s last words were, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where animators go when they die, but I guess there must be a lot of them. They could probably use a good director, though.&quot; He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.

==Influence and legacy==

Avery&#x27;s influence can be seen in modern cartoons such as &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;Cat Burglar&quot;. An Avery-esque cowboy character bore his name in the otherwise unrelated series &quot;The Wacky World of Tex Avery&quot;. Avery&#x27;s work has been featured on shows such as &quot;The Tex Avery Show&quot; and &quot;Cartoon Alley&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Dark Horse Comics released a trio of three-issue miniseries that were openly labelled tributes to Avery&#x27;s MGM cartoons, &quot;Wolf &amp; Red&quot;, &quot;Droopy&quot;, and &quot;Screwy Squirrel&quot;, in which other characters make appearances in the comics such as &quot;George and Junior&quot;, &quot;Spike&quot;, and the one-shot characters. Tex Avery, unlike most Warner Bros. directors, kept many original title frames of his cartoons; several were otherwise lost due to Blue Ribbon Reissues. Rare prints and art containing original titles and unedited animation from Avery&#x27;s MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons are now usually sold on eBay or in the collections of animators and cartoon enthusiasts. In 2008, France issued three postage stamps honoring Tex Avery for his 100th birthday, depicting Droopy, the redheaded showgirl, and the Wolf.

All of his MGM shorts were released in a North American MGM/UA laserdisc set called &quot;The Compleat Tex Avery&quot;. While two cartoons in the set were edited versions---the blackface gags in &quot;Droopy&#x27;s Good Deed&quot; and &quot;Garden Gopher&quot;---others, including the controversial &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabaña&quot; and &quot;Half-Pint Pygmy&quot; were included intact (although they were removed from the Region 2 DVD release, now out of print). Several of his cartoons were released on VHS, in four volumes of &quot;Tex Avery&#x27;s Screwball Classics&quot;, two VHS Droopy collections, and various inclusions on MGM animation collection releases, with many gags left in that had been edited out for television.

Avery&#x27;s Droopy cartoons are available on the DVD set &quot;Tex Avery&#x27;s Droopy: The Complete Theatrical Collection&quot;. The seven Droopy cartoons produced in CinemaScope were included here in their original widescreen versions (letter-boxed), instead of the pan-and-scan versions regularly broadcast on television.

Also, some of his works could be found on home video releases (from VHS to Blu-ray) of Warner Bros.&#x27; Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts, and the same is true of his few Lantz Studio cartoons included in the DVD set &quot;The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection&quot;.

Just like with the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award, first awarded to Forrest J Ackerman in 1984 and the Friz Freleng Lifetime Achievement of Excellence, first award to Isadore Freleng himself in 1994, The Texas Avery Award, first awarded to Brad Bird in 2005, 25 years after Avery&#x27;s death. First presented by the Deep Ellum Film Festival, it is now presented by Reel FX. Notable recipients include Henry Selick, Pete Docter, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders for &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, John Kricfalusi for his contributions to the animation industry, and Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.

Avery is honored by Texas Historical Marker #17073, which was unveiled in his hometown of Taylor, Texas, in 2014. The marker says Avery spent &quot;a lifetime...reinventing the American cartoon.&quot;

In February 2020, Warner Archive released &quot;Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 1&quot; on Blu-ray containing 19 of his MGM cartoons. According to Jerry Beck, most of MGM&#x27;s pre-1951 cartoons had their original negatives destroyed in a 1978 George Eastman House fire, causing great difficulties in terms of restoration. However, using the best surviving archival elements, all 19 shorts on the set have been digitally restored in HD and are uncut. In March 2020, Warner Archive announced they were working on &quot;Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 2&quot;, which was released in December 2020 and contained 21 restored and uncut shorts as well as &quot;Tex Avery: The King of Cartoons&quot;, an archival documentary as a special feature. &quot;Volume 3&quot; was released on October 5, 2021, with an additional 20 uncut restored cartoons with the Avery directed &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short, &quot;The Crackpot Quail&quot;, as a bonus feature restored with its original 1941 soundtrack.

<text>In mathematics, more specifically complex analysis, the residue is a complex number proportional to the contour integral of a meromorphic function along a path enclosing one of its singularities. (More generally, residues can be calculated for any function formula_1 that is holomorphic except at the discrete points {&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;}&quot;k&quot;, even if some of them are essential singularities.) Residues can be computed quite easily and, once known, allow the determination of general contour integrals via the residue theorem.

== Definition ==
The residue of a meromorphic function formula_2 at an isolated singularity formula_3, often denoted formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 or formula_7, is the unique value formula_8 such that formula_9 has an analytic antiderivative in a punctured disk formula_10. 

Alternatively, residues can be calculated by finding Laurent series expansions, and one can define the residue as the coefficient &quot;a&quot;−1 of a Laurent series. 

The concept can be used to provide contour integration values of certain contour integral problems considered in the residue theorem. According to the residue theorem, for a meromorphic function formula_2, the residue at point formula_12 is given as: 

: formula_13

where formula_14 is a positively oriented simple closed curve around formula_12 and not including any other singularities on or inside the curve.

The definition of a residue can be generalized to arbitrary Riemann surfaces. Suppose formula_16 is a 1-form on a Riemann surface. Let formula_16 be meromorphic at some point formula_18, so that we may write formula_16 in local coordinates as formula_20. Then, the residue of formula_16 at formula_18 is defined to be the residue of formula_23 at the point corresponding to formula_18.

== Contour integration ==
=== Contour integral of a monomial ===
Computing the residue of a monomial

:formula_25

makes most residue computations easy to do. Since path integral computations are homotopy invariant, we will let formula_26 be the circle with radius formula_27 going counter clockwise. Then, using the change of coordinates formula_28 we find that

: formula_29

hence our integral now reads as

:formula_30
Thus, the residue of formula_31 is 1 if integer formula_32 and 0 otherwise.

=== Generalization to Laurent series ===
If a function is expressed as a Laurent series expansion around c as follows:formula_33Then, the residue at the point c is calculated as:formula_34using the results from contour integral of a monomial for counter clockwise contour integral formula_14 around a point c. Hence, if a Laurent series representation of a function exists around c, then its residue around c is known by the coefficient of the formula_36 term.

=== Application in residue theorem ===

For a meromorphic function formula_2, with a finite set of singularities within a positively oriented simple closed curve formula_26 which does not pass through any singularity, the value of the contour integral is given according to residue theorem, as:formula_39where formula_40, the winding number, is formula_27 if formula_12 is in the interior of formula_26 and formula_44 if not, simplifying to:formula_45where formula_12 are all isolated singularities within the contour formula_26.

== Calculation of residues ==
Suppose a punctured disk &quot;D&quot; = {&quot;z&quot; : 0 &lt; |&quot;z&quot; − &quot;c&quot;| &lt; &quot;R&quot;} in the complex plane is given and &quot;f&quot; is a holomorphic function defined (at least) on &quot;D&quot;. The residue Res(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;c&quot; is the coefficient &quot;a&quot;−1 of in the Laurent series expansion of &quot;f&quot; around &quot;c&quot;. Various methods exist for calculating this value, and the choice of which method to use depends on the function in question, and on the nature of the singularity.

According to the residue theorem, we have:

: formula_48

where &quot;γ&quot; traces out a circle around &quot;c&quot; in a counterclockwise manner and does not pass through or contain other singularities within it. We may choose the path &quot;γ&quot; to be a circle of radius &quot;ε&quot; around &quot;c.&quot; Since &quot;ε&quot; can be as small as we desire it can be made to contain only the singularity of c due to nature of isolated singularities. This may be used for calculation in cases where the integral can be calculated directly, but it is usually the case that residues are used to simplify calculation of integrals, and not the other way around.

===Removable singularities===
If the function &quot;f&quot; can be continued to a holomorphic function on the whole disk formula_49, then Res(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) = 0. The converse is not generally true.

===Simple poles===
If &quot;c&quot; is a simple pole of &quot;f&quot;, the residue of &quot;f&quot; is given by:

:formula_50

If that limit does not exist, then &quot;f&quot; instead has an essential singularity at &quot;c&quot;. If the limit is 0, then &quot;f&quot; is either analytic at &quot;c&quot; or has a removable singularity there. If the limit is equal to infinity, then the order of the pole is higher than 1.

It may be that the function &quot;f&quot; can be expressed as a quotient of two functions, formula_51, where &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are holomorphic functions in a neighbourhood of &quot;c&quot;, with &quot;h(c)&quot; = 0 and &quot;h&#x27;(c)&quot; ≠ 0. In such a case, L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule can be used to simplify the above formula to:

: formula_52

===Limit formula for higher-order poles===
More generally, if &quot;c&quot; is a pole of order &quot;p&quot;, then the residue of &quot;f&quot; around &quot;z&quot; = &quot;c&quot; can be found by the formula:

: formula_53

This formula can be very useful in determining the residues for low-order poles. For higher-order poles, the calculations can become unmanageable, and series expansion is usually easier. For essential singularities, no such simple formula exists, and residues must usually be taken directly from series expansions.

===Residue at infinity===
In general, the residue at infinity is defined as:

: formula_54

If the following condition is met:

:formula_55

then the residue at infinity can be computed using the following formula:

:formula_56

If instead

:formula_57

then the residue at infinity is

:formula_58

For functions meromorphic on the entire complex plane with finitely many singularities, the sum of the residues at the (necessarily) isolated singularities plus the residue at infinity is zero, which gives:

: formula_59

=== Series methods ===
If parts or all of a function can be expanded into a Taylor series or Laurent series, which may be possible if the parts or the whole of the function has a standard series expansion, then calculating the residue is significantly simpler than by other methods. The residue of the function is simply given by the coefficient of formula_36 in the Laurent series expansion of the function.

== Examples ==

=== Residue from series expansion ===

==== Example 1 ====
As an example, consider the contour integral
:formula_61
where &quot;C&quot; is some simple closed curve about 0.

Let us evaluate this integral using a standard convergence result about integration by series. We can substitute the Taylor series for formula_62 into the integrand. The integral then becomes

:formula_63

Let us bring the 1/&quot;z&quot;5 factor into the series. The contour integral of the series then writes

: formula_64

Since the series converges uniformly on the support of the integration path, we are allowed to exchange integration and summation. 
The series of the path integrals then collapses to a much simpler form because of the previous computation. So now the integral around &quot;C&quot; of every other term not in the form &quot;cz&quot;−1 is zero, and the integral is reduced to

: formula_65

The value 1/4! is the &quot;residue&quot; of &quot;e&quot;&quot;z&quot;/&quot;z&quot;5 at &quot;z&quot; = 0, and is denoted

: formula_66

==== Example 2 ====
As a second example, consider calculating the residues at the singularities of the functionformula_67which may be used to calculate certain contour integrals. This function appears to have a singularity at &quot;z&quot; = 0, but if one factorizes the denominator and thus writes the function asformula_68it is apparent that the singularity at &quot;z&quot; = 0 is a removable singularity and then the residue at &quot;z&quot; = 0 is therefore 0.
The only other singularity is at &quot;z&quot; = 1. Recall the expression for the Taylor series for a function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) about &quot;z&quot; = &quot;a&quot;:formula_69So, for &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = sin &quot;z&quot; and &quot;a&quot; = 1 we haveformula_70and for &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = 1/&quot;z&quot; and &quot;a&quot; = 1 we haveformula_71Multiplying those two series and introducing 1/(&quot;z&quot; − 1) gives usformula_72So the residue of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) at &quot;z&quot; = 1 is sin 1.

==== Example 3 ====

The next example shows that, computing a residue by series expansion, a major role is played by the Lagrange inversion theorem. Letformula_73be an entire function, and letformula_74with positive radius of convergence, and with formula_75. So formula_76 has a local inverse formula_77 at 0, and formula_78 is meromorphic at 0. Then we have:formula_79Indeed,formula_80because the first series converges uniformly on any small circle around 0. Using the Lagrange inversion theoremformula_81and we get the above expression. For example, if formula_82 and also formula_83, thenformula_84andformula_85The first term contributes 1 to the residue, and the second term contributes 2 since it is asymptotic to formula_86.
Note that, with the corresponding stronger symmetric assumptions on formula_87 and formula_76, it also followsformula_89where formula_90 is a local inverse of formula_87 at 0.

<doc id="73105" wikidata="Q213711" url="?curid=73105" title="Hurling">
<text>Hurling (, &#x27;) is an outdoor [[Team sport|team game]] of ancient [[Gaelic culture|Gaelic]] Irish origin, played by men and women. One of Ireland&#x27;s native [[Gaelic games]], it shares a number of features with [[Gaelic football]], such as the field and goals, the number of players and much [[glossary of Gaelic games terms|terminology]]. The same game played by women is called [[camogie]] (&#x27;), which shares a common Gaelic root.

The objective of the game is for players to use an ash wood stick called a hurl or hurley (in Irish a &#x27;, pronounced or ) to hit a small ball called a&#x27; between the opponent&#x27;s goalposts either over the crossbar for one point or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for three points. The &#x27; can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air or struck on the ground with the hurley. It can be kicked, or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass), for short-range passing. A player who wants to carry the ball for more than four steps has to bounce or balance the&#x27; on the end of the stick (solo), and the ball can be handled only twice while in the player&#x27;s possession. Provided that a player has at least one foot on the ground, he may make a shoulder-to-shoulder charge on an opponent who is in possession of the ball or is playing the ball, or when both players are moving in the direction of the ball. No protective padding is worn by players though a plastic protective helmet with a faceguard has been mandatory for all age groups since 2010.

Early forms of hurling have been played since at least the Middle Ages, with the earliest written references appearing in Irish law tracts from the seventh century. The earliest archaeological evidence dates from the twelfth-century. The first written rules for hurling were published in January 1883 by the Dublin Hurling Club.
Hurling is today administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It has featured regularly in art forms such as film, music and literature. The final of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was listed in second place by CNN in its &quot;10 sporting events you have to see live&quot;, after the Olympic Games and ahead of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship. &quot;Financial Times&quot; columnist Simon Kuper wrote after Stephen Bennett&#x27;s performance in the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final that hurling was &quot;the best sport ever and if the Irish had colonised the world, nobody would ever have heard of football&quot;. UNESCO lists hurling as an element of intangible cultural heritage. A 2024 survey found that hurling was the favourite sport of 24% of Irish people.

==Statistics==
* A team comprises 15 players, or &quot;hurlers&quot;
* The hurley/hurl is generally in length
* The ball, known as a &quot;sliotar&quot;, has a cork centre and a leather cover; it is between in diameter, and weighs between 
* The goalkeeper&#x27;s hurley/hurl usually has a &quot;bas&quot; (the flattened, curved end) twice the size of other players&#x27; hurleys to provide some advantage against the fast moving &quot;sliotar&quot;
* A good strike with a hurley/hurl can propel the ball over in speed and in distance.
* A ball hit over the bar is worth one point. A ball that is hit under the bar is called a &quot;goal&quot; and is worth three points.
* As of 2010, all players must wear helmets.

==Rules==

===Playing field===

A hurling pitch is similar in some respects to a rugby pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching long and wide. There are &quot;H&quot;-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually high, set apart, and connected above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goal posts. The same pitch is used for Gaelic football; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of 13 metres, 20 metres and 59 metres (41 metres for Gaelic football) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams.

===Teams===

Teams consist of fifteen players: a goalkeeper, three full backs, three half backs, two midfielders, three half forwards and three full forwards (see diagram). The panel is made up of 24–30 players and five substitutions are allowed per game. An exception can now be made in the case of a blood substitute being necessary. Blood substitutes are a result of one player needing medical treatment for a laceration, usually stitches, and another coming on as a temporary replacement while the injured player is tended to.

===Helmets===

From 1 January 2010, the wearing of helmets with faceguards became compulsory for hurlers at all levels. This saw senior players follow the regulations already introduced in 2009 at minor and under 21 grades. The GAA hopes to significantly reduce the number of injuries by introducing the compulsory wearing of helmets with full faceguards, both in training and matches. Hurlers of all ages, including those at nursery clubs when holding a hurley in their hand, must wear a helmet and faceguard at all times. Match officials will be obliged to stop play if any player at any level appears on the field of play without the necessary standard of equipment.

===Duration, extra time, replays===
Senior inter-county matches last 70 minutes (35 minutes per half). All other matches last 60 minutes (30 minutes per half). For teams under-13 and lower, games may be shortened to 50 minutes. Timekeeping is at the discretion of the referee who adds on stoppage time at the end of each half. In 2020, water breaks were brought in after the first 15 minutes in each half.

There are various solutions for knockout games that end in a draw, such as a replay, or what the rules refer to as &quot;Winner on the Day&quot; measures such as extra time (20 minutes), further extra time (10 more minutes), or a shoot-out. The application and details of these measures vary according to the importance of the match and the difficulty of scheduling possible replays, and can change from year to year. The general trend is that the GAA have been trying to reduce the need for replays, to ease scheduling.

===Technical fouls===
The following are considered technical fouls (&quot;fouling the ball&quot;):

* Picking the ball directly off the ground (instead it must be flicked up with the hurley)
* Throwing the ball (instead it must be &quot;hand-passed&quot;: slapped with the open hand)
* Going more than four steps with the ball in the hand (it may be carried indefinitely on the hurley)
* Catching the ball three times in a row without it touching the ground (touching the hurley does not count)
* Putting the ball from one hand to the other
* Hand-passing a goal
* &quot;Chopping&quot; slashing downwards on another player&#x27;s hurley
*Deliberately dropping the hurley or throwing it away.
*A &#x27;square ball&#x27;, entering the opponent&#x27;s small rectangle prior to the ball entering it
*To cover or shield the ball by lying down on it.
*To deliberately throw the ball up and catch it again (the ball must touch a hurley or other body part)
*Carrying the ball over the opponent&#x27;s goal line

=== Aggressive fouls ===
Can be deliberate or accidental, often accompanied by a card. They are as follows:

* Pulling down an opponent.
* Using the hurl in an uncontrolled or reckless way.
* Tripping an opponent.
* Using threatening or abusive language to an opposing player, to a teammate, or to an official
* Throwing the hurl in a dangerous manner.
* Attempting to strike any player or official with a hurl, elbow, fist, head, or kick.
* Spitting at an opponent.

===Scoring===
Scoring is achieved by sending the &quot;sliotar&quot; between the opposition&#x27;s goal posts. The posts, which are at each end of the field, are &quot;H&quot; posts as in rugby football but with a net under the crossbar as in football. The posts are 6.4 m apart and the crossbar is 2.44 m above the ground.

If the ball goes over the crossbar, a &quot;point&quot; is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a &quot;goal&quot;, worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal must be scored by either a striking motion or by directly soloing the ball into the net. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format {goal total} – {point total}. For example, the 1996 All-Ireland final finished: Wexford 1–13 Limerick 0–14. Thus Wexford won by two points (1–13 being worth sixteen points).

In speech, a score consisting of at least one goal and one point is read as simply the two numbers, so Wexford&#x27;s 1–13 is read &quot;one thirteen&quot;; the words &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;points&quot; invariably omitted. Goals are never &quot;converted&quot; into points; it is incorrect to describe a score of 1–13 as &quot;sixteen&quot;. 2–0 would be referred to as &quot;two goals&quot;, never &quot;two zero&quot;. Likewise, 0–10 would be referred to as &quot;ten points&quot;, never &quot;zero ten&quot;. 0–0 is said &quot;no score&quot;. So the Wexford/Limerick match score would be read as &quot;Wexford one thirteen, Limerick fourteen points&quot;.

===Tackling===
Players may be tackled but not struck by a one-handed slash of the stick; exceptions are two-handed jabs and strikes. Jersey-pulling, wrestling, pushing, and tripping are all forbidden. There are several forms of acceptable tackling, the most popular being:

* the &quot;block&quot;, where one player attempts to smother an opposing player&#x27;s strike by trapping the ball between his hurley and the opponent&#x27;s swinging hurl
* the &quot;hook&quot;, where a player approaches another player from a rear angle and attempts to catch the opponent&#x27;s hurley with his own at the top of the swing
* the &quot;side pull&quot;, where two players running together for the &quot;sliotar&quot; will collide at the shoulders and swing together to win the tackle and &quot;pull&quot; (name given to swing the hurley) with extreme force
*The &quot;shoulder barge&quot; where one player attacks the other player&#x27;s shoulder by shoving him with the shoulder

===Restarting play===

* The match begins with the referee throwing the &quot;sliotar&quot; in between the four midfielders on the halfway line
* After an attacker has scored or put the ball wide of the goals, the goalkeeper may take a &quot;puckout&quot; from the hand at the edge of the small square. All players must be beyond the 20 m line.
* After a defender has put the ball wide of the goals, an attacker may take a &quot;65&quot; from the 65 m line level with where the ball went wide. It must be taken by lifting and striking. However, the ball must not be taken into the hand but struck while the ball is lifted.
* After a player has put the ball over the sideline, the other team may take a &#x27;sideline cut&#x27; at the point where the ball left the pitch. It must be taken from the ground.
* After a player has committed a foul, the other team may take a &#x27;free&#x27; at the point where the foul was committed. It must be taken by lifting and striking in the same style as the &quot;65&quot;.
* After a defender has committed a foul inside the square (large rectangle), the other team may take a &quot;penalty&quot; from the ground from behind the 20 m line. Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals. It must be taken by lifting and striking and the &quot;sliotar&quot; must be struck on or behind the 20m line (The penalty rule was amended in 2015 due to safety concerns. Before this the ball merely had to start at the 20m line but could be struck beyond it. To balance this advantage the two additional defenders previously allowed on the line have been removed).
* If many players are struggling for the ball and no side is able to capitalize or gain control of it the referee may choose to throw the ball in between two opposing players. This is also known as a &quot;throw in&quot;.

===Officials===
A hurling match is watched over by eight officials:

* The referee (on field)
* Two linesmen (sideline)
* Sideline official/standby linesman (inter-county games only)
* Four umpires (two at each end)
*Hawkeye Video technology for some scoring situations in Croke Park, Dublin and in Semple Stadium in Thurles, Co. Tipperary. (inter-county games only)
The referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees, noting infractions, and issuing yellow (caution) and red (sending off) penalty cards to players after offences. A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal.
Linesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee and also for conferring with the referee. The fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions, and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board. The umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 65 m puck (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), or a goal (wave green flag).

Contrary to popular belief within the association, all officials are not obliged to indicate &quot;any misdemeanours&quot; to the referee, but are in fact permitted to inform the referee only of violent conduct they have witnessed which has occurred without the referee&#x27;s knowledge. A linesman or umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a &quot;third time in the hand&quot;, where a player catches the ball for a third time in succession after soloing or an illegal pick up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee.

== Injury risk ==

Blunt injury to the larynx is an infrequent consequence of contact sports despite protective equipment and stringent rules. Hurling, one of the two national sporting games of Ireland, is seen as one of the fastest field sports on earth and only played with a facemask and helmet as protection, making injury an unavoidable feature of the game without further padding. The two most common sites of injury in hurling are the fingers and the hamstrings. Hurling is also considered to have &quot;a notable proportion of blunt scrotal trauma.&quot;

==History==
=== Early history ===
Forms of stick-and-ball games have been played in Ireland since at least the Early Middle Ages. References to &quot;iomáin&quot; and &quot;báire&quot; are found across early Irish law tracts, annals and poetry. The word &#x27;hurling&#x27; appears first as &#x27;horlinge&#x27; in the 1366 Statute of Kilkenny, which prohibited Gaelic Irish cultural practices in the English colony.

The eighteenth century is frequently referred to as &quot;The Golden Age of Hurling&quot;. This was when members of the Anglo-Irish landed gentry kept teams of players on their estates and challenged each other&#x27;s teams to matches for the amusement of their tenants.

=== First rules ===
The earliest effort to codify the rules was not made until the late nineteenth century, by which time the traditional forms of hurling had all but died out throughout most of country. 

=== Gaelic Athletic Association ===
The founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884 in Hayes Hotel, Thurles, County Tipperary, ended decline by organising the game around a common set of written rules. In 1888, Tipperary represented by Thurles Blues beat Meelick of Galway to win the first All-Ireland Championship. However, the twentieth century saw Cork, Kilkenny as well as Tipperary dominate hurling with each of these counties winning more than 20 All-Ireland titles each. Wexford, Waterford, Clare, Limerick, Offaly, Antrim, Dublin, and Galway were also strong hurling counties during the twentieth century.

An extended qualifier system resulted in a longer All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Pay-for-play remains controversial and the Gaelic Players Association continues to grow in strength. The inauguration of the Christy Ring Cup and Nicky Rackard Cup gave new championships and an opportunity to play in Croke Park to the weaker county teams. Further dissemination of the championship structure was completed in 2009 with the addition of the Lory Meagher Cup to make it a four tier championship.

==International==
Although many hurling clubs exist worldwide, only Ireland has a national team (although it includes only players from weaker counties in order to ensure matches are competitive). It and the Scotland shinty team have played for many years with modified match rules (as with International Rules Football). The match is the only such international competition. However, competition at club level has been going on around the world since the late nineteenth century thanks to emigration from Ireland, and the strength of the game has ebbed and flowed along with emigration trends. Nowadays, growth in hurling is noted in Continental Europe, Australia, and North America.

===Argentina===

Irish immigrants began arriving in Argentina in the 19th century. The earliest reference to hurling in Argentina dates from the late 1880s in Mercedes, Buenos Aires. However, the game was not actively promoted until 1900, when it came to the attention of author and newspaperman William Bulfin. Under Bulfin&#x27;s patronage, the Hurling Club was formed on 15 July 1900, leading to teams being established in different neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and the surrounding farming communities.

Games of hurling were played every weekend until 1914 and received frequent coverage from Argentina&#x27;s Spanish language newspapers, such as &quot;La Nación&quot;. After the outbreak of World War I, it became almost impossible to obtain hurleys from Ireland. An attempt was made to use native Argentine mountain ash, but it proved too heavy and lacking in pliability. Although the game was revived after the end of the war, the golden age of Argentine hurling had passed. World War II finally brought the era to its close.

In the aftermath of the Second World War, immigration from Ireland slowed to a trickle. In addition, native born Irish-Argentines assimilated into the local community. The last time that hurling was played in Argentina was in 1980, when the Aer Lingus Hurling Club conducted a three-week tour of the country and played matches at several locations. Since 2009, with the realization of several Summers Camps and the visit of the All Stars in December, hurling returned to be a frequent activity at the Hurling Club, where many boys and young men have since been trained and taught to play. The Hurling Club have even been invited to take part in the Hurling Festival within The Gathering events organised by Aer Lingus. This team was present in September 2013 in the city of Galway. The team consists of 21 players from Hockey and Rugby teams. Many have contributed to the return of hurling as an activity in the club. As an example we can name Alejandro Yoyo Wade, Johnny Wade, Barbie, Cecilia and Irene Scally, David Ganly, Dickie Mac Allister, Eduardo Cabrera Punter, Hernan Magrini Scally. Several Irish have participated in many opportunities to work with the skills and education: Jonathan Lynch, Kevin O&#x27;Connors and Michael Connery, who currently works with the team&#x27;s training to participate in the Aer Lingus International Hurling Festival.

===Australia===

The earliest reference to hurling in Australia is related in the book &quot;Sketches of Garryowen&quot;. On 12 July 1844, a match took place at Batman&#x27;s Hill in Melbourne as a counterpoint to a march by the Orange Order. Reportedly, the hurling match attracted a crowd of five hundred Irish immigrants, while the Orange march shivered out of existence.

Several hurling clubs existed in Victoria in the 1870s including Melbourne, Collingwood, Upper Yarra, Richmond and Geelong.

In 1885, a game between two Sydney-based teams took place before a crowd of over ten thousand spectators. Reportedly, the contest was greatly enjoyed despite the fact that one newspaper dubbed the game &quot;Two Degrees Safer Than War&quot;.

Arden Street Oval in North Melbourne was used by Irish immigrants during the 1920s.
The game in Australasia is administered by Australasia GAA.

===Great Britain===

Hurling was brought to Great Britain in the 19th century. The game is administered by British GAA. Warwickshire and Lancashire compete at inter-county level in the Lory Meagher Cup, competing against other counties in Ireland. London is the only non-Irish team to have won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (having captured the title in 1901), and after winning the 2012 Christy Ring Cup gained the right to contest the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2013.

The first ever hurling game played in the Scottish Highlands was played at Easter 2012 between CLG Micheal Breathnach and Fir Uladh, an Ulster select of Gaeiligoiri, as part of the Iomain Cholmcille festival, na Breathnaich coming out victorious.

Wales has its own club, St. Colmcilles in Cardiff.

===South Africa===
Soldiers who served in the Irish Brigade during the Anglo-Boer War are believed to have played the game on the veldt. Immigrants from County Wicklow who had arrived to work in the explosives factory in Umbogintwini, KwaZulu-Natal formed a team c. 1915–16. A major burst of immigration in the 1920s led to the foundation of the &quot;Transvaal Hurling Association&quot; in Johannesburg in 1928. Games were traditionally played in a pitch on the site of the modern-day Johannesburg Central Railway Station every Easter Sunday after Mass.

In 1932, a South African hurling team sailed to Ireland to compete in the Tailteann Games, where they carried a banner donated by a convent of Irish nuns in Cape Town. On their arrival, they were personally received by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) at the time, Éamon de Valera.

South African hurling continued to prosper until the outbreak of the Second World War, which caused immigration from Ireland to cease and made it impossible to import equipment. Games of hurling and Gaelic football were occasionally sponsored by the Christian Brothers schools in Boksburg and Pretoria well into the 1950s. Both games have all but ceased to be played.

===North America===
References to hurling on the North American continent date from the 1780s in modern-day Canada concerning immigrants from County Waterford and County Kilkenny, and also, in New York City. After the end of the American Revolution, references to hurling cease in American newspapers until the aftermath of the Great Famine when Irish people moved to America in huge numbers, bringing the game with them. Newspaper reports from the 1850s refer to occasional matches played in San Francisco, Hoboken and New York City. The first game of hurling played under GAA rules outside Ireland was played on Boston Common in June 1886.

In 1888, there was an American tour by fifty Gaelic athletes from Ireland, known as the &#x27;American Invasion&#x27;. This created enough interest among Irish Americans to lay the groundwork for the North American GAA. By the end of 1889, almost a dozen GAA clubs existed in America, many of them in and around New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Later, clubs were formed in Boston, Cleveland, and many other centers of Irish America. Concord, New Hampshire has its state&#x27;s only hurling team, New Hampshire Wolves, sponsored by Litherman&#x27;s Limited Craft Brewery.

In 1910, twenty-two hurlers, composed of an equal number from Chicago and New York, conducted a tour of Ireland, where they played against the County teams from Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick, Dublin and Wexford.Traditionally, hurling was a game played by Irish immigrants and discarded by their children. Many American hurling teams took to raising money to import players directly from Ireland. In recent years, this has changed considerably with the advent of the Internet and increased travel. The Barley House Wolves hurling team from New Hampshire was formed when U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq saw a hurling game on the television in Shannon Airport as their plane refuelled. Outside of the traditional North American GAA cities of New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, clubs are springing up in other places where they consist of predominantly American-born players who bring a new dimension to the game and actively seek to promote it as a mainstream sport, especially Joe Maher, a leading expert at the sport in Boston. The Milwaukee Hurling Club, with 300 members, is the largest Hurling club in the world outside Ireland, and is made of mostly Americans and very few Irish immigrants. The St. Louis Gaelic Athletic Club was established in 2002 and has expanded its organization to an eight team hurling league in the spring and six team Gaelic football league in the fall. They also have a 30-member camogie league. Saint Louis has won two National Championships in Jr C Hurling (2004 and 2011), as well as two National Championships in Jr D Gaelic Football (2005, and 2013). The Indianapolis Hurling Club began in 2002, then reformed in 2005. In 2008, the Indy Hurling Club won the Junior C National Championship. In 2011, Indy had 7 club teams and sent a Junior B, Junior C and Camogie team to nationals. Hurling continues to grow in popularity with teams now in Knoxville, TN, Charleston, SC, Orlando, FL, Tampa, FL, Augusta, GA, Greenville, SC, Indianapolis, IN, Worcester, MA, Corvallis, OR, Akron, OH, Raleigh, NC, Concord, NH, Portland, Maine, Providence, RI, Twin Cities, MN, Madison, WI, Milwaukee, WI, Washington, DC, Hampton Roads, VA, Rochester NY, Nashville, TN, Richmond, VA, Hartford, CT, Missoula, MT, Butte, MT and Seattle, WA.

The GAA have also begun to invest in American college students with university teams springing up at University of Connecticut, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Purdue University, Indiana University, University of Montana and other schools. On 31 January 2009, the first ever US collegiate hurling match was held between UC Berkeley and Stanford University, organized by the newly formed California Collegiate Gaelic Athletic Association. UC Berkeley won the challenge match by one point, while Stanford won the next two CCGAA matches to win the first collegiate cup competition in the U.S. On Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, the first ever National Collegiate GAA championship was played. The Indiana University Hurling Club won all matches of the tournament, and won by four points in the championship final to be crowned the first ever U.S. National Collegiate Champions.

===Olympic Games===
Hurling was an demonstration sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States. A single match was played between two American clubs, Innisfails from St. Louis and Fenians from Chicago. Innisfails won 2-2 to 0-2.

<text>Mount Pleasant Cemetery is a cemetery located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and is part of the Mount Pleasant Group of Cemeteries. It was opened in November 1876 and is located north of Moore Park, a neighbourhood of Toronto. The cemetery has kilometres of drives and walking paths interspersed with fountains, statues and botanical gardens, as well as rare and distinct trees. It was originally laid out by German-born landscape architect Henry Adolph Engelhardt, inspired by the European and American garden cemeteries of the 19th century, and with influences from Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston.

As the final resting place of more than 168,000 persons, Mount Pleasant Cemetery contains remarkable architecture amongst its many monuments. The cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2000.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the only authorized cemeteries within the town of York (predecessor to present-day Toronto) were limited to members of either the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. Deceased citizens who did not belong to either of these Christian denominations had no choice but to find burial arrangements outside of the city. Notably, those of Jewish faith who wanted a Jewish burial had to resort to cemeteries beyond Ontario (Montreal and Buffalo) until Pape Avenue Cemetery was opened outside of Toronto in 1849.
In response to a petition to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, which included &quot;it has become desirable that a Plot be obtained for the purpose of a General Burying Ground, as well for Strangers as for the Inhabitants of the Town, of whatever sect or denomination they may be&quot;, a statute named &quot;An act to authorize certain persons therein named, and their successors, to hold certain lands for the purpose therein mentioned&quot; was passed and received Royal Assent in 1826: &quot;Acts of U.C. 7 Geo. IV, c. 21&quot;. The land that came to be known as the &quot;Potters Field&quot; was acquired and started operation as a cemetery soon afterwards. Over time, additional cemetery lands were added to what became the Toronto General Burying Ground.

In 1873, a new cemetery available to all citizens was established. The new cemetery was situated on an farm on Lot 19 Concession 3 (also referred to as Yonge Street Farm) that was once owned by the Cawthra family (and likely by William Cawthra) at the far outskirts of the city. Mount Pleasant Cemetery formally opened on 4 November 1876, with more than of carriage drives along rolling hills and ponds. Mount Pleasant Road was later constructed to pass through the centre of the cemetery and is named after it. The cemetery also has remains and a number of stone markers that were moved from the Potter&#x27;s Field. The urban expansion of Toronto eventually led to Mount Pleasant Cemetery being situated in the centre of the city.

A number of Canadian servicemen who died during the World Wars were interred at the cemetery. It contains 231 Commonwealth War Graves, comprising 126 burials in World War I and 105 in World War II. 188 are of the Canadian, and 43 the British, armed forces.

In the autumn of 2009, the cemetery opened Mount Pleasant Visitation Centre. The new building is approximately and is built on the property grounds. It was built with the intention to provide visitation space and chapel services.

The cemetery began planning the building as early as 2004, but disputes with the City of Toronto government, local funeral homes, and the Ontario Municipal Board all delayed the project. Changes were made as a result of this process, most notably vehicle access is now through the cemetery grounds only (near the cemetery offices), not directly from Moore Avenue.

== Controversy ==
Despite the cemetery having been created as a public trust by Special Act of the Ontario legislature in 1826 (Toronto General Burying Grounds Act), Mount Pleasant Group began to assert publicly that it had been converted in 1871 into a corporation subject to the Corporations Act of Ontario and that it was no longer a trust. Community activist Margot Boyd and others argued that its status as a public trust remained unchanged.

With donations from the community, Boyd engaged the McCarthy Tetrault law firm in 2009 to review the statutes pertaining to Mount Pleasant Group. An 18-page letter sent to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated: “Legally, this trust might be characterized in several ways, but an accurate description of the trust in question is a ‘public trust.’ ” Local politicians Toronto Centre MPP Glen Murray and Ward 12 Toronto City Councillor Josh Matlow both agreed at the time.

As early as 2006, Mount Pleasant Group began describing itself as a commercial privately owned entity, and refused to disclose its financial records, giving rise to allegations that it was engaged in the stealth privatization of a public asset. In 2012, Mount Pleasant Group commenced a public relations campaign against Boyd and others in an attempt to deflect criticism, and to discredit its detractors by labelling them NIMBYs.
In December 2012, Boyd and lawyer and community activist Pamela Taylor organized a public trustee election in accordance with the requirements of the 1849 Special Act.

In 2013, over the objections of local residents, Mount Pleasant Group installed a new crematorium. The siting of the facility was a mere 16.5 metres from neighbouring houses, and contrary to Toronto City By-laws. Ward 13 City Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam sought leave to appeal against the Ontario Ministry of the Environment decision to allow the crematorium.

Also in 2013, Boyd and Taylor, together with historian and environmental consultant Lorraine Tinsley, founded the not-for-profit association Friends of Toronto Public Cemeteries and brought an Application to the Superior Court of Ontario to interpret the cemetery statutes.

<text>Shinty () is a team sport played with sticks and a ball. Shinty is now played mainly in the Scottish Highlands and among Highland migrants to the major cities of Scotland, but it was formerly more widespread in Scotland, and was even played in Northern England into the second half of the 20th century and other areas in the world where Scottish Highlanders migrated.

While comparisons are often made with field hockey, the two games have several important differences. In shinty a player is allowed to play the ball in the air and is allowed to use both sides of the stick, called a , which is wooden and slanted on both sides. The stick may also be used to block and to tackle, although a player may not come down on an opponent&#x27;s stick, a practice called hacking. Players may also tackle using the body as long as it is shoulder-to-shoulder.

The game was derived from the same root as the Irish game of hurling/camogie and the Welsh game of bando, but has developed unique rules and features. These rules are governed by the Camanachd Association. A composite rules shinty–hurling game has been developed, which allows Scotland and Ireland to play annual international matches.

Another sport with common ancestry is bandy, which is played on ice. In Scottish Gaelic the name for bandy is &quot;ice shinty&quot; () and in the past &quot;bandy&quot; and &quot;shinty&quot; (and &quot;shinney&quot;) could be used interchangeably in the English language.

==Origins==
Hurling, an Irish pastime for at least 2,000 years similar to shinty, is derived from the historic game common to both peoples. Shinty/hurling appears prominently in the legend of Cúchulainn, the Celtic mythology hero. A similar game is played on the Isle of Man known as cammag, a name cognate with camanachd. The old form of hurling played in the northern half of Ireland, called &quot;commons&quot;, resembled shinty more closely than the standardised form of hurling of today. Like shinty, it was commonly known as and was traditionally played in winter. It is still played regularly on St Stephen&#x27;s Day in St John&#x27;s.

The origins of the name &quot;shinty&quot; are uncertain. There is a theory that the name was derived from the cries used in the game; &quot;shin ye&quot;, &quot;shin you&quot; and &quot;shin t&#x27;ye&quot;, other dialect names were &quot;shinnins&quot;, &quot;shinnack&quot;, &quot;shinnup&quot;, &quot;chinnup&quot;, or as Hugh Dan MacLennan proposes from the Scottish Gaelic . However, there was never one all-encompassing name for the game, as it held different names from glen to glen, including (&#x27;play-ball&#x27; in English) and in the Scottish Lowlands, where it was formerly referred to as &quot;hailes&quot;, &quot;common&quot;/&quot;cammon&quot; (&quot;caman&quot;), &quot;cammock&quot; (from Scottish Gaelic ), &quot;knotty&quot;, carrick and various other names, as well as the terms still used to refer to it in modern Gaelic, or . Shinty was once a popular game in lowland Scotland, as shown by its name &quot;shintie&quot;, a term which took that form around 1700, displacing the earlier &quot;shinnie&quot; – of which there is a written record about 100 years earlier. &quot;Shinnie&quot; may also derive from &quot;shin&quot; in English, with the affix &quot;-ie&quot;, a common termination to the name of many games in Scotland.

==Game==

===Playing area===
The objective of the game is to play a small ball into a goal, or &quot;hail&quot;, erected at the ends of a by pitch. The game is traditionally played on grass, although as of 2009 the sport may be played on artificial turf. The pitch also has marks indicating a area around the goals, the penalty and centre spots (along with their associated arcs/circles of radius), and corner arcs at the corners of the rectangular pitch of radius. The goals, at opposite ends of the field, measure wide and high and a net is affixed to catch the ball when a goal is scored.
===Ball===
The ball is a hard solid sphere of around half the diameter of a tennis ball, consisting of a cork core covered by two pieces of leather stitched together. The seam is raised. It is very similar to a hurling sliotar in that it resembles an American baseball with more pronounced stitching. The permitted circumference is between and weight between . The ball is usually white, but there is no statutory colour, black being a common colour for Kyles Athletic, and fluorescent balls now being available.

Plastic balls or soft balls are often used in youth competitions such as the variant &quot;First Shinty&quot;.

===Stick===
The ball is played using a &quot;caman&quot;, which is a stick about long with two slanted faces. The stick has a wedge shaped head, roughly triangular in cross section, which must be able to pass through a ring in diameter. Unlike the Irish &quot;camán&quot;, it has no blade. The &quot;caman&quot; is traditionally made of wood, traditionally ash but now more commonly hickory, and must not have any plate or metal attached to it. The &quot;caman&quot; would be made from any piece of wood with a hook in it, hence &quot;caman&quot;, from the Scottish and Irish Gaelic word &quot;cam&quot;, meaning bent or crooked. It can also be called a stick or club. The slant of the face will vary according to the position that the stick is used for. It can be made according to the player&#x27;s height.

Plastic camans are common in the youth variant &quot;First Shinty&quot;.

==Rules of play==

A player can play the ball in the air and is allowed to use both sides of the stick. The stick may also be used to block and to tackle, although a player may not bring their stick down on an opponent&#x27;s stick, which is defined as hacking. A player may tackle an opponent using the body as long as it is shoulder-to-shoulder as in association football (soccer).

A player may only stop the ball with the stick, the chest, two feet together or one foot on the ground. Only the goalkeeper may use his hands, but only with an open palm since he is not allowed to catch it. Playing the ball with the head constitutes a foul whether intentional or not, as it is considered dangerous play. Other examples of dangerous play, which will be penalised, are a player, while grounded, playing the ball, or a player recklessly swinging the caman in the air in a way which might endanger another player.

Fouls are penalised by a free-hit, which is indirect unless the foul is committed in the penalty area, commonly referred to as &quot;The D&quot;. This results in a penalty hit from .

A ball played by a team over the opposing bye line results in a goal hit from the edge of the D, while a ball played by a team over their own line results in a corner. A ball hit over the sideline results in a shy: a shinty shy involves the taker tossing the ball above his head and hitting the ball with the shaft of the caman, and the ball must be directly overhead when struck.

===Scoring===
The winner of a game is the team that scores the most goals. A team scores a goal &quot;when the whole of the ball has passed over the goal-line and under the cross-bar&quot;. A goal can only be scored with the caman; there is no goal when the ball &quot;has been kicked, carried or propelled by hand or arm by a player of the attacking side.&quot; A goal cannot be scored directly from a free-hit.

===Team size===
Teams consist of 12 players (men) or 10 players (women), including a goalkeeper. A match is played over two halves of 45 minutes. With the exception of the goalkeeper, no player is allowed to play the ball with his hands. There are also variants with smaller sides, with some adjustments in the field size and duration of play.

===Substitutions===

As with sports such as football, shinty originally did not have substitutes. These were introduced in the 1960s, progressively expanding to allow a maximum of three substitutions per game. As of 2011, a rule change allowed for rolling substitutions to be made at the senior level.

==Organisation==

In common with many sports, it became formalised in the Victorian Era and the first organised clubs were established in cities such as Glasgow and London where there were thousands of Gaels resident.

In 1887, a historic game was played between Glenurquhart Shinty Club and Strathglass Shinty Club in Inverness. This game was attended by thousands of people and was a major milestone in developing a set of common rules. This fixture was to be repeated on 12 January 2007 in Inverness as the opening centrepiece of the Highland 2007 celebrations in Scotland, but was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.

The modern sport is governed by the Camanachd Association (). The association came into being in the late Victorian era as a means of formulating common rules to unite the various different codes and rules which differed between neighbouring glens. Its first meeting was held in Kingussie in 1893.

The Camanachd Association maintained its initial structure for much of its first century. The &#x27;Future of Shinty&#x27; Report published in 1981 led to a complete restructuring of the way in which shinty was organised and managed. That led to the move away from a dependence on volunteers to govern the sport, to the Association&#x27;s first salaried employees.

==Competitions==


There are shinty clubs in Aberdeen, Aberdour (Fife), Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Cornwall, Oxford and even London. University Shinty is a popular section of the sport, with almost all Scotland&#x27;s main universities possessing a team. Historically, Glasgow University, Aberdeen University and Edinburgh University have vied for supremacy, but in recent years, Strathclyde University, Robert Gordon University, Dundee University, and the University of St. Andrews have risen to prominence. Clubs compete in various competitions, both cup and league, on a national and also North/South basis. While the top Premier Division has been played on a Scotland-wide basis since 1996, the lower leagues are based on geography. Many clubs run second teams that also compete in these leagues against clubs with only one senior side.

===Season===

Shinty was traditionally played through the winter, based around the tradition of the &quot;Iomain Challainn&quot;, where New Year was marked by a game between neighbouring parishes. The summer was left free for seasonal work and friendly tournaments. The Winter season always ran over, however, and many teams would find themselves finishing the previous season only weeks before the next one would start.

In 2003, shinty clubs voted for a trial period of two years of a summer season from March to October, with a view to moving permanently to summer shinty if the experiment was judged to be a success. Despite opposition from the &quot;Big Two&quot;, Kingussie and Newtonmore, and other small groups in the game, an EGM in November 2005 voted by an overwhelming majority (well over the required two thirds) to make summer shinty the basis upon which the game would proceed.

There have been teething problems since the move to summer shinty, with a couple of teams being culpable for the season running over into November and December. Season 2010 saw the league season finished by the first weekend in October, almost on schedule.

Shinty does still get played during the winter, in University Shinty which has teams compete for the second most valuable trophy in Scottish sport – the Littlejohn Vase – and in New Year fixtures, the most prestigious of which is the Lovat Cup, played between Beauly and Lovat.

===Leagues===

&quot;For more information, see Shinty league system&quot;

League shinty was originally organised on a regional basis, with distinct competitions for the North District and at one time, two separate leagues for Argyll (the Dunn League) and the Southern League, for clubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh and the surrounding areas. Over time, there have been moves to amalgamate leagues and, since the 1980s, a push for national competition at the highest levels. In the modern era of league shinty, Kingussie have been unsurpassed in their domination of the sport; according to the Guinness Book of Records 2005, Kingussie is world sport&#x27;s most successful sporting team of all time, winning 20 consecutive league championships and going four years without losing a single fixture in the early 1990s. 

Kingussie&#x27;s unmatched run of dominance was ended on 2 September 2006 by rivals Newtonmore, who defeated Oban Camanachd 2–0 to ensure that Kingussie could not catch the team at the top of the Premier Division. However, Newtonmore were unable to replace their neighbours as champions, as the first post-Kingussie champions were confirmed as Fort William, who sealed the title on 30 September 2006, having won their games in hand over Newtonmore. Kingussie regained the title in 2007. Since 2010, Newtonmore have been the dominant league force.

===Cup===
Cup shinty has always been seen as being more important than league shinty, and the premier national competition remains the Scottish Cup or the Camanachd Association Challenge Cup, the Camanachd Cup for short. Until 1983 the competition was designed to ensure the final was between the North and South.

The Macaulay Cup still preserves a guaranteed North/South Final. There are national equivalents for the Camanachd Cup for intermediate and junior teams. There are regional cups for both senior and junior teams; the MacTavish Cup is the senior cup for the North and the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup is the one for the South.

===Shinty and hurling internationals===
In recognition of shinty&#x27;s shared roots with hurling, an annual international between the two codes from Scotland and Ireland is played on a home and away basis using composite rules. In recent years, the Irish have had the upper hand, but the Scots won the fixture narrowly in 2005 and again in 2006, this time at Croke Park, Dublin, albeit with the Irish fielding weaker players from the second tier Christy Ring Cup. Scotland made it four in a row when they won in 2008.

==Outside Scotland==
Canadian Gaelic-speaking pioneers in Nova Scotia adapted shinty, which was traditionally a winter sport, to the much colder Canadian climate by wearing ice skates while playing on frozen lakes. This led to the creation of the modern winter sport known as ice hockey.

The game of shinny in Canada is a synonym for street hockey, pond hockey or any informal game of hockey. It derives its name from shinty, although a myth there perpetuates that it came from children tying Eaton&#x27;s catalogues around their legs to protect their shins from flying pucks or slashing.

The English Shinty Association (ESA) is the main body for promoting and encouraging the sport of shinty in England.

London Camanachd is a shinty club first established in the Victorian era, competing in English and Scottish competitions such as the English League, the Bullough Cup and most recently in the Camanachd Cup in 1994. They went into abeyance in 1995, but were reconstituted in 2005. They played the first officially recognised shinty match outside Scotland in 80 years on 22 July 2006 against the Highlanders. They compete annually in the English Shinty Championships against Cornwall, Oxford, Devon and Bristol as well as playing shinty–hurling matches and organising sporadic friendlies against visiting teams.

On 28 December 2010 Ireland held its first dedicated shinty match in Westmeath, with players who have played the Compromise rules Shinty/Hurling.

A Cornwall Shinty Club was established in 2012, playing their first game on 21 April 2012 against London; the match finished a draw. They also entered the St Andrew&#x27;s Sixes tournament in 2012. Following this, in December 2012, two more Cornish clubs were created; the first being the Combined Universities of Cornwall and the second being Mabe. These two teams put forward their best players to play for the Cornwall Shinty Club.

There was a team in Northallerton in the 1970s, which competed in six-a-sides; and on 1 August 2012 a re-vamped Northallerton Shinty Club was formed. The club is hoping to draw in a few former players, but wants to focus on raising awareness of the game in Yorkshire and bringing new local players into the game.

Shinty was played widely in England in the 19th century and early 20th century, with teams such as London Scots, Bolton Caledonian and Cottonopolis; Nottingham Forest F.C. was established by shinty players.

Since 2012 London has hosted the annual &quot;London Shinty Festival&quot;, which has been attended by Cornwall, London, Oxford Shinty Club, St Andrews university ladies team, and the Scots. It is an open tournament held in late September after the Shinty season is finished to allow any travelling teams the opportunity to attend.

Since 2013, a combined English Shinty Association side has entered the Bullough cup, being beaten in 2013 by Tayforth and then in 2014 by Ballachulish.
Shinty is played in the British Army, with The Scots Shinty Club keeping alive the tradition of the game being played in the Forces.

Shinty is also being revived among the Scottish diaspora in North America, where it was originally played in the 18th and 19th century by Scottish immigrants, but died out. More recent teams such as Northern California Camanachd Club (NCCC), Central California Cammanchd (CCC), and Oregon Shinty-Camanachd (OSC) play at Highland games and other venues across the USA.

==Media coverage==
Local papers, such as the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot;, &quot;The Buteman&quot;, the &quot;Oban Times&quot; and the &quot;Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard&quot;, have in-depth shinty reports. The Inverness-based media reduce shinty coverage to one summary of the whole weekend&#x27;s action, as do national newspapers, such as the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Post&quot;. The only significant national press coverage is of the Camanachd Cup final. Regional newspaper &quot;The Press and Journal&quot; runs shinty coverage twice a week (Mondays and Fridays).

The first-ever shinty match broadcast live on television was the 1964 Celtic Society Cup Final. Although Camanachd Cup finals and internationals have been shown over the years, 2006 marked the first-ever regular TV deal for shinty with matches being shown on the BBC Sports show &quot;Spòrs&quot;. This was then followed by the STV show &quot;An Caman&quot;.

2009 saw the Camanachd Association sign a deal with BBC Alba to broadcast all national finals as well as the Marine Harvest Festival. The MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup final were also shown on BBC Two. There is also an increasing amount of shinty on the internet, with various clips garnering attention on video sites such as YouTube. 2011 was a sparse year for TV coverage outside of the usual games, but 2012 saw several games filmed live on BBC Alba.

The sport is featured on BBC Radio nan Gaidheal by the programme, Spòrs na Seachdain, although English-language radio interest is usually restricted to the big events in the year. Commentary on the Camanachd Cup Final is provided in both English and Gaelic.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
* In his 1783 poem &quot;Moladh Gheàrrloch&quot; (&#x27;In Praise of Gairloch&#x27;), Gaelic bard William Ross (1761–1791) describes a game of shinty, which was still a winter sport played in the Gàidhealtachd upon St. Andrew&#x27;s Day, Christmas Day, New Year&#x27;s Day, Handsel Monday, and Candlemas. The bard&#x27;s account of the annual New Year&#x27;s Day match at ebb tide upon the Big Sand () of Gairloch, is, according to Ronald Black, &quot;as succinct a description as we have of the great festive shinty matches of the past.&quot;
* The author Margaret Hope MacPherson wrote a children&#x27;s book called &quot;The Shinty Boys&quot;, which was published in 1963.

===Music===
* The shinty song &quot;Clash of the Ash&quot;, by the Celtic rock band Runrig, immediately became widely popular and is now considered an anthem for the sport.

===Television===
* In September 2009 comedian Billy Connolly suggested that shinty should become Scotland&#x27;s new national sport, because the Scotland men&#x27;s national football team had become so bad.
* The accordionist Gary Innes wrote &quot;The Caman Man&quot; on his latest album ERA and has played shinty for Scotland fourteen times, captaining the side in 2010/11.
* The TV series &quot;Hamish MacBeth&quot; featured a shinty match as an integral part of the plot of the episode &quot;More Than a Game&quot;, with real shinty players Dallas Young of Kingussie and Neil &quot;Ach&quot; MacRae of Kinlochshiel Shinty Club, playing pivotal roles.
* A shinty game is shown in episode 4, &quot;The Gathering&quot;, of the Starz TV show &quot;Outlander&quot;.

<text>Camogie ( ; ) is an Irish stick-and-ball team sport played by women. Camogie is played by 100,000 women in Ireland and worldwide, largely among Irish communities.

A variant of the game &quot;hurling&quot; (which is played by men only), it is organised by the Dublin-based Camogie Association (An Cumann Camógaíochta). The annual All Ireland Camogie Championship has a record attendance of 33,154, while average attendances in recent years are in the range of 15,000 to 18,000. The final is broadcast live, with a TV audience of as many as over 300,000.

UNESCO lists Camogie as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The game is referred to in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett.

==Game and Rules==
The game consists of two thirty-minute halves. There is a half-time interval of 15 minutes. In event of extra time, halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of one goalkeeper, three full back players, three half back players, two centre-field players, three half forward players and three full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times. The rules are almost identical to hurling, with a few exceptions.

*Goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players. This is because no special rules apply to the goalkeeper and so there is no need for officials to differentiate between goalkeeper and outfielders.
*A camogie player can hand pass a point over the bar from play (hand passing a goal is forbidden in camogie since 2021 and forbidden in hurling since 1980).
*Camogie games last 60 minutes, two 30-minute halves (senior inter-county hurling games last 70, which is two 35-minute halves). Ties are resolved by multiple 2×10-minute sudden death extra time periods; in these, the first team to score wins.
*A smaller sliotar (ball) is used in camogie – commonly known as a size 4 sliotar – whereas hurlers play with a size 5 sliotar.
*If a defending player hits the sliotar wide, a 45-metre puck is awarded to the opposition (in hurling, it is a 65-metre puck).
*After a score, the goalkeeper pucks out from the 13-metre line (in hurling, he must puck from the end line).
*The metal band on the camogie stick must be covered with tape (not necessary in hurling).
*Side-to-side charges are forbidden (permitted in hurling).
*Two points are awarded for a score direct from a sideline cut (since March 2012).
* Players must wear skirts or skorts rather than shorts.

Under the original 1903 rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields long and wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a &quot;points bar&quot; was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation, although it was more a &quot;squeezed lemon&quot; formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation.

===Field and equipment===
====Field====
The field is not of a fixed size, but must be long by wide.

====Sticks====
The length of the stick, called a &quot;hurley&quot;, varies depending on the player&#x27;s height.

===Goals and scoring===
H-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a &quot;point&quot;, the team earns one point. If the ball goes under the bar for a &quot;goal&quot;, the team earns three points.

==History==
===Foundation===
The name was invented by Tadhg Ua Donnchadha (Tórna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904. The term camogie is derived from the name of the stick used in the game. Men play hurling using a curved stick called a &quot;camán&quot; in Irish. Women in the early camogie games used a shorter stick described by the diminutive form &quot;camóg&quot;. The suffix -&quot;aíocht&quot; (originally &quot;uidheacht&quot;) was added to both words to give names for the sports: &quot;camánaíocht&quot; (which became &quot;iománaíocht&quot;) and &quot;camógaíocht&quot;. When the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1884 the English-origin name &quot;hurling&quot; was given to the men&#x27;s game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name &quot;camógaíocht&quot; to &quot;camogie&quot;.

The experimental rules were drawn up for the female game by Máire Ní Chinnéide, Seán (Sceilg) Ó Ceallaigh, Tadhg Ó Donnchadha and Séamus Ó Braonáin. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Chéitinnigh (Keatings branch of the Gaelic League) and Cúchulainns on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport&#x27;s governing body, the Camogie Association or An Cumann Camógaíochta, was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Camógaíochta na nGael.

Máire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of Ní Dhonnchadha&#x27;s scholarly brother Tadhg Ó Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de siècle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing. Nonetheless, the creation of camogie was not universally supported - even by women - with leading figures such as president of the Irish Countrywomen&#x27;s Association and Conradh na Gaeilge member, Kit Ahern (despite her support of GAA clubs for men) describing camogie as &quot;too strenuous for girls&quot;.

==Leagues==
===Ireland===
An Cumann Camógaíochta has a similar structure to the Gaelic Athletic Association, with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council—the Ard Chomhairle—which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in Croke Park in Dublin. Each of 28 county boards takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except Fermanagh, Leitrim and Sligo), with the number of clubs ranging from 58 in Cork to one in Leitrim. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in Asia, Australia, Britain, Europe, New York, New Zealand and North America.

==Competitions in Ireland==

===All-Ireland Championship===

The county is the unit of structure in elite competition, responsible for organising club competitions within the county unit and for fielding inter-county teams in the various grades of the All-Ireland championships and National Camogie League. The All Ireland Club Championship is staged at Senior, Intermediate and Junior level, usually reaching the final stages in November–December or the following March. London competed in the National Camogie League in the 2010 season, but not in 2011.

Counties compete for the elite All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship in which the O&#x27;Duffy Cup is awarded. The All-Ireland Final is held every year in Croke Park during September, usually on the week between the hurling final and Gaelic football final, and attracts attendances of up to 33,000.

There are age-graded All Ireland championships at Minor A, Minor B, and Minor C, and Under-16 A, B and C level.

Six teams contest the fourth-tier Nancy Murray Cup (or Junior A championship), Carlow, Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, Westmeath, and the second team of Offaly.

Three teams contest the fifth-tier Máire Ní Chinnéide Cup, (or Junior B championship), Wicklow, and the second teams of Kildare and Meath.

Although six counties do not compete at adult level: Donegal, Fermanagh, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo and Sligo do not compete at adult level, clubs from Fermanagh, Kerry and Mayo have won honours and Donegal have contested divisional finals at under-14 Feile na nGael level. Both Louth (in 1934 and 1936) and Mayo (in 1959) have contested the All Ireland senior final in the past.

===National League===
The National League is staged during the winter-spring months, with four divisions of team graded by ability.

===Provincial championships===
Provincial championships take place at all levels, independent of the All Ireland series which has been run on an open draw basis since 1973.

===International and inter-provincial===
Ireland plays a camogie-shinty international against Scotland each year. The Gael Linn Cup is an inter-provincial competition played at senior and junior level. The sport is closely associated with the Celtic Congress. Two former Camogie Association presidents Máire Ní Chinnéide and Agnes O&#x27;Farrelly were also presidents of Celtic Congress and exhibition matches have been held at the Celtic Congress since 1938. The first such exhibition match, on the Isle of Man in 1938, marked the first appearance of Kathleen Cody, who became one of the stars of the 1940s.

===Inter-collegiate===
The Ashbourne and Purcell Cups and Father Meachair seven-a-side are the principal inter-collegiate competitions.

===Schools===
There is also a programme of provincial and All Ireland championships at secondary schools senior and junior levels, differentiated by the years of secondary school cycle, with years 4–6 competing in the senior competition, and years 1–3 competing at junior level. Cumann na mBunscoil organises competitions at primary school level.

===Féile na nGael===
Camogie competitions for club teams featuring under-14 players are played in four divisions as part of the annual Féile na nGael festival. The county that is selected for a particular year, all their clubs host teams from all around the country representing their county. Host clubs get families to take in two or three children for a couple of days.

==International presence==

Though camogie is played predominantly in its native homeland of Ireland, it has spread to other countries, largely among the Irish diaspora due to immigrants and the immigrant population. The sport is known to have arrived in places in such as Great Britain, North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina.
Southeast Asia has teams in Vietnam, Thailand, and Kuala Lumpur.
In North America camogie is played in the United States, Canada, and in parts of the Caribbean. Camogie has also been included as a part of the GAA World Games.

==North American presence==
Camogie teams in North America have existed for at least a century.

===United States===

The national organizing body for Gaelic Games in the United States, with the exception of New York City, is the USGAA where camogie can be found. It is the governing body which promotes camogie in the United States along with other Gaelic sports. The USGAA also maintains a close relationship with other GAA groups in North America including Canada (Gaelic Games Canada), the New York GAA, and the Caribbean.

==Results==
===2018 All Ireland Championship===
Eleven counties competed for the elite All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship in 2018: Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford, and Wexford.

Eleven teams contested the second-tier Jack McGrath Cup in 2018 (All Ireland intermediate championship): Antrim, Carlow, Derry, Down, Kildare, Laois, and Westmeath, and the second teams of Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, and Tipperary.

Seven teams contested the third-tier Kay Mills Cup (All Ireland junior or &#x27;Premier Junior&quot; championship) in 2018: Armagh, Kerry, Roscommon, and the second teams of Clare, Dublin, Limerick, and Offaly.

Only fourteen points were scored by the winning team in the 2018 senior final, and most points in the game followed the awarding of frees. Ten points was sufficient to determine the winner of the 2017 senior final.

==Awards==
Camogie All Stars Awards are awarded annually to the elite players who have performed best in each of the 15 positions on a traditional camogie team. Player of the year and other achievement awards have also been awarded to leading players for several decades.

==Criticism==

Partly due to biological and physiological differences between men and women, some argue that Camogie lacks the physical drama found in the male equivalent sport, hurling.

There are lower score tallies in the senior camogie championship finals than in comparison to men&#x27;s hurling championships.

<doc id="73110" wikidata="Q117656" url="?curid=73110" title="Antipope Benedict X">
<text>Benedict X (died 1073/1080), born Giovanni, was elected to succeed Pope Stephen IX on 5 April 1058, but was opposed by a rival faction that elected Nicholas II. He fled Rome on 24 January 1059 and is today generally regarded as an antipope.

He was a son of Guido, Lord of Poli who was the youngest son of Alberic III, Count of Tusculum, a member of the dominant political dynasty in the region at that time. Giovanni was a nephew of the notorious Pope Benedict IX, who was deposed in 1048. Benedict X reportedly later was given the nickname of &quot;Mincius&quot; (thin) due to his ignorance. His mother was present at his trial in April 1060.

==Biography==
Giovanni, Bishop of Velletri, was created a cardinal by Pope Leo IX in 1050. He was highly esteemed, however, by those who wanted to reform the Church, and was one of five men proposed by Cardinal Frederick of Lorraine when consulted during the summer of 1057 concerning a possible successor to Pope Victor II, whom Frederick himself succeeded as Pope Stephen IX. Pope Victor had died at Arezzo on 28 July 1057, where he had just held a synod, but his successor was elected in Rome, in the Basilica of S. Pietro in vincoli, on 2 August 1057 and consecrated the next day.

In less than a year, Stephen IX (Frederick of Lorraine) created thirteen new cardinals. Peter Damian was a native of Ravenna and had been educated in northern Italy. Ubderto Poggi was from Poggio (now Poggio Lucenzio), in the duchy of Lucca. Bruno, cardinal priest of S. Sabina, was from Germany. Ugobaldo degli Obizi came from Lucca. The Benedictine Alberic came from the neighborhood of Benevento. Of the more senior cardinals, Boniface of Albano was from Apulia, Hugo of Silva Candida was a Burgundian, and Stephen of S. Crisogono was a monk of Cluny.

In 1058, Pope Stephen was relieved, by force on the part of the Romans, of the treasure which he had brought to Rome from Constantinople, in the wake of his participation in the embassy which excommunicated the Patriarch Michael Cerularius and began the Great Schism. He transferred the remaining treasure to Montecassino, and then hastened into Tuscany, in order to consult with his elder brother Godfrey, whom he had enfeoffed as Duke of Spoleto in January 1058. It was even suggested that Stephen intended to make his brother emperor. He suddenly grew weak, and died in Florence on 29 March 1058. It is said that he was given poison on the journey by an agent of the Romans. The Romans also asserted that Godfrey had dispatched 500 troops and money to regain control of Rome, which motivated the Romans to act.

Pope Stephen, before he left Rome, issued a decree, in the presence of the bishops, clergy, and people of Rome, that no election was to be held until the return of Cardinal Hildebrand from a mission to Germany, under penalty of anathematization. Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII) had been sent to the court of Empress Agnes, who had questioned the validity of Stephen&#x27;s own election. A somewhat different version of the story has it that Pope Stephen summoned the bishops, cardinals, and deacons, and informed them that he knew that some of them were planning to fill the papal seat with the help of lay persons, not in accordance with the decrees of the holy fathers. The assembled clergy then swore that they would never consent to someone becoming pope except in accordance with canon law.

===Enthroned as pope===

News of Pope Stephen&#x27;s death was brought to Rome by two cardinal-bishops, Humbert of Silva Candida and Peter of Tusculum. A section of the Roman aristocracy, along with numerous members of the clergy who were opposed to the reforms being pushed by the German popes and Cardinal Hildebrand, engineered a coup. The leaders were Rome&#x27;s traditional leaders for more than a century, Gregory, the son of Alberic of Tusculum and brother of Pope Benedict IX; Count Gerard of Galeria, the son of Rainerius; and members of the Monticelli branch of the Crescentius family from Tivoli. On the night of 4—5 April, they forced their way into Rome with large forces, and seized control, establishing a &quot;tyranny&quot;, in the words of their enemies. Cardinal Giovanni, Bishop of Tusculum, was enthroned, unwillingly, as pope, on 5 April 1058. His election, it is stated, was arranged by his own family. Since he was already a bishop, he did not need to be consecrated, only enthroned. Cardinal Peter Damiani and his supporters in the reform party, objected loudly to the proceedings and began to cast anathemas. At length, he and his followers fled in terror. Cardinal Humbert and Cardinal Peter of Tusculum, who witnessed the disorders of April 5, fled to Benevento a few days later. As a result, a number of cardinals alleged that the election was irregular. These cardinals were soon moved to flee Rome.
When Hildebrand heard of Benedict&#x27;s election during his return journey from the German court, he decided to oppose it. He went to Florence where he obtained the support of Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine, Duke of Spoleto, and Marquis of Tuscany for the election of Gerhard of Burgundy, Archbishop of Florence, as pope instead. Godfrey was the elder brother of the recently deceased Pope Stephen IX. Support for this was given by Empress Agnes. Those cardinals who had opposed Benedict&#x27;s election met at Siena in December 1058, and elected Gerhard, who then took the name of Nicholas II.

===Deposition===
Nicholas then proceeded towards Rome, along the way holding a synod at Sutri, where he pronounced Benedict deposed and excommunicated. The supporters of Nicholas then gained control of Rome, and forced Benedict to flee to the castle of Count Gerard of Galeria. Having arrived in Rome, Nicholas was crowned as pope on 24 January 1059. He then proceeded to wage war against Benedict and his supporters, with the assistance of Norman forces based in southern Italy, after he agreed to recognize Count Richard of Aversa as ruler of Capua. An initial battle was fought in Campagna in early 1059, which was not wholly successful for Nicholas; but later that same year, his forces conquered Praeneste, Tusculum and Nomento, and then attacked Galéria, forcing Benedict to surrender and to renounce the papacy in the Fall of that year.

After he returned to Rome, Archdeacon Hildebrand interrogated the cardinals about their behavior in regard to the oath they had taken, not to elect a pope until he had returned from his embassy to the German court. Some did not defend themselves, saying that it was not done well, and that those who enthroned Benedict did not do so with their consent. Others defended themselves, saying, &quot;Since he was good, wise, humble, chaste, kindly, and whatever else is found in a good person was found in him, what we did we believe that we did well.&quot; The disagreement between them and Hildebrand continued. One of those cardinals, Peter Damiani, testified independently to Benedict&#x27;s character, stating that he was &quot;bene litteratus&quot;, with a lively personality, chaste and with no suspicion, and generous in giving charity.

Benedict was allowed to go free, departing from the Lateran Palace a few days before the consecration of Nicholas II (24 January 1059). He retired to one the castle of Passerani (a suburb of Rieti), which was held by Regetellus, the son of the Prefect Crescentius, and from there to Galeria (not far from Bracciano), which was held by Count Gerard, the son of Rainerius. In March 1060 he returned to Rome and took up residence in his own house near S. Maria Maggiore, where he remained for thirty days. Then the Archdeacon Hildebrand arrested him by force, and brought him along with himself to the Lateran, where the council was in session. Pope Nicholas deemed his submission inadequate and had him publicly tried in April 1060, with Hildebrand serving as his prosecutor. Hildebrand put a document into Benedict&#x27;s hands, and demanded that he read it aloud and sign it. Benedict refused, unwilling to accuse himself and saying it had nothing to do with himself. With tears and lamentations, he was forced to read it. Despite Benedict&#x27;s pleading that he had been forced to assume the papal crown, he was convicted, deposed, and stripped of all his titles and his ordination as priest and bishop. He was further sentenced to confinement in the guest house (&#x27;hospitium&#x27;) attached to the Basilica of .

Suppus, the Archpriest of S. Anastasia, who was the spiritual advisor of Pope Nicholas II, requested that he show Benedict indulgence, and thereupon Benedict was restored to the post of Lector.

He died, still in confinement, sometime during the reign of Gregory VII, between 1073 and 1080. The Archpriest Seppus went to Pope Gregory to inform him of the death and the ceremonies with which they had buried him. Gregory burst out, saying they should have buried him with pontifical honors, and on the pope&#x27;s orders, he was interred with those honors in the Basilica of Saint Agnes.

===Aftermath===

The most important consequence of these events was the adoption of new regulations for papal elections, laid out at a synod presided over by Pope Nicholas in the Lateran Palace at Easter 1059. It was attended by 113 bishops and other clergy. It limited the vote in a papal election to the cardinal Bishops, and the right of approval to the College of Cardinals. The imperial sanction, whether obtained before an election or after one, was eliminated. This was a major step in depriving the lower clergy, the nobility, and Roman citizenry from their role in the election of future popes. Additionally, the diocese which Benedict had held as Bishop of Velletri was given in administration to the Bishop of Ostia in the bull of Pope Alexander II &quot;Si Extraneis&quot;, dated 11 June 1065. Ca. 1150, Pope Eugenius III permanently combined the two dioceses into one.

Benedict X was considered a legitimate pope, not an anti-pope, down until the time of Pope Honorius III in the thirteenth century. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; assigns him a reign of eight months and twenty days, which would be 5 April to 24 December 1058. Nicholas II was consecrated on 24 January 1059.

==== Greece ====
* Chremonides, an Athenian statesman and general, issues the Decree of Chremonides, creating an alliance between Sparta, Athens, and Ptolemy II of Egypt. The origins of this alliance lay in the continuing desire of many Greek states, notably Athens and Sparta, for a restoration of their former independence, along with the desire of Ptolemy II to create troubles for his rival Antigonus II, King of Macedonia. Ptolemy II&#x27;s ambitions in the Aegean Sea are threatened by Antigonus Gonatas&#x27; fleet, so he carefully builds up a coalition of the rest of the Greeks against Macedonians. He especially cultivates Athens by supplying the city with grain.

<text>Year 278 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Luscinus and Papus (or, less frequently, year 476 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 278 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* After their defeats in Greece, the Gauls move into Asia Minor. The Seleucid king Antiochus wins a major battle over the Gauls leading to his being given the title of Soter (Greek for &quot;saviour&quot;). The Gauls settle down to become the &quot;Galatians&quot; and are paid 2,000 talents annually by the Seleucid kings to keep the peace.
* Antigonus concludes a peace with Antiochus who surrenders his claim to Macedonia. Thereafter Antigonus II&#x27;s foreign policy is marked by friendship with the Seleucids.
* Nicomedes I becomes the first ruler of Bithynia to assume the title of king. He founds the city of Nicomedia, which soon rises to great prosperity.

==== Sicily ====
* The Carthaginians seize an opportunity to interfere in a quarrel between Syracuse and Agrigentum and besiege Syracuse. The Syracusans ask for help from Pyrrhus and Pyrrhus transfers his army there.
* On his arrival in Sicily, Pyrrhus&#x27; forces win battles against the Carthaginians across Sicily. Pyrrhus conquers almost all of Sicily except for Lilybaeum (Marsala).
* Pyrrhus is proclaimed king of Sicily. He plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to inherit Italy.

==== China ====
* The heartland of the State of Chu in the modern Hubei province is overrun by the powerful state of Qin from the west under Bai Qi&#x27;s leadership. Sailing down the Han river from Bashu, Bai Qi captures Ying - the capital of Chu - as well as Yiling, and his army reaches as far as Jingling. Bai Qi is honoured as Lord Wu&#x27;an (武安君; literally: Lord of Martial Peace). The Chu government moves to the east, occupying various temporary capitals until settling in Shouchun in 241 BC.
* Qu Yuan writes the poem &quot;Lament for Ying&quot; after the fall of the capital of Chu.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Polyaenus of Lampsacus, Greek mathematician and philosopher and friend of Epicurus (b. c. 340 BC)
* Qu Yuan, Chinese poet from southern Chu who lived during the Warring States period. His works are mostly found in an anthology of poetry known as Chu Ci (b. c. 340 BC)

<text>Year 279 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Publius Sulpicius Saverrio and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] (or, less frequently, year 475 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 279 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for many years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* An army of Gauls under Brennus invade Greece. A section of the army, commanded by Bolgios, crushes a Macedonian army led by Ptolemy Keraunos, who is killed in the battle. At the narrow pass of Thermopylae, on the east coast of Central Greece, Brennus&#x27; forces suffer heavy losses while trying to break through the Greek defence comprising the Phocians and the Aetolians. Eventually Brennus finds a way around the pass but the Greeks escape by sea. Brennus pushes on to Delphi where he is defeated and forced to retreat, after which he dies of wounds sustained in the battle. His army falls back to the river Spercheios where it is routed by Thessalians and Malians. Some of the survivors settle in a part of Asia Minor that will eventually be called Galatia, while some settle in Thrace, founding a short-lived city-state named Tylis.
* With the death of Ptolemy Keraunos, the previous King of Macedonia, Antipater II becomes king again. However, his new reign lasts only a few months before he is killed by his cousin Sosthenes who becomes the new King of Macedonia.
* The Phocians are readmitted into the Amphictyonic League after they have joined in the defence of Delphi against the Gauls.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Carthaginians and the Romans agree to support each other against a common foe. The Carthaginians give Rome money and ships in their fight against Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus.
* Pyrrhus realizes that he cannot capture Rome and suggests peace terms to the Romans. Pyrrhus sends his chief advisor, Cineas, to Rome to negotiate a peace. Cineas demands that the Romans halt their aggression against the Greeks of southern Italy and restore the lands the Romans have taken from the Bruttii, the Apulians, and the Samnites. The Romans reject his demands, largely at the instigation of the former Roman censor, Appius Claudius Caecus.
* In renewed fighting, Pyrrhus of Epirus, leading the combined Tarantine, Oscan, Samnite, and Greek forces, wins a &#x27;Pyrrhic victory&#x27; against the Romans led by consul Publius Decius Mus at the Battle of Asculum, called such because his victory comes at a great cost to his own forces. Pyrrhus is reported to have said afterwards, &quot;One more victory against the Romans and we shall be utterly ruined!&quot; Disheartened, Pyrrhus retires to Tarentum and sends Cineas to make renewed peace overtures to Rome. These talks are inconclusive.

==== Egypt ====
* The aggression of Ptolemy II of Egypt continues to cause friction with Antiochus as he takes Miletus in south-western Asia Minor from him.

==== The Balkans ====
* Scordisci Celts found a city called Singidon (Roman Singidunum) which is today the Serbian city of Belgrade.

====China====
* General Bai Qi of the State of Qin attacks the State of Chu and captures the cities of Yan and Deng.
* General Lian Po of the State of Zhou defeats an army of the State of Qi.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Chrysippus, Greek Stoic philosopher (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Brennus, leader of the army of Gauls who in 279 BC invaded Macedonia and northern Greece
* Ptolemy Keraunos, king of Macedonia from 281 to 279 BC

<doc id="73121" wikidata="Q735023" url="?curid=73121" title="Blackmore's Night">
<text>Blackmore&#x27;s Night is a British-American neo-medieval folk rock band formed in 1997, consisting mainly of Ritchie Blackmore (acoustic guitar, hurdy gurdy, mandola, mandolin, nyckelharpa, and electric guitar) and Candice Night (lead vocals, lyricist, and woodwinds). Their lineup has seen many changes over the years; Blackmore and Night have been the only two constant members. They have released eleven studio albums. Their early releases were mostly acoustic and imitated early music, but eventually Blackmore&#x27;s Night started using more electric guitars and other modern instruments, as well as performing folk-rearranged cover versions of pop and rock songs. 

==History==
===Early===
Candice Night was a Rainbow fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in Renaissance music.

During the reformed Rainbow&#x27;s recording of the album &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot; in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a pun of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.

===1997 to 2005===

Their debut album &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; was a musical success and featured Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on flute for the song &quot;Play Minstrel Play&quot;. In subsequent albums, particularly &quot;Fires at Midnight&quot;, there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, while maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent on a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.
The group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including &quot;castle tours&quot; of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: &quot;Renaissance Night&quot;, the Italian &quot;Morning Star,&quot; The &quot;Midnight&quot; and &quot;Elflore&quot;.

They have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game.

===2006–present===

In 2006, Night performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween&#x27;s &quot;Light the Universe&quot;, which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy&quot;, released in the same year.

On 27 June 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called &quot;Secret Voyage&quot;, a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (“Locked Within the Crystal Ball&quot; is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore&#x27;s Night also performed a cover of a Rainbow song (“Rainbow Eyes”) and an Elvis Presley cover (&quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;).

A new album titled &quot;Autumn Sky&quot; was released at the end of 2010 in Europe and in 2011 in the U.S. This was followed by &quot;Dancer and the Moon&quot;, in 2013, an album featuring covers of songs by Randy Newman (&quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot;), Uriah Heep (&quot;Lady in Black&quot;) and another Rainbow song (“Temple Of The King”, originally from the album &quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;).

Their album, &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;, was released on 18 September 2015. Their latest studio album, &quot;Nature&#x27;s Light&quot; was released worldwide on 12 March 2021.

In 2022, Night was featured on the single &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Be Drinking&quot; with the German folkrock band dArtagnan from their album &quot;Felsenfest&quot; (2022). Blackmore&#x27;s Night had previously made a version of the song on their 2003 album &quot;Ghost of a Rose&quot; called &quot;All for One&quot;. A live version can be found on the DVD &quot;Castles And Dreams&quot;.

<text>The Tampa Bay Lightning (colloquially known as the Bolts) are a professional ice hockey team based in Tampa, Florida. The Lightning compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. They play their home games at Amalie Arena in Downtown Tampa. The franchise is owned by Jeffrey Vinik, and the general manager is Julien BriseBois. Jon Cooper has served as head coach since March 2013, and is the longest-tenured active head coach in the NHL.

The Lightning were founded as an expansion team on December 6, 1990, and began play in the 1992–93 NHL season. The team has won three Stanley Cup championships in 2004, 2020, and 2021, and also played in two additional Stanley Cup Finals in 2015 and 2022. The team&#x27;s sustained success in the time period from 2015 to 2022 (which also includes making the Eastern Conference Finals in 2016 and 2018) has led some outlets to regard the Lightning as a modern NHL dynasty within that time span; the Lightning also went to the conference finals in 2011. Additionally, the Lightning won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy in 2019 after they tied the then all-time record for regular season wins in the 2018–19 season, tying the 62 wins of the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings (later broken by the 2022–23 Boston Bruins), and won eleven straight playoff series from 2020 to 2022. 

==History==

===Early years (1992–2000)===

====Bringing hockey to Tampa====
In the late 1980s, the NHL announced it would expand. Two rival groups from the Tampa Bay Area decided to bid for a franchise: a St. Petersburg-based group fronted by future Hartford Whalers/Carolina Hurricanes owners Peter Karmanos and Jim Rutherford, and a Tampa-based group fronted by Phil Esposito, his brother Tony (both members of the Hockey Hall of Fame), and Mel Lowell, who was vice-president of Madison Square Garden for 14 years. One of the Esposito group&#x27;s key backers, the Pritzker family, backed out a few months before the bid, to be replaced by a consortium of Japanese businesses headed by Kokusai Green, a golf course and resort operator. Although it appeared on paper that the Karmanos/Rutherford group had more financial resources, it only wanted to pay $29 million of the $50 million expansion fee before starting operations. In contrast, the Esposito/Kokusai Green group was one of the few groups willing to pay the full $50 million fee up front. The Esposito group would win the expansion franchise on December 6, 1990, and name the team the Lightning, after Tampa Bay&#x27;s status as the &quot;Lightning Capital of North America&quot;.
Phil Esposito assigned himself president and general manager, while Tony became chief scout, and Mel Lowell executive vice-president and treasurer. Terry Crisp, who played for the Philadelphia Flyers when they won two Stanley Cups in the mid-1970s and coached the Calgary Flames to a Stanley Cup in 1989, was tapped as the first head coach. Phil Esposito also hired former teammates from the Boston Bruins of the 1970s, including former linemate Wayne Cashman as an assistant coach and former Bruin trainer John &quot;Frosty&quot; Forristal as the team&#x27;s trainer. The inaugural team photo has him flanked by Cashman and player Ken Hodge, Jr., son of his other Bruins&#x27; linemate.

In 1991, Angus Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester announced that a company of which he was a director would raise millions of dollars in investments in the Lightning, but his plans were unsuccessful and he was later convicted of wire fraud.

The Lightning played their first preseason game in September 1992 against the Minnesota North Stars, and then turned heads later that preseason when Manon Rhéaume became the first woman to play in an NHL game, which also made her the first woman to play in any of the major professional North American sports leagues. She played for the Lightning against the St. Louis Blues, and stopped seven of nine shots.

The Lightning played their first regular season game on October 7, 1992, in Tampa&#x27;s tiny 11,000-seat Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds. They surprised the visiting Chicago Blackhawks, winning 7–3 with four goals by little-known Chris Kontos. The team rose to the top of the Campbell Conference&#x27;s Norris Division within a month, behind Kontos&#x27; initial torrid scoring pace and a breakout season by forward Brian Bradley. However, it buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the NHL—their nearest division rival, the Blues, were over away—and finished in last place with a record of 23–54–7 for 53 points. This was, at the time, one of the best-ever showings by an NHL expansion team. Bradley&#x27;s 42 goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season; it would be a team record until the 2006–07 season.

The following season saw the Lightning shift to the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Atlantic Division, as well as move into the Florida Suncoast Dome (a building originally designed for baseball) in St. Petersburg, which was reconfigured for hockey and renamed the &quot;ThunderDome.&quot; The team acquired goaltender Daren Puppa, left wing goal scorer Petr Klima, and veteran forward Denis Savard. While Puppa&#x27;s play resulted in a significant improvement in goals allowed (from 332 to 251), Savard was long past his prime and Klima&#x27;s scoring was offset by his defensive lapses. The Lightning finished last in the Atlantic Division in 1993–94 with a record of 30–43–11 for 71 points. Another disappointing season followed in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season with a record of 17–28–3 for 37 points.

====On-ice and off-ice struggles====
In their fourth season, 1995–96, backed by Bradley&#x27;s team-leading 79 points, second-year forward Alexander Selivanov&#x27;s 31 goals, and Roman Hamrlik&#x27;s All-Star year on defense, the Lightning finally qualified for the playoffs, posting a 38–32–12 record for 88 points, ahead of the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference by a single win. Due to his stellar play in net, Puppa was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy (losing out to Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals). Playing the Philadelphia Flyers, a team seen as a Stanley Cup contender, in the first round, the Lightning split the opening two games in Philadelphia before taking game 3 in overtime before a ThunderDome crowd of 28,183. This was the largest crowd for an NHL game, a record that stood until the 2003 Heritage Classic in Edmonton; and it still stands today as the largest crowd at a Stanley Cup playoffs game. An injury to Puppa in that game, however, would see the Lightning lose the next three games and the series.
The Lightning moved into a new arena in downtown Tampa, the Ice Palace (later the St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa Bay Times Forum and now Amalie Arena) for the 1996–97 season. They had acquired goal-scorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off-season, and he did not disappoint, scoring 35 goals while Chris Gratton notched another 30 goals. The team appeared destined for another playoff appearance, but suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but six games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000. Bradley also lost time to a series of concussions that would limit him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. Center John Cullen developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and missed the last 12 games of the 1996–97 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. They would not tally as much as 60 points again for five years.

Most of the Lightning&#x27;s early stars were gone by the 1998–99 season due to free agency and a series of ill-advised trades. Crisp was fired 11 games into the 1997–98 season and replaced by Jacques Demers. Though Demers had presided over the resurgence of the Detroit Red Wings in the 1980s and helmed a Stanley Cup run with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993, he was unable to change the team&#x27;s fortunes and the Lightning ended up losing 55 games. That team&#x27;s .268 winning percentage is still the worst in franchise history.

By most accounts, the Lightning&#x27;s plunge to the bottom of the NHL was due to inattentive ownership by Kokusai Green. Rumors abounded as early as the team&#x27;s second season that the Lightning were on the brink of bankruptcy and that the team was part of a money laundering scheme for the yakuza (Japanese crime families). Its scouting operation consisted of Tony Esposito and several satellite dishes. The Internal Revenue Service investigated the team in 1994 and 1995, and nearly threatened to put a tax lien on the franchise for $750,000 in back taxes. The situation led longtime NHL broadcaster and writer Stan Fischler to call the Lightning a &quot;skating vaudeville show.&quot;

Even in their first playoff season, the team was awash in red ink and Kokusai Green was looking to sell the team; however its asking price of $230 million for the team and the lease with the Ice Palace deterred buyers. A possible sale was further hampered by the team&#x27;s murky ownership structure; many team officials (including Crisp) did not know who really owned the team. Kokusai Green&#x27;s owner, Takashi Okubo, had never met with the Espositos or with NHL officials in person prior to being awarded the Lightning franchise, and never watched his team play during his seven years as owner.

Nearly all of Kokusai Green&#x27;s investment in the team and the Ice Palace came in the form of loans, leaving the team constantly short of cash. At least one prospective buyer pulled out after expressing doubts that Okubo even existed. In fact, the first time anyone connected with the Lightning or the NHL even saw Okubo was in the spring of 1998. Esposito was forced into several trades just to keep the team above water. The team&#x27;s financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials; rumors surfaced that the NHL was seriously considering taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of 1998.

&quot;Forbes&quot; wrote an article in late 1997 calling the Lightning a financial nightmare, with a debt equal to 236% of its value, the highest of any major North American sports franchise. Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant, &quot;Forbes&quot; called the team&#x27;s deal with the arena a lemon since it would not result in much revenue for 30 years. It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes.

Finally, in 1998, Kokusai Green found a buyer. Although William Davidson, longtime owner of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), was thought to be the frontrunner, the buyer turned out to be insurance tycoon and motivational speaker Art Williams, who previously owned the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The team was $102 million in debt at the time the sale closed. Williams knew very little about hockey, but was very visible and outspoken, and immediately pumped an additional $6 million into the team&#x27;s payroll. He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era. After taking control, Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe, only to fire them two games into the 1998–99 season. He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager. The Lightning drafted Vincent Lecavalier first overall in 1998, a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come.

Williams was widely seen as being in over his head. Early in the 1998–99 season, the Lightning lost ten games in a row, all but ending any chance of making the playoffs. They ended up losing 54 games that year, more than the expansion Nashville Predators.

===Return to respectability (2000–2010)===
By the spring of 1999, Williams had seen enough. He had not attended a game in some time because &quot;this team broke my heart&quot;. He lost $20 million in the 1998–99 season alone, as much money in one year as he had estimated he could have reasonably lost in five years. Williams sold the team for $115 million—$2 million less than he had paid for the team a year earlier—to Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson, who had almost bought the team a year earlier. Along with the sale, the Lightning acquired a new top minor league affiliate; Davidson also owned the Detroit Vipers of the now-defunct International Hockey League.

Davidson remained in Detroit, but appointed Tom Wilson as team president to handle day-to-day management of the team. Wilson immediately fired Demers, who despite his best efforts (and fatherly attitude toward Lecavalier) was unable to overcome the damage from the Kokusai Green ownership. Wilson persuaded Ottawa Senators general manager (and former Vipers general manager) Rick Dudley to take over as the Lightning&#x27;s new general manager; Dudley, in turn, brought Vipers coach Steve Ludzik in as the team&#x27;s new head coach. Wilson, Dudley and Ludzik had helped make the Vipers one of the premier minor league hockey franchises, having won a Turner Cup in only their third season in Detroit (the team had originally been based in Salt Lake City).

However, as had been the case with Demers, the damage from the last few seasons under Kokusai Green was too much for Ludzik to overcome. Even with a wholesale transfer of talent from Detroit to Tampa (a move that eventually doomed the Vipers, which folded along with the IHL in 2001), the Lightning lost 54 games in 1999–2000 and 52 in 2000–01, becoming the first team in NHL history to post four straight 50-loss seasons. The lone bright spots in those years were the blossoming of Lecavalier and Brad Richards into NHL stars. Ludzik was replaced in early 2001 by career NHL assistant John Tortorella. The March 5 trade deadline offered another glimmer of hope when the team acquired hold-out goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin from the Phoenix Coyotes for three players and a draft pick.

The 2001–02 season, Tortorella&#x27;s first full year behind the bench, saw some improvement. Martin St. Louis was having a breakout season when he broke his leg in game number 47 and was lost for the remainder of the season. Khabibulin recorded a shut out at the NHL All-Star Game but was not named its MVP, by all accounts due to the game&#x27;s voting protocol. By mid-February, the Lightning were well out of playoff contention and were sinking under a rash of injuries. Dudley, who had guaranteed a playoff berth before the season, was fired and replaced by his assistant, Jay Feaster. Still the Lightning showed some signs of life, earning more than 60 points for the first time since 1997. Tortorella stripped Lecavalier of the captaincy due to contract negotiations that had made the young center miss the start of the season.

====Two dream seasons and first Stanley Cup championship (2002–2004)====
With a young core of players led by Vincent Lecavalier, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis and Fredrik Modin, the Lightning were thought to be very close to respectability. However, they arrived somewhat earlier than expected in 2002–03. The young team was led by the goaltending of Nikolai Khabibulin and the scoring efforts of Lecavalier, St. Louis, Modin, Richards and Ruslan Fedotenko. Throughout the season, the Lightning battled the Washington Capitals for first place in the Southeast Division. They finished with a record of 36–25–16 for 93 points, breaking the 90-point barrier for the first time in team history. They won the division by just one point, giving them home-ice advantage in their first-round match-up with the Capitals. At season&#x27;s end, coach Tortorella was recognized for his efforts by being named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award, losing out to Jacques Lemaire of the Minnesota Wild.

In the first round of the playoffs, the Lightning quickly fell two games behind in the series but followed the two losses with four consecutive wins for their first playoff series win in franchise history. However, in the semifinals, they went down in five games to the New Jersey Devils, who went on to win the Stanley Cup.
The Lightning&#x27;s dramatic improvement continued through the 2003–04 regular season, finishing with a record of 46–22–8–6 for 106 points, second-best in the NHL after the Western Conference&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings—the first 100-point season in franchise history. The Lightning lost only 20 man-games to injury. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lightning ousted the New York Islanders in five games, with Khabibulin posting shutouts in games 1, 3, and 4.

In the second round, the Lightning faced the Montreal Canadiens; Lecavalier, Richards, and Khabibulin led the team to a four-game sweep of Montreal. Next, they faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the conference finals. After a tightly fought seven-game series in which neither team was able to win consecutive games, Fredrik Modin notched the winning goal of the seventh and deciding game, earning the Eastern Conference championship for the Lightning and their first-ever berth in the Stanley Cup Finals.

Their opponent in the final round was the Calgary Flames. The final round also went the full seven games, with the deciding game played in the St. Pete Times Forum on June 7, 2004. This time, Ruslan Fedotenko was the game 7 hero, scoring both Lightning goals in a 2–1 victory. Brad Richards, who had 26 points in the postseason, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs; the Lightning had won all 31 contests in which he had scored a goal since the opening of the season. Tortorella won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s Coach of the Year. Only three years after their last of four consecutive seasons of 50 or more losses, and in only their 12th year of existence, the Lightning became the southernmost team ever to win the Stanley Cup, an accomplishment since surpassed by the Florida Panthers. Martin St. Louis led the team and the NHL with 94 points (his 38 goals were fourth-most after the 41 of tied trio Jarome Iginla, Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk), and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player. St. Louis also won the Lester B. Pearson Award for the NHL&#x27;s most outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players&#x27; Association, and tied the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; Marek Malik for the NHL Plus/Minus Award. A season of superlatives was capped with one final accolade, as &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named general manager Jay Feaster as the league&#x27;s executive of the year for 2003–04.

====Post-championship successes and playoff disappointments (2004–2007)====
The Lightning had to wait a year to defend their title due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, but in 2005–06, they barely made the playoffs with a record of 43–33–6 for 93 points in a conference where six teams notched 100 or more points. They lost to the Ottawa Senators in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs.
During the off-season, the Lightning traded Fredrik Modin and Fredrik Norrena to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for goaltender Marc Denis in an effort to replace the departing John Grahame, who had signed with the Carolina Hurricanes. However, free agent Johan Holmqvist would eventually receive the majority of playing time and most of the club&#x27;s wins. The first half of 2006–07 was inconsistent for the Lightning, maintaining an 18–19–2 record throughout the first few months. January and February were far better months for the team, going 9–4–0 in January and 9–2–2 in February, driving them back into the playoff race. Fourteen games in March were split even, and on March 16, 2007, Vincent Lecavalier broke the franchise record for most points in a season, with 95 (finishing with 108). The record was previously held by Martin St. Louis, who had set the record in the 2003–04 Stanley Cup-winning year. Lecavalier also broke the franchise&#x27;s goal-scoring record, finishing with a league-leading 52 goals.

The Lightning were busy during the final weeks before the NHL&#x27;s trade deadline, acquiring wingers Kyle Wanvig, Stephen Baby and defenseman Shane O&#x27;Brien. Former first-round pick Nikita Alexeev was traded on deadline day to the Chicago Blackhawks. Other mid-season additions to the team included Filip Kuba, Luke Richardson and Doug Janik. Veteran Andre Roy, who had won the Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004, was claimed off waivers from the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Throughout March, the Lightning had been competing with the Atlanta Thrashers for first place in the Southeast Division. With a chance to overtake the Thrashers one final time and once again become division champions for the third time in team history, on April 6, 2007, in the final week of the regular season, the Lightning suffered a loss to the Florida Panthers, the night before the season finale in Atlanta. That same night, the Thrashers defeated the Carolina Hurricanes and subsequently clinched the division. For the Lightning, this meant having to settle for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a final record of 44–33–5 (93 points). However, the Lightning were eliminated from playoff competition on April 22, after a 3–2 home loss to the New Jersey Devils in game 6 of the conference quarterfinals.
Following their playoff exit, on August 7, 2007, Absolute Hockey Enterprises, a group led by Doug MacLean, announced it had signed a purchase agreement for the team and the leasehold on the St. Pete Times Forum. MacLean is the former president and general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and former head coach for both the Blue Jackets and the Florida Panthers. The group announced it planned to keep the team in Tampa, but the deal collapsed during the 2007–08 season.

====Decline (2007–2008)====
The Lightning struggled to maintain success during the 2007–08 campaign. Although the &quot;Big 3&quot; of Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards, along with Vaclav Prospal, had performed up to expectations, they had little consistent play from supporting players.

At the start of the All-Star Break on January 25, 2008, the Lightning had a 20–25–5 record, and with 45 points, were in last place in both the Southeast Division and the Eastern Conference. Only the Los Angeles Kings had a lower point total at this time of the season, with 40 points.

On February 13, 2008, it was announced that Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment had agreed to sell the Lightning to OK Hockey LLC, a group headed by Oren Koules, a producer of the &quot;Saw&quot; horror movies, and Len Barrie, a former NHL player and real estate developer.

The Lightning were active during the trade deadline, similar to the previous season. More notable trades included Vaclav Prospal&#x27;s trade to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for prospect Alexandre Picard and a conditional draft pick. Additionally, former Conn Smythe Trophy winner Brad Richards and goaltender Johan Holmqvist were traded to the Dallas Stars in exchange for goaltender Mike Smith and forwards Jussi Jokinen and Jeff Halpern, as well as a fourth-round draft pick in 2009. Jan Hlavac, a regular contributor, was also traded, moving to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a seventh-round pick in 2008. Defenseman Dan Boyle was re-signed to a six-year contract extension reportedly worth $40 million.

However, after the trade deadline, the Lightning fared no better than they had throughout the entire season. After the February 26 trade deadline, the Lightning won only five games. Finishing with a 31–42–9 record, with 71 points, they had the highest chance of winning the top overall pick in the 2008 NHL entry draft through the draft lottery, which they eventually won on April 7. They would use their first overall pick to select Steven Stamkos of the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Sarnia Sting who, like Lecavalier before, was expected to become a franchise cornerstone player for years to come.

The Lightning were the worst team on the road in the NHL, winning only 11 games. Another showing of the team&#x27;s poor play was the difference from the previous season&#x27;s success in the overtime/shootout periods. In the 2006–07 season, the Lightning had one of the best extra period records, winning 15 games in either overtime or the shootout. However, in the 2007–08 season, they won only three games, losing nine.

Vincent Lecavalier suffered a dislocated shoulder as the result of an open-ice hit from Matt Cooke of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta. Lecavalier, who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season&#x27;s ending, would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well. Cooke was fined $2,500 by the NHL for the hit, as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time. Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier&#x27;s winning both the King Clancy Memorial Trophy and the NHL Foundation Player Award for work through his foundation, including a $3 million pledge to All Children&#x27;s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, for what would become the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at All Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Head coach John Tortorella was fired by the Lightning following their worst season since Tortorella was hired. At the time working as an NHL analyst for ESPN, Barry Melrose stated on June 4 during an episode of &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; that he missed coaching and would entertain any NHL coaching offers. He stated, &quot;I miss not having a dog in the fight.&quot; On June 23, ESPN reported Melrose had been chosen to be the head coach of the Lightning, beginning in 2008–09. The next day, the Lightning officially introduced him as their new head coach.

====Arrival of Steven Stamkos (2008–2010)====
Steven Stamkos was selected first overall by Tampa Bay. On July 29, 2008, he signed an entry-level contract with the Lightning in which he could earn as much as $8.55 million in performance bonuses. Leading up to the start of the 2008–09 season, the Lightning centered their promotional efforts around Stamkos, including a website with the slogan &quot;Seen Stamkos?&quot; On July 4, 2008, Dan Boyle, despite coming off a recent contract extension, was traded (along with Brad Lukowich) to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle, Ty Wishart, a first-round draft pick in 2009 and a fourth-round pick in 2010. Boyle was pressured to waive his no-trade clause by Tampa Bay&#x27;s ownership, who said they would otherwise place him on waivers, where he would likely be claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers. In the fallout from the trade, Boyle would call Lightning ownership &quot;liars&quot; for misrepresenting the aforementioned events to the public, while former coach Tortorella later labeled them as &quot;cowboys&quot; and said he had zero respect for them. Frustrated at interference in the team&#x27;s hockey operations by Barrie and Koules, seven days later, Jay Feaster resigned as general manager, despite having three years remaining on his contract.

The Lightning opened the 2008–09 season in the Czech Republic against the New York Rangers as a part of the NHL&#x27;s regular season &quot;Premiere&quot; that selects several teams to open the regular season in Europe. Barry Melrose would record his first win as a head coach in over 13 years on October 21, 2008, with a 3–2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. However, the Lightning did not get off to a great start as hoped, and Melrose was eventually fired by the Lightning with a 5–7–4 record. Rick Tocchet, who had been hired as assistant coach during the previous off-season, was promoted to interim head coach. On March 4, veterans Mark Recchi and Olaf Kolzig were traded by the Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. The Lightning acquired top round picks Matt Lashoff and Martins Karsums from the Bruins. After the firing of Melrose, the Lightning went 19–33–14 and would finish the season 24–40–18 with 66 points, their lowest point total since the 2000–01 season. 

With the second overall pick in the 2009 NHL entry draft, the Lightning selected Swedish defenseman Victor Hedman, who would also be another major part of the franchise for years to come. In the 2009 off-season, the Lightning removed the interim status of Rick Tocchet, making him the full-time head coach and signing him to a multi-year contract. The Lightning had an up-and-down beginning to the 2009–10 campaign. Despite an overmatched roster on paper, and a team that struggled in the first two periods of many games, the Lightning remained competitive in the playoff race until March, when they went 5–10–1 for the month and fell eight points out of a playoff spot. Unable to make a final push for the playoffs, they were officially eliminated from contention within the first week of April. The Lightning finished the season 34–36–12 for 80 points, fourth in the Southeast Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference.

Steven Stamkos scored 51 goals in just his second NHL season along with 44 assists and 95 points. His 51 goals earned himself a share of the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy by finishing tied for the NHL lead in goals with Pittsburgh Penguins star and captain Sidney Crosby. During the season, the team was sold to Bostonian investment banker Jeffrey Vinik. Following the late-season collapse, Vinik cleaned house, firing both head coach Rick Tocchet and general manager Brian Lawton on April 12, 2010, one day after the season ended.

===Steve Yzerman/Julien BriseBois era (2010–present)===

====2011 run to the conference finals (2010–2011)====
In May 2010, Vinik hired Steve Yzerman away from the Detroit Red Wings front office to be the new general manager on a five-year contract. Yzerman then hired Guy Boucher from the Montreal Canadiens organization to succeed Rick Tocchet as the head coach two weeks later.

Yzerman&#x27;s first off-season with Tampa Bay began with a splash. With the sixth pick of the 2010 NHL entry draft, the Lightning selected forward Brett Connolly despite a history of injuries while playing for the Western Hockey League (WHL)&#x27;s Prince George Cougars. On July 1, 2010, veteran blueliner Andrej Meszaros was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second-round pick in 2011. Later that day, the Lightning signed star winger Martin St. Louis to a four-year, $22.5 million contract extension to come into effect on July 1, 2011. On July 19, in another move with the Flyers organization, the Lightning traded defenseman Matt Walker and Tampa Bay&#x27;s fourth-round pick in 2011 for high-scoring winger Simon Gagne. Other off-season acquisitions included the signing of forwards Sean Bergenheim, Dominic Moore and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, along with defensemen Brett Clark, Randy Jones and Pavel Kubina and goaltender Dan Ellis, as well as the re-signing of restricted free agent forward Steve Downie to a two-year, $3.7 million deal.

With starting goaltender Mike Smith injured, the Lightning called up Cedrick Desjardins, who played with a .950 save percentage and a 1.00 goals against average (GAA) in two games. The team then acquired veteran Dwayne Roloson from the New York Islanders for further coverage in net.

The Lightning compiled a 46–25–11 record with 103 points in the 2010–11 season, matching a franchise record for wins in a season. After holding the first place in the Southeast Division for several months, they fell to second after a poor performance in March. However, their record was solid enough for second in the Southeast Division and fifth in the Eastern Conference, and they returned to the playoffs for the first time since the 2007. Scoring 31 goals and assisting on 68 for 99 points, Martin St. Louis finished second in the NHL in points only behind the 104 points by Daniel Sedin of the Vancouver Canucks. Steven Stamkos recorded 45 goals as the runner-up to the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy only behind the 50 goals scored by Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks and was a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award as the most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the NHL Players&#x27; Association, which ultimately went to Vancouver&#x27;s Daniel Sedin.
In the 2011 playoffs, Tampa Bay played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the conference quarterfinals who finished the season as the fourth seed in the Eastern Confernence. After losing game 4 at home in the second overtime period, they fell behind in the series one game to three. However, the Lightning went on to win the next three games, including a 1–0 game 7 win on the road, taking their first playoff series since winning the Stanley Cup against the Calgary Flames in 2004. In the conference semifinals, the Lightning swept the top-seeded Washington Capitals. Tampa Bay played the Boston Bruins in the conference finals. In game 4 of the series, the Lightning trailed 3–0 at the end of the first period. When Dwayne Roloson was pulled for Mike Smith, the Bruins failed to score again, and the Lightning tied the game in the second period by scoring three goals in 3:58, going on to win the game 5–3 and tying the series at two games apiece. The series went the full seven games, though the Lightning were eliminated by a single goal, as they lost game 7 (0–1) to lose the series to the eventual Stanley Cup champion and third-seeded Bruins in seven games, one win short from reaching the Stanley Cup Finals.

====Transition seasons (2011–2013)====
The Lightning finished the 2011–12 season with a 38–36–8 record. With only 84 points, they fell short of reaching the playoffs by eight points in the standings and ending the season third in the Southeast Division and tenth in the Eastern Conference. Individually, Steven Stamkos scored a franchise-record 60 goals. He won the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy for the second time in his career. Stamkos was also second in the NHL in points with 97, and was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy for the first time and the Ted Lindsay Award for the second consecutive season which both awards eventually going to Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

As with the 1994–95 NHL lockout, the 2012–13 NHL lockout resulted in a 48-game season. Nearing the end of an 18–26–4 season for 40 points, in which the Lightning ended fourth in the division and 14th in the conference, general manager Steve Yzerman looked to their highly-successful American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. On March 25, 2013, head coach Guy Boucher was dismissed for following a 7–16–1 record. The Lightning announced Jon Cooper would become the eighth head coach in franchise history. Martin St. Louis won his second Art Ross Trophy with 60 points in the shortened season, as Stamkos finished runner-up 57.

On June 27, 2013, the team announced that they would exercise one of their two &quot;compliance buyouts&quot; on captain Vincent Lecavalier, as permitted by the collective agreement. This move made Lecavalier an unrestricted free agent beginning July 5 of that year. The team stated the move was made not because of Lecavalier&#x27;s play on the ice, but because of how his contract affected the team&#x27;s salary cap, which would have been more than $7 million per year until its expiration after the 2019–20 season.

====Return to playoff contention (2013–2014)====
After acquiring goaltender Ben Bishop from the Ottawa Senators in a trade the previous season, the Lightning started the 2013–14 season with an above-average performance. On November 11, 2013, going into the day tied for most goals during the regular season, Steven Stamkos suffered a broken right tibia after crashing into one of the goalposts during play against the Boston Bruins. He would miss 45 games and was not cleared to play again until March 5, 2014.
In January 2014, general manager Steve Yzerman, who also served as the general manager for Canada&#x27;s team at the 2014 Winter Olympics, elected not to name Lightning captain Martin St. Louis to Canada&#x27;s roster, instead choosing the still-injured Stamkos. After Stamkos was not medically cleared to play in Sochi in early February, Yzerman ultimately named St. Louis to Team Canada as an injury replacement. In late February, it was reported St. Louis had requested a trade from Yzerman the month prior. St. Louis, who had a no-move clause in his contract with Tampa Bay, reportedly consented to only being traded to the New York Rangers. On March 5, 2014, St. Louis was sent to New York along with a conditional 2015 second-round pick in exchange for New York captain Ryan Callahan, a 2015 first-round draft pick, a conditional 2014 second-round pick and a 2015 conditional seventh-round pick. The deal came subsequently after Stamkos had been cleared to return to the Lightning&#x27;s active roster. St. Louis cited his decision based on his family and thanked Lightning fans for their support during his tenure with the franchise, but would not specify any further about the reasons leading to his request. On March 6, Steven Stamkos was named Tampa Bay&#x27;s 10th captain in his first game back after recovering from a tibia injury. On April 7, the team announced it had signed general manager Steve Yzerman to a four-year contract extension.
Finishing the season with 101 points, the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2011. However, Tampa Bay was eliminated in the first round, losing to the Montreal Canadiens in a four-game sweep.

====Contention for the Stanley Cup and one playoff absence (2014–2018)====
On June 25, 2014, the Lightning agreed to terms with Ryan Callahan, signing him to a six-year, $34.8 million contract extension. The same day, the Lightning used its remaining compliance buyout on forward Ryan Malone after his on-ice performance had declined from injuries seasons prior in addition to his off-ice troubles that included a DUI arrest before the end of the season.

Finishing the 2014–15 season with 108 points, the Lightning placed second in the Atlantic Division and qualified for the playoffs for the second-straight season, scoring the most goals out of any team in the NHL. Tampa Bay eliminated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in the first round of the playoffs before facing the Montreal Canadiens in the second round. The Lightning won the first three games of the series and had a chance to sweep the Canadiens; however, Montreal responded with wins in games 4 and 5 to extend the series to a sixth game. Tampa Bay won the sixth game of the series to eliminate the Canadiens and advance to the conference finals for the first time since 2011, facing the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning New York Rangers. In the conference finals, the Lightning and the Rangers split the first two games of the series in New York, with the Lightning winning game 2 of the series thanks to a Tyler Johnson hat-trick. The series then shifted to Tampa, where the Lightning had a come-from-behind overtime victory in game 3, but lost game 4 to even the series at two games apiece. During game 5 in New York, goaltender Ben Bishop recorded his second shutout of the playoffs in a 2–0 victory, but the Rangers responded in game 6 by scoring seven goals to tie the series at three games apiece. In game 7, Bishop recorded his third shutout of the playoffs in another 2–0 victory against the Rangers to lead the Lightning to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals since 2004. The Lightning not only became the first team to defeat the Rangers in a game 7 at Madison Square Garden, but they also became the first team to successfully defeat three Original Six teams in the first three rounds of the playoffs. The Lightning would face the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals, making it the first time a finalist faced four Original Six teams in the playoffs since the four-round format was introduced in 1980. After losing game 1 at home, the Lightning built a two games to one series lead, though the Blackhawks would win the following three games to win the Stanley Cup in six games at the United Center in Chicago. This made Tampa Bay the first team to beat three of the Original Six teams in the playoffs since the Pittsburgh Penguins completed the feat in 1992. However, they became the first team to lose the Stanley Cup Finals despite beating three Original Six teams in the previous three rounds.
The Lightning had a slow start to the 2015–16 season. The season was filled with controversy for the team, starting off with the contractual questions regarding captain Steven Stamkos and with the former third overall pick Jonathan Drouin publicly requesting a trade and being suspended from the organization. The Lightning picked up their play at the beginning of 2016 and set the franchise record to nine consecutive wins on March 5, 2016, when Alex Killorn scored with 42.5 seconds remaining in overtime to propel the Lightning to a 4–3 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes at Amalie Arena. On March 26, 2016, the Lightning announced cornerstone defenseman Anton Stralman had suffered a fractured leg in their game against the New York Islanders at home. Stamkos was out of the lineup for the team&#x27;s game on April 2 against the New Jersey Devils in Tampa; general manager Steve Yzerman announced after the game that the captain would miss one-to-three months due to a blood clot in his arm. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the team had no other option but to bring Drouin back to the team. The Lightning ended up finishing second in the Atlantic Division and would once again face the third-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs. The Lightning played the Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the 2016 playoffs for the second consecutive year and defeated them in five games after winning game five 1–0 at Amalie Arena. Next up, the New York Islanders (who had recently defeated the Panthers to win their first playoff series since the 1992–93 season) would face the Lightning. In game 1, the Islanders defeated the Bolts 5–3. The Lightning would eventually answer back by winning four consecutive games in the series to defeat the Isles in five games to move on to the conference finals for the second consecutive year, in large part due to back-to-back road overtime victories with goals scored by Brian Boyle and Jason Garrison. The Lightning were set to play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the conference finals. In game 1 at Consol Energy Center, star goaltender Ben Bishop would be added to the list of devastating injuries for the team as he left on a stretcher and did not return for the remainder of the series. Stralman would eventually return in game 2. A back-and-forth series would eventually lead to a game 7 showdown in Pittsburgh. Lightning captain Steven Stamkos surprisingly took warmups and was in the Lightning lineup after a long absence from blood clot surgery. However, it was not enough as the Lightning would fall in the game 2–1 against the Penguins for a 4–3 series defeat, who went on to defeat the San Jose Sharks and win the Stanley Cup while the Lightning came one win short from a second consecutive appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals.
With the Lightning under the spotlight in the 2016 off-season, Drouin rescinded his trade request. Steve Yzerman would then announce on June 29 the team re-signed Stamkos to an eight-year, cap-friendly deal. He would then sign star defenseman Victor Hedman to an eight-year contract on July 1, along with a seven-year deal for Alex Killorn and three-year deals to star winger Nikita Kucherov and goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy.

The Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs in the 2016–17 season. Finishing with 94 points, they were beaten to the second wildcard by the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 95 points. The 2016–17 season for the Lightning was a host of injuries, mainly their captain, Steven Stamkos. Stamkos went down in the 17th game, against the Detroit Red Wings on November 15, 2016. It was revealed he suffered from a torn left meniscus, which put him out for the rest of the season. Ryan Callahan would also play in only 18 games due to multiple surgeries to his back and hip. Towards the end of the season, they traded goaltender Ben Bishop to the Los Angeles Kings, center Brian Boyle to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and forward Valtteri Filppula to the Philadelphia Flyers. However, there were positive signs as winger Nikita Kucherov emerged with 40 goals for the first time in his career and the Lightning also showcased their young talent with rookie Brayden Point and promising AHL call-ups Yanni Gourde and Jake Dotchin. The Lightning bounced back with this talent in the last third of the season, but it was not enough as they missed the 2017 playoffs by one point.

In the 2017 off-season, the Lightning made a deal with the Montreal Canadiens to send Jonathan Drouin to their franchise in exchange for defensive prospect Mikhail Sergachev and a second-round pick in the 2018 NHL entry draft. They also signed defenseman Daniel Girardi for two years and winger Chris Kunitz to a one-year deal.
In the 2017–18 season, Steven Stamkos returned from injury, scoring 20 points in the first 10 games and assisting on nine of Nikita Kucherov&#x27;s 11 goals. The Lightning finished the 2017–18 season with a record of 54–23–5, finishing with 113 points. The Lightning won their first Atlantic Division title and first division title since the 2003–04 season, as well as securing the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. Andrei Vasilevskiy was nominated for the Vezina Trophy for the first time. Nikita Kucherov scored 100 points during the regular season, finishing third overall in the league. Steve Yzerman was once again nominated for the NHL General Manager of the Year Award. During the 2018 playoffs, the Lightning eliminated the New Jersey Devils in the first round and the Boston Bruins in the second round, both in five games. However, they were defeated in the conference finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, in seven games, one win short from clinching a spot in the Stanley Cup Finals once more.

====First Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner swept in the first round (2018–2019)====
On September 11, 2018, it was announced that Steve Yzerman would be resigning from his position as general manager, and longtime assistant general manager Julien BriseBois would be taking his place as the new general manager. During the 2018–19 season, the Lightning clinched their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy and second consecutive division title after a 4–1 win over the Arizona Coyotes on March 18, 2019. Winning their final regular season game against the Boston Bruins on April 6, the Lightning finished with 62 wins, tying the NHL record set by the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings for most wins in a season. Nikita Kucherov became the second player in Lightning franchise history (after Martin St. Louis) to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player and the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading point scorer, setting a new franchise record of 128 points. Andrei Vasilevskiy became the first player in franchise history to win the Vezina Trophy as the league&#x27;s best goaltender. However, in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, they were swept in four games by the eighth seeded Columbus Blue Jackets in that team&#x27;s first-ever playoff series victory, becoming the first Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner to be swept in the first round of the playoffs. The series is widely regarded as one of the biggest upsets in league history. Former NHL player and NBC Sports analyst Jeremy Roenick described Tampa&#x27;s elimination as &quot;one of the biggest letdowns in history&quot;, while the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; described it as &quot;the disappointment that all others are measured against&quot;.

====Back-to-back Stanley Cups and three straight Finals appearances (2019–2022)====
Following their earlier than expected exit from the 2019 playoffs, several players left the Lightning. Left winger J. T. Miller was traded to the Vancouver Canucks. Backup goaltender Louis Domingue was dealt to the New Jersey Devils for a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2021. Defenseman Anton Stralman left the team in free agency after five seasons and signed a three-year contract with the inner-state rival Florida Panthers. Right winger Ryan Callahan&#x27;s career was effectively ended when he was diagnosed with a degenerative back disease. Defenseman Daniel Girardi went unsigned over the summer and eventually announced his retirement from playing hockey effective immediately after his two-year contract he signed in 2017 expired. To make up for these losses, the Lightning signed defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk to a one-year contract, after his contract with the New York Rangers was bought out. Left winger Patrick Maroon, who was coming off a Stanley Cup championship with his hometown team, the St. Louis Blues, was also signed to a one-year deal. The Lightning re-signed centers Brayden Point and Cedric Paquette to two and three-year contracts, respectively. Starting goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy&#x27;s contract was also extended by eight years.

The Lightning began the season with a 17–13–4 record after 34 games. After this point, they won 23 of their next 26 games, including two separate win streaks of at least ten games, the second of which eventually set a new franchise record of eleven consecutive wins. They lost captain Steven Stamkos to injury once again, as he underwent surgery to repair a core muscle in late February. He was expected to miss 6–8 weeks as a result, which at the time was expected to keep him out for the remainder of the regular season and the start of the playoffs.

Before the 2020 trade deadline the Lightning made two significant trades that would go on to be instrumental to their future success. On February 16, 2020, the Lightning acquired forward Blake Coleman from the New Jersey Devils for prospect Nolan Foote and a 2020 first-round pick. Then on the last day before the deadline, the Lightning acquired forward Barclay Goodrow and a 2020 third-round pick from the San Jose Sharks for Tampa&#x27;s 2020 first-round pick and Anthony Greco.
Tampa Bay had only played 70 games when the NHL suspended the season on March 12, 2020, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not until late May that the league decided to cancel the remaining three weeks of the regular season. At the time, the Lightning had a record of 43–21–6 and were second in their conference. To finish the season, the league expanded the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs to include 24 teams rather than 16. In July, it was announced that the playoffs would begin August 1, and would take place in the Canadian cities of Toronto as the Eastern Conference hub, and Edmonton for the Western Conference. By virtue of having one of the top four highest point percentages at the time the season was suspended, the Lightning not only qualified for the playoffs, but would first compete in a single round-robin opening round group with the Boston Bruins, Washington Capitals, and Philadelphia Flyers to determine seeding. Winning two out of three games, the Lightning earned the second seed in the East.

Following the round-robin, the Lightning drew the Columbus Blue Jackets again in the first round. The first game of the series ultimately became the fourth-longest NHL game in history, as the game-winning goal was scored by Brayden Point at the 10:27 mark of the fifth overtime period. Point also scored in overtime for a second time in game five, eliminating Columbus. In the second round, the Lightning faced the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Boston Bruins. After losing the first game of this series, the Lightning rallied to win the next four, with Victor Hedman&#x27;s double-overtime goal in game 5 sealing the series victory for Tampa Bay. After advancing, the remainder of the Lightning&#x27;s playoff run took place in Edmonton, which had been planned as the site of both of the conference finals and the Stanley Cup Finals. In the conference finals, the Lightning took on the New York Islanders. The Islanders extended the Lightning to six games, but Tampa Bay would once again prevail in overtime to win the series, with the game-winning goal this time being scored by Anthony Cirelli. The win earned the Lightning the Prince of Wales Trophy for the third time in their history, and their first trip to the Stanley Cup Finals since 2015. In the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, the Lightning met the Dallas Stars. The teams split the first two games of the series. In game three, Steven Stamkos returned to the lineup, having missed the entire playoff run to that point after suffering an injury prior to the start of the playoffs, unrelated to an injury he sustained during the regular season. He scored a goal on what was his only shot on goal of the series, as he did not take to the ice again following the end of the first period. Tampa Bay did, however, win both game three and four to take a 3–1 series lead. Dallas stayed alive in the series by winning game five 3–2 in double-overtime to force a game six, but the Lightning closed them out with a 2–0 win in game six to win their second Stanley Cup championship, and first since 2004. Victor Hedman was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the MVP of the playoffs, having recorded 22 points on 10 goals and 12 assists. Nikita Kucherov set a new franchise record for points in a single playoff season with 34, and also became the franchise leader for playoff goals, assists, and points. The team set a league record with over 221 minutes played in overtime periods alone. They also became the first team in league history to have three series-winning goals in overtime. Andrei Vasilevskiy surpassed both former Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop and Nikolai Khabibulin to become the franchise leader in playoff games played and playoff games won. The victory led to a new tradition for Tampa Bay sports teams: boat parades. The 2020 Lightning held a parade of boats on the Hillsborough River rather than a traditional victory parade through the streets of the city, mainly to comply with COVID-19 regulations, but subsequent championship teams in Tampa have held similar parades even with those restrictions lifted.

Due to COVID-19, the league moved the Lightning to the Central Division, where they would compete with the Blackhawks, Blue Jackets, Hurricanes, Panthers, Predators, Red Wings, and Stars for the 2020–21 season. The Lightning would only play against teams in the Central Division, with limited attendance to start the season. The team once again played in a shortened season, playing 56 games in total. Nikita Kucherov would miss the entire regular season with a hip surgery he had in December 2020. During the season, the Lightning acquired defenseman David Savard through a multi-team trade with the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings. The Lightning would also acquire defenseman Fredrik Claesson in another trade with the San Jose Sharks. The Lightning finished the season with a 36–17–3 record, and would finish third in the Central Division.

Entering the 2021 playoffs, the Lightning would face against the Florida Panthers in the first round, making this the first time the state rivals would meet each other in the playoffs. The Lightning would win the series 4–2, with the last game continuing a playoff series clinching shutout streak that had carried over from the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals against Dallas. In the second round, the Lightning would face the Carolina Hurricanes. In the third game of the series, Brayden Point would score the first goal in a playoff goal-scoring streak that would last for 9 games, coming in second to Reggie Leach with 10 games in a single playoff year. The Hurricanes would win game 3 in overtime, however the Lightning would win the next two games to win the series 4–1. For the second consecutive year, the Lightning would again face the New York Islanders before heading to the Stanley Cup Finals. Due to the lack of conferences for this season, this series would not be called the conference finals, but instead it would be known as the Stanley Cup semifinals. The Islanders would once again take the Lightning to an extended series, having won game 6 in overtime to force the series to seven games. However, the Lightning would clinch the series in game 7 with a single shorthanded goal scored by Yanni Gourde. The win would earn the Lightning their second consecutive Prince of Wales Trophy, and a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals, the Lightning went up against the Montreal Canadiens. In the first three games, the Lightning would prevail, a notable highlight being the diving goal Blake Coleman would score with 1.1 seconds left in the second period in the second game in the series. The Canadiens however would force a game 5 and prevent a sweep, winning game 4 in overtime. The Lightning however would win the Stanley Cup in game 5, with a single goal scored by Ross Colton in the second period. The game would also see the Lightning win in their own arena, the second time in team history, and the first time since the Chicago Blackhawks won the Cup in 2015, which coincidentally was against the Lightning. Starting goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP with 5 shutouts during the playoffs, 4 of which were series-clinching shutouts. Patrick Maroon would win his third consecutive Stanley Cup, one with his hometown team, the St. Louis Blues in 2019 and two with the Lightning in 2020 and 2021. Maroon later slipped and dropped the Stanley Cup and severely dented the trophy&#x27;s bowl during a celebration at Julian B. Lane Park following the team&#x27;s victory parade on July 12. Maroon cited the strong thunderstorm during the outdoor celebration as the reason, and the Cup was quickly repaired with no further issues whatsoever.

On February 26, 2022, the Lightning played their first outdoor game in franchise history against the host Nashville Predators in the 2022 NHL Stadium Series at Nissan Stadium. The Lightning would win the game against the Predators with a score of 3–2, with Steven Stamkos receiving first star. On April 14, 2022, the Lightning clinched a playoff berth after a 4–3 overtime win against the Anaheim Ducks. In the 2022 playoffs, the Lightning defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games in the first round and swept their in-state rivals, the Presidents&#x27; Trophy–winning Florida Panthers, in the second round. On June 11, the Lightning clinched their third straight Stanley Cup Finals berth after a 2–1 win against the New York Rangers in game six of the conference finals. However, in the 2022 Finals, they came up two wins short for a third consecutive Stanley Cup title by losing the series in game 6 against the Colorado Avalanche on June 26.

====Early playoff exits and Stamkos departure (2022–present)====
In the 2022–23 season, the Lightning finished in third place in the Atlantic Division and sixth in the Eastern Conference, and once again played the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round of the 2023 playoffs. However, this time, the Maple Leafs would avenge their loss the previous year and eliminated the Lightning 4–2. After a 7–3 game one win, Tampa lost 7–2 in game two. The Lightning then became the first team in Stanley Cup playoffs history to lose three overtime games at home, including a 2–1 loss in the deciding game six. It was the first time since 2019, the Lightning failed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.

In the 2023–24 season, the Lightning finished in fourth place in the Atlantic Division and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the 2024 playoffs as the first wild card, but were eliminated by their in–state rivals and eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Florida Panthers, in five games in the first round.

In the 2024 off-season, longtime captain Steven Stamkos signed with the Nashville Predators on the first day of free agency after Stamkos and the team were unable to come up with a contract extension agreement prior to start of free agency. They would subsequently name Victor Hedman as the next captain.

==Team colors and mascot==
Since 2010, the Lightning colors have been blue, black and white. Their logo has been a stylized lightning bolt. This is the origin of one nickname for the team—the &quot;Bolts&quot;.

===Logo and jerseys===

The original Lightning jerseys featured simple stripes on the sleeves and tail, and contrasting shoulders—black shoulders over a white jersey, and white shoulders over the black—with the alternate logo (a lightning bolt over the outline of the state of Florida). The underarm gussets included a feature referred to as &quot;victory stripes&quot;—a group of thin stripes, alternating in the team&#x27;s colors (black-silver-blue on white, or white-blue-silver on black). For the 1996–97 season, the Lightning added a third jersey, primarily blue with a sublimated wave and rain design on the front and back, lightning bolts down the sleeves, a silver-gray shoulder yoke, and black gussets. The third jersey was retired after the 1998–99 season.

In their first two seasons, the Lightning used a stylized block font for player names, with gaps in the upper loops of letters such as A, B, D, and R. The numbers were standard block numbers with drop shadows. The fonts were vertical in 1992–93, and italicized in 1993–94. The following season, the name font changed to a block font, vertically arched, while the number font changed to a painted style resembling the letters &quot;Tampa Bay&quot; in the logo. This style was also used on the blue alternate in 1998–99, replacing an &quot;electrified&quot; number font used from 1996 to 1998. In 2001–02, the old fonts were replaced with traditional block letters and numbers, which have been used ever since. They also darkened their shades of blue that season from a royal blue to a speed (Indy) blue.

As with all NHL teams for the 2007–08 season, the Lightning debuted in new Reebok &quot;Rbk Edge&quot; jerseys. Also, like several other NHL teams, the Lightning updated their team logo.

The Lightning unveiled their new logo on August 25, 2007. The logo was similar to the inaugural one, but with a more modern look. The new logo also kept the same theme as the previous one, but with the words &quot;Tampa Bay&quot; across the top now appearing with tall capital initials, and the word &quot;Lightning&quot; no longer appearing on the bottom of the logo.
The Edge jerseys use the same template adopted by the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins. Unlike those teams, the Lightning&#x27;s elbow panels remain the base color of the jersey, and an additional blue panel is added near the cuff of the sleeve. The Edge uniforms retain the underarm gusset &quot;victory stripes&quot; of their predecessors.

The Lightning then debuted a new &quot;alternate&quot; or &quot;third&quot; jersey in the 2008–09 season. The jersey features a dominant &quot;electric blue&quot; color, with black and silver accents at the end of the sleeves. The logo is removed, and in its place emblazoned across the front of the jersey descending to the lower left of the jersey is the word &quot;BOLTS&quot; (utilizing a layout similar to that of the Ottawa Senators&#x27; third jersey). The numbers are featured on the back and sleeves only, using white lettering.

It was reported on January 23, 2011, that the Lightning had filed paperwork with the NHL to change their logo and colors, beginning with the 2011–12 season. The new logo, as well as the new home and away jerseys, were unveiled by the team at a press conference at the St. Pete Times Forum on January 31, 2011. The Lightning began to integrate the new logo onto center ice, and even distributed free T-shirts with the simplified logo on February 4, 2011, while still using the old Lightning logo and uniforms.

The current uniforms are made in a traditional hockey sweater design. Initially, the colors that were to be used were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was later added as a trim color on the numbers. The victory stripes were also eliminated. Despite the introduction of the new uniforms, the previous third jersey was retained, with the new simplified logo replacing the old logo in the shoulders prior to the 2012–13 season.

For the 2014–15 season, the Lightning announced that a new black third sweater will replace the existing &quot;BOLTS&quot; sweaters. The new sweaters were unveiled on September 27, 2014. It retained the &quot;BOLTS&quot; wordmark, while adding white accents in a similar manner as the Los Angeles Kings&#x27; sweaters. The secondary roundel logo also replaced the primary logo on the sleeves, while the metro name was enscripted on the collar.

The Lightning made some minor tweaks to their current uniform set following the NHL&#x27;s move to Adidas as its uniform provider in the 2017–18 season. The most notable change is the removal of the &quot;TAMPA BAY&quot; wordmark on the white away sweaters.

A third sweater was not used during all of 2017–18 and much of the 2018–19 season. On February 7, 2019, the Lightning unveiled a new black uniform, lacking any blue and white elements and featuring sublimated black and grey patterns on the sleeves, socks and back numbers.

For the 2020–21 season, the Lightning released a &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform, using the design they wore from 2001 to 2007. Unlike the originals, blue served as the base color while black was relegated to trim color. Their 2022–23 &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform used the design of the third jersey from 1996 to 1999, but with a white base.

For the 2022 NHL Stadium Series, the Lightning unveiled a white uniform with a stylized blue stripe shaped like a thunderbolt at the bottom. An updated rendition of the &quot;BOLTS&quot; wordmark was stitched in front, and numbers featured pointed accents.

In the 2023–24 season, the Lightning unveiled a new black alternate uniform, putting the roundel logo as the main crest and bringing back the &quot;victory stripes&quot; on the sleeves. The white numbers with black trim and blue drop shadows were heavily inspired by the team&#x27;s first uniforms.

===In-game personalities===
Greg Wolf has been the Lightning&#x27;s in-game host since the 2006–07 season.

Retired United States Air Force Technical Sergeant Sonya Bryson-Kirksey sings the Canadian and American national anthems at most home games. She started singing the US national anthem for the team in 2013, and the Canadian anthem in 2020 and is accompanied by organist, Krystof Srebrakowski.

===ThunderBug===
The Lightning mascot is a lightning bug named ThunderBug, who performs at games and makes appearances in the community.

===Lightning Girls===
Until the 2019–20 season, an official dance team known as the Lightning Girls performed at all home games and community events. The Tampa Bay Lightning Girls were a group of dancers who performed in the stands.

==Radio and television==
The Lightning&#x27;s flagship radio outlet is WHPT, which replaced WFLA as of the 2022–23 NHL season. Dave Mishkin serves as play-by-play announcer, joined by Phil Esposito as color commentator for home games. Greg Lenelli is the pregame and intermission host. The Lightning television broadcasts can be seen on Bally Sports Sun. From 1995 to 2020, the television play-by-play announcer was Rick Peckham. He announced that he would be retiring following the 2019–20 season. His final game for the Lightning was game five of their first round series during the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, in which the Lightning won in overtime to win the series. Dave Randorf was named as his replacement prior to the 2020–21 season. The color commentator is Brian Engblom. The studio host is Paul Kennedy. Caley Chelios, daughter of Hall of Fame defenseman Chris Chelios, was the in-arena host and Lightning reporter for 5 seasons. Former Lightning player Dave Andreychuk and former color commentator Bobby &quot;The Chief&quot; Taylor assist with the television pregame and postgame broadcasts.

On December 10, 2014, long-time color commentator Bobby &quot;The Chief&quot; Taylor announced he would be retiring from the broadcast booth at the end of the 2014–15 season. Taylor had served as the team&#x27;s color commentator since the 1993–94 season, which was the team&#x27;s second year of existence. Taylor cited that he desired to be home with his wife Jan more. Taylor said, &quot;The road was starting to get a little stale,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve been traveling since I was 15, and that&#x27;s a long time.&quot; However, Taylor announced that he was not completely stepping away from the team broadcasts. He has continued to serve as a studio analyst during the games on Fox Sports Sun for both home and away games.

On August 11, 2015, Fox Sports Sun, the regional television home of the Lightning, announced Brian Engblom as Taylor&#x27;s replacement on color commentary for the 2015–16 season.

<text>The Washington Capitals (colloquially known as the Caps) are a professional ice hockey team based in Washington, D.C. The Capitals compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team is owned by Ted Leonsis through Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, and initially played its home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, before moving to the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., in 1997.

The franchise was founded in 1974 as an expansion team, alongside the Kansas City Scouts, and struggled throughout its first eight years of existence. In 1982, David Poile was hired as general manager, helping to turn the team&#x27;s fortunes around. With a core of players such as Mike Gartner, Rod Langway, Larry Murphy, and Scott Stevens, they became a regular playoff contender for the next fourteen seasons. After purchasing the team in 1999, Leonsis revitalized the franchise by drafting star players such as Alexander Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom, John Carlson, Braden Holtby, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Tom Wilson. In the 2009–10 season, the Capitals won the franchise&#x27;s first Presidents&#x27; Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. They won it a second time in 2015–16, and for a third time the following season in 2016–17. In addition to 13 division titles and three Presidents&#x27; Trophies, the Capitals have reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1998 and 2018, winning the latter in five games against the Vegas Golden Knights.

The Capitals have retired the use of four numbers in honor of four players. In addition, the team holds an association with a number of individuals inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Capitals are affiliated with two minor league teams: the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League and the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL.

==History==

===Early years (1974–1982)===
The NHL awarded an expansion franchise to the city of Washington on June 8, 1972, and the Capitals joined the NHL as an expansion team for the 1974–75 season along with the Kansas City Scouts. The Capitals were owned by Abe Pollin (also owner of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Washington Bullets/Wizards). Pollin had built the Capital Centre in suburban Landover, Maryland, to house both the Bullets (who formerly played in Baltimore) and the Capitals. His first act as owner was to hire Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt as general manager.

With a combined 30 teams between the NHL and the World Hockey Association (WHA), the available talent was stretched thin. The Capitals had few players with professional experience and were at a disadvantage against the long-standing teams that were stocked with veteran players.
The Capitals&#x27; inaugural season was dreadful, even by expansion standards. They finished with the worst record in the league at 8–67–5; their 21 points were half that of their expansion brethren, the Scouts. The eight wins are the fewest for an NHL team playing at least 70 games, and the .131 winning percentage is still the worst in NHL history. They also set records for most road losses (39 out of 40), most consecutive road losses (37), and most consecutive losses (17). Head coach Jim Anderson said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather find out my wife was cheating on me than keep losing like this. At least I could tell my wife to cut it out.&quot; Schmidt himself had to take over the coaching reins late in the season.

In 1975–76, Washington went 25 straight games without a win and allowed 394 goals en route to another horrendous record: 11–59–10 (32 points). In the middle of the season, Schmidt was replaced as general manager by Max McNab and as head coach by Tom McVie. For the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s, the Capitals alternated between dreadful seasons and finishing only a few points out of the Stanley Cup playoffs; in 1980 and 1981, for instance, they were in playoff contention until the last day of the season. The one bright spot during these years of futility was that many of McNab&#x27;s draft picks (e.g., Rick Green, Ryan Walter, Mike Gartner, Bengt Gustafsson, Gaetan Duchesne, and Bobby Carpenter) would impact the team for years to come, either as important members of the roster or as crucial pieces in major trades.

Pollin stuck it out through the Capitals&#x27; first decade, even though they were usually barely competitive. This stood in contrast to the Scouts; they were forced to move to Denver after only two years because their original owners did not have the resources or patience to withstand the struggles of an expansion team. By the summer of 1982, however, there was serious talk of the team moving out of the U.S. capital, and a &quot;Save the Caps&quot; campaign was underway.

===Gartner–Langway era (1982–1993)===

In August 1982, the team hired David Poile as general manager. As his first move, Poile pulled off one of the largest trades in franchise history on September 9, 1982, when he dealt longtime regulars Ryan Walter and Rick Green to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Rod Langway (named captain only a few weeks later), Brian Engblom, Doug Jarvis and Craig Laughlin. This move turned the franchise around, as Langway&#x27;s solid defense helped the team to dramatically reduce its goals-against, and the explosive goal-scoring of Dennis Maruk, Mike Gartner and Bobby Carpenter fueled the offensive attack. Another significant move was the drafting of defenseman Scott Stevens during the 1982 NHL entry draft (the pick was made by interim general manager Roger Crozier, prior to Poile&#x27;s hiring). The result was a 29-point jump, a third-place finish in the powerful Patrick Division, which had teams such as the high-powered New York Islanders, Philadelphia Flyers, and New York Rangers. Another result was the team&#x27;s first playoff appearance in 1983. Although they were eliminated by the three-time defending (and eventual) Stanley Cup champion Islanders three games to one, the Caps&#x27; dramatic turnaround ended any talk of the club leaving Washington.

====Fourteen consecutive playoff appearances (1983–1996)====
The Capitals would make the playoffs for each of the next 14 years in a row, becoming known for starting slow before catching fire in January and February. However, regular season success did not carry into the playoffs. Despite a continuous march of stars like Gartner, Carpenter, Langway, Gustafsson, Stevens, Mike Ridley, Dave Christian, Dino Ciccarelli, Larry Murphy, and Kevin Hatcher, Washington was knocked out in either the first or second round seven years in a row. In 1985–86, for instance, the Caps finished with 107 points and won 50 games for the first time in franchise history, good enough for the third-best record in the NHL. They defeated the Islanders in the first round but were eliminated in the second round by the New York Rangers.
The 1986–87 season brought even more heartbreak, with a loss to the Islanders in the division semifinals. This series was capped off by the classic Easter Epic game, which ended at 1:56 am on Easter Sunday 1987. The Capitals had thoroughly dominated most of the game, outshooting the Islanders 75–52, but lost in overtime when goaltender Bob Mason was beaten on a Pat LaFontaine shot from the blue line. For the 1989 playoffs push, Gartner and Murphy were traded to the Minnesota North Stars in exchange for Ciccarelli and defenseman Bob Rouse. However, the goaltending once again faltered and they were eliminated in the first round by the Philadelphia Flyers. The Capitals finally made the conference finals in 1990, but went down in a four-game sweep at the hands of the first-place Boston Bruins.

===Bondra–Gonchar era (1993–2005)===
From 1990–91 to 1995–96, the Capitals would lose in either the first or the second round of the playoffs. They would eliminate the Rangers in the first round but lost the second round to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991. In 1991–92 and 1992–93, they would lose in the first round to the Penguins and the Islanders, respectively. In 1993–94, they won their first-round series against the Penguins but lost in the second round to the Rangers. In 1994–95 and 1995–96, they lost in the first round both times to the Penguins. They would miss the playoffs in 1996–97.

====First Stanley Cup Finals appearance (1998)====

In 1997–98, as the Caps opened MCI Center, Peter Bondra&#x27;s 52 goals led the team, veterans Dale Hunter, Joe Juneau and Adam Oates returned to old form, and Olaf Kolzig had a solid .920 save percentage as the Caps got past the Boston Bruins, Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres (the latter on a dramatic overtime win in game 6 on a goal by Joe Juneau) en route to the team&#x27;s first Stanley Cup Finals appearance. The Capitals won six overtime games, three in each of their series against the Bruins and Sabres. However, the team was outmatched by the defending champions, the Detroit Red Wings, who won in a four-game sweep. That same season, Oates, Phil Housley and Hunter all scored their 1,000th career point, the only time in NHL history that one team had three players reach that same milestone in a single season. This series is also famous for Esa Tikkanen&#x27;s missed open net goal in game 2.

====Disappointments and rebuilding (1998–2004)====
After their 1998 Stanley Cup run, the Capitals finished the 1998–99 season with a record of 31–45–6 and failed to qualify for the playoffs. During the season, the team was sold to a group headed by America Online (AOL) executive Ted Leonsis. The Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, yet both years lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Penguins. After the 2000–01 season, Adam Oates demanded a trade but management refused and stripped him of his team captaincy.

In the summer of 2001, the Capitals landed five-time Art Ross Trophy winner Jaromir Jagr, by trading three young prospects to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Jagr was signed to the largest contract ever in NHL history – $77 million over seven years at an average salary of $11 million per year (over $134,000 per game) with an option for an eighth year. However, after Adam Oates was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in 2002 despite a winning record. Still, the 2001–02 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing in 710,990 fans and 17,341 per game.

Before the 2002–03 season, the Caps made more roster changes, including the signing of highly regarded Robert Lang as a free agent, a linemate of Jagr&#x27;s from Pittsburgh. Washington returned to the playoffs in 2003, but disappointed fans again by losing in six games to the Tampa Bay Lightning after starting off with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven first-round series. The series is well-remembered for the three–overtime game 6 at the then-MCI Center. At the time it was the longest game in the building&#x27;s history and was eventually decided by a power-play goal by Tampa Bay.
In the 2003–04 season, the Caps unloaded much of their high-priced talent – not just a cost-cutting spree, but also an acknowledgment that their attempt to build a contender with high-priced veteran talent had failed. Jagr had never lived up to expectations during his time with the Capitals, failing to finish among the league&#x27;s top scorers or make the postseason All-Star team. The Caps tried to trade Jagr, but as only one year was left on the existing NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) before it expired, few teams were willing to risk $11 million on an underperforming player. In 2004, Jagr was finally sent to the New York Rangers in exchange for Anson Carter and an agreement that Washington would pay approximately $4 million per year of Jagr&#x27;s salary, with Jagr himself agreeing to defer (with interest) $1 million per year for the remainder of his contract to allow the trade to go ahead. This was quickly followed by Peter Bondra departing for the Ottawa Senators. Not long after, Robert Lang was sent to the Detroit Red Wings, as well as Sergei Gonchar to the Boston Bruins. The Lang trade marked the first time in the history of the NHL that the league&#x27;s leading scorer was traded in the middle of the season. The Capitals ended the year 23–46–10–3, tied for the second-worst record, along with the Chicago Blackhawks.

In the 2004 NHL entry draft, the Capitals won the draft lottery, moving ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who held the NHL&#x27;s worst record, and selected Alexander Ovechkin first overall. During the NHL labor dispute of 2004–05, which cost the NHL its entire season, Ovechkin stayed in Russia, playing for Dynamo Moscow. Several other Capitals played part or all of the lost season in Europe, including Olaf Kolzig, Brendan Witt, Jeff Halpern, and Alexander Semin. The Capitals&#x27; 2005 off-season consisted of making D.C.-area native Halpern the team&#x27;s captain, signing Andrew Cassels, Ben Clymer, Mathieu Biron and Jamie Heward, and acquiring Chris Clark and Jeff Friesen via trade.

===Ovechkin–Backstrom era (2005–present)===

====Building a contender (2005–2007)====

The Capitals finished the 2005–06 season in the cellar of the Southeast Division again, with a 29–41–12 campaign, earning 12 more points than the 2003–04 season, good for 27th out of the 30 NHL teams. The team, however, played close in every game, playing in 42 one-goal games, although losing two-thirds of those games. Ovechkin&#x27;s rookie season exceeded the hype, as he led all 2005–06 NHL rookies in goals, points, power-play goals and shots. He finished third overall in the NHL in scoring and tied for third in goals, and his 425 shots not only led the league, but also set an NHL rookie record and was the fourth-highest total in NHL history. Ovechkin&#x27;s rookie point total was the second-best in Capitals history, and his goal total was tied for third in franchise history. Ovechkin won the Calder Memorial Trophy, beating out Pittsburgh center Sidney Crosby and Calgary Flames defenseman Dion Phaneuf.

Many longtime Capitals had career years, with Dainius Zubrus netting 57 points, Halpern having a career-best 33 assists, Matt Pettinger putting in a career-best 20-goal, 38-point effort and seven others on the relatively young team topping 20 points for the first time. Two notable landmarks were also hit by Capitals, as the team&#x27;s longest-tenured player, Olaf Kolzig, won his 250th game in goal, and Andrew Cassels became the 204th player to play 1,000 games, although he did not finish his season with Washington. A notable first was that Washington area native Jeff Halpern was named captain of his hometown Capitals. At the 2006 NHL trade deadline, on March 8, Brendan Witt was traded to the Nashville Predators.
In the 2006 off-season, Halpern left the Capitals to join the Dallas Stars; Chris Clark subsequently became the Capitals&#x27; new captain. Richard Zednik returned to the Capitals in 2006–07 after a disappointing 16-goal, 14-assist season in 2005–06 with the Montreal Canadiens, but was later dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Islanders after a disappointing and injury-plagued season. The Caps also signed former Philadelphia Flyers enforcer Donald Brashear. Despite the transactions, however, the Capitals finished with the same point total (70) in 2006–07 as they did the year before, although they won one fewer game. Ovechkin was the Capitals&#x27; lone representative in the season&#x27;s All-Star Game, with Washington&#x27;s campaign also seeing the breakout of Alexander Semin, who notched 38 goals in only his second NHL season.

====Return to playoffs and first Presidents&#x27; Trophy (2007–2015)====
The Capitals signed Swedish phenom Nicklas Backstrom, the fourth overall pick in the 2006 NHL entry draft, to a three-year entry-level contract. They also signed 19-year-old Semyon Varlamov to a three-year entry-level contract. They then went on to fill needs at defense, signing puck-moving defenseman Tom Poti; right wing, by signing Viktor Kozlov; and center, by signing playmaker Michael Nylander. As a result of these signings, there was much more hope for the 2007–08 season and players were looking towards the playoffs.

After starting the season 6–14–1, the Capitals fired head coach Glen Hanlon and replaced him with Hershey Bears head coach Bruce Boudreau on Thanksgiving Day 2007. On January 10, 2008, the Capitals signed Ovechkin to an NHL-record $124 million contract extension at 13 years, the second-longest term of any contract in the NHL after New York Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro&#x27;s 15-year contract. Despite the Capitals&#x27; young defense and injuries to key players such as Michael Nylander and Brian Pothier, Boudreau engineered a historic turnaround. Aided by key acquisitions at the trade deadline (Matt Cooke, Sergei Fedorov and Cristobal Huet), Ovechkin&#x27;s NHL-leading 65 goals, and Mike Green&#x27;s league defensemen-leading 18 goals, the Capitals won the Southeast Division title for the first time since the 2000–01 season, edging out the Carolina Hurricanes for the division title on the final game of the season. Washington&#x27;s remarkable end-of-season run included winning 11 of the final 12 regular season games. The Capitals became the first team in NHL history to make the playoffs after being ranked 14th or lower in their conference standings at the season&#x27;s midpoint. For the postseason, the Capitals drew the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round and managed to force a game 7 after being down three games to one in the series. However, they ultimately lost to the Flyers 3–2 in overtime. After the season concluded, Boudreau&#x27;s efforts were rewarded with a long-term contract extension.
The accolades for the team continued to grow after the end of the season. Ovechkin won the Art Ross Trophy, the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Lester B. Pearson Award, becoming the first player in NHL history to win all four awards in the same season. He also was the first player to win an MVP award in any major sport in the Washington, D.C., area since Joe Theismann won the National Football League (NFL) MVP award in 1983. Moreover, Ovechkin was also named an NHL First Team All-Star and became the first player since 1953 to be named as such in each of his first three years in the NHL. Nicklas Backstrom was a finalist for the Calder Trophy, but ended up second to the Chicago Blackhawks&#x27; Patrick Kane, though Backstrom was nonetheless selected to the All-Star Rookie Team. In addition to player awards, head coach Bruce Boudreau won the Jack Adams Award for the NHL&#x27;s coach of the year. Ovechkin and Mike Green were named to the &quot;Sporting News&quot; All-Star team, with Ovechkin being the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year.

The 2008–09 season was highlighted by the play of Mike Green (who was the third of the Capitals&#x27; three first-round selections in Ovechkin&#x27;s draft year) and Ovechkin. Green led all NHL defensemen in goals and points, also setting the record for the longest consecutive goal-scoring streak by a defenseman with eight games. Ovechkin won his second Hart Trophy, his second Lester B. Pearson Award and his second Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy. The Capitals finished the regular season with a record of 50–24–8 and a team-record 108 points, and they won their second consecutive Southeast Division title. They then defeated the New York Rangers in the first round of the 2009 playoffs four games to three, overcoming a 3–1 deficit. The Capitals were then defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins, in the conference semifinals in seven games.
The Capitals finished the 2009–10 season first in the NHL with 121 points, thereby winning the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. Ovechkin led the team in points with 109 and finished as the third-highest goal scorer, despite playing nine games fewer than the league leaders. Backstrom finished with 101 points, fourth-most in the NHL. Once again, Mike Green led all defensemen in points, finishing with 76. The Capitals also dominated the plus-minus category, finishing with five players in the top six in the league. Despite having a top-ranked regular season, Washington were defeated by the eighth-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs after being up 3–1 in the series.

The 2010–11 season saw the Capitals repeat as the Southeast Division champions and as the top team in the Eastern Conference with 107 points. The season was highlighted by their participation in the 2011 Winter Classic, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3–1 at Heinz Field. However, the Capitals&#x27; playoff disappointment continued. After again defeating the New York Rangers in five games in the first round, they were swept by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the conference semifinals.

The Capitals started the 2011–12 season with a record of 7–0, but they only won five of their next 15 games. As a result, general manager George McPhee fired head coach Boudreau, hiring Capitals legend Dale Hunter as his replacement. By the end of the 2011–12 season, the team&#x27;s top two goaltenders, Michal Neuvirth and Tomas Vokoun, were injured and the Capitals were required to lean on their goaltending prospect Braden Holtby to help the team into the 2012 playoffs. The Capitals made a strong push and finished with the seventh overall seed in East, drawing the defending champion Boston Bruins in the first round. The Capitals shocked the NHL by defeating the heavily favored defending Stanley Cup champion and second-seeded Boston Bruins in seven games on an overtime goal by Joel Ward. Every game in the series was decided by a one-goal margin; previously, no single series in the Stanley Cup playoffs had ever gone as far as six or seven games while neither team ever held more than a one-goal lead. The Capitals then advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded New York Rangers. The series again went seven games, ending with a 2–1 Rangers victory at Madison Square Garden. Following the season&#x27;s end, head coach Dale Hunter announced he would step down. Adam Oates was later named permanent head coach of the team.
The lockout-shortened 2012–13 season saw the Capitals off to a rocky start, as they managed just two wins in their first ten games. The team rebounded to win the Southeast Division, thereby earning the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2013 playoffs. Unfortunately for Washington, the Capitals&#x27; playoff woes continued as they again fell to the Rangers in seven games.

In the 2013–14 season, the Capitals started the season strong by winning five of their first 10 games. The Capitals struggled to stay in a playoff spot and ultimately missed the playoffs by just three points in the standings, resulting in them missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006–07. On April 26, 2014, 15 days after the regular season ended, the Capitals announced they would not renew general manager George McPhee&#x27;s contract and that they had fired head coach Adam Oates.

On May 26, 2014, the Capitals announced the promotion of Brian MacLellan from director of player personnel to general manager and the hiring of Barry Trotz as the new head coach. In Ovechkin&#x27;s 691st NHL game on November 4, 2014, he became the Capitals&#x27; all-time points leader during a game against the Calgary Flames, surpassing Peter Bondra. On January 1, 2015, the Washington Capitals defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 3–2 in the annual 2015 Winter Classic at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The Capitals finished in a second-place tie with the New York Islanders in the Metropolitan Division during the 2014–15 season and held home-ice advantage in the first-round playoff series between the two, as they had defeated the Islanders in the season series with two home wins and two road overtime losses (in comparison, the Islanders had two home wins, one road loss and one road shootout loss). The teams split the first four games of the series, with the Islanders winning the first and third games, and the Capitals winning the second and fourth games. After winning game 5, the Capitals had a chance to clinch the series in Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, but the Islanders won game 6 to send the series to a deciding game 7 in Washington, which the Capitals would go on to win and defeat the Islanders, setting up a match-up against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Rangers in the second round for the third time in four years.
In the second round, all seven games were decided by a one-goal margin. The Capitals and the Rangers split the first two games (with Joel Ward scoring a game-winning buzzer beater goal for Washington in game 1, coupled with a loss by Washington in game 2) by a 2–1 margin. Braden Holtby would then post a 1–0 shutout in game 3, with Jay Beagle scoring the game&#x27;s only goal, which was then followed by another 2–1 victory in game 4. After Washington held a 3–1 series lead, the Rangers would then cut the series lead to 3–2 after scoring the game-tying goal and the game-winning overtime goal in game 5. The Rangers then tied the series with a 4–3 victory in game 6 to force a game 7 at Madison Square Garden. Both teams scored a goal during regulation time in game 7, but the Capitals would lose the game and the series in overtime via a Derek Stepan goal.

====Back-to-back Presidents&#x27; Trophies and first Stanley Cup championship (2015–2018)====
In the 2015–16 season, the Capitals finished in first place in the league with a record of 56–18–8 and 120 points. In the first round of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, they would face the Philadelphia Flyers. The Capitals won the first three games of the series and were looking for their first sweep in the playoffs of a best-of-seven series in franchise history. However, the Flyers would win the next two games to send the series to a sixth game in Philadelphia; the Capitals nevertheless won that series in six games to advance to the second round of the playoffs. In the second round, they faced the Pittsburgh Penguins for the first time since 2009. After winning the first game of the series in Washington, the Capitals lost three straight games, and were in danger of elimination. Washington would stave off elimination with a win in game 5, but they would lose the series in six games, with the Penguins going on to win the Stanley Cup for the first time since 2009.
Ovechkin reached the 1,000-point milestone on January 11, 2017, with a goal against the Pittsburgh Penguins 35 seconds into the first period of that game. Ovechkin is the 84th NHL player to reach the 1,000-point milestone, the fourth Russian-born player and the 37th player to reach the milestone while playing for one team throughout their NHL career. The Capitals won their second Presidents&#x27; Trophy in a row, becoming just the seventh team in NHL history and the first time since the Vancouver Canucks in 2010–11 and 2011–12 to win back-to-back Presidents&#x27; Trophies. Ovechkin finished the 2016–17 season with 33 goals, leading the Capitals in goals for the twelfth straight season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Capitals defeated the eighth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs in six games in the first round to set up a second consecutive showdown with the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round. After falling behind 3–1 in the series, they battled back to force a game 7 at home, where they were eliminated 2–0, and lost their series 4–3.

After the 2017 playoffs, the Capitals were unable to retain a number of players, losing Kevin Shattenkirk, Karl Alzner, Justin Williams, and Daniel Winnik to free agency, and budding young defenseman Nate Schmidt to the 2017 NHL expansion draft. In addition, to get under the cap, the Capitals shipped Marcus Johansson to the New Jersey Devils.
Despite a slow 5–6–1 start, which extended out to 10–9–1, the Capitals caught fire in December, going 10–2–2, and were able to clinch the Metropolitan Division for a third straight year on April 1. They qualified for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs for the 10th time in 11 years with their third straight division title and a second seed finish in the Eastern Conference.

In the 2018 playoffs, the Capitals were able to battle back from a 2–0 series deficit against the seventh-seeded Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round of the playoffs, winning four straight and beating the Blue Jackets in six games. They faced the Penguins again in the second round, and this time, on May 7, 2018, they were able to beat the Penguins in the second round with an overtime goal on the road in game 6 by Evgeny Kuznetsov. It marked the first time in 20 seasons that the Capitals made the conference finals and the first time in 24 seasons that they had defeated the Penguins in playoff series. The Capitals advanced to the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals on May 23, after beating the top-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games after a 4–0 rout at Amalie Arena in Tampa. They then faced the expansion Vegas Golden Knights and overcame them in five games, including a 4–3 win in the decisive game 5 at T-Mobile Arena after Lars Eller scored with about seven minutes to go. Not only was it the Capitals&#x27; first Stanley Cup win, but it was also the first championship for a Washington, D.C. team in one of the four major North American sports leagues since the Washington Redskins defeated the Buffalo Bills 26 years beforehand in Super Bowl XXVI. Shortly after the Stanley Cup Finals, Barry Trotz resigned as the head coach of the Capitals, after negotiations for a contract extension fell through. Todd Reirden was named as Trotz&#x27;s replacement on June 29.

====Playoff struggles (2018–present)====
During the 2018–19 season, the Capitals clinched their fourth straight Metropolitan Division title and with that accomplishment, Washington became only the second organization in NHL history to win four consecutive division titles twice in their history (Boston Bruins from 1927–28 to 1930–31 and again from 1975–76 to 1978–79). The Capitals&#x27; previous streak was from the 2007–08 season to the 2010–11 season in the now-defunct Southeast Division. Despite having a nearly identical roster to the Stanley Cup season the season prior, in the 2019 playoffs, the Capitals efforts to repeat as champions ultimately fell short, as they were eliminated in the first round by the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games having lost game 7 at home in double overtime 4–3.

In the 2019–20 season, the Capitals clinched another division title, but lost to the New York Islanders in the first round of the 2020 playoffs.

The next season saw the Capitals finish second in the division, ultimately losing to the Boston Bruins in five games of the first round of the 2021 playoffs.

Following their third straight first round exit since their Stanley Cup win, the Capitals started the following season strong, holding first place through the Christmas break. However, they ended up falling to fourth place in the division, which was good enough for the second wild card, and was matched against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Florida Panthers in the first round of the 2022 playoffs, falling to them in six games.

The 2022–23 season saw the Capitals miss the playoffs for the first time since 2014. Following the season, the team and head coach Peter Laviolette agreed to mutually part ways. The Capitals hired 41-year-old Spencer Carbery to be their new head coach on May 30, 2023.

In December 2023, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment founder and team owner Ted Leonsis engaged in a non-binding partnership with Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin to move the Capitals and Washington Wizards to a planned arena in Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia, by 2028. The structure would be part of an arts and entertainment district at the site, which would include a practice facility, restaurants, an esports venue, concert hall, and a new headquarters for Monumental. In March 2024, after officials in Alexandria announced that the $2 billion entertainment and sports complex plans were scrapped, Washington mayor Muriel Bowser announced she has signed a deal with both teams&#x27; majority owner, Ted Leonsis, to keep the Capitals and Wizards in the District &quot;at least until 2050.&quot; The Capitals clinched the 2024 playoffs by beating the Philadelphia Flyers on April 16, finishing with a 40–31–11 record and the second wild card spot. They were swept by the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning New York Rangers in the first round.

On July 8, 2024, the Capitals announced that Chris Patrick would be promoted to general manager, with MacLellan retaining his position as president of hockey operations.

==Team information==

===Logos and jerseys===

The Capitals took to the ice in red, white and blue jerseys featuring contrast-colored shoulders and stars on the chest and sleeves based on the flag of the United States. The team originally had red, white, and blue pants options, but retired the white pants only after a few games in their first season, and the red ones at season&#x27;s end. The blue pants would eventually become the only option used. The original logo crest underwent a few modifications throughout the jersey&#x27;s history.

Prior to the start of the 1995–96 season, in an attempt to modernize the look and improve merchandise sales, the team abandoned its traditional red, white and blue color scheme in favor of a blue, black, and copper palette with an American bald eagle with five stars as its logo. The alternate logo depicted the Capitol building with crossed hockey sticks behind. For the 1997–98 season, the team unveiled a black alternate jersey, devoid of blue with copper stripes on the ends of sleeves and at the waist. The crest on the white and blue jerseys were the bald eagle logo, while the crest on the black jersey was the Capitol logo. Initially, the team name was placed along the bottom black stripe, but was removed on the white jersey in 1997, while it remained on the blue jersey until its retirement. Prior to the 2000–01 season, the team retired its blue road jersey in favor of the black alternate jersey, but still kept the white jersey for home games.
The Capitals unveiled new uniforms on June 22, 2007, which coincided with the 2007 NHL entry draft and the new league-wide adaptation of the Reebok-designed uniform system for 2007–08. The change marked a return to the red, white and blue color scheme originally used from 1974 to 1995. The new primary logo is reminiscent of the original Capitals&#x27; logo, complete with a hockey stick formed by the letter &quot;t&quot;; it also includes a new feature not present in the original logo in the form of three stars representing DC, Maryland and Virginia. More simply, the stars are a reference to the flag of Washington, D.C., which is in turn based on the shield of George Washington&#x27;s family coat of arms. The new alternate logo uses an eagle in the shape of a &quot;W&quot; with the silhouette of the Washington Monument and the United States Capitol building in the negative space within and below.

For the 2011 Winter Classic, the Capitals wore a white jersey honoring the franchise&#x27;s past with the original logo. The jersey resembled the one the franchise wore from 1974 to 1995. Instead of wearing the combination of blue pants and white helmets the team used when it played at the Capital Centre, the Capitals chose red pants and helmets for the New Year&#x27;s Day game. The Capitals wore the same jersey, minus the NHL Winter Classic patch, on February 1, 2011, to honor Hockey Hall of Fame winger Dino Ciccarelli.

The Capitals announced on September 16, 2011, that they would wear a third jersey modeled after the Winter Classic jersey for 16 road games during the 2011–12 season.
For the 2015 Winter Classic, which took place on New Year&#x27;s Day at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., the Capitals wore a newly designed jersey intended to pay homage to hockey&#x27;s outdoor roots. The primary color of the jersey was a vintage deep red. The addition of stripes on the shoulders, waist and legs brought in elements of Washington&#x27;s professional hockey jerseys from the 1930s, predating the Capitals franchise&#x27;s formation in the 1970s. A large &quot;W&quot; on the front of the jersey, topped with the common three stars, offset in blue to contrast the white &quot;Capitals&quot; wordmark.

Starting with the 2015–16 season, the Capitals wore their throwback red third jerseys, replacing the white Winter Classic thirds.

Prior to the 2017–18 season, the NHL announced a new partnership with Adidas, and the Capitals unveiled new uniforms with minor changes. There were no third jerseys during that season, but the return of the program in the 2018–19 season saw the return of the Capitals&#x27; red throwback uniforms as their alternates.

For the 2018 Stadium Series, the Capitals used newly designed navy uniforms, honoring the fact that the game was held at the U.S. Naval Academy. The chest logo was based on the regular stylized &quot;Capitals&quot; logo, but shortened to &quot;Caps&quot;, the nickname commonly used for the team. There were also features honoring various aspects of D.C., as well as the presence of a slightly altered W logo from the 2015 Winter Classic on the pants.

In 2021, as part of Adidas&#x27; &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform series, the Capital unveiled a recolored version of their blue &quot;screaming eagle&quot; uniform used from 1995 to 2000. The base color is red with dark blue accents. The Capitals also replaced their throwback red alternates with a dark blue third jersey; this design featured three red stars and a uniquely-designed white &quot;W&quot; with the Washington Monument triangle in the middle. The uniform also features white/red/white stripes on the waist and sleeves and a white shoulder yoke.

In 2022, a second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniform was released, this time featuring a black version of the &quot;screaming eagle&quot; uniform with blue and copper accents. This uniform was restored as the team&#x27;s alternate ahead of the 2024–25 season, updated to the Fanatics template.

For the 2023 Stadium Series, the Capitals unveiled a white uniform centered around the alternate &quot;Weagle&quot; logo, with its navy wings extending towards the sleeves with white numbers.

===Practice facility===

The team practiced for many years at a rink at Piney Orchard, Maryland, when they played at the Capital Centre in Landover. They continued to practice at that rink for several years after moving to Capital One Arena in downtown Washington. However, following his purchase of the team in 1999, Ted Leonsis made plans to open a new practice facility. In 2006, the new facility opened on top of a renovated parking garage and entertainment center, known as the Ballston Quarter, in the Ballston neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia. The practice facility is known as the MedStar Capitals Iceplex.

===Mascot===

Since 1995, the Capitals&#x27; mascot has been Slapshot, a bald eagle that wears the number 00. Slapshot is seen before games driving his car on the ice and waving flags to excite the fans. He is also a common fixture in the community and attends Capitals functions and community activities.

====Hall of Fame honorees====
The Washington Capitals hold an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame, including eight inductees from the players category and one from the builders category, five of whom have played at least five seasons with the club (Gartner, Oates, Stevens, Langway, and Murphy). Sergei Fedorov and Phil Housley were the most recently inducted Capitals players to the Hall of Fame in 2015.

In addition to players, members of the local sports media have been honored by the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2007, Dave Fay, a sports journalist for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, was a recipient of the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award. In 2010, play-by-play radio broadcaster Ron Weber was awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hall of Fame for his contributions to hockey broadcasting.

==Broadcasters==
Monumental Sports Network (MSN) has carried Capitals games locally since its founding as Home Team Sports (HTS) in 1984. The channel was later rebranded into Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic (CSN) from 2001 through 2017, and then NBC Sports Washington from 2017 to 2023. MSN&#x27;s commentators are Joe Beninati, Craig Laughlin, &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Alan May, and rinkside reporter Al Koken.

The Capitals&#x27; flagship radio station is WJFK-FM (106.7 FM); commentators are John Walton and Ken Sabourin. The team&#x27;s radio network consists of stations in Washington, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.

Mike Vogel has been covering the team online for the Washington Capitals on its website since the 1995–96 season, writing daily game stories and analysis. Vogel, who also participates in podcasts and in-stadium video presentations as well as guesting on various Washington DC radio and television programs, has been described as &quot;the most interesting man in Caps media&quot;.

===Historical===
WTOP-TV (channel 9) picked up television coverage for the Capitals&#x27; first three seasons, covering 15 road games in the 1974–75 season. Sportscaster Warner Wolf was the commentator for the first season. Team radio broadcaster Ron Weber moved to the TV booth for telecasts in the second and third seasons. WTOP-TV&#x27;s coverage was sporadic and poorly received, to the point of being called &quot;revolting&quot; by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;; game broadcasts were scheduled around network commitments and often joined live in progress or tape-delayed entirely. Station management had little interest in the games and said they received far more complaints about the preempted CBS shows. Before the 1977–78 season, the Capitals signed a five-year deal with WDCA (channel 20), which had regional cable carriage and as an independent station was able to commit to more expansive live coverage.

WDCA later split games with HTS/CSN upon its founding in 1984. The 1991–92 season illustrates a typical arrangement: WDCA showed 20 road games and any road playoff games, while HTS picked up 34 home games and any home playoff games, leaving 28 regular season games not televised. After 18 seasons on WDCA, the Capitals moved their over-the-air broadcasts to WBDC (channel 50) for the 1995–96 season. All 82 games were televised for the first time in the 2001–02 season. The Capitals have not aired any games over-the-air locally since the end of the 2005–06 season.

WTOP (1500 AM) was the Capitals&#x27; first radio home through the 1986–87 season. After nine years on WMAL (630 AM), the games returned to 1500 AM for the 1996–97 season. Ron Weber was the first announcer, and never missed a game through his retirement at the end of the 1996–97 season. WJFK-FM began airing postseason games during the 2008 playoffs. 1500 AM, since renamed WFED, remained the flagship station until 2012, when WJFK took over all coverage. WFED continues to broadcast games as a network affiliate. This is primarily to take advantage of its 50,000-watt clear-channel signal, which brings Capitals games to the entire eastern half of North America at night.

Weber rejoined current announcers Walton and Sabourin for the first period of game 4 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals.

WJFK-FM attracted controversy when it elected to drop the Capitals in the 2016–17 season, leaving the Capitals to air solely on WFED. However, WFED&#x27;s signal is unusable in some portions of the Washington suburbs at night, since it is directed north–south to protect co-channel KSTP. The Washington Wizards also took priority over the Capitals on WFED in case of a conflict, leading to some games in which the only home broadcast was available via Internet streaming. The team responded to fan complaints by reaching a temporary deal in January 2017 to place the rest of its games on WWDC-HD2, which is available metro-wide to those with HD Radios and has a low-powered analog signal that covers the city itself. The Capitals reached a deal to return to WJFK-FM for the 2017–18 season.
