<text>USS &quot;Holland&quot; (SS-1) was the United States Navy&#x27;s first submarine, although not its first underwater watercraft, which was the 1775 submersible &quot;Turtle&quot;. The boat was originally laid down as Holland VI at the Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth, New Jersey for John Philip Holland&#x27;s Holland Torpedo Boat Company, and launched on 17 May 1897. She was acquired by the USN on 11 April 1900 and commissioned on 12 October 1900, Lieutenant H. H. Caldwell commanding.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Holland&quot; was built at former Navy Lieutenant Lewis Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth, New Jersey for John Holland&#x27;s Holland Torpedo Boat Company, which became the Electric Boat company in 1899. The vessel was built under the supervision of John Philip Holland, who designed the vessel and her details. &quot;Holland&quot;″s keel was laid at Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard with both men present. The two men worked together using many of John Holland&#x27;s proven concepts and patents to make the submarine a reality, each man complementing the other&#x27;s contributions to the development of the modern submarine. John Holland was the inventor for US Patent 702,729 for the design of a submarine boat. Testing and training first took place at the Holland Torpedo Boat Station from 1899 to 1900. Important contributions were also made by Arthur L. Busch (or Du Busc), Crescent&#x27;s superintendent.

&quot;Holland VI&quot; included many features that submarines of the early 20th century would exhibit, albeit in later, more advanced forms. There was a conning tower from which the boat and her weapons could be directed. Also, she had all the necessary ballast and trim tanks to make precise changes in depth and attitude underwater. Her crew was six men and maximum diving depth was .

For armament, she had a reloadable 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tube with three Whitehead Mark 2 torpedoes and an pneumatic dynamite gun in the bow (the dynamite gun&#x27;s projectiles were called &quot;aerial torpedoes&quot;). A second dynamite gun in the stern was removed in 1900 to make room for an improved engine exhaust, prior to delivery to the Navy.

She had both an internal combustion engine (specifically, a 4-stroke Otto gasoline engine of ) for running on the surface and charging batteries, and an Electro Dynamic electric motor of for submerged operation, with one shaft. A 66-cell Exide battery powered the electric motor when submerged. This allowed speeds of surfaced and submerged. Surfaced range was at , while submerged range was at . There is significant variation in references as to the vessel&#x27;s horsepower and speed, for example, the &quot;Register of Ships of the U. S. Navy&quot; gives horsepower figures of surfaced and submerged, with surfaced and submerged.

==Service==
&quot;Holland VI&quot; eventually proved her validity and worthiness as a warship and was ultimately purchased by the U.S. government for the sum of $150,000 on 11 April 1900. She was considered to be the first truly successful craft of her type. The United States Government soon ordered more submarines from Holland&#x27;s company, which were to be known as the . These became America&#x27;s first fleet of underwater naval vessels.
&quot;Holland VI&quot; was modified after her christening, and was renamed United States Submarine Torpedo Boat &quot;Holland&quot; (Submarine-1) when she was commissioned by the US Navy on 12 October 1900, at Newport, Rhode Island, with Lieutenant Harry H. Caldwell in command.

During her commissioned life in the USN, the &quot;Holland&quot; did not carry the hull designation SS-1. The designation system currently in use was placed into Naval Regulations on 17 July 1920. Thus, the &quot;Holland&quot; would have never been assigned SS-1. She would have been designated Submarine-1 or simply S-1 under the system in place between 1895 and 1920. Most historians, including official Navy sources, have retroactively applied both the prefix USS and the designation SS-1 to avoid confusion.

&quot;Holland&quot; was the first commissioned submarine in the US Navy and is the first of the unbroken line of submarines in the Navy. She was the fourth submarine to be owned by the Navy, however. The first submarine was &quot;Propeller&quot; (also known as &quot;Alligator&quot;), the second was &quot;Intelligent Whale&quot; and the third was &quot;Plunger&quot;, an experimental submarine, built in 1895, which is not to be confused with USS &quot;Plunger&quot; (SS-2).
On 16 October 1900, in order to be kept serviceable throughout the winter, &quot;Holland&quot; left Newport under tow of the tug &quot;Leyden&quot; for Annapolis, Maryland, where she was used to train midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy, as well as officers and enlisted men ordered there to receive training vital in preparing for the operation of other submarines being built for the Fleet.

&quot;Holland&quot; proved valuable for experimental purposes in collecting data for submarines under construction or contemplation. Her surface run, from Annapolis to Norfolk, Virginia from 8–10 January 1901, provided useful data on her performance underway over an extended period.

&quot;Holland&quot; (briefly in 1899, on trials) and five Holland-type submarines were based in New Suffolk, New York on the North Fork of Long Island from 1899 to 1905, prompting the hamlet to claim to be the first submarine base in the United States.

Except for the period from 15 June to 1 October 1901, which was passed training cadets at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Holland&quot; remained at Annapolis as a training submarine until 17 July 1905 when she was decommissioned.

&quot;Holland&quot; finished her career in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 November 1910. This revolutionary submarine was sold as scrap to Henry A. Hitner &amp; Sons of Philadelphia on 18 June 1913 for $100. Her purchaser was required to put up $5,000 bond as assurance that the submarine would be broken up and not used as a ship.

About 1915, the hulk of the &quot;Holland&quot;, stripped of her external fittings, was sold to Peter J. Gibbons. As of October 1916, she was on display in Philadelphia. In May 1917 she was moved to the Bronx, New York as a featured attraction at the Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries.

&quot;Holland&quot; was on display for several years in Paterson, New Jersey until in 1930 she was sold as scrap to the Brooklyn Navy yard, and in 1932 was scrapped.

<doc id="71777" wikidata="Q45789" url="?curid=71777" title="Satyendra Nath Bose">
<text>Satyendra Nath Bose (; 1 January 1894 – 4 February 1974) was an Indian theoretical physicist and mathematician. He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, in developing the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics, and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was awarded India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1954 by the Government of India.

The class of particles that obey Bose statistics, bosons, was named after Bose, by Paul Dirac.

A polymath, he had a wide range of interests in varied fields, including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature, and music. He served on many research and development committees in India, after independence.

==Early life==

Bose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven children in a Bengali Kayastha family. He was the only son, with six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency. His schooling began at the age of five, near his home. When his family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian School. In his final year of school, he was admitted into the Hindu School. He passed his entrance examination (matriculation) in 1909 and stood fifth in the order of merit. He then joined the intermediate science course at the Presidency College, Calcutta, where his teachers included Jagadish Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla Chandra Ray.

Bose received a Bachelor of Science in mixed mathematics from Presidency College, standing first in 1913. Then he joined Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee&#x27;s newly formed Science College where he again stood first in the MSc mixed mathematics exam in 1915. His marks in the MSc examination created a new record in the annals of the University of Calcutta, which is yet to be surpassed.

After completing his MSc, Bose joined the Science College, Calcutta University as a research scholar in 1916 and started his studies in the theory of relativity. It was an exciting era in the history of scientific progress. Quantum theory had just appeared on the horizon and significant results had started pouring in.

His father, Surendranath Bose, worked in the Engineering Department of the East Indian Railway Company. In 1914, at age 20, Satyendra Nath Bose married Ushabati Ghosh, the 11-year-old daughter of a prominent Calcutta physician. They had nine children, two of whom died in early childhood. When he died in 1974, he left behind his wife, two sons, and five daughters.

As a polyglot, Bose was well versed in several languages such as Bengali, English, French, German and Sanskrit as well as the poetry of Lord Tennyson, Rabindranath Tagore and Kalidasa. In Europe, he impressed his host Jacqueline Zadoc-Kahn with his knowledge of Hebrew in literature and religion. He could play the &quot;esraj&quot;, an Indian instrument similar to a violin. He was actively involved in running night schools that came to be known as the Working Men&#x27;s Institute.

==Research career==
Bose attended Hindu School in Calcutta, and later attended Presidency College, also in Calcutta, earning the highest marks at each institution, while fellow student and future astrophysicist Meghnad Saha came second. He came in contact with teachers such as Jagadish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Ray and Naman Sharma who provided inspiration to aim high in life. From 1916 to 1921, he was a lecturer in the physics department of the Rajabazar Science College under University of Calcutta. Along with Saha, Bose prepared the first book in English based on German and French translations of original papers on Einstein&#x27;s special and general relativity in 1919.

In 1921, Satyendra Nath Bose joined as Reader in the Department of Physics of the recently founded University of Dhaka (in present-day Bangladesh). Bose set up whole new departments, including laboratories, to teach advanced courses for MSc and BSc honours and taught thermodynamics as well as James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism.

Bose, along with Indian Astrophysicist Meghnad Saha, presented several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, whilst a Reader in the Physics Department of the University of Dhaka, Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck&#x27;s quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the important field of quantum statistics. Though not accepted at once for publication, he sent the article directly to Albert Einstein in Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose&#x27;s behalf to the &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;. As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein.

===Bose–Einstein statistics===

While presenting a lecture at the University of Dhaka on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe, Bose intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results.

In the process of describing this discrepancy, Bose for the first time took the position that the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution would not be true for microscopic particles, where fluctuations due to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle will be significant. Thus he stressed the probability of finding particles in the phase space, each state having volume , and discarding the distinct position and momentum of the particles.

Bose adapted this lecture into a short article called &quot;Planck&#x27;s Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta&quot; and sent it to Albert Einstein with the following letter:
Einstein agreed with him, translated Bose&#x27;s papers &quot;Planck&#x27;s Law and Hypothesis of Light Quanta&quot; into German, and had it published in &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot; under Bose&#x27;s name, in 1924.


(1) There are three outcomes. What is the probability of producing two heads?

(2) Since the coins are distinct, there are two outcomes which produce a head and a tail. The probability of two heads is one-quarter.


The reason Bose&#x27;s interpretation produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy if, in an alternate universe, coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third (tail-head = head-tail).

Bose&#x27;s interpretation is now called Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented a new type of statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn&#x27;t that familiar with Boltzmann&#x27;s statistics and didn&#x27;t realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.
====Bose–Einstein condensate====

Einstein also did not at first realize how radical Bose&#x27;s departure was, and in his first paper after Bose, he was guided, like Bose, by the fact that the new method gave the right answer. But after Einstein&#x27;s second paper using Bose&#x27;s method in which Einstein predicted the Bose-Einstein condensate (&quot;pictured left&quot;), he started to realize just how radical it was, and he compared it to wave/particle duality, saying that some particles didn&#x27;t behave exactly like particles. Bose had already submitted his article to the British Journal &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, which rejected it before he sent it to Einstein. It is not known why it was rejected.

Einstein adopted the idea and extended it to atoms. This led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as Bose–Einstein condensate, a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.
===Dhaka===

After his stay in Europe, Bose returned to Dhaka in 1926. He did not have a doctorate, and so ordinarily, under the prevailing regulations, he would not be qualified for the post of Professor he applied for, but Einstein recommended him. He was then made Head of the Department of Physics at Dhaka University. He continued guiding and teaching at Dhaka University and was the Dean of the Faculty of Science there until 1945.

Bose designed equipment himself for an X-ray crystallography laboratory. He set up laboratories and libraries to make the department a center of research in X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, magnetic properties of matter, optical spectroscopy, wireless, and unified field theories. He also published an equation of state for real gases with Meghnad Saha.

===Calcutta===
When the partition of India became imminent (1947), he returned to Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) and taught there until 1956. He insisted every student design their own equipment using local materials and local technicians. He was made professor emeritus on his retirement. He then became Vice-Chancellor of Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan. He returned to the University of Calcutta to continue research in nuclear physics and complete earlier works in organic chemistry. In subsequent years, he worked in applied research such as extraction of helium in hot springs of Bakreshwar.

===Other fields===
Apart from physics, he did research in biotechnology and literature (Bengali and English). He made studies in chemistry, geology, zoology, anthropology, engineering and other sciences. Being Bengali, he devoted significant time to promoting Bengali as a teaching language, translating scientific papers into it, and promoting the development of the region.
==Honours==
In 1937, Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his only book on science, &quot;Visva–Parichay&quot;, to Satyendra Nath Bose. Bose was honoured with the title Padma Vibhushan by the Indian Government in 1954. In 1959, he was appointed as the National Professor, the highest honour in the country for a scholar, a position he held for 15 years. In 1986, the S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences was established by an act of Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta.

Bose became an adviser to the then newly formed Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. He was the president of the Indian Physical Society and the National Institute of Science. He was elected general president of the Indian Science Congress. He was the vice president and then the president of Indian Statistical Institute. In 1958, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was nominated as member of Rajya Sabha.

Partha Ghose has stated that

===Nobel Prize nomination===

Bose was nominated by K. Banerjee (1956), D.S. Kothari (1959), S.N. Bagchi (1962), and A.K. Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his contribution to Bose–Einstein statistics and the unified field theory. Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel Committee as follows: &quot;(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics is found to be of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely to the development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to date, he has made a number of highly interesting contributions of far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein&#x27;s Unitary Field Theory.&quot; Bose&#x27;s work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel Committee, Oskar Klein, who deemed his work not worthy of a Nobel Prize.

==Legacy==

Bosons, a class of elementary subatomic particles in particle physics were named by Dirac after Satyendra Nath Bose to commemorate his contributions to science.

Soviet Nobel laureate Lev Landau kept a list of names of physicists which he ranked on a logarithmic scale of productivity ranging from 1 to 5. Albert Einstein was ranked 0.5. Landau awarded a rank of 1 to Bose along with the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Erwin Schrödinger, and others. Landau ranked himself as a 2.5 but later promoted to a 2.

Although seven Nobel Prizes were awarded for research related to S N Bose&#x27;s concepts of the boson, Bose–Einstein statistics and Bose–Einstein condensate, Bose himself was not awarded a Nobel Prize.

In his book &quot;The Scientific Edge&quot;, physicist Jayant Narlikar observed: 

When Bose himself was once asked that question, he replied, &quot;I have got all the recognition I deserve.&quot;

One of the main academic buildings of University of Rajshahi, the No 1 science building has been named after him.

The 4 June 2022 Google Doodle featured Bose, on the 98th anniversary of his sending his work to Einstein.

<doc id="71789" wikidata="Q51748" url="?curid=71789" title="Mara Jade">
<text>Mara Jade Skywalker is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. She appears in the now non-canon &quot;Legends&quot; continuity as the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker. She has been voiced by Heidi Shannon, Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie in various &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games.

==Concept and development==
Her first appearance was in Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991). Zahn imagined Mara Jade as a strong, complex female character, somebody he thought lacking in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. While competent, she is flawed. When the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy ended in 1993 with &quot;The Last Command&quot;, Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character. Asked to write another novel, he established two goals: &quot;to end the war between the New Republic and the Empire, and to get Luke Skywalker and Mara together.&quot; Although Lucasfilm resisted the idea of Luke marrying Mara, they eventually acquiesced.

In 2018, Zahn said Lucasfilm gave him some creative control over the character of Mara Jade: any appearance of Mara in new works requires Zahn&#x27;s approval. Zahn also explained that Lucasfilm Story Group held the authority to prevent him from incorporating Mara back into the canon, so any appearance of the character must be approved by both parties. Zahn said he would only allow her to appear if she plays an important role in the plot, and he would block any kind of cameo appearance. Previously, the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn, another Zahn creation, made the jump from &quot;Legends&quot; to canon, albeit with a slightly-reworked story. Subsequently, Zahn said he hoped to find a way to bring Mara into the canon, stating &quot;If there was a generic, or organic, spot for her to fit into a story... I promise people, I will pitch it to the Lucasfilm story group, and then, it&#x27;s their decision whether to allow it or not.&quot;

Compared to Princess Leia, Zahn said, &quot;Mara has a sharper and sarcastic manner, and of course, she had to go through the painful realization her service was to an evil cause. But both women are strong without sacrificing their femininity, a balance which I think some authors have trouble writing. Bear in mind, too, Leia was one of the first people in the New Republic who decided Mara could be trusted, which perhaps says something about their understanding of each other.&quot;

== Appearances ==
Mara is introduced as smuggler Talon Karrde&#x27;s second-in-command in &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;. The novel establishes she was previously an &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Hand&quot;—a special agent—for Emperor Palpatine.

Several stories depict Jade before the events in &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, showing her training under Palpatine and executing his orders. The &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy depicts Mara&#x27;s first confrontation with Luke Skywalker, whom she swears to kill to avenge Palpatine&#x27;s death (Palpatine sent her a faked image of Luke and Vader turning on him together, rather than Vader killing Palpatine, and the demand for Luke&#x27;s death motivated by Palpatine&#x27;s desire for revenge against his father rather than Luke&#x27;s actions).

This was re-inforced by the Emperor&#x27;s final telepathic command to assassinate Luke, plaguing her thoughts since his death; upon learning this situation, Luke vowed to help Mara break Palpatine&#x27;s hold on her, regardless of the threat she posed to Luke. Toward the end of the trilogy, she turns against the Empire, and resolves her anger toward Luke, silences the command without killing him and instead killing Luke&#x27;s &quot;clone&quot;—Luuke Skywalker—made by the Dark Jedi Joruus C&#x27;baoth to challenge Luke.

In doing so, she took Luke&#x27;s lightsaber that was recovered after his initial duel with Darth Vader, and used it to stab C&#x27;baoth. At the close of &quot;The Last Command&quot;, Luke gives her Anakin&#x27;s lightsaber because he believed she earned it and because he truly wanted her to have it. Over the course of the series, Luke recognizes in Mara an underdeveloped affinity for the Force; and although she initially resists Jedi training, she eventually becomes a Jedi Master.

Luke and Mara develop a strong bond in Zahn&#x27;s &quot;The Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology; he proposes marriage, and the two wed in Michael A. Stackpole&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Union&quot;. She delivers a son, Ben, during &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; series.

In the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series, Mara is suspicious of her nephew, Jacen Solo, after he sends Ben on several ethically-dubious missions. Upon learning Jacen is a Sith apprentice, Mara vows to kill him, but Jacen ultimately kills &quot;her&quot; in &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. She later appears as a Force ghost, first to Ben then to Luke, in &quot;Revelation&quot;. She also appears as a Force ghost to Cade Skywalker in the &quot;Legacy&quot; comics, set more than a century after the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

=== Other appearances ===

Mara also appears in the short story &quot;Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade,&quot; by Timothy Zahn, in the anthology &quot;Tales from Jabba&#x27;s Palace&quot;. In this story, she infiltrates Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s palace as a dancing girl to assassinate Luke Skywalker under orders of the Emperor, but misses her chance after Jabba drops him into the Rancor&#x27;s lair then escapes.

Mara was portrayed by model Shannon McRandle (as Shannon Baksa) on several cards in the &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot;.

She is a playable character in &quot;Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; (Wii version). Meeting her was also a mission objective in the defunct massively multiplayer online game &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;. She also narrates the Imperial campaign in &quot;Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds&quot;. 

She was portrayed by Denise Donovan in the Team Starkid musical parody &quot;Ani&quot;.

== Canonicity ==

In 2008, when franchise creator George Lucas said there would be no sequel trilogy, he explained that plot elements from the Expanded Universe were not part of his story, saying, &quot;Luke doesn&#x27;t get married&quot;. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were re-branded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

==Reception==
Mara Jade was chosen by &quot;IGN&quot; as the 19th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; character. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jesse Schedeen also listed the character as the top 10th &quot;Star Wars&quot; hero, noting she &quot;entered the Expanded Universe early, and she stuck around for so long because she&#x27;s just a great character&quot;. UGO Networks called the character the seventh top &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe character, calling her complex. In a 1998 &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot; poll of fans&#x27; favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, Mara was the only expanded universe character to break the top 20. In 2006, Zahn called Mara and Grand Admiral Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created, saying &quot;Mara, with her attitude and her Jedi skills, is just plain fun to write, especially in opposition—or in partnership—with Luke.&quot;

<doc id="71791" wikidata="Q3050598" url="?curid=71791" title="Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man">
<text>Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man is a novel by Siegfried Sassoon, first published in 1928 by Faber and Faber. Originally published anonymously, it went on to become a bestseller, and won both the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

==Background==
Prior to its publication, Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I. Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. So uncertain was he of the wisdom of this move that he elected to publish &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot; anonymously. It is a depiction of his early years presented in the form of an autobiographical novel, with false names being given to the central characters, including Sassoon himself, who appears as &quot;George Sherston&quot;. Sassoon was motivated to write the work by a war incident, when a fox was loose in the trenches and one of his friends shot and killed it. However, the book draws heavily on his pre-war life, with riding and hunting being among the favourite pastimes of the author.

Much of the material for the novel came from Sassoon&#x27;s own diaries. He said he was inspired by the work of Marcel Proust, saying, &quot;A few pages of Proust have made me wonder whether insignificant episodes aren&#x27;t the most significant&quot;. In particular, his relationship with &quot;Aunt Evelyn&quot;, a fictionalised representation of his mother Theresa, is revealed as having been a major influence in his upbringing.

==Plot==
The story is a series of episodes in the youth of George Sherston, ranging from his first attempts to learn to ride to his experiences in winning point-to-point races. The title is somewhat misleading, as the book is mainly concerned with a series of landmark events in Sherston/Sassoon&#x27;s childhood and youth, and his encounters with various comic characters. &quot;The Flower-Show Match&quot;, an account of an annual village cricket match – an important fixture for those involved – in which young Sherston plays a significant part, was later published separately by Faber as a self-contained story. The book as a whole is a frequently humorous work, in which fox-hunting, one of Sassoon&#x27;s major interests, comes to represent the young man&#x27;s innocent frame of mind in the years before war broke out. The book ends with his enlistment in a local regiment, the Sussex Yeomanry, and his subsequent transfer, with a commission, to the Flintshire Fusiliers, a battalion of the Royal Welsh which was sent to France. The story is continued in two sequels: &quot;Memoirs of an Infantry Officer&quot; and &quot;Sherston&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

<doc id="71792" wikidata="Q316661" url="?curid=71792" title="Daniel Boone">
<text>Daniel Boone (, 1734September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer and frontiersman whose exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. He became famous for his exploration and settlement of Kentucky, which was then beyond the western borders of the Thirteen Colonies. In 1775, Boone founded the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap and into Kentucky, in the face of resistance from Native Americans. He founded Boonesborough, one of the first English-speaking settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains. By the end of the 18th century, more than 200,000 people had entered Kentucky by following the route marked by Boone.

He served as a militia officer during the Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which in Kentucky was fought primarily between American settlers and British-allied Indians. Boone was taken in by Shawnees in 1778 and adopted into the tribe, but he resigned and continued to help protect the Kentucky settlements. He also left due to the Shawnee Indians torturing and killing one of his sons. He was elected to the first of his three terms in the Virginia General Assembly during the war and fought in the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782, one of the last battles of the American Revolution. He worked as a surveyor and merchant after the war, but went deep into debt as a Kentucky land speculator. He resettled in Missouri in 1799, where he spent most of the last two decades of his life, frustrated with legal problems resulting from his land claims.

Boone remains an iconic, if imperfectly remembered, figure in American history. He was a legend in his own lifetime, especially after an account of his adventures was published in 1784, making him famous in America and Europe. After his death, he became the subject of many heroic tall tales and works of fiction. His adventures—real and legendary—helped create the archetypal frontier hero of American folklore. In American popular culture, Boone is remembered as one of the foremost early frontiersmen, even though mythology often overshadows the historical details of his life.

==Early life==
Boone was born on October 22, 1734 (&quot;New Style&quot; November 2), the sixth of eleven children in a family of Quakers. His father, Squire Boone (1696–1765), immigrated to colonial Pennsylvania from the small town of Bradninch in the county of Devon, England, sometime around 1712. Squire, a weaver and blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700–1777), whose family were Quakers from Wales. In 1731, the Boones built a one-room log cabin in the Oley Valley in what is now Berks County, Pennsylvania, near present-day Reading, where Daniel was born.

Boone spent his early years on the Pennsylvania frontier, often interacting with American Indians. Boone learned to hunt from local settlers and Indians; by the age of fifteen, he had a reputation as one of the region&#x27;s best hunters. Many stories about Boone emphasize his hunting skills. In one tale, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the panther through the heart just as it leaped at him. The story may be a folktale, one of many that became part of Boone&#x27;s popular image.

In Boone&#x27;s youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community. In 1742, Boone&#x27;s parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child Sarah married a &quot;worldling&quot;, or non-Quaker, while she was visibly pregnant. When Boone&#x27;s oldest brother Israel also married a &quot;worldling&quot; in 1747, Squire Boone stood by his son and was therefore expelled from the Quakers, although his wife continued to attend monthly meetings with her children. Perhaps as a result of this controversy, in 1750 Squire sold his land and moved the family to North Carolina. Daniel Boone did not attend church again, although he always considered himself a Christian and had all of his children baptized. The Boones eventually settled on the Yadkin River, in what is now Davie County, North Carolina, about two miles (3 km) west of Mocksville.

Boone received little formal education, since he preferred to spend his time hunting, apparently with his parents&#x27; blessing. According to a family tradition, when a schoolteacher expressed concern over Boone&#x27;s education, Boone&#x27;s father said, &quot;Let the girls do the spelling and Dan will do the shooting.&quot; Boone was tutored by family members, though his spelling remained unorthodox. Historian John Mack Faragher cautions that the folk image of Boone as semiliterate is misleading, arguing that Boone &quot;acquired a level of literacy that was the equal of most men of his times.&quot; Boone regularly took reading material with him on his hunting expeditions—the Bible and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; were favorites. He was often the only literate person in groups of frontiersmen, and would sometimes entertain his hunting companions by reading to them around the campfire.

==Hunter, husband, and soldier==
The French and Indian War (1754–1763) broke out between the French and the British, along with their respective Indian allies, and Boone joined a North Carolina militia company as a teamster and blacksmith. In 1755, his unit accompanied General Edward Braddock&#x27;s attempt to drive the French out of the Ohio Country, which ended in disaster at the Battle of the Monongahela. Boone, in the rear with the wagons, took no part in the battle, and fled with the retreating soldiers. He returned home after the defeat, and married Rebecca Bryan, a neighbor in the Yadkin Valley, on August 14, 1756. The couple initially lived in a cabin on his father&#x27;s farm, and eventually had ten children, in addition to raising eight children of deceased relatives.

In 1758, conflict erupted between British colonists and the Cherokees, their former allies in the French and Indian War. After the Yadkin Valley was raided by Cherokees, the Boones and many other families fled north to Culpeper County, Virginia. Boone saw action as a member of the North Carolina militia during this &quot;Cherokee Uprising&quot;, periodically serving under Captain Hugh Waddell on the North Carolina frontier until 1760.

Boone supported his growing family in these years as a market hunter and trapper, collecting pelts for the fur trade. Almost every autumn, despite the unrest on the frontier, he would go on &quot;long hunts&quot;, extended expeditions into the wilderness lasting weeks or months. Boone went alone or with a small group of men, accumulating hundreds of deer skins in the autumn, and trapping beaver and otter over the winter. When the long hunters returned in the spring, they sold their take to commercial fur traders. On their journeys, frontiersmen often carved messages on trees or wrote their names on cave walls, and Boone&#x27;s name or initials have been found in many places. A tree in Washington County, Tennessee reads &quot;D. Boon Cilled a. Bar on tree in the year 1760&quot;. A similar carving is preserved in the museum of the Filson Historical Society in Louisville, Kentucky which reads &quot;D. Boon Kilt a Bar, 1803.&quot; The inscriptions may be genuine, or part of a long tradition of phony Boone relics.

According to a popular story, Boone returned home after a long absence to find that Rebecca had given birth to a daughter. Rebecca confessed that she had thought that Daniel was dead, and that his brother had fathered the child. Boone did not blame Rebecca, and raised the girl as his own child. Boone&#x27;s early biographers knew the story but did not publish it. Modern biographers regard the tale as possibly folklore, since the identity of the brother and the daughter vary in different versions of the tale.

In the mid-1760s, Boone began to look for a new place to settle. The population was growing in the Yadkin Valley, which reduced the amount of game available for hunting. He had difficulty making ends meet, and was often taken to court for nonpayment of debts. He sold what land he owned to pay off creditors. After his father&#x27;s death in 1765, Boone traveled with a group of men to Florida, which had become British territory after the end of the war, to look into the possibility of settling there. According to a family story, he purchased land in Pensacola, but Rebecca refused to move so far away from friends and family. The Boones instead moved to a more remote area of the Yadkin Valley, and he began to hunt westward into the Blue Ridge Mountains.

==Into Kentucky==


Years before entering Kentucky, Boone had heard about the region&#x27;s fertile land and abundant game. In 1767, Boone and his brother Squire first crossed into what became the state of Kentucky, but they failed to reach the rich hunting grounds. In May 1769, Boone set out again with a party of five othersincluding John Findley, who first told Boone of the Cumberland Gapon a two-year hunting and trapping expedition. His first sighting of the Bluegrass region from atop Pilot Knob became &quot;an icon of American history&quot;, and was the frequent subject of paintings.

On December 22, 1769, Boone and fellow hunter John Stuart were captured by a party of Shawnee, who confiscated all of their skins and told them to leave and never return. The Shawnee had not signed the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, in which the Iroquois had ceded their claim to Kentucky to the British. The Shawnee regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground; they considered American hunters there to be poachers. Boone, undeterred, continued hunting and exploring in Kentucky. On one occasion, he shot a man to avoid capture, which historian John Mack Faragher says &quot;was one of the few Indians that Boone acknowledged killing.&quot; Boone returned to North Carolina in 1771, but came back to hunt in Kentucky in the autumn 1772.

In 1773, Boone packed up his family and, with his brother Squire and a group of about 50 others, began the first attempt by British colonists to establish a settlement. Boone was still an obscure figure at the time; the most prominent member of the expedition was William Russell, a well-known Virginian and future brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. Another member of this expedition was Boone&#x27;s friend and fellow long-hunter, Michael Stoner.

Included in this group were an unknown number of enslaved Blacks, including Charles and Adam. On October 9, Boone&#x27;s oldest son, James, several Whites and Charles and Adam left the main party to seek provisions in a nearby settlement. They were attacked by a band of Delawares, Shawnee, and Cherokees. Following the Fort Stanwix treaty, American Indians in the region had been debating what to do about the influx of settlers. This group had decided, in the words of Faragher, &quot;to send a message of their opposition to settlement&quot;. James Boone and William Russell&#x27;s son, Henry, were tortured and killed. Charles was captured. Adam witnessed the horror concealed in riverbank driftwood. After wandering in the woods for 11 days, Adam located the group and informed Boone of the circumstances of their deaths. Charles&#x27;s body was found by the pioneers 40 miles from the abduction site, dead from a blow to the head. The brutality of the killings sent shockwaves along the frontier, and Boone&#x27;s party abandoned their expedition.

The attack was one of the first events in what became known as Dunmore&#x27;s War, a struggle between Virginia and American Indians for control of what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. In the summer of 1774, Boone traveled with a companion to Kentucky to notify surveyors there of the outbreak of war. They journeyed more than in two months to warn those who had not already fled the region. Upon his return to Virginia, Boone helped defend colonial settlements along the Clinch River, earning a promotion to captain in the militia, as well as acclaim from fellow citizens. After the brief war, which ended soon after Virginia&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Point Pleasant in October 1774, the Shawnee relinquished their claims to Kentucky.

Following Dunmore&#x27;s War, Richard Henderson, a prominent judge from North Carolina, hired Boone to help establish a colony to be called Transylvania. Boone traveled to several Cherokee towns and invited them to a meeting, held at Sycamore Shoals in March 1775, where Henderson purchased the Cherokee claim to Kentucky.

Boone then blazed &quot;Boone&#x27;s Trace&quot;, later known as the Wilderness Road, through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Sam, an enslaved Black &quot;body servant&quot;, and other enslaved laborers were among this group of settlers. When this group camped near the location of present-day Richmond, Kentucky, Indians attacked, killing Sam and his owner. After driving off the attackers, the party buried the two men side by side.

Boone founded Boonesborough along the Kentucky River; other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.

==American Revolution==
American Indians who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky by treaties saw the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, Boone and his family were among the fewer than 200 colonists who remained, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan&#x27;s Station.

On July 14, 1776, Boone&#x27;s daughter Jemima and two other girls were captured outside Boonesborough by an Indian war party, who carried the girls north toward the Shawnee towns in the Ohio country. Boone and a group of men from Boonesborough set out in pursuit, finally catching up with them two days later. Boone and his men ambushed the Indians, rescuing the girls and driving off their captors. The incident became the most celebrated event of Boone&#x27;s life. James Fenimore Cooper created a version of this episode in his classic novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826).

In 1777, Henry Hamilton, British Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, began to recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. That same year in March, the newly formed militia of Kentucky County, Virginia, mustered in Boonesborough, whose population included ten to 15 enslaved people. On April 24, 1778, the British-allied Shawnee led by Chief Blackfish mounted the siege of Boonesborough. Armed enslaved men fought alongside their owners at the fort&#x27;s walls. After going beyond the fort walls to engage the attackers, London, one of the enslaved, was killed.

Boone was shot in the ankle while outside the fort. Amid a flurry of bullets, he was carried back inside by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough. Kenton became Boone&#x27;s close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.

===Capture and court-martial===
While Boone recovered, the Shawnee kept up their attacks outside Boonesborough, killing cattle and destroying crops. With food running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, when Boone was hunting for meat for the expedition, he was captured by Blackfish&#x27;s warriors. Because Boone&#x27;s party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned to camp the next day with Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.

Blackfish intended to move on to Boonesborough and capture it, but Boone argued the women and children would not survive a winter trek as prisoners back to the Shawnee villages. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly some of his men concluded he had switched sides, an impression that led to his court-martial (see below). Many of the Shawnee wanted to execute the prisoners in retaliation for the recent murder of Shawnee Chief Cornstalk by Virginia militiamen. Because Shawnee chiefs led by seeking consensus, Blackfish held a council. After an impassioned speech by Boone, the warriors voted to spare the prisoners. Although Boone had saved his men, Blackfish pointed out that Boone had not included himself in the agreement, so Boone was forced to run the gauntlet through the warriors, which he survived with minor injuries.

Boone and his men were taken to Blackfish&#x27;s town of Chillicothe. As was their custom, the Shawnee adopted some of the prisoners to replace fallen warriors. Boone was adopted into a Shawnee family at Chillicothe, perhaps into Blackfish&#x27;s family, and given the name Sheltowee (Big Turtle). In March 1778, the Shawnee took the unadopted prisoners to Governor Hamilton in Detroit. Blackfish brought Boone along, though he refused Hamilton&#x27;s offers to release Boone to the British. Hamilton gave Boone gifts, attempting to win his loyalty, while Boone continued to pretend that he intended to surrender Boonesborough. Boone returned with Blackfish to Chillicothe.

On June 16, 1778, when he learned Blackfish was about to return to Boonesborough with a large force, Boone eluded his captors and raced home, covering the to Boonesborough in five days on horseback and, after his horse gave out, the majority on foot. Biographer Robert Morgan calls Boone&#x27;s escape and return &quot;one of the great legends of frontier history.&quot;

Upon Boone&#x27;s return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone&#x27;s loyalty, since he had apparently lived happily among the Shawnee for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnee across the Ohio River, and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a 10-day siege led by Blackfish, which began on September 7, 1778. After the siege, Captain Benjamin Logan and Colonel Richard Callaway—both of whom had nephews who were still captives surrendered by Boone—brought charges against Boone for his recent activities. In the court-martial that followed, Boone was found &quot;not guilty&quot; and was even promoted after the court heard his testimony. Despite this vindication, Boone was humiliated by the court-martial, and he rarely spoke of it.

===Final years of the Revolution===
After the trial, Boone returned to North Carolina to take his family back to Kentucky. In the fall of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including the family of Captain Abraham Lincoln, grandfather of the future president. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone&#x27;s Station,KY. He began earning money by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash () from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.

In contrast to the later folk image of Boone as a backwoodsman who had little affinity for &quot;civilized&quot; society, Boone was a leading citizen of Kentucky at this time. When Kentucky was divided into three Virginia counties in November 1780, Boone was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Fayette County militia. In April 1781, he was elected as a representative to the Virginia General Assembly, which was held in Richmond. In 1782, he was elected sheriff of Fayette County.

Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark&#x27;s invasion of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua against the Shawnee on August 7. On the way home from the campaign, Boone was hunting with his brother Ned when Shawnee shot and killed Ned, who resembled Daniel. The Shawnee beheaded Ned, believing him to be Daniel, and took the head as evidence that Daniel Boone had finally been slain.

In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone&#x27;s term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks, a disastrous defeat for the Kentuckians in which Boone&#x27;s son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark-led expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.

==Businessman and politician==
After the Revolutionary War ended, Boone resettled in Limestone (later renamed Maysville, Kentucky), then a booming Ohio River port. He kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. In 1784, on Boone&#x27;s 50th birthday, frontier historian John Filson published &quot;The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke&quot;. The popular book included a chronicle of Boone&#x27;s adventures, which made Boone a celebrity.

As settlers poured into Kentucky, the border war with American Indians north of the Ohio River resumed. In September 1786, Boone took part in a military expedition into the Ohio Country led by Benjamin Logan. Returning to Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnee who had been captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war would not end until the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers eight years later, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.

Boone was initially prosperous in Limestone, owning seven slaves, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. In 1786, he purchased a Pennsylvania enslaved woman, age of about 20, for &quot;Ninety poundes Current Lawfull (sic) money.&quot; A leader, he served as militia colonel, sheriff, and county coroner. In 1787, he was again elected to the Virginia state assembly, this time from Bourbon County. He began to have financial troubles after engaging in land speculation, buying and selling claims to tens of thousands of acres. These ventures ultimately failed because of the chaotic nature of land speculation in frontier Kentucky and Boone&#x27;s poor business instincts. Frustrated with the legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1789 Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he operated a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor&#x27;s assistant. That same year, when Virginia created Kanawha County, Boone became the lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, he was elected to the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping, though he was often hampered by rheumatism.

In 1795, Boone and his wife moved back to Kentucky, living on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone in what became Nicholas County. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone&#x27;s remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone&#x27;s arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.

==Into Missouri==
Having endured legal and financial setbacks, Boone sought to make a fresh start by leaving the United States. In 1799, he moved his extended family to what is now St. Charles County, Missouri, then part of Spanish Louisiana. The Spanish, eager to promote settlement in the sparsely populated region, did not enforce the official requirement that all immigrants be Catholic. The Spanish governor appointed Boone &quot;syndic&quot; (judge and jury) and commandant (military leader) of the Femme Osage district. Anecdotes of Boone&#x27;s tenure as syndic suggest he sought to render fair judgments rather than strictly observe the letter of the law.

Boone served as syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase. He was appointed captain of the local militia. Because Boone&#x27;s land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on oral agreements, he again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone&#x27;s sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.

Although Boone reportedly vowed never to return to Kentucky after moving to Missouri, stories (possibly folk tales) were told of him making one last visit to Kentucky to pay off his creditors. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics noted the similarity of his painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have accepted the veracity of Audubon&#x27;s account.Boone spent his final years in Missouri, often in the company of children and grandchildren. He continued to hunt and trap as much as his health and energy levels permitted, intruding upon the territory of the Osage tribe, who once captured him and confiscated his furs. In 1810, at the age of 76, he went with a group on a six-month hunt up the Missouri River, reportedly as far as the Yellowstone River, a round trip of more than 2,000 miles. He began one of his final trapping expeditions in 1815, in the company of a Shawnee and Derry Coburn, a slave who was frequently with Boone in his final years. They reached Fort Osage in 1816, where an officer wrote, &quot;We have been honored by a visit from Col. Boone... He has taken part in all the wars of America, from Braddock&#x27;s war to the present hour,&quot; but &quot;he prefers the woods, where you see him in the dress of the roughest, poorest hunter.&quot;

==Death and burial==
Boone died on September 26, 1820, at his son Nathan Boone&#x27;s home on Femme Osage Creek, Missouri. He was buried next to Rebecca, who had died on March 18, 1813. The graves, which were unmarked until the mid-1830s, were near Jemima (Boone) Callaway&#x27;s home on Tuque Creek, about two miles (3 km) from present-day Marthasville, Missouri.

In 1845, the Boones&#x27; remains were disinterred and reburied in a new cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Resentment in Missouri about the disinterment grew over the years, and a legend arose that Boone&#x27;s remains never left Missouri. According to this story, Boone&#x27;s tombstone in Missouri had been inadvertently placed over the wrong grave, but no one had corrected the error—and that Boone&#x27;s Missouri relatives, displeased with the Kentuckians who came to exhume Boone, kept quiet about the mistake and allowed the Kentuckians to dig up the wrong remains. No contemporary evidence indicates this actually happened, but in 1983, a forensic anthropologist examined a crude plaster cast of Boone&#x27;s skull made before the Kentucky reburial and announced it might be the skull of an African American. Black slaves were also buried at Tuque Creek, so it is possible that the wrong remains were mistakenly removed from the crowded graveyard. Both the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky and the Old Bryan Farm graveyard in Missouri claim to have Boone&#x27;s remains.

==Legacy==

Daniel Boone remains an iconic figure in American history, although his status as an early American folk hero and later as a subject of fiction has tended to obscure the actual details of his life. He emerged as a legend in large part because of John Filson&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon&quot;, part of his book &quot;The Discovery, Settlement and present State of Kentucke&quot;. First published in 1784, Filson&#x27;s book was primarily intended to popularize Kentucky to immigrants. It was translated into French and German, and made Boone famous in America and Europe. Based on interviews with Boone, Filson&#x27;s book contained a mostly factual account of Boone&#x27;s adventures from the exploration of Kentucky through the American Revolution, although many have doubted if the florid, philosophical dialogue attributed to Boone was authentic. Often reprinted, Filson&#x27;s book established Boone as one of the first popular heroes of the United States.

Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his &quot;Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky&quot; (1833) became one of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint embellished Boone&#x27;s adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint&#x27;s book, Boone fought with a bear, escaped from Indians by swinging on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone&#x27;s family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.

===Symbol and stereotype===
Thanks to Filson&#x27;s book, Boone became a symbol of the &quot;natural man&quot; who lives a virtuous, uncomplicated existence in the wilderness. This was famously expressed in Lord Byron&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1822), which devoted a number of stanzas to Boone, including this one:
Byron&#x27;s poem celebrates Boone as someone who found happiness by turning his back on civilization. In a similar vein, many folk tales depicted Boone as a man who migrated to more remote areas whenever civilization crowded in on him. In a typical anecdote, when asked why he was moving to Missouri, Boone supposedly replied, &quot;I want more elbow room!&quot; Boone rejected this interpretation. &quot;Nothing embitters my old age,&quot; he said late in life, like &quot;the circulation of absurd stories that I retire as civilization advances.&quot;

Existing simultaneously with the image of Boone as a refugee from society was, paradoxically, the popular portrayal of him as civilization&#x27;s trailblazer. Boone was celebrated as an agent of Manifest Destiny, a pathfinder who tamed the wilderness, paving the way for the extension of American civilization. In 1852, critic Henry Tuckerman dubbed Boone &quot;the Columbus of the woods&quot;, comparing Boone&#x27;s passage through the Cumberland Gap to Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyage to the New World. In popular mythology, Boone became the first to explore and settle Kentucky, opening the way for countless others to follow. In fact, other Americans had explored Kentucky before Boone, as debunkers in the 20th century often pointed out, but Boone came to symbolize them all, making him what historian Michael Lofaro called &quot;the founding father of westward expansion.&quot;

In the 19th century, when Native Americans were being displaced from their lands and confined on reservations, Boone&#x27;s image was often reshaped into the stereotype of the belligerent, Indian-hating frontiersman which was then popular. In John A. McClung&#x27;s &quot;Sketches of Western Adventure&quot; (1832), for example, Boone was portrayed as longing for the &quot;thrilling excitement of savage warfare.&quot; Boone was transformed in the popular imagination into someone who regarded Indians with contempt and had killed scores of the &quot;savages&quot;. The real Boone disliked bloodshed. According to historian John Bakeless, there is no record that Boone ever scalped Indians, unlike other frontiersmen of the era. Boone once told his son Nathan that he was certain of having killed only one Indian, during the battle at Blue Licks, although on another occasion he said, &quot;I never killed but three.&quot; He expressed regret over the killings, saying the Indians &quot;have always been kinder to me than the whites.&quot; Even though Boone had lost two sons and a brother in wars with Indians, he respected Indians and was respected by them. In Missouri, Boone went hunting with the Shawnees who had captured and adopted him decades earlier. Some 19th-century writers regarded Boone&#x27;s sympathy for Indians as a character flaw and altered his words to conform to contemporary attitudes.

===Commemoration and portrayals===

Many places in the United States are named for Boone, including the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky and the Sheltowee Trace Trail in Tennessee. His name has long been synonymous with the American outdoors. The Boone and Crockett Club is a conservationist organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1887, and the Sons of Daniel Boone was the precursor of the Boy Scouts of America. A half-dollar coin was minted in 1934 to mark the bicentennial of Boone&#x27;s birth; a commemorative stamp was issued in 1968. In 1961, the US Navy ordered ten ballistic missile submarines to be made at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. One would be named the USS &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; (SSBN-629), commissioning on April 23, 1964, and remaining in service until decommissioning in 1994. The submarine&#x27;s motto &quot;New Trails to Blaze&quot; was an homage to Boone&#x27;s life and his great legacy of exploration on the frontier.

Boone&#x27;s adventures, real and mythical, formed the basis of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main character of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone&#x27;s name. As mentioned above, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826), Cooper&#x27;s second &quot;Leatherstocking&quot; novel, features a fictionalized version of Boone&#x27;s rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.

In the 20th century, Boone was featured in numerous comic strips, radio programs, novels, and films, such as the 1936 film &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; as well as the 1956 &quot;Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer&quot; shot in Mexico during the &quot;Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier&quot; craze of the time. Boone was the subject of a TV series that ran from 1964 to 1970. In the theme song for the series, Boone was described as a &quot;big man&quot; in a &quot;coonskin cap&quot; and the &quot;rippin&#x27;est, roarin&#x27;est, fightin&#x27;est man the frontier ever knew!&quot; This did not describe the real Boone, who was not a big man and did not wear a coonskin cap, which he thought uncouth and uncomfortable. Boone was portrayed this way in the TV series because Fess Parker, the tall actor who played him, was essentially reprising his role as Davy Crockett from an earlier TV series. That Boone could be portrayed the same way as Crockett, another American frontiersman with a very different personality, was another example of how Boone&#x27;s image was reshaped to suit popular tastes. He was also the subject matter for the song sung by Ed Ames called &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;. It was released in 1966.

Arthur Guiterman in a four stanza poem recounts the life of Boone, ending with his ghost happily tracking animals, both ancient and mythical, across the Milky Way. &quot;The Taking of Jemima Boone&quot; by Matthew Pearl, published in 2021, is an account of the abduction of the daughter of Daniel Boone and, after her rescue by Boone, then shifts to the conflicts between Boone, his political rival Richard Callaway, and Shawnee leader Blackfish, with resulting impacts to the Western theater of the American Revolutionary War.

<text>Les Halles (; &#x27;The Halls&#x27;) was Paris&#x27; central fresh food market. It last operated on 12 January 1973 and was replaced by an underground shopping centre and a park. The unpopular modernist development was demolished yet again in 2010, and replaced by the Westfield Forum des Halles, a modern shopping mall built largely underground and topped by an undulating 2.5 hectare canopy. The mall sees around 50 million visitors every year, making it the busiest in France as of 2019. It is directly connected to the massive RER and métro transit hub of Châtelet–Les Halles, Paris&#x27;s busiest station.

==History==
===The market of the Little Fields===
In the 11th century, a market grew up by a cemetery to the northwest of Paris in an area called the Little Fields (). This was mainly a dry goods and money changing market. A bishop briefly took control of the market before sharing control with Louis VI in 1137. In 1183, Philip Augustus took full control of the market and built two market halls —  — to protect the textiles. He also built walls around the market, including land which had recently been confiscated from exiled Jews that originally belonged to the church. When he then built walls around the city, these embraced the market, which quickly became the city&#x27;s largest (and, over time, went from being at the edge of the city to at its center). Officially, it would remain a dry goods market for centuries, but food stalls soon grew up around the main buildings and by the 15th century food prices at les Halles were being cited as significant for the whole city.

The market would have ups and downs over the coming centuries and was rebuilt more than once. Over time, an increasing number of halls were built explicitly for food, but the dry goods market remained central to the (increasingly cramped) space.

===The wholesale market===
The church of Saint-Eustache was constructed in the 16th century. The circular Halle aux Blés (Corn Exchange), designed by Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières, was built between 1763 and 1769 at the west end of Les Halles. Its circular central court was later covered with a dome, and it was converted into the Bourse de Commerce in 1889.

In the 1850s, Victor Baltard designed the famous glass and iron structure which would house les Halles for over a century and became one of the sights of Paris; this would last until the 1970s. Having become entirely a food market, the remodeled market was known as the &quot;Belly of Paris&quot;, as Émile Zola called it in his 1873 novel , which is set in the busy marketplace of the 19th century.

===Major conversion===
Unable to compete in the new market economy and in need of massive repairs, the colourful ambience once associated with the bustling area of merchant stalls disappeared in 1973, when Les Halles was demolished (fruit, flower and vegetable markets had moved in 1969, and only the butchers at the meat markets remained); the wholesale market was relocated to the suburb of Rungis. Two of the glass and cast iron market pavilions were dismantled and re-erected elsewhere; one in the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne, the other in Yokohama, Japan, and the rest were destroyed. The site was chosen to host the station Châtelet–Les-Halles, the point of convergence of the RER, a new network of express underground railway lines through the city. Three lines leading out of the city to the south, east and west were to be extended and connected in the new underground station. For several years, the site of the markets was an enormous open pit, nicknamed (&quot;the hole of Les Halles&quot;), regarded as an eyesore at the foot of the historic church of Saint-Eustache. The construction on Paris&#x27;s new central railway hub was completed in 1977.
The , a partially underground multiple story commercial and shopping centre, designed by Claude Vasconi and Georges Pencreac&#x27;h, opened at the east end of the site on 4 September 1979 in the presence of the Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac. A public garden covering opened in 1986. Many of the surrounding streets were pedestrianized.

The demolition of Baltard&#x27;s market hall structure and the design of the spaces that replaced it proved highly controversial over the subsequent decades. The critic Oliver Wainwright called the razing &quot;one of the worst acts of urban vandalism of the century&quot;, and that the place became a &quot;national embarrassment&quot; with the park &quot;a magnet for drug dealing&quot;. Historian Donato Severo called the events &quot;the most violent act ever committed against the heritage of Paris&quot;, with architect Lloyd Alter adding that the replacement complex was &quot;nearly universally reviled for its mean spirit&quot;.

===21st century redesign===
Against that background, in 2002 Mayor Bertrand Delanoë announced that the City of Paris would begin public consultations regarding the remodeling of the area, calling Les Halles &quot;a soulless, architecturally bombastic concrete jungle&quot;.

A design competition for the Forum and gardens was held, with entries from Jean Nouvel, Winy Maas, David Mangin, and Rem Koolhaas. Mangin&#x27;s design for the gardens, which proposed replacing the landscaped mounds and paths of the 1980s design with a simplified pattern of east–west pedestrian promenades and a large central lawn, was selected. The plan also included extending the pedestrianized area further east to include all the streets bordering the gardens. Another competition was held for the redesign of the Forum. Ten teams submitted plans, and the proposal by Patrick Berger and Jacques Anziutti was selected in 2007. Their design included a large undulating glass canopy covering the redesigned Forum. STIF and RATP began plans for the remodeling of the Châtelet-Les-Halles station in 2007, and the following year Berger and Anziutti were awarded a contract for redesign of the station.

The station redesign included new entrances on Rue Berger, Rue Rambuteau, and Place Marguerite de Navarre, an expanded RER concourse, and improved pedestrian circulation. Construction began in 2010 on the gardens, Forum, and station. The canopy over the Forum was inaugurated in April 2016; construction finished in 2018.

==In popular culture==

* Scenes of the old Les Halles marketplace can be seen in the films (1958) and in and (both 1963).
* Part of the actual demolition of the site is featured in the 1974 film (&quot;Don&#x27;t Touch the White Woman!&quot;), which iconoclastically restages General Custer&#x27;s &#x27;last stand&#x27; in a distinctly French context in and around the area.
* In 1977, Roberto Rossellini made a 54-minute documentary film that testified to the public&#x27;s response to the demolition of Les Halles and the construction of . &quot;The result was a sceptical vision rather than a pure celebration.&quot;
* The 1998 action movie &quot;Ronin&quot;, well known for its famous car chase scenes, used the Les Halles tunnel network as one of the locations for the final emblematic pursuit across Paris.
* The open-air market and Baltard&#x27;s pavilions were digitally reconstructed for the 2004 film (&quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;), which was set after the First World War.
* The Revolution-era version of Les Halles and Halles aux Blés can be found in the 2014 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot;, where the observational tower built by Catherine de Médici beside the pavilion acts as the district&#x27;s synchronisation point. It serves as the location for a mission, which results in an explosion and the severe burning of the interior.

<text>Major League Soccer (MLS) is a professional soccer league in North America and the highest level of the United States soccer league system. It comprises 30 teams, with 27 in the United States and 3 in Canada, and is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation. MLS is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The league is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

The predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984. MLS was founded in 1993 as part of the United States&#x27; successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The inaugural season took place in 1996 with ten teams. MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years, losing millions of dollars and folding two teams in 2002. Since then, developments such as the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums around the league, the implementation of the Designated Player Rule allowing teams to sign star players such as David Beckham and Lionel Messi, and national TV contracts have made MLS profitable. 

In 2022, with an average attendance of over 21,000 per game, MLS had the fourth-highest average attendance of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, behind the National Football League (NFL) with over 69,000 fans per game, Major League Baseball (MLB) with over 26,000 fans per game, and the Canadian Football League (CFL) with over 21,700 fans per game. Two years later, MLS was ranked second in the most attended soccer leagues in the world, only trailing the Premier League.

The MLS regular season typically starts in late February or early March and runs through mid-October, with each team playing 34 games; the team with the best record is awarded the Supporters&#x27; Shield. Eighteen teams compete in the postseason MLS Cup playoffs in late October and November, culminating in the league&#x27;s championship game, MLS Cup. Instead of operating as an association of independently owned clubs, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned by the league and individually operated by the league&#x27;s investors. The league has a fixed membership like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada and Mexico&#x27;s Liga MX which makes it one of the few soccer leagues that does not use a promotion and relegation process. 

The LA Galaxy have the most MLS Cups, with six. They are tied with D.C. United for most Supporters&#x27; Shields, with four each.

==Competition format==
Major League Soccer&#x27;s regular season runs from late February or early March to October. Teams are geographically divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences, playing 34 games in an unbalanced schedule. With 30 teams in 2025, each team plays two games (home and away) against the others teams within their conference, and six games against teams from the opposite conference. The 2020 season was the first season in league history in which teams did not play against every other team in the league. At the end of the regular season, the team with the highest point total is awarded the Supporters&#x27; Shield and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

Teams break for the annual All-Star Game midway through the season, an exhibition game containing the league&#x27;s best players. The format of the All-Star Game has changed several times since the league&#x27;s inception; 2020 was the first year in which the MLS All-Stars were planned to play against an all-star team from Mexico&#x27;s Liga MX, before the event&#x27;s cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2015, the final matchday of the season has been branded as &quot;Decision Day&quot; and has almost all matches played between intra-conference teams kicking off simultaneously during two windows—one for each conference.

Unlike most major soccer leagues around the world, but similar to other leagues in the Americas, the MLS regular season is followed by a postseason knockout tournament to determine the league champion. , eighteen teams participate in the MLS Cup Playoffs in October and November, which concludes with the MLS Cup championship game in early December. The 2023 playoff format includes a pair of single-elimination play-in matches for the two lowest-ranked teams in each conference ahead of a best-of-three round; the round is followed by more single-elimination rounds that lead up to the MLS Cup final.

Major League Soccer&#x27;s spring-to-fall schedule results in scheduling conflicts with the FIFA calendar and with summertime international tournaments such as the World Cup and the Gold Cup, causing some players to miss league matches. While MLS has looked into changing to a fall-to-spring format, there are no current plans to do so. Were the league to change its schedule, a winter break would be necessary to accommodate teams located in harsh winter climates. It would also have to compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL), which all run on fall-to-spring schedules.

===Other competitions===
MLS teams also play in other international and domestic competitions. Each season, up to ten MLS teams play in the CONCACAF Champions Cup (CCC) against other clubs from the CONCACAF region. Four MLS teams qualify based on regular-season results from the previous year: the Supporters&#x27; Shield champion, the team with the highest point total from the opposite conference, and the next two clubs in the Supporters&#x27; Shield rankings. The fifth MLS team to qualify is the reigning MLS Cup champion. An additional U.S.-based MLS team can qualify by winning the U.S. Open Cup. Starting in 2024, the league will send eight teams to participate in the U.S. Open Cup instead of every U.S.-based club, with MLS Next Pro teams as representatives for some teams. MLS had announced their intention to remove itself from the tournament entirely, but reached a compromise with U.S. Soccer to send representatives from clubs that were not participating in the Champions Cup, with the exception of the defending Open Cup champions. The last three teams to qualify are the champion, runner-up, and third-place finisher of the Leagues Cup. Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver compete against other Canadian sides in the Canadian Championship for the one CONCACAF Champions Cup berth allocated to Canada. All three Canadian clubs may also qualify through MLS or the Leagues Cup. If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or they are taken by a Canadian MLS team, the berth is reallocated to the next best team in the overall table. If the U.S. Open Cup winner qualifies through multiple methods, the runner-up fills the slot; should the runner-up qualify, the next best team in the overall table earns the slot. If the Leagues Cup champion wins the MLS Cup, the MLS Cup runner-up qualifies to the round of 16; should a Leagues Cup slot already qualify, MLS is awarded with one additional slot given to the next best non-qualified team in the overall table. Seattle Sounders FC became the first MLS team to win the CONCACAF Champions Cup under the competition&#x27;s updated format in 2022.

Since 2018, the reigning MLS Cup champion plays in the Campeones Cup, a Super Cup-style single game against the Campeón de Campeones from Liga MX, hosted by the MLS team in September. The inaugural edition saw Tigres UANL defeat Toronto FC at BMO Field in Toronto in 2018.

Another inter-league competition with Liga MX, the Leagues Cup, was established in 2019. The 2020 edition of the tournament was originally planned to pair eight MLS clubs against eight Liga MX clubs in a single-elimination tournament hosted in the United States, reviving an inter-league rivalry that previously took place in the now-defunct North American Superliga, before its cancelation. Beginning with the 2023 edition all MLS and Liga MX teams participated in the competition, which functions as the regional cup for the North American zone of CONCACAF. As of the 2025 edition, only 18 MLS clubs will take part.

==Clubs==
The 30 clubs of Major League Soccer are divided between the Eastern and Western conferences. MLS has regularly expanded since the 2005 season, most recently with the addition of San Diego FC in 2025.

The league features numerous rivalry cups that are contested by two or more teams, quite often geographic rivals. Each trophy is awarded to the team with the best record in matches during the regular season involving the participating teams. The concept is comparable to rivalry trophies played for by American college football teams.

MLS features some of the longest travel distances for a domestic soccer league, with Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Inter Miami CF the furthest apart teams at . During the 2018 season, the team with the shortest distance traveled over the entire regular schedule was Toronto FC at , while the longest was Vancouver at .

===Timeline===
==History==

Major League Soccer is the most recent of a series of men&#x27;s premier professional national soccer leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984. The United States did not have a truly national top-flight league with FIFA-sanctioning until the creation of the NASL. The first league to have U.S. and Canadian professional clubs, the NASL struggled until the mid-1970s when the New York Cosmos, the league&#x27;s most prominent team, signed a number of the world&#x27;s best players including Pelé and Franz Beckenbauer. Pelé&#x27;s arrival attracted other well-known international stars to the league including Johan Cruyff, Gerd Müller, Eusébio, Bobby Moore, and George Best. Despite dramatic increases in attendance (with some matches drawing over 70,000 fans such as Soccer Bowl &#x27;78, the highest attendance to date for any club soccer championship in the United States) over-expansion, the economic recession of the early 1980s, and disputes with the players union ultimately led to the collapse of the NASL following the 1984 season, leaving the United States without a top-level soccer league until MLS.

===Establishment and shootout era===

In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the 1994 World Cup, U.S. Soccer promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league. In 1993, U.S. Soccer selected Major League Professional Soccer (the precursor to MLS) as the exclusive Division 1 professional soccer league. Major League Soccer was officially formed in February 1995 as a limited liability company.

Tab Ramos was the first player signed by MLS, on January 3, 1995, and was assigned to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. MLS began play in 1996 with ten teams. The first game was held on April 6, 1996, as the San Jose Clash defeated D.C. United in front of 31,000 fans at Spartan Stadium in San Jose in a game broadcast on ESPN. The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS—including U.S. stars such as Alexi Lalas, Tony Meola and Eric Wynalda, and foreign players such as Mexico&#x27;s Jorge Campos and Colombia&#x27;s Carlos Valderrama.
D.C. United won the MLS Cup in three of the league&#x27;s first four seasons. The league added its first two expansion teams in 1998—the Miami Fusion and the Chicago Fire; the Chicago Fire won its first title in its inaugural season.

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance. The league&#x27;s low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large American football stadiums.
One aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to &quot;Americanize&quot; the sport. The league implemented the use of shootouts to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season.
The league&#x27;s quality was cast into doubt when the U.S. men&#x27;s national team, which was made up largely of MLS players, finished in last place out of the 32 teams at the 1998 World Cup.

The league lost an estimated $250 million during its first five years, and more than $350 million between its founding and 2004.
The league&#x27;s financial problems led to Commissioner Doug Logan being replaced by Don Garber, a former NFL executive, in August 1999. Following decreased attendance and increased losses by late 2001, league officials planned to fold but were able to secure new financing from owners Lamar Hunt, Philip Anschutz, and the Kraft family to take on more teams. MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion, leaving the league with ten teams.

Despite the financial problems, though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for the league&#x27;s resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as Historic Crew Stadium, was built in 1999, becoming MLS&#x27;s first soccer-specific stadium. This began a trend among MLS teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums, where they would not be able to generate revenue from other events. In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, &quot;Fraser v. Major League Soccer&quot;, that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS&#x27;s policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity since MLS was a single entity and therefore incapable of conspiring with itself.

===Resurgence===
The 2002 FIFA World Cup, in which the United States made the quarterfinals, coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS, with MLS Cup 2002 drawing 61,316 spectators to Gillette Stadium, the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final until 2018. MLS limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted International Football Association Board (IFAB) rules in 2005.

MLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the 2006 World Cup. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues. For example, Tim Howard was transferred to Manchester United for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history. Many more American players did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, Jason Kreis became the first player to score 100 career MLS goals.

The league&#x27;s financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums. From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as Lamar Hunt and Phil Anschutz, so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. Real Salt Lake and Chivas USA began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles. By 2006 the San Jose Earthquakes owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion Houston Dynamo, after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that formed in 2007.

===Arrival of Designated Players===

In 2007, the league expanded beyond the United States&#x27; borders into Canada with the Toronto FC expansion team. Major League Soccer took steps to further raise the level of play by adopting the Designated Player Rule, which helped bring international stars into the league.
The 2007 season witnessed the MLS debut of David Beckham. Beckham&#x27;s signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer, and was made possible by the Designated Player Rule. Players such as Cuauhtémoc Blanco (Chicago Fire) and Juan Pablo Ángel (New York Red Bulls), are some of the first Designated Players who made major contributions to their clubs.
The departures of Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, coupled with the return of former U.S. national team stars Claudio Reyna and Brian McBride, highlighted the exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS.

By 2008, San Jose had returned to the league under new ownership, and in 2009, the expansion side Seattle Sounders FC began play in MLS. The Sounders set a new average attendance record for the league, with 30,943 spectators per match, and were the first expansion team to qualify for the playoffs since 1998. The 2010 season ushered in an expansion franchise in the Philadelphia Union and their new PPL Park stadium (now known as Subaru Park). The 2010 season also brought the opening of the New York Red Bulls&#x27; soccer-specific stadium, Red Bull Arena, and the debut of French striker Thierry Henry.

The 2011 season brought further expansion with the addition of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the second Canadian MLS franchise, and the Portland Timbers. Real Salt Lake reached the finals of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League.
During the 2011 season, the Galaxy signed another international star in Republic of Ireland all-time leading goalscorer Robbie Keane. MLS drew an average attendance of 17,872 in 2011, higher than the average attendances of the NBA and NHL. In 2012, the Montreal Impact became the league&#x27;s 19th franchise and the third in Canada, and made their home debut in front of a crowd of 58,912, while the New York Red Bulls added Australian all-time leading goalscorer Tim Cahill.

===Expansion of the league===


In 2012, with an average attendance of over 18,000 per game, MLS had the third highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), and was the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide .

In 2013, MLS introduced New York City FC as its 20th team, and Orlando City Soccer Club as its 21st team, both of which would begin playing in 2015.

In 2013, the league implemented its &quot;Core Players&quot; initiative, allowing teams to retain key players using retention funds instead of losing the players to foreign leagues. Among the first high-profile players re-signed in 2013 using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler.
Beginning in summer of 2013 and continuing in the run up to the 2014 World Cup, MLS began signing U.S. stars based abroad, including Clint Dempsey, Jermaine Jones, and Michael Bradley from Europe; and DaMarcus Beasley from Mexico&#x27;s Liga MX. By the 2014 season, fifteen of the nineteen MLS head coaches had previously played in MLS. By 2013, the league&#x27;s popularity had increased to the point where MLS was as popular as Major League Baseball among 12- to 17-year-olds, as reported by the 2013 Luker on Trends ESPN poll, having jumped in popularity since the 2010 World Cup.

In 2014, the league announced Atlanta United FC as the 22nd team to start playing in 2017. Even though New York City FC and Orlando City were not set to begin play until 2015, each team made headlines during the summer 2014 transfer window by announcing their first Designated Players—Spain&#x27;s leading scorer David Villa and Chelsea&#x27;s leading scorer Frank Lampard to New York, and Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Kaká to Orlando. The 2014 World Cup featured 21 MLS players on World Cup rosters and a record 11 MLS players playing for foreign teams—including players from traditional powerhouses Brazil (Júlio César) and Spain (David Villa); in the U.S. v. Germany match the U.S. fielded a team with seven MLS starters.

On September 18, 2014, MLS unveiled their new logo as part of a branding initiative. In addition to the new crest logo, MLS teams display versions in their own colors on their jerseys. Chivas USA folded following the 2014 season, while New York City FC and Orlando City SC joined the league in 2015 as the 19th and 20th teams. Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference in 2015 to make two 10-team conferences.

In early 2015, the league announced that two teams—Los Angeles FC and Minnesota United FC—would join MLS in either 2017 or 2018. The 20th season of MLS saw the arrivals of several players who have starred at the highest levels of European club soccer and in international soccer: Giovanni dos Santos, Kaká, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Didier Drogba, David Villa, and Sebastian Giovinco. MLS confirmed in August 2016 that Minnesota United would begin play in 2017 along with Atlanta United FC.

In April 2016, the league&#x27;s commissioner Don Garber reiterated the intention of the league to expand to 28 teams, with the next round of expansion &quot;likely happening in 2020&quot;. In December 2016, he updated the expansion plans stating that the league will look to approve the 25th and 26th teams in 2017 and to start play in 2020. In January 2017, the league received bids from 12 ownership groups.

In July 2017, it was reported that Major League Soccer had rejected an offer by MP &amp; Silva to acquire all television rights to the league following the conclusion of its current contracts with Fox, ESPN, and Univision, where MP &amp; Silva insisted that the deal would be conditional on Major League Soccer adopting a promotion and relegation system. The league stated that it rejected the offer due to the exclusive periods that the current rightsholders have to negotiate extensions to their contracts. Additionally, media noted that Major League Soccer has long-opposed the adoption of promotion and relegation, continuing to utilize the fixed, franchise-based model used in other U.S. sports leagues. Furthermore, MP &amp; Silva founder Riccardo Silva also owned Miami FC of the NASL, which stood to benefit from such a promotion and relegation system.

In October 2017, Columbus Crew owner Anthony Precourt announced plans to move the franchise to Austin, Texas by 2019. The announcement spawned a league-wide backlash and legal action against the league by the Ohio state government. On August 15, 2018, the Austin City Council voted to approve an agreement with Precourt to move Crew SC to Austin, and on August 22, 2018, the club&#x27;s new name, Austin FC, was announced. After negotiations between Precourt and Jimmy Haslam, owner of the Cleveland Browns, were announced, MLS made it clear that Austin would receive an expansion team only after a deal to sell Columbus to a local buyer had completed. The purchase of Crew SC by Haslam&#x27;s group was finalized in late December 2018, and on January 15, 2019, Austin FC was officially announced as a 2021 MLS entry.

MLS announced on December 20, 2017, that it would be awarding an expansion franchise to Nashville, Tennessee, to play in a yet-to-be-built 27,000-seat soccer-specific stadium, Nashville Fairgrounds Stadium, and would join MLS in 2020. The management of the Nashville franchise announced in February 2019 that the MLS side would assume the Nashville SC name then in use by the city&#x27;s USL Championship team.

On January 29, 2018, MLS awarded Miami an expansion team, led by David Beckham. Inter Miami CF started MLS play on March 1, 2020, and plan on opening the proposed 25,000-seat stadium sometime in the near future. An expansion team was awarded to Cincinnati, Ohio on May 29, 2018, to the ownership group of USL&#x27;s FC Cincinnati. The team, which assumed the existing FC Cincinnati name, started MLS play in 2019 and moved to the new 26,000-seat TQL Stadium in 2021.

The league planned to expand to 30 teams with the addition of Austin FC in 2021, Charlotte in 2022, and Sacramento and St. Louis in 2023; however, this was reduced to 29 after Sacramento Republic FC&#x27;s bid was placed on indefinite hold. Commissioner Don Garber has suggested that another round of expansion could lead to 32 teams in MLS.

The league suspended its 2020 season on March 12, 2020, after two weeks, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and other U.S.-based sports leagues did the same. The 2020 season resumed in July with the MLS is Back Tournament, a competition in which 24 out of the 26 teams competed at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando for a spot in the CONCACAF Champions League. In September 2020, the league announced the formation of MLS Next, an academy league for MLS academy teams from the under-13 to under-19 level.

In 2022, the league signed a $2.5 billion, 10-year deal with Apple Inc. that made Apple TV the primary broadcaster for all MLS games beginning in 2023. The agreement also included MLS and Leagues Cup games shared across the streaming service. Subscriptions were provided for free for season ticket holders of clubs and certain matches were made free to all users. The schedule was adjusted as a result of the deal, with start times generally at 7:30 p.m. local time on Wednesdays and Saturdays rather than staggered across the matchday.

In May 2023, the league announced it would expand to 30 teams with the addition of San Diego FC for the 2025 season. The 2024 season broke attendance records, with an average of 23,240 per match and over 11 million total spectators. The presence of Lionel Messi and other star players was credited with contributing to the record crowds, which included several matches moved to larger venues.

====Expansion fees====
In 2005, Toronto FC&#x27;s ownership paid $10 million (about $16 million in 2024) to join the league in 2007; San Jose paid $20 million the next year, and the fee had risen to $30 million when Sounders FC paid the fee in 2007 to join the league in 2009. In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record $100 million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015. This record was surpassed by the ownership groups of FC Cincinnati and Nashville SC, which each paid $150 million to join MLS 2019 and 2020, respectively. Despite being announced in January 2018, Inter Miami CF only paid a $25 million expansion fee due to a clause in part-owner David Beckham&#x27;s original playing contract signed in 2007. $150 million was paid as an effective entrance fee by a group that bought Columbus Crew in 2018, which led to that team&#x27;s previous operator receiving rights to Austin FC, which joined MLS in 2021. In 2019, Charlotte FC agreed to a reported $325 million expansion fee. The most recent expansion team, San Diego FC paid a record $500 million fee in 2023.

==League championships==
As of the 2024 season, 32 different clubs have competed in the league, with 15 having won at least one MLS Cup, and 16 winning at least one Supporters&#x27; Shield. The two trophies have been won by the same club in the same year on eight occasions (two clubs have accomplished the feat twice). Of these teams only one, Toronto FC have also won their national elite knockout tournament (In Toronto FC&#x27;s case, the Canadian Championship) in the same year for a domestic treble.


==Organization==

===Ownership===

Major League Soccer operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and player contracts are centrally owned by the league. Each team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league. In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In &quot;Fraser v. Major League Soccer&quot;, a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services. The court also ruled that even absent their collective bargaining agreement, players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.

Having multiple clubs operated by a single investor was a necessity in the league&#x27;s first ten years. At one time, Phil Anschutz&#x27;s AEG operated six MLS franchises and Lamar Hunt&#x27;s Hunt Sports operated three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club operator. These changes included granting operators the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club&#x27;s academy system each year, sharing the profits of Soccer United Marketing, and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.

As MLS appeared to be on the brink of overall profitability in 2006 and developed significant expansion plans, MLS announced that it wanted each club to have a distinct operator. The league has attracted new investors that have injected more money into the league. Examples include Red Bull&#x27;s purchase of the MetroStars from AEG in 2006 for over $100 million. For the 2014 season, the league assumed control of the former Chivas USA club, which had suffered from mismanagement and poor financial results under its individual operator relationship. The league eventually dissolved the team, in favor of awarding rights to a second soccer club in the Los Angeles area to a new investor group on October 30, 2014.

The league now has 30 investor-operators for its 30 current clubs, with no member of any club&#x27;s investor group having a stake in that of any other club. Since December 2015, when AEG sold its remaining 50% interest in the Houston Dynamo, the former multiple-team operators AEG and Hunt Sports, with the LA Galaxy and FC Dallas respectively, now only control one franchise.

===League executives===
Don Garber has been the commissioner of Major League Soccer since 1999, serving as the league&#x27;s chief executive. The league&#x27;s first commissioner was Doug Logan, who served in the role from 1995 to 1999.

Mark Abbott, a former MLS business partner, has served as the league&#x27;s president and Deputy Commissioner since 2006.

===Player acquisition and salaries===

In 2016, the average salary for MLS players was $373,094, lower than the average salaries in England&#x27;s second-tier EFL Championship ($420,000 in 2015), the Netherlands&#x27; Eredivisie ($445,000), or Mexico&#x27;s Liga MX ($418,000 in 2015). The league&#x27;s minimum player salary increased in 2017 to $65,000 for most players, and roster players #25–30 saw their minimum salary increased to $53,000.

MLS salaries are limited by a salary cap, which MLS has had in place since the league&#x27;s inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team&#x27;s owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams. The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the &quot;Fraser v. Major League Soccer&quot; lawsuit. The 2017 salary cap increased to $3.845 million per team. Each team is allowed up to 30 players on its first team roster. All 30 players are eligible for selection to each 18-player game-day squad during the regular season and playoffs.

Teams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two transfer windows—the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August. When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining from 33% to 75% depending on the player&#x27;s status and tenure.
MLS teams have a limited number of international roster slots that they can use to sign non-domestic players. However, MLS teams often obtain green cards for their non-domestic players in order to qualify them for domestic status and thus free up international roster slots. In 2015, 49% of MLS players were born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.

MLS has a set of pool goalkeepers who are signed to a contract with the league and are loaned to teams during emergencies in which they are missing a goalkeeper due to injuries or suspensions. The pool goalkeeper trains with an MLS club or an affiliated team when not assigned to a team; some pool goalkeepers, including Tim Melia, have gone on to be signed to permanent contract with their assigned teams. In the past, when rosters were smaller, there were multiple goalkeepers signed to the pool, however, in recent years only one or two keepers are signed as team rosters are much larger.

====Designated Players and allocation money====
MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.

The designated player (DP) rule allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap; in 2017, each DP player only counted as $480,625 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap. Instituted in 2007, England&#x27;s David Beckham was the first signing under the DP rule. The DP rule has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum. In the 2013 season, 21% of the league&#x27;s wage spending went to just five players; this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.

The league&#x27;s &quot;Core Players&quot; initiative allows teams to re-sign players using retention funds that do not count against the salary cap. Retention funds were implemented in 2013 as a mechanism for MLS to retain key players; among the first high-profile players re-signed using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler. MLS teams can also obtain allocation money, which is money that the team can use on player salaries that does not count against the cap, and teams can earn allocation money in several ways, such as from the transfer fees earned by selling players to teams in other leagues. MLS teams can also use Targeted Allocation Money (often referred to as TAM), an initiative announced in 2015. Teams can use TAM funds to attract high-profile players by &quot;buying down&quot; contracts of players to below the Designated Player level. High-profile players for which TAM funds were used include Hector Villalba, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Giorgio Chiellini.

===Youth development===

MLS has introduced various initiatives and rules intended to develop young players. Rules concerning Generation Adidas players and home grown players provide incentives for clubs to develop and retain young players.

MLS has required all of its teams to operate youth development programs since 2008. MLS roster rules allow teams to sign an unlimited number of players straight from their academies and bypassing the draft process. There is also supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds. One of the most prominent and lucrative examples of success in &quot;home-grown&quot; development was Jozy Altidore, who rose to prominence as a teenager in MLS before his record transfer fee $10 million move to Villarreal in Spain in 2008. The various MLS teams&#x27; development academies play matches in a U.S. Soccer developmental league against youth academies from other leagues such as the North American Soccer League (NASL), which had been a Division II league prior to 2018, and USL Pro, originally a Division III league but now the Division II USL Championship.

The league operates a Generation Adidas program, which is a joint venture between MLS and U.S. Soccer that encourages young American players to enter MLS. The Generation Adidas program has been in place since 1997, and has introduced players such as Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and Michael Bradley into MLS. Players under the Home Grown Player rule are signed to Generation Adidas contracts, all players on Generation Adidas contracts are &quot;off budget players&quot; and their salaries do not count against the cap.

MLS has operated reserve leagues, which give playing time to players who were not starters for their MLS teams, during two different periods. The MLS Reserve League was formed in 2005, and operated through 2014 (with the exception of the 2009 &amp; 2010 seasons). MLS began integrating its Reserve League with the league then known as USL Pro in 2013, and after the 2014 season folded the Reserve League, with MLS then requiring all teams to either affiliate with a USL team or field their own reserve side in that league. However, this requirement was never strictly enforced, and MLS eventually relaunched its reserve league in 2022 under the banner of MLS Next Pro. In the inaugural 2022 season, 19 of the league&#x27;s then-current clubs, plus future club St. Louis City SC, fielded reserve sides in Next Pro. In the 2023 season, the only MLS teams that will not field Next Pro sides are CF Montréal and D.C. United.

Following the folding of the Development Academy, MLS announced its own development league in 2020. It includes all of the MLS team academies as well as 95 clubs across the country; many of which were a part of the Development Academy.

===Stadiums===

Since 1999, the league has overseen the construction of twelve stadiums specifically designed for soccer. The development of soccer-specific stadiums owned by the teams has generated a better gameday experience for the fans. The soccer-specific stadiums have yielded positive financial results as teams were no longer required to pay to rent out facilities and gained control over revenue streams such as concessions, parking, naming rights, and the ability to host non-MLS events. Several teams have doubled their season tickets following the team&#x27;s move into a soccer-specific stadium. The establishment of soccer-specific stadiums is considered the key to the league and the ability of teams to turn a profit. In 2006, Tim Leiweke, then CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group, described the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums as the turning point for MLS.

Columbus Crew owner Lamar Hunt started this trend in 1999 by constructing Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as Historic Crew Stadium, as MLS&#x27;s first soccer-specific stadium. The Los Angeles Galaxy followed four years later with the opening of the Home Depot Center, now Dignity Health Sports Park, in 2003. FC Dallas opened Pizza Hut Park, now Toyota Stadium, in 2005, and the Chicago Fire began playing their home games in Toyota Park, now SeatGeek Stadium, in 2006. The 2007 season brought the opening of Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park for the Colorado Rapids and BMO Field for Toronto FC.

Near the end of the 2008 season, Rio Tinto Stadium (now known as America First Field) became the home of Real Salt Lake, which meant that for the first time in MLS history a majority of MLS&#x27;s teams (8 out of 14) played in soccer-specific stadiums. Red Bull Arena, the new home of the New York Red Bulls opened for the start of the 2010 season, and the Philadelphia Union opened PPL Park, now Subaru Park, in June 2010, midway through their inaugural season.

The following season, in 2011, the Portland Timbers made their MLS debut in a newly renovated Jeld-Wen Field, now renamed Providence Park, which was originally a multi-purpose venue but turned into a soccer-specific facility. Also in 2011, Sporting Kansas City moved to new Livestrong Sporting Park, now Children&#x27;s Mercy Park. The Houston Dynamo relocated to their new home at BBVA Compass Stadium, now Shell Energy Stadium, in 2012. In the same year, the Montreal Impact joined the league in an expanded Stade Saputo, which reopened in June 2012, when renovations pushed the seating capacity to over 20,000. The Impact has used Olympic Stadium for early season matches and for games that require a larger capacity. The San Jose Earthquakes, who had played at Buck Shaw Stadium from 2008 until 2014, opened their new Avaya Stadium (now PayPal Park) before the 2015 season. Orlando City SC intended to begin constructing its soccer-specific stadium, now known as Exploria Stadium, in 2014 to be completed in 2015. Delays caused by changes to the stadium plans pushed back the new venue&#x27;s opening, first to late 2016 and finally to the start of the 2017 season. Orlando City played at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, now Camping World Stadium, while awaiting the construction of their new venue through the 2016 season. Exploria Stadium hosted its first MLS match on March 5, 2017, against New York City FC as Orlando City Stadium.

The development of additional MLS stadiums has continued to progress. D.C. United had played their home games at former NFL and Major League Baseball venue RFK Stadium. In 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private partnership term sheet to build a new soccer stadium in Washington, D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014. In late February 2017, D.C. United finally broke ground on their new stadium, Audi Field. After 21 years of playing at RFK Stadium, D.C. United played their first game at Audi Field in July 2018.

Two teams have announced their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. New York City FC play home games at Yankee Stadium, a Major League Baseball venue, although they intend to move into a soccer-specific stadium in the future. The New England Revolution play home games at Gillette Stadium which is an NFL Stadium also owned by the Revolution&#x27;s owner, Robert Kraft. The team are currently in discussion with the City of Boston regarding a potential soccer-specific stadium in South Boston.

Several remaining clubs play in stadiums not originally built for MLS and have not announced plans to move. The Seattle Sounders FC play at Lumen Field, a dual-purpose facility used for both American football and soccer. The Vancouver Whitecaps FC joined the league with Portland in 2011 and temporarily held matches at Empire Field before moving into the refurbished BC Place in October 2011, a retractable-roof stadium that hosts Canadian football as well as soccer.

Of the three teams that made their MLS debuts in 2017 and 2018, one opened a soccer-specific stadium in 2019, a second is playing in a shared football stadium, and the last opened a soccer-specific stadium for its inaugural 2018 season. Minnesota United FC, which debuted in 2017, built Allianz Field in St. Paul which hosted its inaugural game against New York City FC on April 13, 2019. Until that time, the team played in Minneapolis at TCF Bank Stadium (now Huntington Bank Stadium), home to University of Minnesota football. Atlanta United FC began play in 2017 at a college football facility, Georgia Tech&#x27;s Bobby Dodd Stadium, before moving into its permanent home at the retractable-roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which it shares with the NFL&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons; the two teams share a common owner and the stadium is equipped with screens to cordon off the upper tiers for most matches. Los Angeles FC, which began play in 2018, opened Banc of California Stadium (now BMO Stadium) on the former site of the Los Angeles Sports Arena in April of its inaugural season.

FC Cincinnati made its MLS debut in 2019 at Nippert Stadium, the football home of the University of Cincinnati. The stadium had been home to FCC&#x27;s USL Championship predecessor for all of its three seasons of play. The club moved within Cincinnati to the new TQL Stadium in 2021. Inter Miami began play in 2020 at Inter Miami CF Stadium, now known as Chase Stadium, at the former site of Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale before opening Miami Freedom Park in the future. Nashville SC played the 2020 and 2021 seasons at an NFL facility, the Tennessee Titans&#x27; Nissan Stadium, before opening Geodis Park in 2022. Austin FC opened Q2 Stadium for its first season in 2021. St. Louis City SC opened CityPark in November 2022, a few months before the club&#x27;s first season in 2023. Construction of Eleven Park was tied to an application for an Indianapolis-based MLS team, initialized in 2024.

===Profitability and revenues===

Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS&#x27;s financial security. As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands, and television coverage increases, MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling costs.

Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league&#x27;s early years. In 2006, MLS reached an 8-year TV deal with ESPN spanning the 2007–2014 seasons, and marked the first time that MLS earned rights fees, reported to be worth $7–8 million annually. In September 2012 the league extended its distribution agreement with London-based Media rights agency MP &amp; Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $10 million annually. Total league TV revenues are over $40 million annually. In 2011, MLS earned $150 million when it sold a 25% stake in SUM.


In early 2005, MLS signed a 10-year, $150 million sponsorship deal with Adidas for its jerseys and other equipment. In 2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, specifically soccer. MLS established a floor of $500,000 per shirt sponsorship, with the league receiving a flat fee of $200,000 per deal. As of July 2014, sixteen teams had signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed on the front of their jerseys (and another team is directly owned by its shirt sponsor), and the league average from jersey sponsors was about $2.4 million. Sleeve sponsorship was introduced to MLS in the 2020 season, with the teams able to sell a section on the right arm where the league logo patch is normally positioned. 

The Los Angeles Galaxy made a profit in 2003 in their first season at The Home Depot Center, and FC Dallas turned a profit after moving into Pizza Hut Park in 2005. For each season between 2006 and 2009, two to three MLS clubs (generally clubs with a soccer-specific stadium) were reported as profitable by the league. In November 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; published a report that revealed that ten of the league&#x27;s nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league&#x27;s collective annual revenues were $494 million, and that the league&#x27;s collective annual profit was $34 million. Forbes valued the league&#x27;s franchises to be worth $103 million on average, almost three times as much as the $37 million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175 million, a 483% gain over the $30 million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.

The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 &quot;Forbes&quot; updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million. In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Atlanta United FC is the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million. These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs. A &quot;Sportico&quot; ranking of club valuations in 2024 placed 20 MLS teams in the top 50 globally, with Los Angeles FC the most valuable at $1.15 billion (15th overall).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, MLS teams typically used commercial flights to transport players and staff between matches, with only four charter flights allowed under league rules. These commercial flights were often non-direct, requiring transfers and layovers, and contributed to long travel days. The number of charters allowed for league matches was increased to eight legs prior to the 2020 season and lifted entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sun Country Airlines has provided charter service to MLS teams since 2020 and became the league&#x27;s official carrier in 2022.

===Rules and officials===
When the league began play, it tried to gain popularity by &quot;Americanizing&quot; the game: the game clock counted down in each half and stopped for certain dead ball situations and games level at the end of regulation were resolved with a running penalty shootout. Now MLS follows the rules and standards of the International Football Association Board (IFAB).
Since 2005, the playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a penalty shootout if necessary.

U.S. Soccer hired the first full-time professional referees in league history in 2007 as part of the league&#x27;s &quot;Game First&quot; initiatives.
Major League Soccer has been implementing fines and suspensions since the 2011 season for simulation (diving) through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match. The first player fined under the new rule was Charlie Davies, fined $1,000 for intentionally deceiving match officials.

MLS uses the list of banned substances published by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

===Branding===
The current MLS logo debuted in 2014, ahead of the league&#x27;s 20th season, replacing an earlier logo that featured a stylized boot and ball. The current logo is a simple crest with a diagonal stripe, the MLS wordmark, and three stars that represent &quot;community, club, and country&quot;. The logo was designed to be remixed in different color schemes that match teams when used on merchandise and jerseys.

The first MLS anthem was unveiled in 2007 and was composed by Audiobrain. The current league anthem debuted in 2020 and was composed by film score composer Hans Zimmer. It will be used during league broadcasts and as a prelude to kickoff at stadiums.

====Team names====
In the early years of MLS, teams were typically given official nicknames in the style of other U.S. sports leagues (e.g., Columbus Crew, Los Angeles Galaxy, New England Revolution). Several club names in MLS originated with previous professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era NASL team names San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers, and Vancouver Whitecaps.

D.C. United was the only MLS team to adopt European naming conventions during the 1990s. In more recent years, European-style names have become increasingly common in MLS, with expansion teams such as Real Salt Lake, Toronto FC, New York City FC, Atlanta United FC, Minnesota United FC, and FC Cincinnati, along with rebrandings such as FC Dallas (formerly the Dallas Burn), Sporting Kansas City (formerly the Kansas City Wizards), and CF Montréal (formerly the Montreal Impact).

Austrian beverage company Red Bull GmbH owns and sponsors the New York Red Bulls as well as other sports teams outside the U.S.

==Media coverage==

===MLS Season Pass on Apple TV===
Since 2023, all MLS and Leagues Cup matches, as well as certain matches from MLS Next Pro and MLS Next, are streamed worldwide on MLS Season Pass via Apple TV. This agreement ended the previous regional sports network-based system. The contract allows for some broadcasts on linear television. ESPN and Univision exited negotiations, apparently because MLS would not allow them to stream via their own platforms or use their own commentators. Following their departures, Fox Sports joined Apple as MLS&#x27;s linear broadcast partners in the U.S., with Bell Media&#x27;s TSN and RDS doing so in Canada.

===United States===
From 2012 to 2014, MLS matches were broadcast by NBC Sports, with 40 matches per year—primarily on NBCSN, and select matches broadcast on the NBC network. The move from Fox Soccer to the more widely distributed NBCSN caused viewership numbers to double for the 2012 season.

Soccer United Marketing partnered with Google and Bedrocket Media Ventures in 2012 to launch &quot;KickTV&quot;, a premium YouTube channel with original soccer programming. KickTV was sold to Copa90 in 2015 to form its American branch. In 2020, Soccer United Marketing signed a multi-year agreement with Bleacher Report to produce content and highlights for MLS and the U.S. national teams through the 2022 season.

From 2015 to 2022, MLS matches were broadcast nationally by ESPN networks and Fox Sports in English, and Univision networks in Spanish under an eight-year contract. Each broadcaster had a window for national regular season matches, with UniMás airing a game on Friday nights in Spanish and additional matches on Univision Deportes Network, and ESPN and Fox Sports 1 airing games on Sunday evenings in English. ESPN, FS1, and Univision shared coverage of the playoffs, while ABC and Fox alternated broadcasting the MLS Cup final in English. In total, at least 125 matches were aired per-season across all three networks. The three contracts have an average estimated value of $90 million per season—five times larger than the average $18 million value of the previous contracts with ESPN, Univision, and NBC Sports.

Matches not televised nationally were broadcast regionally, often by regional sports networks like Bally Sports, NBC Sports Regional Networks, Spectrum Sports and Root Sports, and sometimes by terrestrial stations like KTXA, WGN and KMYU. Regionally televised matches were available outside their local markets on ESPN+, which replaced MLS Live from 2018 until 2022.

===Canada===
Currently, English-language national MLS broadcast rights in Canada are held by the TSN networks through a five-year deal first renewed in 2017. The networks primarily broadcast matches involving the league&#x27;s Canadian franchises, in combination with separate &quot;regional&quot; rights deals giving TSN exclusive rights to all Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC matches. A limited number of matches are also carried by CTV.

TVA Sports holds exclusive French-language rights to MLS in Canada as of the 2017 season. As part of a separate &quot;regional&quot; rights deal, it also holds exclusive rights to all CF Montréal games.

In 2018, online streaming service DAZN obtained Major League Soccer&#x27;s digital out-of-market service MLS Live with live and on-demand streaming of matches featuring U.S. teams (matches with Canadian teams are only available after a 48-hour delay to protect the league&#x27;s main rightsholders TSN and TVA Sports).

===International===
MLS also entered into a four-year contract with Sky Sports to broadcast two MLS matches per week in the United Kingdom and Ireland from 2015 to 2019. As part of the agreement, Sky Sports broadcast at least two MLS regular-season matches each week, as well as the MLS All-Star Game, every MLS Cup Playoff game, and the MLS Cup final. The matches appeared across Sky&#x27;s family of networks. It also carried weekly MLS highlights across various platforms, including Sky Sports News and SkySports.com. Sky Sports also broadcast at least one match from MLS&#x27;s &quot;Decision Day&quot; – the final day of the MLS regular season. Many of the matches on Decision Day every year are expected to determine the final spots for the MLS Cup Playoffs.

DSport, owned by Discovery Communications, began televising league matches in India in 2017.

===Video games===

Major League Soccer is a playable league in the EA Sports FC series, the eFootball series, and the Football Manager series. The league made its video game debut in 1999 with FIFA 2000. Kids video game company Humongous Entertainment had the rights to teams and players for their game, Backyard Soccer MLS Edition and for Backyard Soccer 2004. In 2000, Konami released &quot;ESPN MLS GameNight&quot;, and two years later, they released its sequel, &quot;ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002&quot;. The league made its first appearance in the management series &quot;Football Manager 2005&quot; in 2004.

<doc id="71807" wikidata="Q721851" url="?curid=71807" title="List of rulers of Monaco">
<text>This article lists the rulers of Monaco. Most belong to the House of Grimaldi; exceptions, which consist primarily of the principality&#x27;s administrators under periods of foreign occupation, are noted.

==History==

The House of Grimaldi, descended from Otto Canella, a statesman from the Republic of Genoa, and taking their name from his son Grimaldo, were an ancient and prominent Guelphic Genoese family. Members of this family, in the course of the civil strife in Genoa between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, were banned from Genoa in 1271 and took refuge in Monaco.

François Grimaldi seized the Rock of Monaco in 1297, starting the Grimaldi dynasty, under the Genoese sovereignty. The Grimaldis acquired Menton in 1346 and Roquebrune in 1355, enlarging their possessions. These two towns (some 95% of the country&#x27;s territory) were eventually ceded to France by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty in 1861.

The Grimaldis used the title of Lord until 1612. Then, Lord Honoré II started using the title of Prince, thereby becoming the first Prince of Monaco. Afterwards, Honoré II secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from France by the Treaty of Péronne in 1641. Since then the area has remained under the control of the Grimaldi family to the present day, except when under French control from 24 February 1793 to 17 May 1814.

<doc id="71808" wikidata="Q1774339" url="?curid=71808" title="Women's United Soccer Association">
<text>The Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) was the world&#x27;s first women&#x27;s soccer league in which all the players were paid as professionals. Founded in February 2000, the league began its first season in April 2001 with eight teams in the United States. The league suspended operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the end of its third season, after making cumulative losses of around US$100 million.

==History==
=== Establishment===
As a result of the US women&#x27;s national team&#x27;s (USWNT) first-place showing in the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, a seemingly viable market for the sport germinated.

Feeding on the momentum of their victory, the twenty USWNT players, in partnership with John Hendricks of the Discovery Channel, sought out the investors, markets, and players necessary to form an eight-team league. The twenty founding players were Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, Tracy Ducar, Lorrie Fair, Joy Fawcett, Danielle Fotopoulos, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Shannon MacMillan, Tiffeny Milbrett, Carla Overbeck, Cindy Parlow, Christie Pearce, Tiffany Roberts, Briana Scurry, Kate (Markgraf) Sobrero, Tisha Venturini, Saskia Webber, and Sara Whalen.

Initial investment in the league was provided by the following:

* Time Warner Cable, $5 million 
* Cox Enterprises, $5 million
* Cox Communications, $5 million
* Amos Hostetter Jr., $5 million
* Comcast Corporation, $5 million
* John Hendricks and Comcast Corporation, $2.5 million each
* Amos Hostetter Jr. and John Hendricks, $2.5 million each

The U.S. Soccer Federation approved membership of the league as a sanctioned Division 1 women&#x27;s professional soccer league on August 18, 2000. Tony DiCicco was made commissioner.

==Media coverage==
At various times, games were televised on TNT, CNNSI, ESPN2, PAX TV, and various local and regional sports channels via Comcast, Cox, Fox, AT&amp;T, and MSG.

===TNT and CNN/SI (2001)===
TNT broadcast the first WUSA game on April 21, 2001, which was contest between the Atlanta Beat and New York Power at Bobby Dodd Stadium in Atlanta. Former U.S. national team member Wendy Gebauer Palladino helped called the game alongside broadcaster JP Dellacamera and American soccer great Michelle Akers. About 22 games were scheduled to be broadcast nationally on TNT or CNN/SI in 2001. 15 games were initially expected to be shown on TNT and seven games on CNN/SI over the course of June to August. The deal included broadcast of playoffs and the championship game, the Founders Cup. During a four-year span, TNT and CNN/SI were due to televise at least 88 games, under a $3 million TV contract.

Ratings were not available for CNN/SI for the 2001 season as the cable TV provider did not reach enough households to be a statistical factor.

===Pax (2002–2003)===
After the 2001 season, the WUSA opted out of its four-year agreement to go with a two-year pact with the Pax network. The WUSA&#x27;s reasoning that Pax&#x27;s offer for a 4 p.m. Saturday timeslot was more desirable than the noon timeslot that TNT offered.

The change from TNT and CNN/SI to Pax however, may have immediately depressed ratings by confusing fans. To be more specific, the WUSA&#x27;s ratings plunged from the 0.4 to 0.2 average it got on TNT to a 0.1 average on Pax. In other words, where as an average of 425,000 households tuned in to watch the games on TNT, fewer than 100,000 watched them on Pax. Keep in mind that Pax was a station available in 90 million, 5 million more than TNT. The move to Pax also came as AOL Time Warner considered morphing CNN/SI into a basketball channel that would be co-owned with the National Basketball Association.

Pax&#x27;s coverage in itself, concerned the broadcast of the &quot;WUSA Game of the Week&quot;, on 19 consecutive Saturdays beginning in April at 4:00 p.m. (ET). In 2003, the league wouldn&#x27;t decide on the opponents for the final Pax &quot;Game of the Week&quot; on August 9 in order to provide soccer fans with the best possible matchup with playoff implications. The decision on the two opponents for the August 9 game would be made in early August. In total, Pax was scheduled to televise 18 regular season games and one WUSA Playoff Semifinal in the second week of August.

Pax would receive certain cross-promotional opportunities with the league, including signs at each team venue, although the WUSA would handle ad sales for the games. The agreement carried a reported value of $2 million.

===ESPN2 (2003)===
For the WUSA&#x27;s third and final season, they announced that ESPN2 would join Pax in broadcasting 23 league games in 2003. This would begin with a rematch of Founders Cup II with the Washington Freedom visit the Carolina Courage on April 5. ESPN2 was scheduled to broadcast only four of the 23 nationally televised games. This included the All-Star Game on June 19 and the Founders Cup on August 24. Beth Mowins and Anson Dorrance handled WUSA games on not just Pax but ESPN2 also.

The WUSA ultimately scored a 0.1 percent rating on Pax and 0.2 percent on ESPN2.

== Teams ==

The WUSA franchises were located in Philadelphia; Boston; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Cary, N.C.; Atlanta; San Jose, Ca.; and San Diego:


For the inaugural season, each roster primarily consisted of players from the United States, although up to four international players were allowed on each team&#x27;s roster. Among the international players were China&#x27;s Sun Wen, Pu Wei, Fan Yunjie, Zhang Ouying, Gao Hong, Zhao Lihong, and Bai Jie; Germany&#x27;s Birgit Prinz, Conny Pohlers, Steffi Jones and Maren Meinert; Norway&#x27;s Hege Riise, Unni Lehn, and Dagny Mellgren; Brazil&#x27;s Sissi, Kátia and Pretinha; and Canada&#x27;s Charmaine Hooper, Sharolta Nonen, and Christine Latham.

The league also hosted singular talents from nations which were not then at the forefront of women&#x27;s soccer, such as Maribel Dominguez of Mexico, Homare Sawa of Japan, Julie Fleeting of Scotland, Cheryl Salisbury of Australia, Marinette Pichon of France, and Kelly Smith of England.

== WUSA Awards==

=== Founders Cup champions ===

The Founders Cup (named in honor of the 20 founding players) was awarded to the winner of a four-team, single-elimination postseason playoff.

&quot;asdet&quot; stands for &quot;after sudden death extra time&quot;. WUSA&#x27;s sudden death overtime was 15 minutes long (two 7½-minute periods) and used only in the playoffs.

== League suspension ==

The WUSA played for three full seasons, suspending operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the conclusion of the third season. Neither television ratings nor attendance met forecasts, while the league spent its initial $40million budget, planned to last five years, by the end of the first season. Even though the players took salary cuts of up to 30% for the final season, with the founding players (who also held an equity stake in the league) taking the largest cuts, that was not enough to bring expenses under control. In the hopes of an eventual relaunch of the league, all rights to team names, logos, and similar properties were preserved. Efforts to line up new sources of capital and operating funds continued. In June 2004, the WUSA held two &quot;WUSA Festivals&quot; in Los Angeles and Blaine, Minnesota, featuring matches between reconstituted WUSA teams (often with marquee players borrowed from other teams), in order to maintain the league in the public eye and sustain interest in women&#x27;s professional soccer.

With the WUSA on hiatus, the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and the W-League regained their status as the premier women&#x27;s soccer leagues in the United States, and many former WUSA players joined those teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOCCER / Collapse of WUSA leaves void / College, pro players ponder their futures&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A new women&#x27;s professional soccer league in the United States called Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer started in 2009. However, that league suspended operations in January 2012. It was succeeded by the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League which continues to this day.

<text>Accrington Football Club was a football club based in Accrington, Lancashire, England. They were one of the founder members of the Football League.

==History==

Accrington Football Club was formed following a meeting at a local public house in 1878. 

===Local cups===

With backing from mill owners, the Owd Reds became one of the strongest sides in Lancashire. In 1880–81, it won the Lancashire Senior Cup for the first time, beating Blackburn Park Road 6–4 in the final. The Roadsters walked off the field with five minutes to go in protest at the refereeing, and put in an unsuccessful protest, one reporter stating that the second Accrington goal was seen as handball &quot;by every reporter present&quot; and the sixth Accrington goal was so far offside that &quot;the referee (William Peirce-Dix of Sheffield) was obviously bribed or neglecting his duty as a final judge&quot;, another stating that &quot;the greatest wrongdoer in this last piece of business connected with the already ugly career of the Lancashire Association Challenge Cup is the referee of Saturday last&quot;.

The club was part of the revolt against the Football Association in 1884 over professionalism, after being expelled from the FA the previous year for paying a player, and was a founding member of the British Football Association, in a successful ploy to have the FA overturn its ban on professionals. It won the Lancashire Senior Cup twice more; in 1887–88 by forfeit, after Preston North End refused to play the final in Blackburn, and in 1888–89. Accrington was fortunate to be in the final, turning up late to its third round tie at Halliwell, which claimed the tie; however, before the crowd had left, Accrington turned up and the tie took place, the Owd Reds winning 1–0. The final, against underdogs Higher Walton, ended 1-1 and around 6,000 turned up to Deepdale for the replay, in which the Owd Reds scored the only goal. 

===FA Cup===

The club had less fortune in the FA Cup, as the regionalization of the early rounds in the 1880s meant it was drawn against strong Lancastrian sides. Its best run, in 1887–88, saw it beat Rossendale by an easy 11–0, and then beat Burnley 3–2 at home, coming from 2–0 down at half-time, before a crowd of at least 5,000; however the club was then drawn to host Blackburn Rovers, which had just had a three-season winning run in the competition. Harry Fecitt gave Accrington the lead against his former club, the goal followed by a burst of music from the Accrington Volunteer Band, but Rovers rallied to win 3–1.

===Football League and decline===

It was one of the original twelve clubs that formed the Football League on 17 April 1888. Accrington&#x27;s best season was in 1889–90, when the club finished sixth in the table. However, in the 1892–93 season they finished fifteenth (of 16) and were relegated after losing a test match 1–0 against Sheffield United at Trent Bridge. Accrington then resigned from the league rather than play in the Second Division, becoming the first of the founding Football League clubs to leave the League permanently (Stoke had failed to be re-elected in 1890, but rejoined the league a year later).

After its first season in the Lancashire League, Accrington, realizing that business was better in the national competition, unsuccessfully applied for re-election to the Football League. Shortly afterwards, Accrington F.C. suffered financial problems, which eventually led to its demise. The club continued outside the league until 1896, when they finally folded following a 12–0 defeat on 14 January against Darwen in the Lancashire Senior Cup. The growth of the Football League, and the increased - and consistent - crowds of clubs in bigger population areas, had dwarfed the money available to Accrington from its benefactors, and, with bigger towns close by, Accrington had no room to breathe.

Accrington did not have a Football League club again until in 1921–22 the Lancashire Combination league&#x27;s Accrington Stanley (formerly a local rival), became a member as part of a major expansion of the league.

==Colours==

The club originally wore scarlet and black jerseys and hose, with black knickers. In 1880 the club changed to red jerseys and white knickers, changing the knickers to serge blue from 1888 to 1892.

==Ground==

<text>Chapel Hill is a town in Durham and Orange counties, North Carolina, United States. Its population was 61,960 in the 2020 United States census, making Chapel Hill the 17th-most populous municipality in the state. Chapel Hill and Durham make up the Durham-Chapel Hill, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 608,879 in 2023. When it is combined with Raleigh, the state capital, they make up the corners of the Research Triangle (officially the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area), which had an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023.

The town was founded in 1793 and is centered on Franklin Street, covering . It contains several districts and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care are a major part of the economy and town influence. Local artists have created many murals in the town.

==History==
===Pre-establishment and colonial era===
The Occaneechi Indians lived in the area of what is now Hillsborough, north of Chapel Hill, prior to European settlement.

The area was the home place of early settler William Barbee of Middlesex County, Virginia, whose 1753 grant of 585 acres on the north and south side of &quot;Lick Branch&quot; from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville was the first of two land grants in what is now the Chapel Hill-Durham area. Though William Barbee died shortly after settling there in 1758, one of his eight children, Christopher Barbee, became an important contributor to his father&#x27;s adopted community and to the fledgling University of North Carolina. In 1792, he offered the trustees of UNC 221 acres on which the university is now built, making him the university&#x27;s largest donor.

Chapel Hill has developed along a hill; the crest was the original site of a small Anglican &quot;chapel of ease&quot;, built in 1752, known as New Hope Chapel. The Carolina Inn now occupies this site. In 1819, the town was founded by the NC General Assembly to serve the University of North Carolina and developed around it. The town was chartered in 1851, and its main street, Franklin Street, was named in memory of Benjamin Franklin.

===Civil War===
Four in ten Chapel Hillians were enslaved at the start of the Civil War, and about half of the town was Black. In April 1865, as the war ended, the 9th Michigan Cavalry rode into Chapel Hill and occupied the university and the town for more than two weeks.

===Civil rights era===
In 1969, a year after the town fully integrated its schools, Chapel Hill elected Howard Lee as mayor. It was the first majority-white municipality in the South to elect an African-American mayor. Serving from 1969 to 1975, Lee helped establish Chapel Hill Transit, the town&#x27;s bus system, and the Mountains-to-Sea trail.

Some 30 years later, in 2002, the state passed legislation to provide free service to all riders on local buses. The bus operations are funded through Chapel Hill and Carrboro town taxes, federal grants, and UNC student tuition. The change has resulted in a large increase in ridership, taking many cars off the roads. Several hybrid and articulated buses have been added recently. All buses carry GPS transmitters to report their location in real-time to a tracking web site. Buses can transport bicycles and have wheelchair lifts.

In 1993, the town celebrated its bicentennial and founded the Chapel Hill Museum. This cultural community resource &quot;exhibiting the character and characters of Chapel Hill, North Carolina&quot; includes among its permanent exhibits &quot;Alexander Julian&quot;, &quot;History of the Chapel Hill Fire Department&quot;, &quot;Chapel Hill&#x27;s 1914 Fire Truck&quot;, &quot;The James Taylor Story&quot;, &quot;Farmer/James Pottery&quot;, and &quot;The Paul Green Legacy&quot;.

In addition to the Carolina Inn, the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity House, Chapel Hill Historic District, Chapel Hill Town Hall, Chapel of the Cross, Gimghoul Neighborhood Historic District, Alexander Hogan Plantation, Old Chapel Hill Cemetery, Old East, University of North Carolina, Playmakers Theatre, Rocky Ridge Farm Historic District, and West Chapel Hill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography and climate==

Chapel Hill is located in the southeast corner of Orange County, with a small part extending east into Durham County. It is bounded on the west by the town of Carrboro and on the northeast by the city of Durham. However, most of Chapel Hill&#x27;s borders are adjacent to unincorporated portions of Orange and Durham Counties rather than shared with another municipality. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.69%) is water.

==Government==
Chapel Hill uses a council–manager form of government. The community elects a mayor and eight council members. Mayors serve two-year terms, and council members serve staggered four-year terms, all elected by the town at large; town elections are held in November of odd-numbered years. Mayor Jessica Anderson, a former council member, succeeded four-term mayor Pam Hemminger in 2023. In 2015, Hemminger defeated incumbent Mark Kleinschmidt, who had been elected in 2009 as the first openly gay mayor of Chapel Hill, succeeding outgoing four-term mayor Kevin Foy.

The town adopted its flag in 1990. According to flag designer Spring Davis, the blue represents the town and the University of North Carolina (whose colors are Carolina blue and white); the green represents &quot;environmental awareness&quot;; and the &quot;townscape&quot; in the inverted chevron represents &quot;a sense of home, friends, and community.&quot;

The town&#x27;s seal, has, since the 1930s, depicted Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and protector of cities. Having gone through several revisions, the seal, which also serves as the town logo, was most recently updated in 2005 to a visually simpler version.

==Education== 

Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools covers most of the towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro, along with portions of unincorporated Orange County, and is recognized for its academic strengths. East Chapel Hill High School, Carrboro High School, and Chapel Hill High School have all received national recognition for excellence, with &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2008 ranking East Chapel Hill High as the 88th-best high school in the nation, and the highest-ranked standard public high school in North Carolina. The small portion of Chapel Hill located in Durham County is part of Durham Public Schools.

There are several private K-12 schools in Chapel Hill, including Emerson Waldorf School.

Founded in 1789, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a public research university and is the flagship of the University of North Carolina System.

The state&#x27;s main youth orchestra, Piedmont Youth Orchestra, is based in Chapel Hill.

Also located in the town is the Chapel Hill Public Library, directed by Atlas Logan.

==Culture==

Though Chapel Hill is a principal town of a large metropolitan area, it retains a relatively small-town feel. Combined with its close neighbor, the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area has roughly 85,000 residents. Many large murals can be seen painted on the buildings. Most of these murals were painted by UNC alumnus Michael Brown. Also, for more than 30 years, Chapel Hill has sponsored the annual street fair, Festifall, in October. The fair offer booths to artists, craftsmakers, nonprofits, and food vendors. Performance space is also available for musicians, martial artists, and other groups. The fair is attended by tens of thousands each year.

The Morehead Planetarium and Science Center was the first planetarium built on a U.S. college campus. When it opened in 1949, it was one of six planetariums in the nation and has remained an important town landmark. During the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, astronauts were trained there. One of the town&#x27;s hallmark features is the giant sundial, located in the green square in front of the planetarium on Franklin Street.

Influences of the university are seen throughout the town, even in the fire departments. Each fire station in Chapel Hill has a fire engine (numbers 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35) that is Carolina blue. These engines are also decorated with different UNC decals, including a firefighter Rameses.

Chapel Hill also has some new urbanist village communities, such as Meadowmont Village and Southern Village. Meadowmont and Southern Village both have shopping centers, green space where concerts, movies, and other outdoor events have taken place, community pools, and schools. Also, a traditional-style mall with a mix of national and local retailers is located at University Place.

===Food===
Hailed as one of America&#x27;s Foodiest Small Towns by &quot;Bon Appétit&quot;, Chapel Hill is rapidly becoming a hot spot for pop American cuisine. Among the restaurants noted nationally are Mama Dip&#x27;s (Food Network&#x27;s &quot;$40 A Day With Rachael Ray&quot;), Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen (&quot;The Splendid Table&quot;), caffè Driade (Food Network&#x27;s &quot;$40 A Day With Rachael Ray&quot;), Lantern Restaurant (&quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot;, &quot;Southern Living&quot;, etc.), and Vimala&#x27;s Curryblossom Cafe.

===Music===
In the realm of popular music, James Taylor, George Hamilton IV, Southern Culture on the Skids, Superchunk, Polvo, Archers of Loaf, Ben Folds Five, The Kingsbury Manx, Spider Bags and more recently Porter Robinson, are among the most notable musical artists and acts whose careers began in Chapel Hill. The town has also been a center for the modern revival of old-time music and bluegrass with such bands as the Ayr Mountaineers, Hollow Rock String band, Watchhouse (formerly known as Mandolin Orange), Steep Canyon Rangers, Mipso, the Tug Creek Ramblers, Two Dollar Pistols, the Fuzzy Mountain String band, Big Fat Gap and the Red Clay Ramblers.

Chapel Hill was also the founding home of now Durham-based Merge Records. Bruce Springsteen has made a point to visit the town on four occasions. His most recent appearance was on September 15, 2003, at Kenan Memorial Stadium with the E Street Band. U2 also performed at Kenan on the first American date of their 1983 War Tour, where Bono climbed up to the top of the stage, during pouring rain and lightning, holding up a white flag for peace. The 2011 John Craigie song, &quot;Chapel Hill&quot;, is about the singer&#x27;s first visit there. One song from &quot;Dirty&quot;, a Sonic Youth album, is named after the town.

===Sports=== 

The University of North Carolina has been very successful at college basketball and women&#x27;s soccer, and a passion for these sports has been a distinctive feature of the town&#x27;s culture, fueled by the Tobacco Road rivalry among North Carolina&#x27;s four ACC teams: the North Carolina Tar Heels, the Duke Blue Devils, the NC State Wolfpack, and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

The two largest sports venues in the town both house UNC teams. The Dean Smith Center is home to the men&#x27;s basketball team, while Kenan Memorial Stadium is home to the football team. In addition, Chapel Hill is also home to Carmichael Arena which formerly housed the UNC men&#x27;s basketball team, and currently is home to the women&#x27;s team, and to the new Dorrance Field, home to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and lacrosse teams.

Many walking/biking trails are in Chapel Hill. Some of these include Battle Branch Trail, Morgan Creek Trail and Bolin Creek Trail, Chapel Hill&#x27;s oldest trail and most popular greenway.

<text>Burton United Football Club was a football club based in Burton upon Trent in England. The club was established in 1901 by a merger of Burton Swifts and Burton Wanderers, and played their last competitive season in 1910. In 1924 they merged with Burton All Saints continuing the lineage of the history of football in Burton, while at the same time legally ending the club. Between 1901 and 1907 the club were members of the Football League.

==History==
The club was formed in 1901 when Burton Swifts merged with Burton Wanderers. Swifts had played in the Football League since 1892, whilst Wanderers had been Football League members between 1894 and 1897 but were now members of the Midland League. It was unusual for a smaller town such as Burton to host two Football League clubs so it was hoped the merger would see an upturn in fortunes for the United club.
The new club took Swifts&#x27; place in the Second Division of the Football League and took over residence at their Peel Croft home. However, the new club failed to achieve success, and never finished above 10th place or made it past the first round of the FA Cup. In the 1904–05 and 1905–06 seasons the club finished in second last place, and in 1906–07 finished bottom. At the end of the season the club failed to win re-election, losing their Football League place to Fulham. Following the re-election meeting Burslem Port Vale resigned from the League, and although United applied to take their place, it was instead offered to and accepted by Oldham Athletic.

The club dropped into the Birmingham &amp; District League, and in 1909 also became members of the Southern League. At the end of the 1909–10 season the club finished bottom of the Birmingham &amp; District League and second bottom of their Southern League division, and subsequently merged with Burton All Saints, who had been established around the same time as United. They became Burton Town in 1924. They ceased playing in 1940, and were merged into Burton Albion shortly after they were founded in 1950. Albion did not reach the second tier of English football, however, until 2015–16, when they were promoted to the by-now Football League Championship.

<text>Aberdare Athletic Football Club were a Welsh football club founded in 1893 and based at the Athletic Ground in Aberdare. They joined the Football League in 1921 but were replaced by Torquay United after failing to be re-elected in 1927.

==History==

===Foundation===
Founded in 1893, Aberdare were Welsh Cup runners-up, in 1903–04, 1904–05 and 1922–23. In 1920–21, they joined the Welsh Section of the Southern League and finished runners-up in their first season. That gained them entry to the Football League Third Division South for the next season.

===League football===

Despite a promising start in league football, finishing 8th in the 1921–22 season, Aberdare suffered financial instable throughout the 1920s. The club merged with Aberaman Athletic in 1926 with the first team competing in the Football League under the name Aberdare Athletic, while the reserve team played in the Welsh League under the name Aberdare &amp; Aberaman Athletic. However the merged clubs still had to operate on a tight player budget meant it was unable to secure new players. In the 1926–27 season, Aberdare Athletic finished bottom of the Third Division South and failed to gain re-election to the League, with Torquay United taking their place. 

Aberdare&#x27;s loss of their Football League place was controversial. In the first ballot, Aberdare and Southern League side Torquay, the latter having previously applied to join the League in 1923, tied with 21 each. That round of voting was marred by controversy as the potentially tie-breaking ballot was reported to be &quot;spoilt&quot; and Aberdare&#x27;s secretary claimed that one of the scrutineers was &quot;an interested party&quot;. Aberdare lost the second ballot with 19 votes to Torquay&#x27;s 26; fellow League side Watford, who had finished second-bottom, were comfortably re-elected with 44 votes. The club now fully adopted the name &quot;Aberdare &amp; Aberaman Athletic&quot;, and rejoined the Southern League.

===Decline===
The club only survived for another season, and in 1928, the Aberaman faction split away to re-form Aberaman Athletic, while the Aberdare half folded. Aberdare &amp; Aberaman Athletic was again re-formed in 1945, but that side also split in 1947. Aberdare Town F.C. continue to play in the Welsh Football League today.

==Managers==
The following were managers around the time the team was Football League side:
*William Lot, June 1920 – March 1922
*Frank Bradshaw, May 1923 – April 1924
*Sydney Beaumont, 1924–1927
*Harry Hadley, November 1927 – April 1928

<doc id="71831" wikidata="Q1133209" url="?curid=71831" title="Corned beef">
<text>Corned beef, bully beef, or salted beef in some Commonwealth countries, is a salt-cured brisket of beef. The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also called &quot;corns&quot; of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are added to corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines.

Most recipes include nitrates, which convert the natural myoglobin in beef to , giving it a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; bacteria spores, but have been linked to increased cancer risk in mice. Beef cured without nitrates or nitrites has a gray color, and is sometimes called &quot;New England corned beef&quot;.

Tinned corned beef, alongside salt pork and hardtack, was a standard ration for many militaries and navies from the 17th through the early 20th centuries, including World War I and World War II, during which fresh meat was rationed. Corned beef remains popular worldwide as an ingredient in a variety of regional dishes and as a common part in modern field rations of various armed forces around the world.

==History==
Although the exact origin of corned beef is unknown, it most likely came about when people began preserving meat through salt-curing. Evidence of its legacy is apparent in numerous cultures, including ancient Europe and the Middle East. The word &quot;corn&quot; derives from Old English and is used to describe any small, hard particles or grains. In the case of &quot;corned beef&quot;, the word may refer to the coarse, granular salts used to cure the beef. The word &quot;corned&quot; may also refer to the corns of potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter, which were formerly used to preserve the meat.

===Pre-20th century===

Although the practise of curing beef existed across the globe since the period of classical antiquity, the industrial production of corned beef started in the British Isles during the British Agricultural Revolution. Corned beef sourced from cattle reared in Ireland and Scotland was used extensively for civilian and military consumption throughout the British Empire beginning from the 17th century onwards due to its non-perishable nature. Irish and Scottish corned beef was also sold to the French West Indies, where it was used to feed both settlers and slaves. Industrial processes in the British Isles for producing corned beef during the 17th century did not distinguish different cuts of beef beyond the tough and undesirable parts of the cow such as the beef shank and neck. Instead, the grading was done by sorting all cuts of beef by weight into &quot;small beef&quot;, &quot;cargo beef&quot; and &quot;best mess beef&quot;, with the first being considered the worst and the last the best. &quot;Small beef&quot; and &quot;cargo beef&quot; cuts were most commonly traded to the French, while &quot;best mess beef&quot; were frequently intended for sale and consumption in markets throughout the British Empire.

Ireland produced a significant portion of corned beef consumed in the British Empire during the early modern period, using cattle reared locally and salt imported from the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. Irish port cities, such as Dublin, Belfast and Cork, became home to large-scale beef curing and packing industries, with Cork alone producing half of Ireland&#x27;s annual beef exports in 1668. Although the consumption of corned beef carried no significant negative connotations in Europe, in European colonies in the Americas it was frequently looked upon with disdain due to being primarily consumed by poor people and slaves. American social theorist Jeremy Rifkin noted the sociopolitical effect of corned beef in the British Isles during the early modern period in his 1992 book &quot;Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of the Cattle Culture&quot;: 

Despite being a major producer of corned beef, the majority of the Irish population during this period, Catholic tenant farmers, consumed relatively little meat in their diets. This was due to a variety of factors, including the high costs of buying meat in Ireland and the ownership of the majority of Irish farms by Protestant landlords, who marked most of the corned beef produced using their cattle for export. The level of meat, including corned beef, present in the Irish diet of the period decreased in areas away from major centres for corned beef production, such as Northern Ireland, while increasing in areas such as County Cork. The majority of meat consumed by working-class Irish Catholics consisted of cheap products such as salt pork, with bacon and cabbage quickly becoming one of the most common meals in Irish cuisine.

===20th century to present===
Corned beef became a less important commodity in the 19th century Atlantic world, due in part to the abolition of slavery. Corned beef production and its canned form remained an important food source during the Second World War. Much of the canned corned beef came from Fray Bentos in Uruguay, with over 16 million cans exported in 1943. Today significant amounts of the global canned corned beef supply comes from South America. Approximately 80% of the global canned corned beef supply originates in Brazil.

==Cultural associations==
In North America, corned beef dishes are associated with traditional British and Irish cuisines.

Mark Kurlansky, in his book &quot;Salt&quot;, states that the Irish produced a salted beef around the Middle Ages that was the &quot;forerunner of what today is known as Irish corned beef&quot; and in the 17th century, the English named the Irish salted beef &quot;corned beef&quot;.

Before the wave of 19th century Irish immigration to the United States, many of ethnic Irish immigrants did not consume corned beef dishes. The popularity of corned beef compared to back bacon among the Irish immigrant population may have been due to corned beef being considered a luxury product in their native land, while it was cheap and readily available in the United States.

The Jewish population produced similar corned beef brisket, also smoking it into pastrami. Irish immigrants often purchased corned beef from Jewish butchers.

Canned corned beef has long been one of the standard meals included in military field ration packs globally, due to its simplicity and instant preparation. One example is the American Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) pack. Astronaut John Young sneaked a contraband corned beef sandwich on board Gemini 3, hiding it in a pocket of his spacesuit.

==Regions==

===North America===
In the United States and Canada, corned beef is typically available in two forms: a cut of beef (usually brisket, but sometimes round or silverside) cured or pickled in a seasoned brine, or cooked and canned.

Corned beef is often purchased ready to eat in Jewish delicatessens. It is the key ingredient in the grilled Reuben sandwich, consisting of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island or Russian dressing on rye bread. Smoking corned beef, typically with a generally similar spice mix, produces smoked meat (or &quot;smoked beef&quot;) such as pastrami or Montreal-style smoked meat.

Corned beef hashed with potatoes served with eggs is a common breakfast dish in the United States of America.

In both the United States and Canada, corned beef is sold in cans in minced form. It is also sold this way in Puerto Rico and Uruguay.

====Caribbean====

Multiple Caribbean nations have their own varied versions of canned corned beef as a dish, common in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.

====Newfoundland and Labrador====

Corned beef is known specifically as &quot;salt beef&quot; in Newfoundland and Labrador, and is sold in buckets with brine to preserve the beef and is not seasoned with spices. It is a staple product culturally in Newfoundland and Labrador, providing a source of meat during their long winters. It is still commonly eaten in Newfoundland and Labrador, most often associated with the local Jiggs dinner meal. In recent years it has been used in different meals locally, such as a Jiggs dinner poutine dish.

====Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day====

In the United States, consumption of corned beef is often associated with Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Corned beef is not an Irish national dish, and the connection with Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day specifically originates as part of Irish-American culture, and is often part of their celebrations in North America.

Corned beef was used as a substitute for bacon by Irish immigrants in the late 19th century. Corned beef and cabbage is the Irish-American variant of the Irish dish of bacon and cabbage. A similar dish is the New England boiled dinner, consisting of corned beef, cabbage, and root vegetables such as carrots, turnips, and potatoes, which is popular in New England and another similar dish, Jiggs dinner, is popular in parts of Atlantic Canada.

===Europe===

====Ireland====
The appearance of corned beef in Irish cuisine dates to the 12th century in the poem &quot;Aislinge Meic Con Glinne&quot; or &quot;The Vision of MacConglinne&quot;. Within the text, it is described as a delicacy a king uses to purge himself of the &quot;demon of gluttony&quot;. Cattle, valued as a bartering tool, were only eaten when no longer able to provide milk or to work. The corned beef as described in this text was a rare and valued dish, given the value and position of cattle within the culture, as well as the expense of salt, and was unrelated to the corned beef eaten today.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, &quot;corned beef&quot; refers to minced and canned salt beef. Unminced corned beef is referred to as salt beef.

===Middle East===
==== Israel ====
In Israel, a canned corned beef called Loof () was the traditional field ration of the Israel Defense Forces until the product&#x27;s discontinuation in 2011. The name &quot;Loof&quot; derives from &quot;a colloquially corrupt short form of &#x27;meatloaf.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Loof&quot; was developed by the IDF in the late 1940s as a kosher form of bully beef, while similar canned meats had earlier been an important component of relief packages sent to Europe and Palestine by Jewish organizations such as Hadassah.

===Oceania===
====Polynesia====

In Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, colonialism by western powers brought with them something that would change Polynesian diets—canned goods, including the highly prized corned beef. Natural disasters brought in food aid from New Zealand, Australia, and the US, then world wars in the mid-20th century, foreign foods became a bigger part of daily diets while retaining ancestral foods like taro and coconuts.
Both wet salt-brined beef and canned corned beef are differentiated. In Samoa, brined (lit. &quot;salted beef&quot;) or canned (lit. &quot;pea soup&quot;, general term for canned foods). In Tonga, corned (wet brine) or canned meats are typical.

===East Asia===
==== Hong Kong ====

Corned beef has also become a common dish in Hong Kong cuisine, though it has been heavily adapted in style and preparation to fit local tastes. It is often served with other &quot;Western&quot; fusion cuisine at cha chaan teng and other cheap restaurants catering to locals.

===Southeast Asia===
==== Philippines ====

Along with other canned meats, canned corned beef is a popular breakfast staple in the Philippines. Corned beef is also known as &quot;carne norte&quot; (alternative spelling: &quot;karne norte&quot;) locally, literally translating to &quot;northern meat&quot; in Spanish; the term refers to Americans, whom Filipinos referred then as norteamericanos, just like the rest of Spain&#x27;s colonies, where there is a differentiation between what is norteamericano (Canadian, American, Mexicano, what is centroamericano (Nicaraguense, Costarricense et al.), and what is sudamericano (Colombiano, Equatoriano, Paraguayo, et al.). The colonial mindset distinction then of what was norteamericano was countries north of the Viceroy&#x27;s Road (&quot;Camino de Virreyes&quot;), the route used to transport goods from the Manila Galleon landing in the port of Acapulco overland for Havana via the port of Veracruz (and not the Rio Grande river in Texas today), thus centroamericano meant the other Spanish possessions south of Mexico City.
Corned beef, especially the Libby&#x27;s brand, first became popular during the American colonial period of the Philippines (1901–1941) among the wealthy as a luxury food; they were advertised serving the corned beef cold and straight-from-the-can on to a bed of rice, or as patties in between bread. During World War II (1942–1945), American soldiers brought for themselves, and airdropped from the skies the same corned beef; it was a life-or-death commodity since the Japanese Imperial Army forcibly controlled all food in an effort to subvert any resistance against them.
After the war (1946 to present), corned beef gained far more popularity. It remains a staple in &quot;balikbayan&quot; boxes and on Filipino breakfast tables. The ordinary Filipino can afford them, and many brands have sprung up, including those manufactured by Century Pacific Food, CDO Foodsphere and San Miguel Food and Beverage, which are wholly owned by Filipinos and locally manufactured.

Philippine corned beef is typically made from shredded beef or buffalo meat, and is almost exclusively sold in cans. It is boiled, shredded, canned, and sold in supermarkets and grocery stores for mass consumption. It is usually served as the breakfast combination called &quot;corned beef &quot;silog&quot;&quot;, in which corned beef is cooked as &quot;carne norte guisado&quot; (fried, mixed with onions, garlic, and often, finely cubed potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, and/or cabbage), with a side of &quot;sinangag&quot; (garlic fried rice), and a fried egg. Another common way to eat corned beef is &quot;tortang carne norte&quot; (or corned beef omelet), in which corned beef is mixed with egg and fried. Corned beef is also used as a cheap meat ingredient in dishes like &quot;sopas&quot; and &quot;sinigang&quot;.

<doc id="71833" wikidata="Q9252" url="?curid=71833" title="Kazakh language">
<text>Kazakh or Qazaq is a Turkic language of the Kipchak branch spoken in Central Asia by Kazakhs. It is closely related to Nogai, Kyrgyz and Karakalpak. It is the official language of Kazakhstan, and has official status in the Altai Republic of Russia. It is also a significant minority language in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, China, and in the Bayan-Ölgii Province of western Mongolia. The language is also spoken by many ethnic Kazakhs throughout the former Soviet Union (some 472,000 in Russia according to the 2010 Russian census), Germany, and Turkey.

Like other Turkic languages, Kazakh is an agglutinative language and employs vowel harmony. Kazakh builds words by adding suffixes one after another to the word stem, with each suffix expressing only one unique meaning and following a fixed sequence. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; recognizes three mutually intelligible dialect groups: Northeastern Kazakh—the most widely spoken variety, which also serves as the basis for the official language—Southern Kazakh, and Western Kazakh. The language shares a degree of mutual intelligibility with closely related the Karakalpak language while its Western dialects maintain limited mutual intelligibility with Altai languages.

In October 2017, Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev decreed that the writing system would change from using Cyrillic to Latin script by 2025. The proposed Latin alphabet has been revised several times and as of January 2021 is close to the inventory of the Turkish alphabet, though lacking the letters C and Ç and having four additional letters: Ä, Ñ, Q and Ū (though other letters such as Y have different values in the two languages). Over one million Kazakh speakers in Xinjiang use a modified version of the Perso-Arabic script for writing. It is scheduled to be phased in from 2023 to 2031.

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers of Kazakh (mainly Kazakhs) are spread over a vast territory from the Tian Shan to the western shore of the Caspian Sea. Kazakh is the official state language of Kazakhstan, with nearly 10 million speakers (based on information from the CIA World Factbook on population and proportion of Kazakh speakers).

In China, nearly two million ethnic Kazakhs and Kazakh speakers reside in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang.

==History==

The Kipchak branch of Turkic languages, which Kazakh is borne out of, was mainly solidified during the reign of the Golden Horde. The modern Kazakh language is said to have originated in approximately 1465 AD during the formation of the Kazakh Khanate. Modern Kazakh is likely a descendant of both Chagatay Turkic as spoken by the Timurids and Kipchak Turkic as spoken in the Golden Horde.

Kazakh uses a high volume of loanwords from Persian and Arabic due to the frequent historical interactions between Kazakhs and Iranian ethnic groups to the south. Additionally, Persian was a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the Kazakh Khanate, which allowed Kazakhs to mix Persian words into their own spoken and written vernacular. Meanwhile, Arabic was used by Kazakhs in mosques and mausoleums, serving as a language exclusively for religious contexts, similar to how Latin served as a liturgical language in the Western European cultural sphere.

The Kazakhs used the Arabic script to write their language until approximately 1929. In the early 1900s, Kazakh activist Akhmet Baitursynuly reformed the Kazakh-Arabic alphabet, but his work was largely overshadowed by the Soviet presence in Central Asia. At that point, the new Soviet regime forced the Kazakhs to use a Latin script, and then a Cyrillic script in the 1940s. Today, Kazakhs use the Cyrillic and Latin scripts to write their language, although a presidential decree from 2017 ordered the transition from Cyrillic to Latin by 2031.

== Phonology and orthography ==
Kazakh exhibits tongue-root vowel harmony, with some words of recent foreign origin (usually of Russian or Arabic origin) as exceptions. There is also a system of rounding harmony which resembles that of Kyrgyz, but which does not apply as strongly and is not reflected in the orthography. This system only applies to the open vowels and not , and happens in the next syllables. Thus, (in Latin script) &#x27;star&#x27;, &#x27;today&#x27;, and &#x27;big&#x27; are actually pronounced as , , .

===Consonants===
The following chart depicts the consonant inventory of standard Kazakh; many of the sounds, however, are allophones of other sounds or appear only in recent loanwords. The 18 consonant phonemes listed by Vajda are without parentheses—since these are phonemes, their listed place and manner of articulation are very general, and will vary from what is shown. ( rarely appears in normal speech.) Kazakh has 19 native consonant phonemes; these are the stops , fricatives , nasals , liquids , and two glides . The sounds are found only in loanwords. is heard as an alveolopalatal affricate in the Kazakh dialects of Uzbekistan and Xinjiang, China. The sounds and may be analyzed as allophones of and in words with back vowels, but exceptions occur in loanwords.

* Voiced obstruents syllable-finally become devoiced.

===Vowels===
Kazakh has a system of 12 phonemic vowels, 3 of which are diphthongs. The rounding contrast and generally only occur as phonemes in the first syllable of a word, but do occur later allophonically; see the section on harmony below for more information. Moreover, the sound has been included artificially due to the influence of Arabic, Persian and, later, Tatar languages during the Islamic period. It can be found in some native words, however.

According to Vajda, the front/back quality of vowels is actually one of neutral versus retracted tongue root.

Phonetic values are paired with the corresponding character in Kazakh&#x27;s Cyrillic and current Latin alphabets.


* There is significant debate over the Kazakh vowel phoneme chart, but all analysis agrees on an eight-vowel system with being artificially added due to influence from Arabic and Persian.
* The vowel is often pronounced at the beginning of the word, with exceptional root e-. Urban Kazakh tends to palatalize all , caused by Russian influence.

=== Vowel harmony ===
Kazakh exhibits tongue-root vowel harmony (also called soft-hard harmony), and arguably weakened rounding harmony which is implied in the first syllable of the word. All vowels after the first rounded syllable are the subject to this harmony with the exception of , and in the following syllables, e.g. , . Notably, urban Kazakh tends to violate rounding harmony, as well as pronouncing Russian borrowings against the rules.

=== Stress ===
Most words in Kazakh are stressed in the last syllable, except:
* When counting objects, numbers are stressed in the first syllable, but stressed in the last syllable in collective numbers suffixed by (, from , ):
:
* Definite and negative pronouns are stressed in the first syllable:
:

=== Orthography ===

Nowadays, Kazakh is mostly written in the Cyrillic script, with an Arabic-based alphabet being used by minorities in China. Since 26 October 2017, via Presidential Decree 569, Kazakhstan will adopt the Latin script by 2025.

Cyrillic script was created to better merge the Kazakh language with other languages of the USSR, hence it has some controversial letter readings.

The letter У after a consonant represents a combination of sounds і , ү , ы , ұ with glide , e.g. , , , . Ю undergoes the same process but with at the beginning.

The letter И represents a combination of sounds: i (in front-vowel contexts) or ы (in back vowel contexts) + glide , e.g. , . In Russian loanwords, it is realized as (when stressed) or (when unstressed), e.g. .

The letter Я represents either or depending on vowel harmony.

The letter Щ represents , e.g. .

Meanwhile, the letters В, Ё, Ф, Х, Һ, Ц, Ч, Ъ, Ь, Э are only used in loanwords—mostly those of Russian origin, but sometimes of Persian and Arabic origin. They are often substituted in spoken Kazakh.

== Grammar ==
Kazakh is generally verb-final, though various permutations on SOV (subject–object–verb) word order can be used, for example, due to topicalization. Inflectional and derivational morphology, both verbal and nominal, in Kazakh, exists almost exclusively in the form of agglutinative suffixes. Kazakh is a nominative-accusative, head-final, left-branching, dependent-marking language.

=== Nouns ===
Kazakh has no noun class or gender system. Nouns are declined for number (singular or plural) and one of seven cases:

* Nominative 
* Accusative 
* Genitive 
* Dative
* Locative 
* Ablative
* Instrumental

The suffix for case is placed after the suffix for number.

=== Pronouns ===

There are eight personal pronouns in Kazakh:

The declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. Singular pronouns exhibit irregularities, while plural pronouns do not. Irregular forms are highlighted in bold.

In addition to the pronouns, there are several more sets of morphemes dealing with person.

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives in Kazakh are not declined for any grammatical category of the modified noun. Being a head-final language, adjectives are always placed before the noun that they modify. Kazakh has two varieties of adjectives:

* Qualitative – used to describe properties of the noun, such as color
* Relational – adjectives formed from words from other parts of speech

=== Degrees of comparison ===

==== Comparative ====
The comparative form can be created by appending the suffix or to an adjective.

==== Superlative ====
The superlative form can be created by placing the morpheme before the adjective. The superlative form can also be expressed by reduplication.

===Verbs===
Kazakh may express different combinations of tense, aspect and mood through the use of various verbal morphology or through a system of auxiliary verbs, many of which might better be considered light verbs. The present tense is a prime example of this; progressive tense in Kazakh is formed with one of four possible auxiliaries. These auxiliaries , , and , encode various shades of meaning of how the action is carried out and also interact with the lexical semantics of the root verb: telic and non-telic actions, semelfactives, durative and non-durative, punctual, etc. There are selectional restrictions on auxiliaries: motion verbs, such as and may not combine with . Any verb, however, can combine with to get a progressive tense meaning.

While it is possible to think that different categories of aspect govern the choice of auxiliary, it is not so straightforward in Kazakh. Auxiliaries are internally sensitive to the lexical semantics of predicates, for example, verbs describing motion:

In addition to the complexities of the progressive tense, there are many auxiliary-converb pairs that encode a range of aspectual, modal, volitional, evidential and action- modificational meanings. For example, the pattern verb + , with the auxiliary verb , indicates that the subject of the verb attempted or tried to do something (compare the Japanese construction).

<text>Uzbek is a Karluk Turkic language spoken by Uzbeks. It is the official and national language of Uzbekistan and formally succeeded Chagatai, an earlier Karluk language also known as &quot;Turki&quot;, as the literary language of Uzbekistan in the 1920s.

 According to Joshua Project both Southern Uzbek and Standard Uzbek language is spoken as either a native or second language by around 37 million people around the world, making it the second-most widely spoken Turkic language after Turkish. Uzbeks are about 36 million around the world, and the reason why the number of speakers of the Uzbek language is greater than that of ethnic Uzbeks themselves is because many other ethnic groups such as Tajiks, Kazakhs, Russians who live in Uzbekistan speak Uzbek as their second language.

There are two major variants of the Uzbek language: Northern Uzbek, or simply &quot;Uzbek&quot;, spoken in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and China; and Southern Uzbek, spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both Northern and Southern Uzbek are divided into many dialects. Uzbek and Uyghur are sister languages and they constitute the Karluk or &quot;Southeastern&quot; branch of Turkic.

External influences on Uzbek include Arabic, Persian, and Russian. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel to under the influence of Persian. Unlike other Turkic languages, vowel harmony is almost completely lost in modern Standard Uzbek, though it is still observed to some degree in its dialects, as well as in Uyghur.

Different dialects of Uzbek show varying degrees of influence from other languages such as Kipchak and Oghuz Turkic (for example, in grammar) as well as Persian (in phonology), which gives literary Uzbek the impression of being a mixed language.

In February 2021, the Uzbek government announced that Uzbekistan plans to fully transition the Uzbek language from the Cyrillic script to a Latin-based alphabet by 1 January 2023. Similar deadlines had been extended several times. As of 2024, most institutions still use both alphabets.

== Classification ==

Uzbek is the western member of the Karluk languages, a subgroup of Turkic; the eastern variant is Uyghur. Karluk is classified as a dialect continuum. Northern Uzbek was determined to be the most suitable variety to be understood by the most number of speakers of all Turkic languages despite it being heavily Persianized, excluding the Siberian Turkic languages. A high degree of mutual intelligibility found between certain specific Turkic languages has allowed Uzbek speakers to more easily comprehend various other distantly related languages.

== Number of speakers ==
Uzbek, being the most widely spoken indigenous language in Central Asia, is as well spoken by smaller ethnic groups in Uzbekistan and in neighbouring countries.

The language is spoken by other ethnic groups outside Uzbekistan. The popularity of Uzbek media, including Uzbekfilm and RizanovaUz, has spread among the Post-soviet states, particularly in Central Asia in recent years. Since Uzbek is the dominant language in the Osh Region of Kyrgyzstan (and mothertongue of the city Osh), like the rest of Eastern, Southern and South-Eastern Kyrgyzstan (Jalal-Abad Region), the ethnic Kyrgyzes are, too, exposed to Uzbek, and some speak it fluently. This is a common situation in the rest of Central Asian republics, including: the Turkistan region of Kazakhstan, northern Daşoguz Welaýat of Turkmenistan, Sughd region and other regions of Tajikistan. This puts the number of L2 speakers of Uzbek at a varying 1–5 million speakers.

The Uzbek language has a special status in countries that are common destination for immigration for Uzbekistani citizens. Other than Uzbekistan and other Central Asian Republics, the ethnic Uzbeks most commonly choose the Russian Federation in search of work. Most of them however, are seasonal workers, whose numbers vary greatly among residency within the Russian Federation. According to Russian government statistics, 4.5 million workers from Uzbekistan, 2.4 million from Tajikistan, and 920,000 from Kyrgyzstan were working in Russia in 2021, with around 5 million being ethnic Uzbeks.

Estimates of the number of native speakers of Uzbek vary widely, from 35 up to 40 million. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; estimates put the number of native speakers at 33 million across all the recognized dialects. The Swedish national encyclopedia, , estimates the number of native speakers to be 38 million,
and the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot; estimates 30 million. Other sources estimate the number of speakers of Uzbek to be 34 million in Uzbekistan, 4.5 million in Afghanistan, 1,630,000 in Pakistan, 1,500,000 in Tajikistan, about 1 million in Kyrgyzstan, 600,000 in Kazakhstan, 600,000 in Turkmenistan, and 300,000 in Russia.

The Uzbek language is taught in more than fifty higher education institutions around the world.

== Etymology and background ==
Historically, the language under the name &quot;Uzbek&quot; referred to a totally different language of Kipchak origin. The language was generally similar to the neighbouring Kazakh, more or less identical lexically, phonetically and grammatically. It was dissimilar to the area&#x27;s indigenous and native language, known as &quot;Turki&quot;, until it was changed to Chagatai by western scholars due to its origins from the Chagatai Khanate.
The ethnonym of the language itself now means &quot;a language spoken by the Uzbeks.&quot;

== History ==
Turkic speakers probably settled the Amu Darya, Syr Darya and Zarafshon river basins from at least 600–650 AD, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of the Eastern Iranian languages who previously inhabited Sogdia, Bactria and Khwarazm. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the Kara-Khanid Khanate from the 9th–12th centuries, a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yagma, and other tribes.

Uzbek (along with Uyghur) can be considered the direct descendant of Chagatai, the language of great Turkic Central Asian literary development in the realm of Chagatai Khan, Timur (Tamerlane), and the Timurid dynasty (including the early Mughal rulers of the Mughal Empire). Chagatai contained large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords. By the 19th century, it was rarely used for literary composition and disappeared only in the early 20th century.

Muhammad Shaybani ( – 2 December 1510), the first Khan of Bukhara, wrote poetry under the pseudonym &quot;Shibani&quot;. A collection of Chagatai poems by Muhammad Shaybani is currently kept in the Topkapı Palace Museum manuscript collection in Istanbul. The manuscript of his philosophical and religious work, &quot;Bahr al-Khudā&quot;, written in 1508, is located in London.

Shaybani&#x27;s nephew Ubaydullah Khan (1486–1540) skillfully recited the Quran and provided it with commentaries in Chagatai. Ubaydulla himself wrote poetry in Chagatai, Classical Persian, and Arabic under the literary pseudonym Ubaydiy.

For the Uzbek political elite of the 16th century, Chagatai was their native language. For example, the leader of the semi-nomadic Uzbeks, Sheibani Khan (1451–1510), wrote poems in Chagatai.

The poet Turdiy (17th century) in his poems called for the unification of the divided Uzbek tribes: &quot;Although our people are divided, but these are all Uzbeks of ninety-two tribes. We have different names – we all have the same blood. We are one people, and we should have one law. Floors, sleeves and collars – it&#x27;s all – one robe, So the Uzbek people are united, may they be in peace.&quot;

Sufi Allayar (1633–1721) was an outstanding theologian and one of the Sufi leaders of the Khanate of Bukhara. He showed his level of knowledge by writing a book called &quot;Sebâtü&#x27;l-Âcizîn&quot;. Sufi Allayar was often read and highly appreciated in Central Asia.

The term &quot;Uzbek&quot; as applied to language has meant different things at different times. 
* &quot;Uzbek&quot; was a vowel-harmonised Kipchak language spoken by descendants of those who arrived in Transoxiana who lived mainly around Bukhara and Samarkand.
* Chagatai was a Karluk language spoken by the older settled Turkic populations (&quot;Sarts&quot;) of the region in the Fergana Valley and the Qashqadaryo Region, and in some parts of what is now the Samarqand Region; it contained a heavier admixture of Persian and Arabic and did not have vowel harmony.

According to the Kazakh scholar Serali Lapin, who lived at the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, &quot;there is no special Sart language different from Uzbek. Russian researchers of the second half of the 19th century, like L. N. Sobolev, believed that &quot;Sart is not a special tribe, as many tried to prove. Sart is indifferently called both Uzbek and Tajik, who live in the city and are engaged in trade.

In Khanate of Khiva, Sarts spoke a highly Oghuz-influenced variety of Karluk. All three dialects continue to exist within modern spoken Uzbek.

After the independence of Uzbekistan, the Uzbek government opted to reform Northern Uzbek by changing its alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin in an attempt to stimulate the growth of Uzbek in a new, independent state. However, the reform never went into full application, and both alphabets are widely used, from daily uses to government publications and TV news. Uzbek language hasn&#x27;t eclipsed Russian in the government sector since Russian is used widely in sciences, politics, and by the upper class of the country. However, the Uzbek internet, including Uzbek Wikipedia, is growing rapidly.

== Writing systems ==


Uzbek has been written in a variety of scripts throughout history:
* 1000–1920s: The traditional Arabic script, first in the Qarakhanid standard and next in the Chagatai standard. This is seen as the golden age of the Uzbek language and literary history. 
* 1920–1928: the Arabic-based Yaña imlâ alphabet.
* 1928–1940: the Latin-based Yañalif was imposed officially.
* 1940–1992: the Cyrillic script was used officially.
* Since 1992: Switch back to Latin script, with heavy holdover usage of Cyrillic.

Despite the official status of the Latin script in Uzbekistan, the use of Cyrillic is still widespread, especially in advertisements and signs. In newspapers, scripts may be mixed, with headlines in Latin and articles in Cyrillic. The Arabic script is no longer used in Uzbekistan except symbolically in limited texts or for the academic studies of Chagatai (Old Uzbek).

In 2019, an updated version of the Uzbek Latin alphabet was revealed by the Uzbek government, with five letters being updated; it was proposed to represent the sounds &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;oʻ&quot; and &quot;gʻ&quot; by the letters &quot;c&quot;, &quot;ş&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, &quot;ó&quot; and &quot;ǵ&quot;, respectively. This would&#x27;ve reversed a 1995 reform, and brought the orthography closer to that of Turkish and also of Turkmen, Karakalpak, Kazakh (2018 version) and Azerbaijani. In 2021, it was proposed to change &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;oʻ&quot; and &quot;gʻ&quot; to &quot;ş&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;ḡ&quot;. These proposals were not implemented.

In the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, in northern Afghanistan and in Pakistan, where there is an Uzbek minority, the Arabic-based script is still used. In the early 21st century, in Afghanistan, standardization, publication of dictionaries, and an increase in usage (for example in News agencies&#x27; website, such as that of the BBC) has been taking place.



== Phonology ==
Words are usually oxytones (i.e. the last syllable is stressed), but certain endings and suffixal particles are not stressed. Consonants in brackets are only attested in loanwords.

=== Vowels ===
Standard Uzbek has six vowel phonemes. Uzbek language has many dialects: contrary to many Turkic languages, Standard Uzbek no longer has vowel harmony, but other dialects (Kipchak Uzbek and Oghuz Uzbek) retain vowel harmony.

* and can have short allophones and , and central allophones and . can have an open back allophone .
* and can become and when the syllable or the vowel is adjacent to the phonemes , , and (&quot;yaxshi&quot; یخشی &quot;good&quot; ).

=== Consonants ===
== Grammar ==
As a Turkic language, Uzbek is null subject, agglutinative and has no noun classes (gender or otherwise). Although Uzbek , it has indefinite articles &quot;bir&quot; بِیر and &quot;bitta&quot; بِیتَّه. The word order is subject–object–verb (SOV).

In Uzbek, there are two main categories of words: nominals (equivalent to nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some adverbs) and verbals (equivalent to verbs and some adverbs).

=== Nouns ===
Plurals are formed by suffix &quot;-lar&quot; ـلر. Nouns take the &quot;-ni&quot; ـنی suffix as a definite article; unsuffixed nouns are understood as indefinite. The dative case ending &quot;-ga&quot; ـگه changes to &quot;-ka&quot; ـکه when the noun ends in &quot;-k&quot; ـک, &quot;-g&quot; ـگ, or &quot;-qa&quot; ـقه when the noun ends in &quot;-q&quot; ـق, &quot;-gʻ&quot; ـغ (notice &quot;*tog‘qa&quot; → &quot;toqqa&quot; تاغقَّه). The possessive suffixes change the final consonants &quot;-k&quot; ـک and &quot;-q&quot; ـق to voiced &quot;-g&quot; ـگ and &quot;-gʻ&quot; ـغ, respectively (&quot;yurak&quot; → &quot;yuragim&quot; یورک - یورگیم). Unlike neighbouring Turkmen and Kazakh languages, due to the loss of &quot;pronominal &quot;-n-&quot;&quot; there is no irregularity in forming cases after possessive cases (&quot;uyida&quot; اویی‌ده &quot;in his/her/its house&quot;, as opposed to Turkmen &quot;öýünde&quot; اویونده, though saying &quot;uyinda&quot; اویینده is also correct but such style is mainly used in literary contexts).


=== Verbs ===
Uzbek verbs are also inflected for number and person of the subject, and it has more periphrases. Uzbek uses some of the inflectional (simple) verbal tenses:
:
====Notes====
Vowels marked with parentheses in the suffixes are dropped if the verb root already ends on a vowel. (e.g. &quot;Qara&quot; قره + &quot;(i)ng&quot; ـینگ = &quot;Qarang!&quot; قره‌نگ; &quot;Look!&quot;)

Third person plural is commonly replaced by third person singular.

In the simple past and conditional tenses, the possessive suffixes are used at the end of the verb. Otherwise, the full pronoun suffix is used, except in the imperative. The third person is usually not marked.

===Negation===
Negative is expressed by adding &quot;-ma&quot; after the verb root, or with auxiliary verb &quot;emas&quot;.
Examples:

&quot;Koʻrmay(man)&quot; کورمه‌ی(من) &quot;(I) don&#x27;t see&quot;

&quot;Koʻrmoqchi emas(man)&quot; کورماقچی ایمس(من) &quot;(I) don&#x27;t want to see&quot;

The particle &quot;yoʻq&quot; ـیوق is used to mark the absence or prohibition of a noun or action.

===Gerund===
The gerund is formed with the verb root + &quot;ish&quot; ـیش.

&quot;Chekish mumkin emas&quot; چیکیش ممکن ایمس &quot;Smoking is not allowed&quot;

=== Pronouns ===
=== Word order ===
The word order in the Uzbek language is subject–object–verb (SOV), like all other Turkic languages. Unlike in English, the object comes before the verb and the verb is the last element of the sentence.

== Influences ==
The influence of Islam, and by extension, Arabic, is evident in Uzbek loanwords. There is also a residual influence of Russian, from the time when Uzbeks were under the rule of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. There are a large number of Russian loanwords in Uzbek, particularly when related to technical and modern terms, as well everyday and sociopolitical terms. Most importantly, Uzbek vocabulary, phraseology and pronunciation has been heavily influenced by Persian through its historic roots. It is estimated that Uzbek contains about 60 Mongolian loanwords, scattered among the names of birds and other animals, household items, chemical elements and especially military terms.

== Dialects ==

Uzbek can be roughly divided into three dialect groups. The Karluk dialects, centered on Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and the Ferghana Valley, are the basis for the standard Uzbek language. This dialect group shows the most influence of Persian vocabulary, particularly in the important Tajik-dominated cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. The Kipchak dialect, spoken from the Surxondaryo region through north-central Uzbekistan into Karakalpakstan, shows significant influence from the Kipchak Turkic languages, particularly in the mutation of [j] to [ʑ] as in Kazakh and Kyrgyz. The Oghuz dialect, spoken mainly in Khorezm along the Turkmenistan border, is notable for the mutation of word-initial [k] to [g].

== By country ==
=== Turkmenistan ===
In Turkmenistan since the 2000s the government conducted a forced &quot;Turkmenization&quot; of ethnic Uzbeks living in the country. In the Soviet years and in the 1990s, the Uzbek language was used freely in Turkmenistan. There were several hundred schools in the Uzbek language, many newspapers were published in this language. Now there are only a few Uzbek schools in the country, as well as a few newspapers in Uzbek. Despite this, the Uzbek language is still considered to be one of the recognized languages of national minorities in this country. Approximately 300,000–600,000 Uzbeks live in Turkmenistan. Most of the Uzbek speakers live in Dashoghuz Velayat, as well as in Lebap Velayat and partly in Ashghabad.

=== Russia ===
Uzbek is one of the many recognized languages of national minorities in Russia. More than 400 thousand Uzbeks are citizens of the Russian Federation and live in the country. Also in Russia there are 2 to 6 million Uzbeks from the Central Asian republics (mainly Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) who are immigrants and migrants. Large diasporas of Uzbeks live in large cities of Russia such as Saint Petersburg. Signs in Uzbek are often found in these cities. Signs refer mainly to various restaurants and eateries, barbershops, shops selling fruits, vegetables and textile products. There is a small clinic, where signs and labels are in the Uzbek language. Uzbeks in Russia prefer to use the Cyrillic Uzbek alphabet, but in recent years Uzbek youth in Russia are also actively using the Latin Uzbek alphabet. Small newspapers in Uzbek are published in large cities of Russia. Some instructions for immigrants and migrants are duplicated, including in Uzbek. Uzbek language is studied by Russian students in the faculties of Turkology throughout Russia. The largest Uzbek language learning centers in Russia are located in the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. There are also many Russians who are interested in and love the Uzbek language and culture and who study this language for themselves. Uzbek is one of the most studied languages among the many languages of the former USSR in Russia.

=== Uzbek language researchers ===
Scientific interest in the history of the Uzbek language arose in the 19th century among European and Russian orientalists. A. Vambery, V. Bartold, Sh. Lapin and others wrote about the history of the Uzbek language. Much attention was paid to the study of the history of the language in the Soviet period. E. Polivanov, N.Baskakov, A.Kononov, U. Tursunov, A. Mukhtarov, Sh. Rakhmatullaev and others wrote about the history of the Uzbek language among famous linguists.

== Development ==
1900: Early 20th Century 
Speakers: Approximately 2–4 million. 
The Uzbek-speaking population was primarily concentrated in Central Asia, within the territories of the Russian Empire, including present-day Uzbekistan, parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. 
Global Rank: Likely around 30–40th place. 
Uzbek was not widely recognized globally as it was primarily spoken in rural and regional areas.

1950: Soviet Era 
Speakers: Around 7–8 million. 
The population grew due to natural growth and urbanization under the Soviet Union. Uzbek became one of the officially recognized languages of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. 
Global Rank: Approximately 25–30th place. 
As a regional language in the USSR, Uzbek gained institutional support in education and media, increasing its influence within Central Asia.

1991: Post-Soviet Independence 
Speakers: Around 16–20 million. 
After Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Uzbek was declared the official language of the Republic of Uzbekistan. This led to a revival of Uzbek culture and a shift away from Russian dominance in education and government. 
Global Rank: Around 20–25th place. 
With the fall of the USSR, Uzbek gained prominence as a national language, and its number of speakers increased due to population growth.

2024: Current Status 
Speakers: Estimated 35–40 million. 
Uzbek is primarily spoken in Uzbekistan but also in neighboring countries like Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, as well as by diaspora communities worldwide. 
Global Rank: 18–20th place. 
Uzbek is now one of the top 20 most spoken languages globally, thanks to Uzbekistan&#x27;s large population (over 36 million) and Uzbek-speaking minorities in surrounding countries. It is increasingly recognized on digital platforms, in media, and in academia.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Dreyfus (, ; 9 October 1859 – 12 July 1935) was a French Army officer best known for his central role in the Dreyfus affair. In 1894, Dreyfus fell victim to a judicial conspiracy that eventually sparked a major political crisis in the French Third Republic when he was wrongfully accused and convicted of being a German spy due to antisemitism. Dreyfus was arrested, cashiered from the French army and imprisoned on Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana. Eventually, evidence emerged showing that Dreyfus was innocent and the true culprit was fellow officer Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. 

Gradual revelations indicated that the internal investigation conducted by the French army was biased; Dreyfus was an ideal scapegoat due to being a Jew, and military authorities were aware of his innocence but preferred to cover up the affair and leave him imprisoned rather than lose face. A political scandal subsequently erupted, shaking French political life and highlighting antisemitism in the French army and government. After numerous judicial and political developments, the publication of Émile Zola&#x27;s manifesto &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot; in 1898 brought new momentum to Dreyfus&#x27;s cause. Zola accused French military and political leadership of covering up the affair. Dreyfus was eventually exonerated, rehabilitated and reinstated in the French army, although at a lower rank than his seniority would have warranted.

&quot;Anti-Dreyfusards&quot; and antisemites in France, however, viewed his rehabilitation unfavorably, and while attending the transfer of Zola&#x27;s remains to the Panthéon Dreyfus was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by an antisemitic militarist who was later acquitted at trial. Dreyfus later fought in World War I, notably at the battles of Verdun and the Aisne, before retiring and leading a quiet life. He died in 1935 in Paris and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery. Dreyfus&#x27;s life and the antisemitic persecutions he endured left a significant mark on French political consciousness, while Esterhazy remained unpunished until his death. Among Dreyfus’s defenders were writers such as Zola, Charles Péguy, and Anatole France, politicians such as Georges Clemenceau and Jean Jaurès, and the founders of the Human Rights League (LDH) Francis de Pressensé and Pierre Quillard. 

==Early life, family, and education==
Born in Mulhouse, Alsace in 1859, to Raphaël and Jeannette Dreyfus (née Libmann), the youngest of nine children (seven of whom survived to adulthood). His grandfather was a merchant from a long established Alsatian Jewish family in Rixheim, not far from Mulhouse. His father became a prosperous industrialist who started a cotton mill, then expanded the business with a weaving factory. This enabled the Dreyfus family to live a comfortable and affluent life within Mulhouse society. He spent his first years in a house on Rue du Sauvage, then later in a mansion on Rue de la Sinne, both in Mulhouse. 

Because of his mother&#x27;s bedridden illness following his birth, his sister Henriette became like a second mother to him. Alfred was 10 years old when the Franco-Prussian War broke out in the summer of 1870, and following the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany after the war, he and his family moved to Basel, Switzerland, where he attended high school. The family later relocated to Paris.

==Early career==
The childhood experience of seeing his family uprooted by the war with Germany prompted Dreyfus to decide on a career in the military. Following his 18th birthday in October 1877, he enrolled in the elite military school in Paris, where he received military training and an education in the sciences. In 1880, he graduated and was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the French army. From 1880 to 1882, he attended the artillery school at Fontainebleau to receive more specialized training as an artillery officer. On graduation, he was assigned to the 31st Artillery Regiment, which was in the garrison at Le Mans. Dreyfus was subsequently transferred to a mounted artillery battery attached to the First Cavalry Division (Paris), and promoted to lieutenant in 1885. In 1889, he was made adjutant to the director of the Établissement de Bourges, a government arsenal, and promoted to captain.

On 18 April 1891, the 31-year-old Dreyfus married 20-year-old Lucie Eugénie Hadamard (1870–1945). They had two children, Pierre (1891–1946) and Jeanne (1893–1981). Three days after the wedding, Dreyfus learned that he had been admitted to the École Supérieure de Guerre or War College. Two years later, he graduated ninth in his class with honourable mention and was immediately designated as a trainee in the French Army&#x27;s General Staff headquarters, where he would be the only Jewish officer. His father Raphaël died on 13 December 1893.

At the War College examination in 1892, his friends had expected him to do well. However, one of the members of the panel, General Bonnefond, felt that &quot;Jews were not desired&quot; on the staff, and gave Dreyfus poor marks for &quot;cote d&#x27;amour&quot; (&quot;French slang: attraction&quot;; translatable as &quot;likability&quot;). Bonnefond&#x27;s assessment lowered Dreyfus&#x27; overall grade; he did the same to another Jewish candidate, Lieutenant Picard. Learning of this injustice, the two officers lodged a protest with the director of the school, General Lebelin de Dionne, who expressed his regret for what had occurred, but said he was powerless to take any steps in the matter. The protest would later count against Dreyfus. The French army of the period was relatively open to entry and advancement by talent, with an estimated 300 Jewish officers, of whom ten were generals. However, within the Fourth Bureau of the General Staff, General Bonnefond&#x27;s prejudices appear to have been shared by some of the new trainee&#x27;s superiors. The personal assessments received by Dreyfus during 1893/94 acknowledged his high intelligence, but were critical of aspects of his personality.

==The Dreyfus affair==


A torn-up handwritten note, referred to throughout the affair as the &quot;bordereau&quot;, was found by a French housekeeper, a woman named Marie Bastian, in a wastebasket at the German Embassy. Bastian, whose job was to burn the waste of Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, instead sent it to Hubert-Joseph Henry for potential interest to French intelligence. The bordereau described a minor French military secret, and had obviously been written by a spy in the French military.

In 1894, this made the French Army&#x27;s counter-intelligence section, led by Lieutenant Colonel Jean Sandherr, aware that information regarding new artillery parts was being passed to Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, the German military attache in Paris, by a highly placed spy most likely on the General Staff. Suspicion quickly fell upon Dreyfus, who was arrested for treason on 15 October 1894. 

On 5 January 1895, Dreyfus was summarily convicted in a secret court martial, publicly stripped of his army rank, and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil&#x27;s Island in French Guiana. Following French military custom of the time, Dreyfus was formally degraded (cashiered) by having the rank insignia, buttons and braid cut from his uniform and his sword broken, all in the courtyard of the École Militaire before silent ranks of soldiers, while a large crowd of onlookers shouted abuse from behind railings. Dreyfus cried out: &quot;I swear that I am innocent. I remain worthy of serving in the Army. Long live France! Long live the Army!&quot;

In August 1896, the new chief of French military intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Georges Picquart, reported to his superiors that he had found evidence to the effect that the real traitor was the Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy. Picquart was silenced by being transferred to command a tirailleur regiment based in Sousse, Tunisia, in November 1896. When reports of an army cover-up and Dreyfus&#x27; possible innocence were leaked to the press, a heated debate ensued about antisemitism and France&#x27;s identity as a Catholic nation or a republic founded on equal rights for all citizens. 

Esterhazy was found not guilty by a secret court martial, before fleeing secretly to England and shaving off his moustache. Rachel Beer, editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, interviewed him twice. He confessed to writing the bordereau under orders from Sandherr in an attempt to frame Dreyfus. She wrote about her interviews in September 1898, reporting his confession and writing a leader column accusing the French military of antisemitism and calling for a retrial for Dreyfus.

In France there was a passionate campaign by Dreyfus&#x27; supporters, including leading artists and intellectuals such as Émile Zola, following which he was given a second trial in 1899, but again declared guilty of treason despite the evidence of his innocence.

However, due to public opinion, Dreyfus was offered and accepted a pardon by President Émile Loubet in 1899 and released from prison; this was a compromise that saved face for the military&#x27;s mistake. Had Dreyfus refused the pardon, he would have been returned to Devil&#x27;s Island, a fate he could no longer emotionally cope with; so officially Dreyfus remained a traitor to France, and pointedly remarked upon his release:

For two years, until July 1906, he lived in a state of house arrest with one of his sisters at Carpentras, and later at Cologny.

On 12 July 1906, Dreyfus was officially exonerated by a military commission. The day after his exoneration, he was readmitted into the army with a promotion to the rank of major (&quot;Chef d&#x27;Escadron&quot;). A week later, he was made Knight of the Legion of Honour, and subsequently assigned to command an artillery unit at Vincennes. On 15 October 1906, he was placed in command of another artillery unit at Saint-Denis.

==Aftermath==
While attending a ceremony relocating Zola&#x27;s ashes to the Panthéon on 4 June 1908, Dreyfus was wounded in the arm by a gunshot from a right-wing journalist, , who was trying to assassinate him. Grégori was acquitted by the Parisian court, which accepted his defence that he had not meant to kill Dreyfus, meaning merely to graze him.

In 1937, Dreyfus&#x27; son Pierre published his father&#x27;s memoirs based on his correspondence between 1899 and 1906. The memoirs were titled &quot;Souvenirs et Correspondance&quot; and translated into English by Betty Morgan.

Dreyfus started corresponding with the marquise Marie-Louise Arconati-Visconti in 1899 and began attending her Thursday (political) salons after his release. They continued their correspondence until her death in 1923.

===Modern aftermath===
In October 2021, French president Emmanuel Macron opened a museum dedicated to the Dreyfus affair in Médan in the northwestern suburbs of Paris. He said that nothing could repair the humiliations and injustices Dreyfus had suffered, and &quot;let us not aggravate it by forgetting, deepening, or repeating them&quot;.

The reference to not repeating them follows attempts by the French far right to question Dreyfus&#x27; innocence. An army colonel was cashiered in 1994 for publishing an article suggesting that Dreyfus was guilty; far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s lawyer responded that Dreyfus&#x27; exoneration was &quot;contrary to all known jurisprudence&quot;. Éric Zemmour, a far-right political opponent of Macron, said repeatedly in 2021 that the truth about Dreyfus was not clear; his innocence was &quot;not obvious&quot;.

==Later life==


===World War I===
Dreyfus&#x27; prison sentence on Devil&#x27;s Island had taken its toll on his health. He was granted retirement from the army in October 1907 at the age of 48. As a reserve officer, he re-entered the army as a major of artillery at the outbreak of World War I. Serving throughout the war, Dreyfus was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

By then in his mid-50s, Dreyfus served mostly behind the lines of the Western Front, in part as commander of an artillery supply column. However, he also performed front-line duties in 1917, notably at Verdun and on the Chemin des Dames. He was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in November 1918.

Dreyfus&#x27; son Pierre also served throughout the entire war as an artillery officer, receiving the Croix de guerre.

===Death===
Dreyfus died in Paris aged 75, on 12 July 1935. Two days later, his funeral cortège passed the Place de la Concorde through the ranks of troops assembled for the Bastille Day national holiday. He was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris.

A statue of Dreyfus holding his broken sword is located at Boulevard Raspail, nº116–118, at the exit of the Notre-Dame-des-Champs metro station. A duplicate statue stands in the courtyard of the Museum of Jewish Art and History in Paris.

During the German occupation of France during WWII, Lucie Dreyfus, who had played a major role in the fight to exonerate her husband, was hidden in a convent in Valence. Their son, Pierre Léon Dreyfus (1891–1946), escaped to the United States in 1943. Their daughter, Jeanne Dreyfus Lévy (1893–1981), also survived, but granddaughter Madeleine Levy, arrested by French police in Toulouse, was deported and died of typhus in Auschwitz in January 1944, aged 25.

==Legacy==
Dreyfus&#x27; grandchildren donated over three thousand documents to the Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire du Judaïsme (Museum of Jewish Art and History), including personal letters, photographs of the trial, legal documents, writings by Dreyfus during his time in prison, personal family photographs, and his officer stripes that had been ripped off as a symbol of treason. The museum created an online platform in 2006 dedicated to the Dreyfus Affair.

<doc id="71849" wikidata="Q2663574" url="?curid=71849" title="Oscar the Grouch">
<text>Oscar the Grouch is a Muppet character created by Jim Henson and Jon Stone for the PBS/HBO children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He has a green body, no visible nose, and lives in a trash can. Oscar&#x27;s favorite thing is trash, as evidenced by the song &quot;I Love Trash&quot;, with a running theme being his collection of seemingly useless items. Although the term &quot;Grouch&quot; aptly describes Oscar&#x27;s misanthropic interaction with the other characters, it also refers to his species. The character was originally performed by Caroll Spinney from the show&#x27;s first episode until his retirement. Eric Jacobson began understudying for the character in 2015, and in 2018 officially became the primary performer of the role following Spinney&#x27;s retirement.

==Origins==
Initially, the puppet characters on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; did not appear on the actual Sesame Street set, but were relegated to the intermediary segments. Muppets creator Jim Henson wanted them to be integrated into the series, suggesting a giant bird and also a creature living in the neighborhood&#x27;s trash can. The character was developed by &quot;Sesame Street&quot; head writer Jon Stone and Henson. Puppeteer Caroll Spinney found inspiration for the voice in the driver of a New York City taxi he took to the studio. His first line was &quot;Where to, Mac?&quot;.

Henson credits the character&#x27;s name based on the personality of a &quot;magnificently rude&quot; restaurant owner and namesake of Oscar&#x27;s Salt of the Sea which Henson and Stone frequented. Henson&#x27;s office was on East 67th Street, just around the corner from Oscar&#x27;s Salt of the Sea on Third Avenue. In the early 1960s, Henson and Stone often had lunch there and observed that the owner, Oscar Karp, dressed in black, looked unkempt, and had a gruff disposition.

The Oscar Muppet was orange for the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and then changed to green, which remained his permanent color. This was explained within the show by a visit to Swamp Mushy Muddy.

According to &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s Robert W. Morrow, Oscar was created to indirectly demonstrate racial and ethnic diversity. Since his manners and tastes were different from those of the other characters, his creators hoped to address social issues by using his differences as a metaphor for racial and ethnic differences. Some viewers saw Oscar as a &quot;surrogate for poor, urban Americans&quot; during the show&#x27;s early seasons.
In the early &quot;Sesame Street&quot; development there was criticism that Oscar represented residents of inner city who had grown to accept injustice unchallenged, whilst other observers perceived Oscar to be a negative impression of African-Americans even though the Sesame Workshop did not intend the character to be a representation of black people. Joan Ganz Cooney was confused by this viewpoint when journalist Linda Francke informed her of its existence.

==Performing Oscar==
During the first season of Sesame Street, the street set was arranged in such a way that Spinney, who was right-handed, was forced to operate Oscar&#x27;s head with his left hand. After the set was redesigned, Spinney was able to switch hands.

In scenes where Oscar and Big Bird (both performed by Spinney) interact in a scene together, the situation has varied depending on the number of lines one or the other is given. When Spinney performed Big Bird, a second puppeteer operated Oscar to Spinney&#x27;s vocals; occasionally, Matt Vogel instead operated the Big Bird puppet to a vocal track by Spinney, while he performed Oscar. Previous Oscar puppeteers have included Jerry Nelson and Jim Martin.

In 2015, due to being diagnosed with dystonia, Spinney no longer puppeteered Oscar full-time on the show. Eric Jacobson became his understudy; often lip-syncing to a prerecorded vocal track by Spinney, and other times doing the voice himself. Spinney continued to provide Oscar&#x27;s voice on the series for seasons 46 and 47, as well as select commercials, online videos, and the special &quot;Once Upon a Sesame Street Christmas&quot;. Afterwards, Spinney entered semi-retirement, and Eric Jacobson fully assumed the role. Despite this, Spinney continued to receive onscreen credit for playing the characters through Season 50.

On October 17, 2018, Spinney announced his official retirement from both his characters. The following day, he recorded his final performances as Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird as part of Episode 5022 for the series&#x27; landmark 50th anniversary, though, when the episode aired, none of his vocals were kept in. Spinney&#x27;s final vocal performance as Oscar the Grouch to air was for Episode 4731.

==Attributes==
Oscar can also become mobile with the help of his friend Bruno the Trashman, who carries Oscar around in his trash can. Bruno is a full-body costume which allows Oscar&#x27;s puppeteer to manipulate Oscar while remaining hidden by the Bruno costume. Bruno&#x27;s tenure on the show lasted from 1979 to 1993. Also, as seen in the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; episode &quot;Dance&quot;, Oscar&#x27;s legs can protrude from the bottom of his trash can to allow him to walk around. Similarly, in &quot;Christmas Eve on Sesame Street&quot; (1978), Oscar is seen ice skating. For several seasons, Oscar was frequently shown with his friend and pet Slimey, an orange worm. On occasional episodes he has mentioned leaving Sesame Street to attend &quot;the annual Grouch convention in Syracuse, New York&quot;.

Oscar openly admits that he does not like anything or anybody that is nice, except young human children (the only people that he can actually act nice to without facing ridicule from his fellow Grouches) as well as older fans of the show. The only person he liked on camera was Maria, which he would never admit. He once inadvertently complimented a dance that his followers, The Grouchketeers, had performed for him. Oscar has shown rare acts of kindness such as trying to replace Ernie&#x27;s rubber duckie when Ernie had lost it. He also went out to find the missing Big Bird in &quot;Christmas Eve on Sesame Street&quot;. He and his girlfriend Grundgetta also love each other, though their relationship is somewhat rocky.

==Oscar’s trash can==
While appearing to be the size of a normal trash can on the outside, Oscar&#x27;s trash can is much bigger on the inside, as revealed in &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;. Oscar has said it holds a farm, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, and piano. Other items include his pet worm Slimey, his pet elephant Fluffy, his shoes, a backdoor and a gate to Grouchland USA, his hometown.

==International adaptations==
While Oscar receives new names in international dubs, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; international co-productions have often created their own version of the character.

In their second season, Germany&#x27;s &quot;Sesamstrasse&quot; created an antagonistic character named Uli von Bödefeld. While not a Grouch, he served the same role in plots as Oscar. When a fire destroyed the costume in 1988, a decade after he debuted, he and American segments of Oscar were both replaced by a Grouch named Rumpel. He has a pet caterpillar named Gustav, who is based on Slimey.

Israeli Grouch, Moishe Oofnik, Oscar&#x27;s cousin, is the only character to survive the first &quot;Rechov Sumsum&quot;, appearing in its current reboot; English/Hebrew series &quot;Shalom Sesame;&quot; and Israeli-Palestinian co-production &quot;Rechov Sumsum/Shara&#x27;a Simsim&quot;.

Other Grouches include Bodoque on Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot;, Pancho Contreras, technically a monster, on US Spanish version, Gugu on Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Vila Sesamo&quot;, Kırpık on Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Susam Sokağı&quot;, Ferrão on Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Rua Sésamo&quot;, and Kewal Khadoosa on India&#x27;s &quot;Galli Galli Sim Sim&quot;. Filipino adaptation &quot;Sesame!&quot; featured Kiko Matsing, basically a gorilla; also featured Bebong (The Trashed Monster).

Some Grouches differ from the mostly antagonistic mold. France&#x27;s &quot;1, Rue Sésame&quot; featured Mordicus, who, like Oscar, lives in a trash can, and is slightly cynical, but is also described as lively and enthusiastic, and participated in the neighborhood band.

In Pakistan, he is named Akhtar and lives in a rusty oil barrel.

==Appearances in other media==
A hybrid of Oscar the Grouch, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster appears in &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode &quot;The Goodies Rule – O.K.?&quot;, where it attacked Tim Brooke-Taylor whilst in a bin, only for Tim to eat it.

Oscar made what he called &quot;a very brief cameo&quot; in the 1981 Jim Henson movie &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;. When Miss Piggy threw a truck driver (played by Peter Ustinov) into a pile of boxes and a pile of trash cans, Oscar emerged from his trash can and demanded &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s all the racket?&quot; Oscar also appeared in the Jim Henson holiday special, &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;, when the Sesame Street Gang comes to the Grizzly Farm House for the holidays. In the film he befriends Rizzo the Rat who asks the Grouch if he could stay in his trash can for the night. Oscar agreed saying that he never had a rat in his trash can before.

Oscar could be seen among many villains in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Imagination Land III&quot;.

Oscar appears in the episode &quot;Fashion&quot; of the IFC show &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

Oscar was on an episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, imagined as the new chief of medicine.

Oscar is one of numerous PBS personalities chasing after Homer Simpson for not being able to pay a pledge in a &quot;Simpsons&quot; season 11 episode, &quot;&quot;. Oscar crashes through the window of the church Homer is hiding in, and demands the money while Elmo, who was hiding in the trash can with him, tells Homer he knows where he lives. He also appears in &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot;, a season 9 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Oscar inspired an Apple Macintosh INIT written by Eric B. Shapiro and shown at the 1989 MacHack conference, featuring a singing animated Oscar that appeared from the trash can when the trash was emptied. The hack was so popular that some parents lost the entire contents of their hard disks to preschoolers wanting to see more of Oscar, prompting Shapiro to create a stand-alone application using the same animation and sounds. The software was discontinued after Children&#x27;s Television Workshop sent Shapiro a cease and desist letter.

The fumetti comic &quot;Twisted Toyfare Theatre&quot; once featured Oscar in an issue in which he sings a variation of his &quot;I Love Trash&quot; song about Wesley Snipes&#x27; movies. In the end, Wesley Snipes (as Blade) decapitates him.

Oscar appeared on seven episodes of the game show &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;, which aired between January and February 2008.

Beginning in 2008, Oscar became the mascot for Waste Reduction Week in Canada, an environmental campaign.

In an episode of &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; called &quot;Scythe for Sale&quot;, a parody of Oscar emerges from a dumpster telling Billy to &quot;get outta my house&quot; and a car then crashes into his dumpster. The man in the car and &quot;Oscar&quot; then instruct the viewers that it is wrong to play with scythes (in response to Irwin&#x27;s stealing and misuse of Grim&#x27;s scythe) and to &quot;tell an adult immediately&quot; if they find one.

In the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; sequel &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot;, Oscar has an appearance with Darth Vader, trying to become part of Kahmunrah&#x27;s team—only to be discovered that he is not evil, just &quot;vaguely grouchy&quot;. The Oscar puppet that was used in filming is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

On May 29, 2009, Oscar the Grouch appeared in an ABC television special on economics called &quot;Un-broke: What You Need to Know About Money&quot;. He appeared showing the viewers what investing stocks means. It is shown that he has investment filings with Lehman Brothers, Worldcom, Enron, and Washington Mutual even though they are bankrupt companies, but he then says that they are not really his filings. The press kit for the special reveals that Oscar was popular with the crew for the special even during filming.

On October 11, 2009, Oscar appeared on the CBC Radio One show &quot;Q&quot;, hosted by Jian Ghomeshi. Beyond talking about his time on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, his love for trash and recycling, Oscar revealed that his father is actually from Saint David, New Brunswick and his mother grew up in Nova Scotia, thus making him of Canadian descent. He further went on to suggest that he had cheated on Grundgetta, his long-time girlfriend.

On November 12, 2009, Oscar appeared on CNN to celebrate the 40th anniversary of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Oscar reveals that he would still be orange if he bathed; his green exterior is apparently moss.

On an episode of &quot;Cake Boss&quot;, Buddy and his bakers visited Sesame Street, and Danny could be seen inside Oscar&#x27;s trash can. He tries his best Oscar impression by saying &quot;I live in the trash.&quot; Oscar can also be seen at the end when Buddy reveals his cake, but then goes back in his trash can, ostensibly to get away from the laughing and cheering.

Oscar also made appearances in episodes of the Cartoon Network show &quot;MAD&quot;.

On a Q TV interview promoting the benefits of being &quot;[Eco-]Green&quot;, Oscar suggests that he is actually Canadian. He later mentions that his favorite dessert is spinach sardine chocolate fudge sundaes. His second favorite dessert is mashed bananas with ice cubes and cold beef gravy, and in Season 12, he owns a car called &quot;The Sloppy Jalopy&quot;.

The October 12, 2019 episode of season 45 of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, hosted by David Harbour, included a sketch presenting the origin story of Oscar the Grouch in a &quot;Joker&quot; spoof.

In 2023, Oscar the Grouch was appointed the Chief Trash Officer of United Airlines&#x27; Sustainable Airline Fuel (SAF) program.

On the Masked Singer, guest Oscar was treated to Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s song You&#x27;re No Good; Oscar replies, &quot;You&#x27;re Too Good!&quot;

<text>Lady Eleanor Talbot ( – June 1468), also known by her married name Eleanor Butler (or Boteler), was an English noblewoman. She was a daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. After the death of Edward IV of England in 1483 it was claimed by Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells, that she was legally married precontract to Edward, which invalidated the king&#x27;s later marriage to Elizabeth Woodville. The evidence was examined and the Bishop was questioned by the Three Estates (informal sitting of parliament with the same members), who determined that Bishop Stillington&#x27;s claim was valid. The finding rendered Edward IV&#x27;s second secret marriage to Elizabeth Woodville bigamous, thereby making all seven children illegitimate, including Edward&#x27;s sons, the so-called Princes in the Tower. As the oldest male blood relative of Edward IV, his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was elected by the Three Estates to the throne as Richard III. Edward&#x27;s sons remained in the royal apartments in the Tower and subsequently disappeared. Various explanations for their appearance have been put forward. 

After the death of Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field, the new king Henry Tudor requested Parliament repeal the Titulus Regius and destroy all existing copies.

==Known life==
In 1449, 13-year-old Eleanor married Sir Thomas Butler (or Boteler), son of Ralph Boteler, Lord Sudeley. Thomas died at an unknown date before Edward IV of England&#x27;s overthrow of the House of Lancaster on 4 March 1461. Her father-in-law Lord Sudeley took back one of the two manors he had settled on her and her husband when they married, even though he did not have a licence for the transfer. Edward seized both properties after he became king.

Eleanor died in June 1468. She was interred on 30 June in Norwich.

==Allegations==

After King Edward&#x27;s death in 1483, his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed protector to the as-yet-uncrowned king Edward V. Richard placed Edward and his younger brother in the Tower of London. He then proclaimed that they were illegitimate. According to the French chronicler Philippe de Commines he acted with the support of Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells. Stillington had been briefly imprisoned and fined for speaking out against Edward IV in 1478. Commines later wrote,

The bishop discovered to the Duke of Gloucester that his brother king Edward had been formerly in love with a beautiful young lady and had promised her marriage upon condition that he might lie with her; the lady consented, and, as the bishop affirmed, he married them when nobody was present but they two and himself. His fortune depending on the court, he did not discover it, and persuaded the lady likewise to conceal it, which she did, and the matter remained a secret.

Richard then persuaded Parliament to pass an act, &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;, which debarred Edward V from the throne and proclaimed himself as King Richard III. At a meeting held on 23 January 1484 the former king&#x27;s marriage was declared illegal. The document states:

And howe also, that at the tyme of contract of the same pretensed Mariage, and bifore and longe tyme after, the seid King Edward was and stode maryed and trouth plight to oone Dame Elianor Butteler, Doughter of the old Earl of Shrewesbury, with whom the same King Edward had made a precontracte of Matrimonie, longe tyyme bifore he made the said pretensed Mariage with the said Elizabeth Grey, in maner and fourme abovesaid. 

Opponents of Richard declared that the precontract was fiction. Richard&#x27;s leading enemy, Henry Tudor, allied himself with Elizabeth Woodville, promising to re-legitimise her children if Richard was overthrown. After Henry&#x27;s army defeated and killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, he came to the throne as Henry VII. He ordered the copy of &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; in parliamentary records to be destroyed, along with all others (one copy was later found to have survived).

Stillington later joined the rebellion of Lambert Simnel against Henry in 1487. He was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower until his death in 1491.

==Possible issue==
It was suggested that Eleanor had given birth to a child, possibly fathered by King Edward IV, shortly before her death.

==Views of historians==
Because Commines does not name the &quot;beautiful young lady&quot;, and the official copy of &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; in parliament had been destroyed, Tudor historians confused Talbot with Edward&#x27;s long-standing mistress Elizabeth Lucy (also known as Elizabeth Wayte), the probable mother of Edward IV&#x27;s bastard son, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle. Thomas More, in his life of Richard III, states that Lucy was interrogated at the time of Edward&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, because Edward&#x27;s mother was strongly opposed to the marriage and had suggested that Edward was pre-contracted to Lucy. But Lucy denied that any contract had been made. More says that Richard revived the claim after Edward&#x27;s death.

George Buck, who found the only surviving copy of &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;, was the first to identify Eleanor Talbot as the woman in question. Buck, a defender of Richard, accepted the validity of the precontract. His view has been followed by many defenders of Richard since, including Horace Walpole and Clements Markham. Later Ricardians have also either accepted it as fact, or argued that Richard sincerely believed it to be true. It is also commonly argued by Ricardians that Stillington was imprisoned by Edward IV in 1478 because he incautiously spoke of the precontract to George, Duke of Clarence.

Other historians have been more sceptical. John A. Wagner states that &quot;most modern historians believe the precontract to be a fabrication devised to give Richard III&#x27;s usurpation a veneer of legitimacy. The betrothal cannot be documented beyond the account rehearsed in &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;, and Richard never attempted to have the precontract authenticated by a church court, the proper venue for such a case&quot;. Anne Crawford takes the view that any actual precontract with Eleanor Talbot is unlikely. If it had occurred before her marriage to Thomas Butler it would have been invalidated by the marriage. She suggests that the story may have originated with discussions between Edward&#x27;s father Richard, Duke of York, and Eleanor&#x27;s father John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, of a possible marriage, while both men were serving in France. But even that &quot;seems hardly likely&quot;. Any valid precontract would most likely have been made in the early phase of Edward&#x27;s reign, but the fact that Eleanor did not come forward when Edward married his queen militates against it. She also considers it odd that Eleanor&#x27;s family did not support Richard&#x27;s claims about the precontract. Since Edward was &quot;not stupid enough&quot; to have been unaware that any precontact would threaten his children&#x27;s claim to the throne, if it had existed he could easily have applied to the Pope to free himself of it, which would have been the action of &quot;any prudent king and his advisors&quot;. Michael Alexander argues that a precontract of marriage to Eleanor Talbot would not have affected the legitimacy of Edward&#x27;s sons, since they were born after she died, her death negating any marriage.

However, according to Helmholz (1986), canon law in this situation would not mitigate the illegitimacy of Edward&#x27;s sons as, if the pre-contract existed, it would have meant that adultery had taken place on the part of Edward with Elizabeth. As such the illegitimacy could not be overcome by the death of Eleanor before the birth of Elizabeth&#x27;s sons, even if Edward and Elizabeth married &#x27;again&#x27; after Eleanor&#x27;s death.

Even if there was no formal precontract it is possible that Eleanor Talbot&#x27;s name was used because she was known to have been one of the king&#x27;s lovers. According to Thomas More, Edward had three &quot;concubines&quot; to whom he referred as the &quot;merriest&quot;, the &quot;wiliest&quot; and &quot;the holiest harlot in the realm&quot; (who was always in church when she wasn&#x27;t in bed with the king). More names the &quot;merriest&quot; as Jane Shore, but does not name the others because they were of higher social status (&quot;somewhat greater personages&quot;). It has been speculated that Elizabeth Lucy and Eleanor Talbot were the other two. Her loss of property after the death of her husband may have initiated the affair. Michael Hicks suggests that King Edward was liable to give &quot;benefits&quot; in exchange for sex: &quot;Three young widows, Eleanor Butler, Elizabeth Lucy and Elizabeth Wydeville [Woodville], may have bought concrete benefits from Edward IV with their sexual favours&quot;.

<text>(&quot;royal title&quot; in Latin) is a statute of the Parliament of England issued in 1484 by which the title of King of England was given to Richard III.

The act ratified the declaration of the Lords and the members of the House of Commons a year earlier that the marriage of Edward IV of England to Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid and so their children, including Edward, Richard and Elizabeth, were illegitimate and thus debarred from the throne. Their uncle Richard III had been proclaimed the rightful king. Since the Lords and the Commons had not been officially convened as a parliament, doubts had arisen as to its validity and so when Parliament convened, it enacted the declaration as a law.

After the death and overthrow of Richard III, the act was repealed, which had the effect of reinstating the legitimacy of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s children.

==Contents==

Edward&#x27;s marriage was invalidated because Bishop Robert Stillington testified that the king had precontracted a marriage to Lady Eleanor Butler.

And how also, that at the time of contract of the same pretensed Marriage, and before and long time after, the said King Edward was and stood married and troth-plight to one Dame Eleanor Butler, Daughter of the old Earl of Shrewsbury, with whom the same King Edward had made a precontract of Matrimony, long time before he made the said pretensed Marriage with the said Elizabeth [Woodville] Grey, in manner and form above-said.

The document also claimed that Elizabeth Woodville and her mother had used witchcraft to get the king to marry her. Since Richard&#x27;s brother George, Duke of Clarence, had been executed and attainted, his descendants forfeited all rights to the throne, leaving Richard the true heir. For good measure, the document also hinted that George and Edward (born in Ireland and Normandy, respectively) were themselves illegitimate and stated Richard, &quot;born within this land&quot; was the &quot;undoubted son and heir of Richard, late Duke of York&quot;.

Edward&#x27;s reign was also criticised, he was said to have led by &quot;sensuality and concupiscence&quot; and delighted in &quot;adulation and flattery&quot; and to have been easily influenced by &quot;persons insolent, vicious and of inordinate avarice&quot;, a reference to the Woodville family. In contrast, Richard was said to have been a man distinguished by &quot;great wit, prudence, justice, princely courage, and memorable and laudable acts in diverse battles.&quot;

==Repeal==

After Richard was killed in battle, the act was repealed by the first parliament of the new king, Henry VII. The repeal was important because the new King and his supporters viewed Richard III&#x27;s rule as a usurpation and also because Henry VII&#x27;s prospective wife, Elizabeth of York, whom he had pledged to marry if he gained the throne, was the eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville and the Act had made her illegitimate.

Henry also ordered his subjects to destroy all copies of it and all related documents without reading them. His orders were carried out so well that only one copy of the law has ever been found. That copy was transcribed by a monastic chronicler into the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot;, where it was discovered by Sir George Buck more than a century later during the reign of James I.

The repealing act was passed in the first Parliament of Henry VII, stating that the original &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; was
void, adnulled, repelled, irrite [invalidated], and of noe force ne effecte and that the original be destroyed, and that any copies should be either destroyed or returned to Parliament on pain of fine and imprisonment.

A law report from his reign stated:
that the said Bill, Act and Record, be annulled and utterly destroyed, and that it be ordained by the same Authority, that the same Act and Record be taken out of the Roll of Parliament, and be cancelled and brent [&#x27;burned&#x27;], and be put in perpetual oblivion.

Henry almost succeeded in suppressing the &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;. The 100-year gap during which &quot;&quot; was censored coincided with the ruling period of the Tudor dynasty. It was known that Richard had claimed that a marriage pre-contract invalidated Edward&#x27;s sons&#x27; right to the throne, but it was not known who Edward&#x27;s supposed &quot;real&quot; wife was. Thomas More assumed that the act referred to Edward&#x27;s longtime mistress, Elizabeth Lucy, a view that was repeated until Buck discovered the original document.

Edward IV&#x27;s first son, though &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; annulled his reign, is still counted as Edward V to emphasise that Richard III was a usurper. Thus, Henry VII&#x27;s grandson was numbered Edward VI.

<doc id="71864" wikidata="Q1256" url="?curid=71864" title="Liguria">
<text>Liguria (; ; , ) is a region of north-western Italy; its capital is Genoa. Its territory is crossed by the Alps and the Apennines mountain range and is roughly coextensive with the former territory of the Republic of Genoa. Liguria is bordered by France (Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur) to the west, Piedmont to the north, and Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany to the east. It rests on the Ligurian Sea, and has a population of 1,557,533. The region is part of the Alps–Mediterranean Euroregion.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Liguria&quot; predates Latin and is of obscure origin. The Latin adjectives (as in ) and &quot;Liguscus&quot; reveal the original root of the name, &quot;ligusc-&quot;: in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of , according to rhotacism. Compare whence . The name derives from the ancient Ligures people, although the territory of this people was much larger than the current administrative region; it included all of North-west Italy south to the Po river, and south-eastern France.

==Geography==

The narrow strip of land is bordered by the sea, the Alps and the Apennine Mountains. Some mountains rise above ; the watershed line runs at an average altitude of about . The highest point of the region is the summit of Monte Saccarello ().

Liguria is the third smallest Italian region after Aosta Valley and Molise, but is also one of the most densely populated, with a population density of 287 inhabitants/km2, much higher than the national average, and is fourth place after Campania, Lombardy and Lazio. However, there is much difference between inland mountain areas and coastal areas.

The region is crossed east to west by the Ligurian Alps and the Ligurian Apennines that form an interrupted chain, but discontinuous in its morphology, with stretches where the Alpine/Apennine ridge is extremely compact and high aligning very high mountain groups (north to Ventimiglia, a series of massifs which became French after the Second World War, rises up to altitudes of 2700–3000 m) while in other stretches (for example in the hinterland of Savona and Genoa) the mountain barrier is not very high and deeply crossed by short valleys and passes that do not reach 500 m above sea level (Bochetta di Altare, Passo dei Giovi, Crocetta d&#x27;Orero).

The winding arched extension goes from Ventimiglia to La Spezia. Of this, are mountainous (65% of the total) and are hills (35% of the total). Liguria&#x27;s natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.

The continental shelf is very narrow and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its coastline. Except for the Portovenere and Portofino promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at Genoa and La Spezia.

The hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are and summer temperatures are , which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an orographic effect. Genoa and La Spezia can see up to of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of annually.

As of 2023, according to the report on land consumption of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, Marche and Liguria hold the Italian record for coastal overbuilding.

===Italian Riviera===
The Italian Riviera or Ligurian Riviera is the narrow coastal strip in Italy which lies between the Ligurian Sea and the mountain chain formed by the Maritime Alps and the Apennines. Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or ) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany. The Italian Riviera thus includes nearly all of the coastline of Liguria. Historically the &quot;Riviera&quot; extended further to the west, through what is now French territory as far as Marseille.

The Italian Riviera crosses all four Ligurian provinces and their capitals Genoa, Savona, Imperia and La Spezia, with a total length of about 350 km (218 miles). It is customarily divided into a western section, the Ponente Riviera, and an eastern section, the Levante Riviera, the point of division being the apex of the Ligurian arc at Voltri. It has about 1.6 million inhabitants, and most of the population is concentrated within the coastal area. Its mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of Liguria.
As a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.

Industries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy&#x27;s leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy&#x27;s major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important. in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes &quot;Cinque Terre&quot;, Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy&#x27;s 58 World Heritage Sites.

The Riviera&#x27;s centre is Genoa, which divides it into two main sections: the Riviera di Ponente (&quot;the coast of the setting sun&quot;), extending westwards from Genoa to the French border; and the Riviera di Levante (&quot;the coast of the rising sun&quot;) between Genoa and Capo Corvo. It is known for its mild climate and its reputation for a relaxed way of life, old fishing ports, and landscapes. It has been a popular destination for travellers and tourists since the time of Byron and Percy Shelley.

Many villages and towns in the area are internationally known, such as Portofino, Bordighera, Lerici and the Cinque Terre. Many villages of Italian Riviera are counted among I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;). The part of the Riviera di Ponente centred on Savona, is called the Riviera delle Palme (the Riviera of palms); the part centred on Sanremo, is the Riviera dei Fiori, after the long-established flower growing industry.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
Evidence of human presence in Liguria dates back to prehistoric times. Near the port of Nice, in Terra Amata, traces of the oldest huts built by nomadic hunters, around 300,000 years ago, have been found. The stratigraphy showed different settlement periods, with the remains of oval huts with a central hearth, chipped pebbles, scrapers and captured animals such as wild boar, turtles, Merk&#x27;s rhinoceros, southern elephants, aurochs and various birds. Traces of Neanderthal Man have been found near Loano. In the caves of Toirano, signs of frequentation dating back to the end of the Upper Palaeolithic are visible. Remains reminiscent of Cro-Magnon Man have appeared in the Balzi Rossi cave in Ventimiglia. At the Arene Candide there is evidence of Neolithic and epigravettian strata dating between 20,000 and 18,700 years ago, while in the caves along the Pennavaira stream, in the valley of the same name in the Ingauno area, human remains have been found dating back as far as 7,000 BC.
Copper begins to be mined from the middle of the 4th millennium BC in Liguria with the Libiola and Monte Loreto mines dated to 3700 BC.
These are the oldest copper mines in the western Mediterranean basin.

From the 2nd millennium B.C. (Neolithic), there are records of the presence of Ligurians over a vast territory, corresponding to most of northern Italy.

It is commonly thought that the ancient Ligurians settled on the Mediterranean coastline, divided in several tribes, from the Rhone to the Arno (so we are told by Polybius), pushing their presence as far as the Spanish Mediterranean coast to the west and the Tiber to the south-east, colonizing the coasts of major islands such as Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily. Numerous ceramic artefacts remain of them.

=== The foundation of Genoa ===

The Genoa area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC. In ancient times this area was inhabited by Ligures (ancient people after whom Liguria is named). According to excavations carried out in the city between 1898 and 1910, the Ligure population that lived in Genoa maintained trade relations with the Etruscans and the Greeks, since several objects from these populations were found. In the 5th century BC the first town, or oppidum, was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. The ancient Ligurian city was known as Stalia (Σταλìα), referred to in this way by Artemidorus Ephesius and Pomponius Mela; this toponym is possibly preserved in the name of Staglieno, some from the coast. Stalia had an alliance with Rome through a &quot;foedus aequum&quot; (equal pact) in the course of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). The Carthaginians accordingly destroyed it in 209 BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the Carthaginian Wars ended in 146 BC, it received municipal rights. The original &quot;castrum&quot; then expanded towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trade goods included skins, timber, and honey. Goods were moved to and from Genoa&#x27;s hinterland, including major cities like Tortona and Piacenza. An amphitheater was also found there among other archaeological remains from the Roman period.

=== Roman times ===

During the first Punic War, the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with Carthage, others, including the inhabitants of Stalia (later Genoa), with Rome. Under Augustus, Liguria was designated a region of Italy (&quot;Regio IX Liguria&quot;) stretching from the coast to the banks of the Po River. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of Albenga, Ventimiglia and Luni. In 180 B.C., the Romans, in order to dispose of Ligurian rebels in their seeking of the conquest of Gaul, they deported 47,000 Liguri Apuani, confining them to the Samnite area between Avellino and Benevento.

===Middle Ages===

Between the 4th and the 10th centuries, Liguria was dominated by the Byzantines, the Lombards of King Rothari (about 641) and the Franks (about 774). It was also invaded by Saracen and Norman raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries, the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops&#x27; power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which Genoa soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.

Between the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the Republic of Genoa experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the Mediterranean from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the Battle of Meloria (1284), it acquired control over the Tyrrhenian Sea and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, having colonies up to Black Sea and Crimean.

After the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of Simone Boccanegra, Genoa resumed its struggles against the Marquisate of Finale and the Counts of Laigueglia and it conquered again the territories of Finale, Oneglia and Porto Maurizio. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the Visconti family of Milan. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra&#x27;s lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge Antoniotto Adorno to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.

===Early modern===

The alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when Andrea Doria allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic relative stability for about 250 years.

Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus&#x27;s speculative proposal to reach the East Indies by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative spice trade with Asia. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the Bahamas archipelago, at a locale he named &quot;San Salvador&quot;. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and Central America, claiming them for the Spanish Empire.
The value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the Age of Discovery, when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the Cape of Good Hope. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 bombardment by Louis XIV&#x27;s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the Piedmontese and Austrian armies when these two states came into conflict with France. Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the Habsburg troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon&#x27;s first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the Ligurian Republic, modelled on the French Republic. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the French Empire (1805) and divided by Napoleon into three departments: Montenotte (department), with capital Savona, Gênes, with capital Genoa and the department of the Apennines, with the capital Chiavari.

===Late modern and contemporary===

After a short period of independence in 1814, the Congress of Vienna (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population&#x27;s national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of &quot;Risorgimento&quot; were born in Liguria (Giuseppe Mazzini, Mameli, Nino Bixio). Italian patriot and general Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in the neighbouring Nice (then part of the Sardinian state), started his Expedition of the Thousand on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.

In late 19th and early 20th century, the region&#x27;s economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from Imperia to La Spezia, while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the Second World War, Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the German troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led—among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat, the city was awarded the gold medal for military valour.

==Demographics==

The population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km2, or 770 per mi2), being only less than Campania&#x27;s, Lombardy&#x27;s and Lazio&#x27;s. In the Metropolitan City of Genoa, it reaches almost 500 inhabitants per km2, whereas in the provinces of Imperia and Savona it is less than 200 inhabitants per km2. The Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur, noting it from sea in 1436, remarked &quot;To one who does not know it, the whole coast from Savona to Genoa looks like one continuous city, so well inhabited is it, and so thickly studded with houses,&quot; and today over 80% of the regional population still lives permanently near to the coast, where all the four major cities above 50,000 are located: Genoa (pop. 610,000), La Spezia (pop. 95,000), Savona (pop. 62,000) and Sanremo (pop. 56,000).

The population of Liguria has been declining since the census in 1971, most markedly in the cities of Genoa, Savona and La Spezia. The age pyramid now looks more like a &#x27;mushroom&#x27; resting on a fragile base. The negative trend has been partially interrupted only in the last decade when, after a successful economic recovery, the region has attracted consistent fluxes of immigrants. , the Italian national institute of statistics, ISTAT, estimated that 90,881 foreign-born immigrants live in Liguria, equal to 5.7% of the total regional population.

==Economy==
Ligurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, wine, olive oil) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999). The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).

Sanremo Casino (official ) is a gambling and entertainment complex located in Sanremo, on the Italian Riviera. The Casino&#x27;s building was designed by French architect Eugène Ferret, opening 14 January 1905. Seven different projects were submitted, resulting in the victory of Ferret, who adhered to the Art Nouveau movement, so much in vogue in France back then. Ferret was also to be the first manager of the proper gaming activities by an agreement signed on 5 November 1903. From 1913 the Casino had its own tram connection. From 1927 to 1934 the Casino was managed by Luigi De Santis who proved to be, among other things, a first-rate gamester for its knowledge of the game and the particularities of the world around it. In the 1930s, Pietro Mascagni, Luigi Pirandello and Francesco Pastonchi were regular clients of the Casino. De Santis invited Marta Abba to Sanremo and offered her the Compagnia Stabile (Theatre Company) of which Pirandello was to be its Artistic Director. It also granted funds to Pastonchi for the organisation and setting up of the Literary Mondays. The Sanremo Casino closed its doors on 10 June 1940. Still, undamaged by the war and two German and allied occupations, the Casino resumed its activities seven months after the end of World War II. From its first edition in 1951 until 1976, the Sanremo Casino was home of the Sanremo Music Festival.

Steel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting production. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding, electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the region still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).
In the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.

=== Economical statistics ===
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 49.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.8% of Italy&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 32,000 euros or 106% of the EU27 average in the same year.

The unemployment rate stood at 8.3% in 2020 and was slightly lower than the national average.
===Wine===

Liguria is an Italian wine region located in the northwest region of Italy along the Italian Riviera. It is bordered by the Piedmont wine region to the north, the Alps and French wine region of Provence to the west, the Apennine Mountains and the Emilia-Romagna wine region to the east with a small border shared with Tuscany in the south-east along the Ligurian Sea.

Liguria has several &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; regions with the most notable being the Cinque Terre DOC from cliff side vineyards situated among the five fishing villages of Cinque Terre in the province of La Spezia. The DOC produces light white wines made from grape varieties such as Bosco, Albarola and Vermentino. In the west is the red wine-producing region of Dolceacqua, producing wine from the indigenous Rossese grape.

The following is a list of DOCs in the Liguria region along with the grapes that may be included in the blend under varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label.

*Cinque Terre DOC - White wine only DOC producing wine from the Bosco, Albarola and Vermentino grapes. A &quot;passito&quot; and &quot;liquoroso&quot; style made from the same grapes can also be produced under the Sciacchetra designation.
*Colli di Luni DOC - Red and white wine DOC producing wine from Sangiovese, Canaiolo, Ciliegiolo, Pollera nera, Bracciola nera, Trebbiano and Vermentino.

==Government and politics==
The politics of Liguria takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.

The Regional Government is presided by the Governor, who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed of the President and the Ministers, who are currently 11, including a vice president.

The Regional Council of is composed of 40 members and it is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the &quot;simul stabunt vel simul cadent&quot; clause (introduced in 1999), also the council will be dissolved and there will be a fresh election.

In the last regional election, which took place on 31 May 2015, Giovanni Toti (Forza Italia) defeated Raffaella Paita (Democratic Party), after 10 years of regional left-wing government by Claudio Burlando (Democratic Party).

At both national and local level, Liguria is considered a swing region, where no one of the two political blocs is dominant, with the two eastern provinces leaning left, and the two western provinces right.

Liguria is one of 20 regions (administrative divisions) of Italy.

==Administrative divisions==

Liguria is divided into four provinces:

Vegetables, especially beans, are important in Ligurian cooking. &quot;Mesciua&quot; soup is made from beans, olive oil and farro (old kinds of wheat including emmer). The Badalucco, conio and pigna beans are a Slow Food Presidium.

The Milan–San Remo (in Italian &quot;Milano-Sanremo&quot;), also called &quot;&quot;The Spring classic&quot; or &quot;La Classicissima&quot;&quot;, is an annual road cycling race between Milan and Sanremo, in Northwest Italy. With a distance of 298 km (~185.2 miles) it is the longest professional one-day race in modern cycling. It is the first major classic race of the season, usually held on the third Saturday of March. The first edition was held in 1907. It is traditionally the first of the five &quot;Monuments&quot; of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling. 

The Rallye Sanremo is a rally competition held in Sanremo, Italy. Except for the 1995 event, the event was part of the FIA World Rally Championship schedule from 1973 to the 2003. It was a round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge and is currently a round of the Italian national rally championship. The first &quot;Rallye Internazionale di Sanremo&quot; was held in 1928. The rally name&#x27;s French word &quot;rallye&quot;, as opposed to Italian &quot;rally&quot;, was inspired by Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo. After another successful rally in 1929, the event was given to new organisers who decided to set up a street race through the town of Sanremo instead. The first one, 1° Circuito Automobilistico Sanremo, was held in 1937 and won by Achille Varzi. Rallye Sanremo was restarted in 1961 as Rallye dei Fiori (&quot;Rally of the Flowers&quot;) and has been held every year since.

The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).
In average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region. The Port of Genoa, with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes is the first port of Italy, the second in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units after the port of transshipment of Gioia Tauro, with a trade volume of 1.86 million TEUs. The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona and Canary Islands.

===Airports===

* Genoa Cristoforo Colombo Airport — commonly Genoa-Sestri Ponente Airport after the city district where it is located — is an international airport built on an artificial peninsula, west of Genoa, Italy. The airport began construction in 1954 and opened in 1962, at a cost of 12.8 billion lira. Building an offshore airport was not a strange or unique solution only for Genoa. Among the most conspicuous examples are other airports in Nice, Venice, Gibraltar, or Hong Kong. The current terminal building was opened in 1986. It is the most important airport in Liguria and it serves the city and Port of Genoa, as well as a considerable population in Southern Piedmont (Asti and Alessandria Provinces, southern areas of Cuneo Province).
* Riviera Airport, former known as Villanova d&#x27;Albenga Airport, is on the Italian Riviera between Savona and Imperia, approximately west of the town of Albenga, in the community of Villanova d’Albenga. Riviera Airport is mainly used for general aviation in the Northern Mediterranean, with international travel and transport facilitated by the presence of Italian Customs. The airport is also used by the Italian aeroplane manufacturer Piaggio Aerospace. Riviera Airport is well connected to all financial and tourist centres on the Italian and French Riviera by means of highway A10 and the Via Aurelia (SS1). While Monte-Carlo is less than an hour&#x27;s travel by car, a helicopter company based at the airport can connect passengers from the runway directly to the Principality of Monaco in less than 20 minutes. The airport opened in 1922.

<text>Marija Gimbutas (, ; January 23, 1921 – February 2, 1994) was a Lithuanian archaeologist and anthropologist known for her research into the Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures of &quot;Old Europe&quot; and for her Kurgan hypothesis, which located the Proto-Indo-European homeland in the Pontic Steppe.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Marija Gimbutas was born as Marija Birutė Alseikaitė to Veronika Janulaitytė-Alseikienė and Danielius Alseika in Vilnius, the capital of the Republic of Central Lithuania; her parents were members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia.

Her mother received a doctorate in ophthalmology at the University of Berlin in 1908, while her father received his medical degree from the University of Tartu in 1910. After Lithuania regained independence in 1918, Gimbutas&#x27;s parents organized the Lithuanian Association of Sanitary Aid which founded the first Lithuanian hospital in the capital.

During this period, her father also served as the publisher of the newspaper &quot;Vilniaus žodis&quot; and the cultural magazine &quot;Vilniaus šviesa&quot; and was an outspoken proponent of Lithuanian independence during the Polish–Lithuanian War.

Gimbutas&#x27;s parents were connoisseurs of traditional Lithuanian folk arts and frequently invited contemporary musicians, writers, and authors to their home, including Vydūnas, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, and Jonas Basanavičius. With regard to her strong cultural upbringing, Gimbutas said:I had the opportunity to get acquainted with writers and artists such as Vydūnas, Tumas-Vaižgantas, even Basanavičius, who was taken care of by my parents. When I was four or five years old, I would sit in Basanavičius&#x27;s easy chair and I would feel fine. And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavičius&#x27;s collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.

In 1931, Gimbutas settled with her parents in Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. After her parents separated that year, she lived with her mother and brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father&#x27;s deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: &quot;All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read.&quot;

===Emigration and life abroad===
In 1941, she married architect Jurgis Gimbutas. During the Second World War, Gimbutas lived under the Soviet occupation (1940–41) and then the German occupation (1941–43).

Gimbutas&#x27; first daughter, Danutė, was born in June 1942. One year after the birth of their daughter, the young Gimbutas family, in the face of an advancing Soviet army, fled the country to areas controlled by Nazi Germany, first to Vienna and then to Innsbruck and Bavaria. In her reflection of this turbulent period, Gimbutas remarked, &quot;Life just twisted me like a little plant, but my work was continuous in one direction.&quot;

While holding a postdoctoral fellowship at Tübingen the following year, Gimbutas gave birth to her second daughter, Živilė. In the 1950s, the Gimbutas family left Germany and relocated to the United States, where Gimbutas had a successful academic career. Her third daughter, Rasa Julija, was born in 1954 in Boston.

Gimbutas died in Los Angeles in 1994, at age 73. Soon afterwards, she was interred in Kaunas&#x27;s Petrašiūnai Cemetery.

==Career==

=== Education and academic appointments ===
From 1936, Gimbutas participated in ethnographic expeditions to record traditional folklore and studied Lithuanian beliefs and rituals of death. She graduated with honors from Aušra Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1938 and enrolled in the Vytautas Magnus University the same year, where she studied linguistics in the Department of Philology. She then attended the University of Vilnius to pursue graduate studies in archaeology (under Jonas Puzinas), linguistics, ethnology, folklore and literature.

In 1942 she completed her master&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Modes of Burial in Lithuania in the Iron Age&quot;, with honors. She received her Master of Arts degree from the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1942.

In 1946, Gimbutas received a doctorate in archaeology, with minors in ethnology and history of religion, from University of Tübingen with her dissertation &quot;Prehistoric Burial Rites in Lithuania&quot; (&quot;Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit&quot;), which was published later that year. She often said that she had the dissertation under one arm and her child under the other arm when she and her husband fled the city of Kaunas, Lithuania, in the face of an advancing Soviet army in 1944.

From 1947 to 1949 she did postgraduate work at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich.

After arriving in the United States in the 1950s, Gimbutas immediately went to work at Harvard University translating Eastern European archaeological texts. She then became a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology. In 1955 she was made a Fellow of Harvard&#x27;s Peabody Museum. As a woman scholar, Gimbutas was banned from using Harvard&#x27;s library which was reserved for men only. This was a factor in her leaving Harvard for UCLA.

Gimbutas then taught at UCLA, where she became Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies in 1964 and Curator of Old World Archaeology in 1965. In 1993, Gimbutas received an honorary doctorate at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania.

===Kurgan hypothesis===
In 1956 Gimbutas introduced her &quot;Kurgan hypothesis&quot;, which combined archaeological study of the distinctive &quot;Kurgan&quot; burial mounds with linguistics to unravel some problems in the study of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) speaking peoples, whom she dubbed the &quot;Kurgans&quot;; namely, to account for their origin and to trace their migrations into Europe. This hypothesis, and her method of bridging the disciplines, has had a significant impact on Indo-European studies.

During the 1950s and early 1960s, Gimbutas earned a reputation as a world-class specialist on Bronze Age Europe, as well as on Lithuanian folk art and the prehistory of the Balts and Slavs, partly summed up in her definitive opus, &quot;Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe&quot; (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in linguistics, ethnology, and the history of religions, and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization.

As a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at UCLA from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas directed major excavations of Neolithic sites in southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near Štip, Republic of North Macedonia, and Sitagroi and Achilleion in Thessaly (Greece). Digging through layers of earth representing a period of time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe – where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds – she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and religion or spirituality, which she researched and documented throughout her career.

Three genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the Kurgan theory of Gimbutas regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, Y-chromosome haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages.

===Late archaeology===

Gimbutas gained fame and notoriety in the English-speaking world with her last three English-language books: &quot;The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe&quot; (1974); &quot;The Language of the Goddess&quot; (1989), which inspired an exhibition in Wiesbaden, 1993–94; and the last of the three, &quot;The Civilization of the Goddess&quot; (1991), which, based on her documented archaeological findings, presented an overview of her conclusions about Neolithic cultures across Europe: housing patterns, social structure, art, religion, and the nature of literacy.

The &quot;Goddess&quot; trilogy articulated what Gimbutas saw as the differences between the Old European system, which she considered goddess- and woman-centered (gynocentric), and the Bronze Age Indo-European patriarchal (&quot;androcratic&quot;) culture which supplanted it. According to her interpretations, gynocentric (or &quot;matristic&quot;) societies were peaceful, honored women, and espoused economic equality.
The androcratic, or male-dominated, Kurgan peoples, on the other hand, invaded Europe and imposed upon its natives the hierarchical rule of male warriors.

===Influence===

Gimbutas&#x27;s work, along with that of her colleague, mythologist Joseph Campbell, is housed in the OPUS Archives and Research Center on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria, California. The library includes Gimbutas&#x27;s extensive collection on the topics of archaeology, mythology, folklore, art and linguistics. The Gimbutas Archives house over 12,000 images personally taken by Gimbutas of sacred figures, as well as research files on Neolithic cultures of Old Europe.

Mary Mackey has written four historical novels based on Gimbutas&#x27;s research: &quot;The Year the Horses Came&quot;, &quot;The Horses at the Gate&quot;, &quot;The Fires of Spring&quot;, and &quot;The Village of Bones&quot;.

==Reception==


Joseph Campbell and Ashley Montagu each compared the importance of Gimbutas&#x27;s output to the historical importance of the Rosetta Stone in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. Campbell provided a foreword to a new edition of Gimbutas&#x27;s &quot;The Language of the Goddess&quot; (1989) before he died, and often said how profoundly he regretted that her research on the Neolithic cultures of Europe had not been available when he was writing &quot;The Masks of God&quot;. The ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak argued in 2011 that a &quot;backlash&quot; against Gimbutas&#x27;s work had been orchestrated, starting in the last years of her life and following her death.

Mainstream archaeology dismissed Gimbutas&#x27;s later works. Anthropologist Bernard Wailes (1934–2012) of the University of Pennsylvania commented to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that most of Gimbutas&#x27;s peers believe her to be &quot;immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis. ... She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument.&quot; He said that most archaeologists consider her to be an eccentric.

David W. Anthony has praised Gimbutas&#x27;s insights regarding the Indo-European Urheimat, but also disputed Gimbutas&#x27;s assertion that there was a widespread peaceful society before the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan. A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.

Peter Ucko and Andrew Fleming were two early critics of the &quot;Goddess&quot; theory, with which Gimbutas later came to be associated. Ucko, in his 1968 monograph &quot;Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt&quot; warned against unwarranted inferences about the meanings of statues. He notes, for example, that early Egyptian figurines of women holding their breasts had been taken as &quot;obviously&quot; significant of maternity or fertility, but the Pyramid Texts revealed that in Egypt this was the female gesture of grief.

Fleming, in his 1969 paper &quot;The Myth of the Mother Goddess&quot;, questioned the practice of identifying neolithic figures as female when they weren&#x27;t clearly distinguished as male and took issue with other aspects of the &quot;Goddess&quot; interpretation of Neolithic stone carvings and burial practices. Cynthia Eller also discusses the place of Gimbutas in injecting the idea into feminism in her 2000 book &quot;The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory&quot;.

The 2009 book &quot;Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism&quot; by Cathy Gere examines the political influence on archaeology more generally. Through the example of Knossos on the island of Crete, which had been represented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting what people want to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.

<text>Marlboro College was a private college in Marlboro, Vermont. Founded in 1946, it remained intentionally small, operating as a self-governing community with students following self-designed degree plans culminating in a thesis. In 1998, the college added a graduate school.

The college closed at the end of the 2019–2020 academic year and gave its endowment to Emerson College in Boston to create the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies at Emerson College.

==History==
Marlboro College was founded in 1946 by Walter F. Hendricks, who had been inspired by his time as director of English at Biarritz American University. Hendricks led the college for five years, until 1951, but would leave after a dispute with the trustees. He founded Windham College that same year.

Many of the first students were returning World War II veterans. The campus incorporated the buildings of three farms that were on the site at Potash Hill. The first students were primarily freshmen but included some sophomores and juniors and one senior, Hugh Mulligan, who in 1948 became the first Marlboro graduate. The students made &quot;How Are Things At Casserole College?&quot; the first school song in response to the dining hall menu.

In 2012, Marlboro instituted the Beautiful Minds Challenge, an essay contest for high school students with full or partial scholarships and other awards as prizes. Essays could take the form of text, images, audio, or video and were judged by Marlboro faculty, staff, and students; finalists were flown to the Marlboro campus for a symposium where they presented their work. The program was discontinued after the 2018 competition. The Renaissance Scholars program, instituted in 2015 with the objective of attracting new students from every state and increasing diversity, caused a rise in enrollment to approximately 200 in fall 2016.

The college remained intentionally small; in 2017 it was one of only three liberal arts colleges listed by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; where all classes had fewer than 20 students.

===Merger===
In 2018, Marlboro&#x27;s small size and dwindling enrollment led the Board of Trustees to begin exploring merging with another college or university. In 2019, a merger with the University of Bridgeport was announced and then called off.

Later that year, the college announced that it would merge with Emerson College at the end of the 2019–20 academic year. Under the agreement, finalized on July 23, 2020, Marlboro gave its endowment to Emerson, which created the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies. Marlboro students were guaranteed admission and tenure-track faculty were guaranteed teaching positions at Emerson. At the time of its closure, Marlboro had approximately 150 students.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate===

Freshmen were required to meet the &quot;Clear Writing Requirement&quot; by submitting an acceptable portfolio of at least 20 pages (4,000 words) of nonfiction writing to the English Committee.

With the guidance of professors, juniors and seniors developed and followed an individualized &quot;Plan of Concentration&quot;, often interdisciplinary, of which at least 20% was required to consist of an independent project prepared without direct faculty input; most students&#x27; plans culminated in a thesis. Students defended their work in an oral examination before one or more Marlboro faculty members and an outside evaluator unconnected to the college but with expertise in the student&#x27;s field of study.

Marlboro&#x27;s strengths included Asian studies, religion and theology, and life sciences.

In March 2014, Marlboro and five nearby colleges, Community College of Vermont, Landmark College, the School for International Training, Union Institute, and Vermont Technical College, formed the Windham Higher Education Cooperative, allowing students to take one course a semester at another participating institution.

===Graduate===
Marlboro College Graduate and Professional Studies began in 1998. Primarily aimed at working professionals and focused on technology, in 2010 it shifted to programs focused on socially responsible management and master&#x27;s studies in teaching (teaching with technology, teaching for social justice, and TESOL). later added an accelerated Master&#x27;s track open to undergraduates in some programs.

The graduate school was initially located in nearby Brattleboro. It moved to the main college campus in Marlboro in April 2017, and after that offered courses increasingly online and instituted a teach-out. Enrollment was suspended for 2019–20 and graduate programs were not transferred to Emerson under the merger agreement.

===Rankings and reputation===
In &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;″s 2014 annual college guide, Marlboro College received the highest possible academic rating of 99 and was ranked #1 nationally for the quality of its faculty. In 2017, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it #117 among liberal arts colleges in the United States.

In 2006 Loren Pope wrote in &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot; that &quot;the Marlboro adventure&quot; was &quot;far more intense and intellectually demanding than Harvard, any other Ivy, or Ivy clone&quot;.

==Student life and governance==
Marlboro was founded on an ethos of independence combined with community participation. Students, faculty, and staff made decisions together in weekly &quot;Town Meetings&quot;, and there was an elected community court. Students, faculty, and staff served on elected committees that played a role in hiring decisions and steering the curriculum. All campus buildings were open 24/7, and the library used a self-checkout honor system.

During spring and fall, students were encouraged to work regularly on the school farm. Campuswide Work Days took place each semester, with students, faculty, and staff working together on projects as needed, in the spirit of the first class, who built their own dormitories.

The administration published a magazine called &quot;Potash Hill&quot;. The student newspaper, &quot;The Citizen&quot;, and the &quot;Marlboro College Literary Magazine&quot; were edited by students elected at Town Meetings.

Open mic nights at the Campus Center happened several times a semester in addition to events including the Drag Ball, MayFest, and Apple Days, and other events. The night before writing portfolios were due, a &quot;Midnight Breakfast&quot; was held.

The college had few organized sports teams, but the &quot;Outdoor Program&quot; promoted rock climbing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, white-water kayaking, caving, canoeing, and hiking, and college was only 15 miles from the Mount Snow ski resort. A broomball tournament was held every February beginning in 1990.

==Campus==

The Marlboro College campus is located on South Road in the town of Marlboro, Vermont, in the Green Mountains. In the early years of the college, students and faculty worked together to adapt the buildings of three farms on the site, which became the main classroom building, the dining hall, and the admissions and administration buildings.

Through grants from federal, state and private entities, the college improved the energy efficiency of the Dining Hall, Dalrymple classroom building, Mather administration building, and Admissions building since 2008, as well as the student residences. In summer 2011, the half-circle driveway at the campus entrance was converted to green space and walking paths.

The Serkin Performing Arts Center has a 125-seat auditorium, an electronic music lab, practice rooms with baby grand pianos and a 5,000-square foot dance studio. Whittemore Theater, used primarily by the Theater department, was attached to Drury Gallery, which displayed student works.

The Snyder Center for the Visual Arts, housing studios, classrooms, and gallery spaces in 14,000 square feet, opened in May 2016.

In the summer, the campus is the location of the Marlboro Music Festival, founded in 1951. A new 99-year lease was signed in February 2019 and a residence hall and the Jerome and Celia Reich Building, containing a music library and chamber music rehearsal spaces, are scheduled for completion in 2021.

===Sale===
The former Marlboro campus was sold in May 2020 to Democracy Builders, founded by Seth Andrew, which intended to use it for a low-residency, low-cost college program for low-income students. The Degrees of Freedom program would last four years, from eleventh grade to the second year of college, and would result in an associate degree. The program was slated to be largely online, with students only being on campus two weeks out of each trimester.

In February 2021, Andrew announced that Democracy Builders had sold the campus to &quot;Type 1 Civilization Academy&quot; via a quitclaim deed. On March 9, 2021, During an invitation-only community meeting on Zoom, Andrew announced that the Type 1 deal had been cancelled. He called the agreement &quot;an engagement&quot; rather than &quot;a marriage&quot;. Andrew filed another quit claim deed which transferred the property back to Democracy Builders. The principal of Type 1, Adrian Stein, said that Type 1 was legitimately in control of the campus and that the issue will likely end up in court unless they can find &quot;some other kind of equitable settlement.&quot;

Opening of the Democracy Builders program was deferred in April 2021 after Andrew was charged with financial crimes.

In July 2021, the campus was purchased by the Marlboro Music Festival. The Marlboro Music Festival formed the subsidiary nonprofit organization, Potash Hill, Inc. to manage the property.

<text>John Christopher Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor and musician. He is the recipient of multiple accolades, including a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for three Academy Awards and two British Academy Film Awards. His films, in which he has often played eccentric characters, have grossed over $8 billion worldwide, making him one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable stars.

Depp began his career as a musician performing in several amateur rock bands before transitioning into film. He made his feature film debut in the horror film &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) and appeared in &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (1987–1990). In the 1990s, Depp portrayed lead roles in &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993), &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (1993), &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; (1993), &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995) and title characters &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; (1995) and &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (1997). He also portrayed Hunter S. Thompson in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998) and Dean Corso in Roman Polanski’s &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; (1999). In 1999, Depp received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry. In the early 2000s, he appeared in the romance &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), crime film &quot;Blow&quot; (2001), action film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; (2003), drama &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004), and horror films &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001) and &quot;Secret Window&quot; (2004).

Depp became known for his collaborations with director Tim Burton, including in &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990), &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005), &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2007), for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010). Depp gained worldwide stardom for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series, starting with &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003), and reprised the role in four sequels (2006–2017). For each performance in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, and &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, Depp was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.

His other well-received films include &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009), &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), &quot;Black Mass&quot; (2015), and &quot;Minamata&quot; (2020), among others. He portrayed Gellert Grindelwald in the Wizarding World films &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016) and &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; (2018). He has also lent his voice to numerous animated series in addition to the animated film &quot;Rango&quot; (2011). Outside acting, Depp has produced films through his company Infinitum Nihil, which he founded in 2004. He also formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry. He was named &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; Sexiest Man Alive twice, in 2003 and in 2009.

== Early life ==
Depp was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky, the youngest of four children of waitress Betty Sue Depp (née Wells; later Palmer) and civil engineer John Christopher Depp. Depp&#x27;s family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970. His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15, and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called &quot;an inspiration&quot;.

Depp&#x27;s mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands. He dropped out of Miramar High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The Kids.

After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band&#x27;s bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels. He co-wrote their song &quot;Mary&quot;, which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album &quot;Young Man&#x27;s Blues&quot;. Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.

Depp is of primarily English descent, with some French, German, Irish and African American ancestry. Elizabeth Key Grinstead, one of the first African Americans in the North American colonies to sue for her freedom and win, is an eighth great-grandmother. His surname comes from a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700. In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed to have Native American ancestry, &quot;I guess I have some Native American somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian.&quot;

Depp&#x27;s claims came under scrutiny when &quot;Indian Country Today&quot; wrote that Depp had never inquired about his heritage or been recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation. This led to criticism of Depp, from the Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native ancestry, and Native community leaders consider him &quot;a non-Indian&quot; and a pretendian. Depp&#x27;s choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was criticized, along with his choice to name his rock band &quot;Tonto&#x27;s Giant Nuts&quot;. During the promotion for &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, Depp was formally adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary member of her family but not a member of any tribe.

== Career ==
=== 1980s: Television and early film roles ===

Depp moved to Los Angeles with his band when he was 20. After the band split up, Depp&#x27;s then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage. After they became drinking buddies, Cage advised him to pursue acting. Depp had been interested in acting since reading a biography of James Dean and watching &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;. Cage helped Depp get an audition with Wes Craven for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;; Depp, who had no acting experience, said he &quot;ended up acting by accident&quot;. Thanks in part to his catching the eye of Craven&#x27;s daughter, Depp landed the role of the main character&#x27;s boyfriend, one of Freddy Krueger&#x27;s victims.

Although Depp said he &quot;didn&#x27;t have any desire to be an actor&quot;, he continued to be cast in films, making enough to cover some bills that his musical career left unpaid. After a starring role in the 1985 comedy &quot;Private Resort&quot;, Depp was cast in the lead role of the 1986 skating drama &quot;Thrashin&#x27;&quot; by the film&#x27;s director, but its producer overrode the decision. Instead, Depp appeared in a minor supporting role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1986 Vietnam War drama &quot;Platoon&quot;. He became a teen idol during the late 1980s, when he starred as an undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, which premiered in 1987. He accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series &quot;forced [him] into the role of product&quot;.

=== 1990s: Diversification ===
Disillusioned by his experiences as a teen idol in &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, Depp began taking roles he found more interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office. His first film release in 1990 was John Waters&#x27;s &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;, a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although not a box-office success upon its release, over the years it has gained cult classic status. Also in 1990, Depp played the title character in Tim Burton&#x27;s romantic fantasy film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; opposite Dianne Wiest and Winona Ryder. The film was a commercial and critical success with a domestic gross of $53 million. In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study how to create sympathy without dialogue. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Depp&#x27;s performance, writing that he &quot;artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it&#x27;s a terrific performance&quot;, while Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that he &quot;brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands&quot;. Depp earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the film. Owing to this role, a species of extinct arthropod with prominent claws was named after Depp as &quot;Kootenichela deppi&quot; (&quot;chela&quot; is Latin for claws or scissors).

Depp had no film releases in the next two years, except a brief cameo in &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; (1991), the sixth installment in the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise. He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy &quot;Benny and Joon&quot;, he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a sleeper hit. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Depp &quot;may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton&#x27;s mannerisms sweetly and magically to life&quot;. Depp received a second Golden Globe nomination for the performance. His second film of 1993 was Lasse Hallström&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;, a drama about a dysfunctional family co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliette Lewis. It did not perform well commercially, but received positive notices from critics. Although most of the reviews focused on DiCaprio, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization&quot;. Depp&#x27;s last 1993 release was Emir Kusturica&#x27;s surrealist comedy-drama &quot;Arizona Dream&quot;, which opened to positive reviews and won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.

In 1994, Depp reunited with Burton, playing the title role in &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, a biographical film about one of history&#x27;s most inept film directors. Depp later said that he was depressed about films and filmmaking at the time, but that &quot;within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed&quot;. He found that the role gave him a &quot;chance to stretch out and have some fun&quot; and that working with Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi, &quot;rejuvenated my love for acting&quot;. Although it did not earn back its production costs, &quot;Ed Wood&quot; received a positive reception from critics, with Maslin writing that Depp had &quot;proved himself as an established, certified great actor&quot; and &quot;captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud&quot;. Depp was nominated for a third time for a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe for his performance.

The next year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite Marlon Brando in the box-office hit &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot;, as a man who believes he is Don Juan, the world&#x27;s greatest lover. He starred in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&quot;, a Western shot entirely in black-and-white; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. And in the financial and critical failure &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, Depp played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp and Al Pacino starred in the crime drama &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, directed by Mike Newell. Depp played Joseph D. Pistone, an undercover FBI agent who assumes the name Donnie Brasco to infiltrate the Mafia in New York City. To prepare, Depp spent time with Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; was a commercial and critical success, and is considered one of Depp&#x27;s finest performances. Also in 1997, Depp debuted as a director and screenwriter with &quot;The Brave&quot;. He starred in it as a poor Native American man who accepts a proposal from a wealthy man, played by Marlon Brando, to appear in a snuff film in exchange for money for his family. It premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival to generally negative reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a turgid and unbelievable neo-western&quot;, and Time Out wrote that &quot;besides the implausibilities, the direction has two fatal flaws: it&#x27;s both tediously slow and hugely narcissistic as the camera focuses repeatedly on Depp&#x27;s bandana&#x27;d head and rippling torso&quot;. Due to the reviews, Depp did not release &quot;The Brave&quot; in the U.S.

Depp was a fan and friend of writer Hunter S. Thompson, and played his alter ego Raoul Duke in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998), Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film adaptation of Thompson&#x27;s pseudo-biographical novel of the same name. It was a box-office failure and polarized critics. Later that year, Depp made a brief cameo in Mika Kaurismäki&#x27;s &quot;L.A. Without a Map&quot; (1998).

Depp appeared in three films in 1999. The first was the sci-fi thriller &quot;The Astronaut&#x27;s Wife&quot;, co-starring Charlize Theron, which was not a commercial or critical success. The second, Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, starred Depp as a seller of old books who becomes entangled in a mystery. It was moderately more successful with audiences but received mixed reviews. The third was Burton&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, where Depp played Ichabod Crane opposite Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone, saying he &quot;always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl&quot;. &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; was a commercial and critical success.

=== 2000s: Worldwide recognition ===
Depp&#x27;s first film release of the new millennium was British-French drama &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot; (2000), directed by Sally Potter and starring him as a Roma horseman opposite Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett, and John Turturro. It was not a critical success. Depp also had a supporting role in Julian Schnabel&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (2000). His final film of 2000 was Hallström&#x27;s critically and commercially successful &quot;Chocolat,&quot; in which he played a Roma man and the love interest of the main character, Juliette Binoche. Depp&#x27;s next roles were both based on historical persons. In &quot;Blow&quot; (2001), he starred as cocaine smuggler George Jung, who was part of the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s. The film underperformed at the box office and received mixed reviews. In the comic book adaptation &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001), Depp portrayed inspector Frederick Abberline, who investigated the Jack the Ripper murders in the 1880s London. The film also received mixed reviews but was a moderate commercial success.

In 2003, Depp starred in the Walt Disney Pictures adventure film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, which was a major box office success. He earned widespread acclaim for his comic performance as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and won a Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild Award for Best Actor as well as an MTV Movie Award. Depp has said that Sparrow is &quot;definitely a big part of me&quot;, and that he modeled the character after The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards and cartoon skunk Pepé Le Pew. Studio executives had at first been ambivalent about Depp&#x27;s portrayal, but the character became popular with audiences. In his other film release in 2003, Robert Rodriguez&#x27; action film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, Depp played a corrupt CIA agent. A moderate box-office success, it received average to good reviews, with Depp&#x27;s performance in particular receiving praise.

Depp next starred as an author with writer&#x27;s block in the thriller &quot;Secret Window&quot; (2004), based on a short story by Stephen King. It was a moderate commercial success but received mixed reviews. Released around the same time, the British-Australian independent film &quot;The Libertine&quot; (2004) saw Depp portray the seventeenth-century poet and rake, the Earl of Rochester. It had only limited release, and received mainly negative reviews. Depp&#x27;s third film of 2004, &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, was more positively received by the critics, and earned him his second Academy Award nomination as well as Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG nominations for his performance as Scottish author J. M. Barrie. Depp also made a brief cameo appearance in the French film &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (2004), and founded his own film production company, Infinitum Nihil, under Warner Bros. Pictures.

Depp continued his box-office success with a starring role as Willy Wonka in Tim Burton&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005). It also had a positive critical reception, with Depp being nominated again for the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical. &quot;Chocolate Factory&quot; was followed by another Burton project, stop-motion animation &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005), in which Depp voiced the main character, Victor Van Dort. Depp reprised the role of Jack Sparrow in the &quot;Pirates&quot; sequels &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006) and &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), both of which were major box office successes. He also voiced the character in the video game &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow&quot;. According to a survey taken by Fandango, Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow was the main reason for many cinema-goers to see a &quot;Pirates&quot; film.

In 2007, Depp collaborated with Burton for their sixth film together, this time playing murderous barber Sweeney Todd in the musical &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2007). Depp cited Peter Lorre&#x27;s performance in &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1935), in which Lorre played a &quot;creepy but sympathetic&quot; surgeon, as his main influence for the role. &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; was the first film in which Depp had been required to sing. Instead of hiring a qualified vocal coach, he prepared for the role by recording demos with his old bandmate Bruce Witkin. The film was a commercial and critical success. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Chris Nashawaty stated that, &quot;Depp&#x27;s soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he&#x27;s been hiding ... Watching Depp&#x27;s barber wield his razors ... it&#x27;s hard not to be reminded of &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago ... and all of the twisted beauty we would&#x27;ve missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met.&quot; Depp won the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy Actor for the role, and was nominated for the third time for an Academy Award.
In 2009, Depp portrayed real-life gangster John Dillinger in Michael Mann&#x27;s 1930s crime film &quot;Public Enemies&quot;. It was commercially successful and gained moderately positive reviews. Roger Ebert stated in his review that, &quot;This Johnny Depp performance is something else. For once an actor playing a gangster does not seem to base his performance on movies he has seen. He starts cold. He plays Dillinger as a fact.&quot; Depp&#x27;s second film of 2009, &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot;, reunited him with director Terry Gilliam. Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell each played the character initially portrayed by their friend Heath Ledger, who had died before the film was completed. All three actors gave their salaries to Ledger&#x27;s daughter, Matilda.

=== 2010s: Career fluctuations ===
Depp began the 2010s with another collaboration with Tim Burton, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), in which he played the Mad Hatter opposite Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman. Despite mixed reviews, it earned US$1.025 billion in the box office, thus becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2010 and one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Depp&#x27;s second film release of 2010 was the romantic thriller &quot;The Tourist&quot;, in which he starred opposite Angelina Jolie. It was commercially successful, although panned by critics. Regardless, he received Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Golden Globe nominations for both films.

Depp&#x27;s first 2011 film release was the animated film &quot;Rango&quot;, in which he voiced the title character, a lizard. It was a major critical and commercial success. His second film of the year, the fourth installment in the &quot;Pirates&quot; series, &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;, was again a box office hit, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2011. Later in 2011, Depp released the first two projects co-produced by his company, Infinitum Nihil. The first was a film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Rum Diary&quot; by Hunter S. Thompson and starred Depp. It failed to bring back its production costs and received mixed reviews. The company&#x27;s second undertaking, Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011), garnered major critical acclaim and several awards nominations, but similarly did not perform well in the box office. In 2011, Depp also made a brief cameo in the Adam Sandler film &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;.

By 2012, Depp was one of the world&#x27;s biggest film stars, and was listed by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million. That year, he and his &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; co-stars Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series&#x27; feature film adaptation. Depp also starred in and co-produced his eighth film with Tim Burton, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012), alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Eva Green. The film was based on a 1960s Gothic television soap opera of the same name, which had been one of his favorites as a child. The film&#x27;s poor reception in the United States brought Depp&#x27;s star appeal into question.

After Infinitum Nihil&#x27;s agreement with WB expired in 2011, Depp signed a multi-year first-look deal with Walt Disney Studios. The first film made in the collaboration was &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013), in which Depp starred as Tonto. Depp&#x27;s casting as a Native American brought accusations of whitewashing, and the film was not well received by the public or the critics, causing Disney to take a US$190 million loss. Following a brief cameo in the independent film &quot;Lucky Them&quot; (2013), Depp starred as an AI-studying scientist in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Transcendence&quot; (2014), which was yet another commercial failure, and earned mainly negative reviews. His other roles in 2014 were a minor supporting part as The Wolf in the film adaptation of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, and a more substantial appearance as eccentric French-Canadian ex-detective in Kevin Smith&#x27;s horror-comedy &quot;Tusk&quot;, in which he was credited by the character&#x27;s name, Guy LaPointe.

In 2015, Depp appeared in two films produced by Infinitum Nihil. The first was comedy-thriller &quot;Mortdecai&quot;, in which he acted opposite Gwyneth Paltrow. The film was a critical and commercial failure and brought both stars Golden Raspberry nominations. The second film, &quot;Black Mass&quot; (2015), in which he played Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger, was better received. Critics from &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; called it one of Depp&#x27;s best performances to date, and the role earned Depp his third nomination for the Best Actor SAG award. However, the film failed to bring back its production costs. Depp also made a cameo appearance in the critically panned &quot;London Fields&quot;, starring his then-wife Amber Heard, which was to be released in 2015, but its general release was delayed by litigation until 2018. In addition to his work in films in 2015, French luxury fashion house Dior signed Depp as the face of their men&#x27;s fragrance, Sauvage, and he was inducted as a Disney Legend.

Depp&#x27;s first film release in 2016 was &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Tusk&quot; (2014), in which Depp appeared with his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp. Next, he played businessman and presidential candidate Donald Trump in a Funny or Die satire entitled &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s The Art of the Deal: The Movie&quot;, released during the run-up to the US presidential election. He earned praise for the role, with a headline from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; declaring, &quot;Who knew Donald Trump was the comeback role Johnny Depp needed?&quot;. It was also announced that Depp had been cast in a new franchise role as Dr. Jack Griffin/The Invisible Man in Universal Studios&#x27;s planned shared film universe entitled the Dark Universe, a rebooted version of their classic Universal Monsters franchise. One of the severed zombie heads featured in &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; season 6 episode &quot;Not Tomorrow Yet&quot; was based on Depp. Episode director Greg Nicotero said, &quot;I think we had sculpted an emaciated version of a dummy head for something and we used Johnny Depp&#x27;s head as a basis just for a clay sculpt.&quot; Depp reprised the role of the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; (2016), the sequel to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. In contrast to the first film&#x27;s success, the sequel lost Disney approximately US$70 million. It also gained Depp two Golden Raspberry nominations. Depp had also been secretly cast to play dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in a cameo appearance in &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016), the first installment of the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; franchise. His name was not mentioned in the promotional materials and his cameo was only revealed at the end of the film.

In 2017, Depp appeared alongside other actors and filmmakers in &quot;The Black Ghiandola&quot;, a short film made by a terminally ill teenager through the non-profit Make a Film Foundation. He also reprised his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth installment of the &quot;Pirates&quot; series, &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017). In the US, it did not perform as well as previous installments, and Depp was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards for worst actor and for worst screen combo with &quot;his worn-out drunk routine&quot;. However, the film had a good box office return internationally, especially in China, Japan and Russia. Depp&#x27;s last film release in 2017 was the Agatha Christie adaptation &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, in which he was part of an ensemble cast led by director-star Kenneth Branagh.

In 2018, Depp voiced the title character Sherlock Gnomes in the animated movie &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes&quot;. Although moderately commercially successful, it was critically panned and earned Depp two Golden Raspberry nominations, one for his acting and another for his &quot;fast-fading film career&quot;. Depp then starred in two independent films, both produced by him and his company, Infinitum Nihil. The first was &quot;City of Lies&quot;, in which he starred as Russell Poole, an LAPD detective who attempts to solve the murders of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. It was set for release in September 2018, but was pulled from the release schedule after a crew member sued Depp for assault. The second film was the comedy-drama &quot;Richard Says Goodbye&quot;, in which Depp played a professor with terminal cancer. It premiered at the Zurich Film Festival in October 2018. Depp&#x27;s last film release of 2018 was &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot;, in which he reprised his role as Grindelwald. Depp&#x27;s casting received criticism from fans of the series due to the domestic violence allegations against him.

Depp also experienced other career setbacks around this time, as Disney confirmed that they would not be casting him in new &quot;Pirates&quot; installments and he was reported to no longer be attached to Universal&#x27;s Dark Universe franchise. Depp&#x27;s next films was the independent drama &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; (2019), which premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival and is based on a novel by J. M. Coetzee.

=== 2020s: Personal struggles and resurgence ===
In &quot;Minamata&quot; (2020), Depp portrayed photographer W. Eugene Smith. The film premiered at the 2020 Berlin International Film Festival. In November 2020, Depp resigned from his role as Grindelwald in the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; franchise at the request of its production company, Warner Bros., after he lost his UK libel case against &quot;The Sun&quot;, which had accused him of being a domestic abuser. He was replaced by Mads Mikkelsen.

In March 2021, &quot;City of Lies&quot;, which was originally scheduled for 2018, was released in theaters and streaming services. The same month, an online petition to bring Depp back to the &quot;Pirates&quot; franchise, begun four months earlier, reached its goal of 500,000 signatures. His &quot;Pirates&quot; co-star Kevin McNally also expressed support for Depp returning to the role. In July 2021, Andrew Levitas, the director of &quot;Minamata&quot; (2020), accused MGM of trying to bury the film due to Depp&#x27;s involvement, with Depp claiming he is being boycotted by the Hollywood industry and calling his changed reputation an &quot;absurdity of media mathematics&quot;. &quot;Minamata&quot; was released in the UK and Ireland in August 2021, and in North America in December 2021. The film received positive reviews, with multiple publications praising Depp&#x27;s performance as his best in years. Depp also continues as the face of Dior&#x27;s men&#x27;s fragrance, Sauvage.

Depp received multiple honorary awards at numerous European film festivals, including at the Camerimage festival in Poland, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic, and the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain, where Depp was awarded the Donostia Award. These awards were controversial, with various domestic violence charities criticizing the festivals. The organizers of the ceremonies released statements defending their decision to award Depp, with the San Sebastian Film Festival stating that &quot;he has not been charged by any authority in any jurisdiction, nor convicted of any form of violence against women&quot;.

In September 2021, Depp described himself as a victim of cancel culture. The same month, he launched IN.2, a London-based sister company to his production company, Infinitum Nihil, and announced that IN.2 and the Spanish production company &quot;A Contracorriente Films&quot; were starting a new development fund for TV and film projects. On February 15, 2022, Depp received the Serbian Gold Medal of Merit from President Aleksandar Vučić for &quot;outstanding merits in public and cultural activities, especially in the field of film art and the promotion of the Republic of Serbia in the world&quot;. &quot;Minamata&quot; and animated series &quot;Puffins&quot; were shot in the country.

On May 29, 2022, Depp, who was still awaiting a verdict in his highly publicized defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, made a surprise appearance at a Jeff Beck gig in Sheffield, playing guitar alongside Beck to three classic songs from John Lennon, Marvin Gaye and Jimi Hendrix. Depp joined Beck on his last concert tour in the UK and Europe during June and July and in the United States in October and November, to promote their album &quot;18&quot;. In August 2022, he made a cameo appearance at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards.

Depp next starred as King Louis XV in French actor-director Maïwenn&#x27;s period film &quot;Jeanne Du Barry&quot; (2023). This was the first film for Depp where he acted in French. The film premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival as the opening film, where it was greeted with a 7-minute standing ovation and received a mixed reception from film critics. Many critics deemed it Depp&#x27;s comeback role, something he did not agree with.

&quot;Modì, Three Days on the Wing of Madness&quot; (2024), was Depp&#x27;s first directorial effort in over 25 years. The film is about 72 hours in the life of Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, and Depp co-produced it through his European company IN.2 Film, alongside Al Pacino. It stars Riccardo Scamarcio, Stephen Graham, Al Pacino and Antonia Desplat, and it is based on a play by Dennis McIntyre. Principal photography commenced in September 2023 in Budapest, Hungary and was completed in Los Angeles and Turin in early 2024. The film premiered at the 72nd San Sebastián International Film Festival on September 24, 2024, where it was received warmly by the audience with a lengthy standing ovation.

In June 2024, he was cast as Satan in the upcoming comedy film &quot;&quot;.

== Other ventures ==
In 2004, Depp founded film production company Infinitum Nihil to develop projects where he will serve as actor or producer. He serves as its CEO, while his sister, Christi Dembrowski, serves as president. The company&#x27;s first two film releases were &quot;The Rum Diary&quot; (2011) and &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011). A European sister-company to Infinitum Nihil, entitled IN.2, was launched in September 2021. In a press release, Depp stated: &quot;From the student to the maestro, from the aspiring artists to the yet-knowns, to the well-established great masters across all forms of modern media, IN.2 will build a space where artists can be artists, where they will be free to create those unexpected moments, those happy accidents that contain the propensity to constitute great art and so bring their unique vision to life.&quot;

Depp co-owned the nightclub The Viper Room in Los Angeles from 1993 to 2003, and he was also part owner of the restaurant-bar Man Ray in Paris for a short period of time. Depp and Douglas Brinkley edited folk singer Woody Guthrie&#x27;s novel &quot;House of Earth&quot;, which was published in 2013.

=== Music ===
Prior to his acting career, Depp was a guitarist, and has later featured on songs by Oasis, Shane MacGowan, Iggy Pop, Vanessa Paradis, Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, and The New Basement Tapes, among others. He also performed with Manson at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards in 2012. Depp played guitar on the soundtrack of his films &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, and has appeared in music videos for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Lemonheads, Avril Lavigne and Paul McCartney. In the 1990s, he was also a member of P, a musical group featuring Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones.

In 2014, Depp joined Aerosmith on stage at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield.

In 2015, Depp formed the supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry; the band also includes Bruce Witkin, his friend from his 1980s band, The Kids. Hollywood Vampires released their self-titled debut studio album in September 2015. It featured eleven classic rock covers, as well as three original songs (all co-written by Depp). The band made their live debut at The Roxy in Los Angeles in September 2015, and has since done three world tours in 2016, 2018 and 2023. Their second studio album, &quot;Rise&quot;, was released in June 2019 and consists mostly of original material, including songs written by Depp. The album also features a cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;, sung by Depp.

In 2020, Depp released a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Isolation&quot; with guitarist Jeff Beck, and stated that they would be releasing more music together in the future. Beginning in May 2022, Depp joined Beck onstage for a number of concerts in the United Kingdom, where Beck announced they had recorded an album together. Their joint record, titled &quot;18&quot;, was released on July 15, 2022. Depp also accompanied Beck on his last European and American tours, which began in June and ended in November. In May 2023, Depp performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, sharing the stage with Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and Kirk Hammett among others.

On July 17, 2024, Depp was a special guest at one of the three Andrea Bocelli 30th anniversary concerts. Together, Depp and Bocelli performed the song &quot;En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor&quot; in honor of Jeff Beck. Depp played the guitar, while Bocelli sang. Other guests included Will Smith, Ed Sheeran, Russell Crowe, Brian May, Jon Batiste and Laura Pausini.

=== Art ===
In July 2022, artwork made by Depp sold out less than a day since it debuted in the art retailer Castle Fine Art in London&#x27;s Covent Garden. The art house hosted his &quot;Friends &amp; Heroes&quot; collection, which was described as paintings of people &quot;who have inspired him as a person&quot;. Among the art pieces, the names include actors Al Pacino and Elizabeth Taylor and musicians Bob Dylan and Keith Richards. Depp made for nearly $4 million and sold 780 prints through the art house&#x27;s 37 galleries. Ahead of the sale, Depp expressed his desire to display his art publicly and stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve always used art to express my feelings and to reflect on those who matter most to me, like my family, friends and people I admire.&quot; He added, &quot;My paintings surround my life, but I kept them to myself and limited myself. No one should ever limit themselves.&quot; All 780 pieces sold within hours, with framed individual images going for £3,950 and the complete portfolio of four images selling for £14,950. &quot;This world-first release proved to be our fastest-selling collection to date, with all titles selling out in just hours&quot;, the gallery announced on Instagram. Speaking on behalf of fine art publishers, Washington Green Glyn Washington described Depp as a &quot;true creative, with an extraordinary eye for detail and nuance&quot;.

A second installment in the &quot;Friends &amp; Heroes&quot; collection, this time entitled &quot;Friends &amp; Heroes II&quot; was released in March 2023. Prints of public figures Heath Ledger, Bob Marley, River Phoenix and Hunter S. Thompson were made available for sale, as a four-piece, and signed by Depp, or sold individually. In July 2023, Depp unveiled an auto portrait, entitled &quot;Five&quot; which he had painted in 2021. The meaning of the number five is, according to Depp, linked the fact that he was about to enter the fifth year of a dark phase in his life. Depp spoke about the difficulty in creating a self-portrait, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing doing a self-portrait. Although, in a weird way, almost everything you do is a self-portrait in one way or another.&quot; The collections were once again hosted by Castle Fine Art gallery.

Depp opened his first art exhibition &quot;A Bunch of Stuff&quot; on October 4, 2024, at the Starrett–Lehigh Building in New York City. The exhibition features artworks created by Depp over many decades, with some dating back to his 20s. On September 30, 2024, a special preview event took place, with Depp and some of his friends and family members present, including Jim Jarmusch, Jerry Bruckheimer and Justin Bartha.

== Image and reception ==
In the 1990s, Depp was seen as a new type of male film star that rejected the norms of that role. After becoming a teen idol in &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, he publicly protested against the image, and with his subsequent film and public relations choices began to cultivate a new public persona. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; characterized Depp in the 1990s as the &quot;bad boy of Hollywood&quot;; Depp&#x27;s chain smoking, recreational drug use and drinking habits were generally documented during this time. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Hadley Freeman in 2020:
Similarly, film scholar Anna Everett has described Depp&#x27;s 1990s films and public persona as &quot;anti-macho&quot; and &quot;gender-bending&quot;, going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man. After &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, Depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. Critics often described Depp&#x27;s characters as &quot;iconic loners&quot; or &quot;gentle outsiders&quot;. According to Depp, his onetime agent, Tracey Jacobs of United Talent Agency (UTA), had to take &quot;a lot of heat over the years&quot; for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at UTA as thinking, &quot;Jesus Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody? When does he get to be a man for a change? When is he finally going to do a blockbuster?&quot;. According to Everett, his &quot;rule-breaking&quot; roles matched with the &quot;much publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to Depp&#x27;s own personal life throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others, we clearly see a perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters&quot;.

After a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success, Depp became one of the biggest box-office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Walt Disney Studios&#x27; &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise. The five films in the series have earned US$4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the &quot;Pirates&quot; franchise, Depp also made four further films with Tim Burton that were major successes, with one, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), becoming the biggest commercial hit of Depp&#x27;s career and one of the highest-grossing films in history (as of 2021). In 2012, Depp was one of the world&#x27;s biggest film stars, and was listed by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million in a year.

According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, Depp&#x27;s collaboration with Disney &quot;can be seen to purport and herald a new era for Johnny Depp, one in which he is, finally, as though long-promised and long-expected, the proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star but a middle-class hero&quot;. In 2003, the same year as the first film in the &quot;Pirates&quot; series was released, Depp was named &quot;World&#x27;s Sexiest Man&quot; by &quot;People&quot;; he would receive the title again in 2009. During the decade and into the 2010s, Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film stars in the world and was named by public vote as &quot;Favorite Male Movie Star&quot; at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012, Depp became the highest-paid actor in the American film industry, earning as high as $75 million per film, and as of 2020, is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, with his films having grossed over US$3.7 billion at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide. Although a mainstream favorite with the audiences, critics&#x27; views on Depp changed in the 2000s, becoming more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal. Regardless, Depp continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s, when he starred as John Dillinger in &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009).

In the 2010s, Depp&#x27;s films were less successful, with many big-budget studio films such as &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012), &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013), and &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; (2016) underperforming at the box office. Depp also received negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, poor on-set behavior and the loss of his US$650 million fortune. After losing a highly publicized libel trial against the publishers of &quot;The Sun&quot;, Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; franchise. Many publications alleged that Depp would struggle to find further work in major studio productions in the future.

== Personal life ==
Depp owns a property in West Hollywood and currently lives in London. By February 2023, he had not yet bought a property there, instead choosing to either stay at hotels or at friends&#x27; houses.

=== Relationships ===
Depp married Lori Anne Allison on December 24, 1983, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, when he was 20 and she was 25. She was the sister of his rock band&#x27;s bassist. The couple moved to Los Angeles County, California to pursue careers in music; Depp found some success with his group &quot;The Kids&quot;, opening for the Ramones and Iggy Pop, but Allison&#x27;s career as a record producer was halted after she became deaf in one ear, prompting her to pursue a career as a makeup artist for film and television. Through her connections, Allison was able to introduce Depp to Nicolas Cage. Cage was impressed by Depp and arranged for him to audition for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, which became his first film credit. After two years of marriage, their divorce finalized on March 7, 1986. Depp and Allison remained friendly over the years, with her still using Depp as her professional surname and voicing sympathy for him during his defamation trial against his second wife Amber Heard.

In the late 1980s, he was engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn. In 1990, he proposed to his &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; Winona Ryder, whom he had begun dating the year prior when she was 17 and he was 26. They ended their relationship in 1993; Depp later had the &quot;Winona Forever&quot; tattoo on his right arm changed to &quot;Wino Forever&quot;. Between 1994 and 1998, he was in a relationship with English model Kate Moss. Following his breakup with Moss, Depp began a relationship with French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis, whom he met while filming &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; in France in 1998. They have two children, daughter Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 1999) and a son, Jack (born 2002). Depp stated that having children has given him a &quot;real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything ...You cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children. Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful ride I was on. It was destiny. All the math finally worked.&quot; In June 2012, Depp and Paradis announced their separation.

Following the end of his relationship with Vanessa Paradis, Depp began dating actress Amber Heard, with whom he had co-starred in &quot;The Rum Diary&quot; (2011). Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony on February 3, 2015. Heard filed for divorce on May 23, 2016, and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, alleging in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Depp denied these claims and alleged that she was &quot;attempting to secure a premature financial resolution&quot;. A settlement was reached in August 2016, and the divorce was finalized in January 2017. Heard dismissed the restraining order, and they issued a joint statement saying that their &quot;relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm&quot;. Depp paid Heard a divorce settlement of US$7 million, which she pledged to donate to the ACLU and the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).

=== Legal issues and allegations ===
==== Heard related litigations ====
 &quot;Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd&quot; 
In 2018, Depp brought a libel lawsuit in the UK against News Group Newspapers (NGN), publishers of &quot;The Sun&quot;, over an April 2018 article titled &quot;GONE POTTY How Can J K Rowling be &quot;genuinely happy&quot; casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?&quot;. The case had a highly publicized trial in July 2020, with both Depp and Heard testifying for several days. Depp&#x27;s lawyer, David Sherborne, said that Heard had &quot;blatantly lied&quot; in her evidence while NGN&#x27;s lawyer, Sasha Wass, said that &quot;all the evidence in [the] case and all the supporting evidence of the incidents of violence&quot; leave &quot;no doubt that Mr. Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife&quot;.

In November 2020, the High Court of Justice ruled that 12 of the 14 incidents of physical violence alleged by NGN occurred and that in three of them, Depp had put Heard &quot;in fear of her life&quot;. The court rejected Depp&#x27;s claim of a hoax as well as his characterization of Heard as a &quot;gold-digger&quot;. On the other hand, the court found that the characterization of Depp as a &quot;wife beater&quot; by &quot;The Sun&quot; was &quot;substantially true&quot;. Following the verdict, Depp resigned from the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; franchise after being asked to do so by its production company, Warner Bros.

Depp appealed the verdict, with his lawyers accusing Heard of not following through on a pledge to donate her divorce settlement to charity, contrary to her testimony. Depp&#x27;s lawyers also asserted that Heard&#x27;s donation testimony had significantly influenced the judge&#x27;s view of Heard. In response, Heard&#x27;s legal team stated that she had not yet finished paying her pledged donation due to the financial burden of the lawsuits against her by Depp and that Depp was using this to &quot;divert attention from the UK Court&#x27;s findings relating to allegations of Mr. Depp committing domestic abuse and violence&quot;. Depp&#x27;s appeal to overturn the verdict was rejected by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in March 2021, with the Court concluding:

 &quot;Depp v. Heard&quot; 
In February 2019, Depp sued Heard for defamation over a December 2018 op-ed for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The lawsuit ultimately resulted in Depp alleging that the op-ed contained three defamatory statements: first, its headline, &quot;Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture&#x27;s wrath. That has to change&quot;; second, Heard&#x27;s writing: &quot;Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture&#x27;s wrath for women who speak out&quot;; and third, Heard&#x27;s writing: &quot;I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.&quot; Depp alleged that he had been the one who was abused by Heard, that her allegations constituted a hoax against him, and that as a consequence, Disney had declined to cast him in future projects.

Heard countersued Depp in August 2020, alleging that he had coordinated &quot;a harassment campaign via Twitter and [by] orchestrating online petitions in an effort to get her fired from &quot;Aquaman&quot; and L&#x27;Oreal&quot;. Ultimately, Heard&#x27;s counter-suit went to trial over three allegations that Depp had defamed her through statements made by his then-lawyer, Adam Waldman, published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in April 2020: first, Waldman stated that &quot;Heard and her friends in the media used fake sexual violence allegations as both sword and shield&quot;, publicizing a &quot;sexual violence hoax&quot; against Depp; second, Waldman stated that in one incident at a penthouse, &quot;Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911&quot; as a &quot;hoax&quot; against Depp; third, Waldman stated that there had been an &quot;abuse hoax&quot; by Heard against Depp.

In October 2020, the judge in the case dismissed Depp&#x27;s lawyer Adam Waldman after he leaked confidential information covered by a protective order to the media. Following the verdict in Depp&#x27;s lawsuit against &quot;The Sun&quot; the next month, Heard&#x27;s lawyers filed to have the defamation suit dismissed, but Judge Penny Azcarate ruled against it because Heard had not been a party in the UK case. In August 2021, a New York judge ruled that the ACLU must disclose documents related to Heard&#x27;s charity pledge to the organization.

The Depp v. Heard trial took place in Fairfax County, Virginia from April 11 to June 1, 2022. During the trial, Heard accused Depp of domestic abuse, stating that Depp &quot;plunged into the depths of paranoia and violence after binging on drugs and alcohol&quot; during their relationship. On the other hand, Depp accused Heard of several instances of physical and verbal abuse during their relationship.

On June 1, 2022, the jury returned a verdict after 13 hours of deliberation. In their verdict, the jury found that all three statements from Heard&#x27;s op-ed were false, defamed Depp, and were made with actual malice. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, although the punitive damages were reduced to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by an existing Virginia state law. For Heard&#x27;s counter-suit, the jury found that Waldman&#x27;s first and third statements to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; were not defamatory, while finding that Waldman&#x27;s second statement to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was false, defamatory, and made with actual malice. As a result, Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and zero in punitive damages from Depp.

Depp reacted to the result of the trial by declaring that the &quot;jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled.&quot; Depp also stated that he was &quot;overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world&quot;. He continued: &quot;I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my situation, and that those supporting them never give up.&quot; Depp also highlighted &quot;the noble work of the Judge, the jurors, the court staff and the Sheriffs who have sacrificed their own time to get to this point&quot;, and praised his &quot;diligent and unwavering legal team&quot; for &quot;an extraordinary job&quot;.

After they filed to appeal the verdict, Heard and Depp settled the case in December 2022, with Heard maintaining that the settlement was &quot;not an act of concession&quot;; meanwhile Depp&#x27;s lawyers stated that the &quot;jury&#x27;s unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp&#x27;s favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place&quot;, and that the settlement would result in $1 million being paid to Depp, which &quot;Depp is pledging and will donate to charities&quot;.

==== Other legal issues and allegations ====
Depp was arrested in Vancouver in 1989 for assaulting a security guard after the police were called to end a loud party at his hotel room. When later asked about the incident in 1991, Depp stated: &quot;The guy had a boner for me... He had a wild hair up his ass, and he got real mouthy with me, saying, &#x27;I know who you are, but you can&#x27;t come up unless you&#x27;re a guest here.&#x27; The mistake he eventually made was to put his hands on me. I pushed him back, and then we sort of wrestled around a bit, and I ended up spittin&#x27; in his face.&quot;

Depp was also arrested in New York City in 1994 after causing significant damage to his room at The Mark Hotel, where he was staying with Kate Moss, his girlfriend. The charges were dropped against him after he agreed to pay US$9,767 in damages.

Depp was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazi, when the photographers tried to take his picture. He allegedly threatened them with a wooden plank when they approached him outside Mirabelle restaurant in central London on an early Sunday morning.

In 2012, UC Irvine medical professor Robin Eckert sued Depp and three security firms, Premier Group International, Damian Executive Production Inc. and Staff Pro Inc., claiming to have been roughed up by his bodyguards at a concert in Los Angeles in 2011. During the incident, she was allegedly hand-cuffed and dragged 40 feet across the floor, resulting in injuries including a dislocated elbow. Depp&#x27;s attorneys contended that Eckert provoked the alleged assault and therefore &quot;consented to any assault and battery&quot;. Eckert&#x27;s court papers stated that Depp, despite being his security guards&#x27; direct manager, did nothing to stop the attack. Before the case went to trial, Depp settled with Eckert for an undisclosed sum, according to TMZ.

In April 2015, Depp and his then-wife Amber Heard breached Australia&#x27;s biosecurity laws when they failed to declare their two dogs to the customs when they flew to Queensland, where he was working on a film. Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation. She was placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond for producing a false document; Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the case the &quot;highest profile criminal quarantine case&quot; in Australian history.

In March 2016, Depp cut ties with his management company, The Management Group (TMG), and sued them in January 2017 for alleged embezzlement and for allegedly improperly managing his money and leaving him over $40 million in debt. TMG stated that Depp was responsible for his own fiscal mismanagement and countersued him for unpaid fees. In a related suit, Depp also sued his lawyers, Bloom Hergott, in January 2017. Both lawsuits were settled, the former in 2018 and the latter in 2019.

In 2018, two of Depp&#x27;s former bodyguards sued him for unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions. Among other complaints, the two bodyguards claimed in their suit that they were required to perform tasks that were beyond the scope of their capacity as bodyguards, including being asked to repeatedly drive vehicles that &quot;contained illegal substances, open containers and minors&quot;. Despite this and despite being exposed to other unsafe working conditions while putting in 12-hour work shifts on the job without rest or meal breaks, the bodyguards added, they were neither paid overtime nor otherwise fairly or lawfully compensated. The suit was settled in 2019.

Also in 2018, Depp was sued for allegedly hitting and verbally insulting a crew member while under the influence of alcohol on the set of &quot;City of Lies&quot;. A lawyer for Depp told the media that &quot;Depp never touched the [crew member], as over a dozen witnesses present will attest&quot;; meanwhile, Depp&#x27;s legal team entered a court filing that did not admit that Depp hit the crew member, but stated that the crew member &quot;provoked&quot; the incident with &quot;unlawful and wrongful conduct&quot;, causing Depp and film director Brad Furman to fear for their safety. A film script supervisor submitted a court declaration that Depp did not hit the crew member, and only scolded him. Before the lawsuit went to trial, a tentative settlement regarding the dismissal of the lawsuit was reached between Depp and the crew member in July 2022.

In August 2022, Depp and Jeff Beck were accused of stealing an incarcerated African American man&#x27;s poem by incorporating its verses into the lyrics to their song &quot;Sad Motherfuckin&#x27; Parade&quot; in their 2022 collaborative album, &quot;18&quot;. Bruce Jackson, the folklorist who made the accusation, requested that Depp and Beck give due credit to Slim Wilson, the actual originator of the lyrics, for the song. He also requested that if any profits are made from the album, the two should donate them to an organization that aids African Americans. In response, Depp and Beck sued Jackson, claiming that &quot;Sad Motherfuckin&#x27; Parade&quot; is an &quot;original work of authorship and creativity&quot; and that Jackson&#x27;s accusation amounts to a cash grab. Jackson responded by noting that he had never made any &quot;formal financial demands&quot; and, while maintaining that Depp and Beck never wrote the lyrics to that song, said that them suing the person who caught them stealing the lyrics is akin to &quot;a burglar suing a homeowner because he cut his hand on the kitchen window he broke getting in&quot;. This lawsuit is still ongoing.

In January 2024, actress Lola Glaudini, on an episode of the podcast &quot;Powerful Truth Angels&quot;, recounted an incident of verbal abuse from Depp during the shooting of the movie &quot;Blow&quot; (2001). According to Glaudini, she had been told by the film&#x27;s director, Ted Demme, to &quot;burst out laughing&quot; on cue to a line from Depp during the filming of a scene for the movie. In one take, after several others of her following this direction, Glaudini continued:

While noting that this was her first day of her first studio film ever and that she had been excited to work with Depp, whom she then idolized, Glaudini said that the incident left her almost in tears. She further added that Depp later offered her a &quot;non-apology apology&quot; by blaming the incident on the &quot;Boston accent&quot; that he was doing for the film. In response to Glaudini&#x27;s accusation, Depp, through a representative, said that he values good relationships with his coworkers. In addition, Sam Sarkar—a sound technician on &quot;Blow&quot; who has worked on several of Depp&#x27;s films including &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Choclat&quot;, &quot;Mortdecai&quot;, and &quot;Minamata&quot;—said that, during the filming of &quot;Blow&quot;, he never heard anything like what Glaudini recounted.

=== Alcohol and drug use ===
Depp has struggled with substance abuse for much of his life. He has stated that he began using drugs by taking his mother&#x27;s &quot;nerve pills&quot; at the age of 11, was smoking at age 12 and by the age of 14 had used &quot;every kind of drugs there were&quot;. In a 1997 interview, Depp acknowledged past abuse of alcohol during the filming of &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape?&quot; (1993). In a 2008 interview, Depp stated that he had &quot;poisoned&quot; himself with alcohol &quot;for years&quot;. In 2013, Depp declared that he had stopped drinking alcohol, adding that he &quot;pretty much got everything [he] could get out of it&quot;; Depp also said, &quot;I investigated wine and spirits thoroughly, and they certainly investigated me as well, and we found out that we got along beautifully, but maybe too well.&quot; Regarding his breakup with longtime partner Vanessa Paradis, Depp said that he &quot;definitely wasn&#x27;t going to rely on the drink to ease things or cushion the blow or cushion the situation ...[because] that could have been fatal&quot;. In a 2018 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; profile of Depp, reporter Stephen Rodrick wrote that he had used hashish in his presence and described him as &quot;alternately hilarious, sly and incoherent&quot;; Depp also said that the allegation made by his former business managers that he had spent US$30,000 per month on wine was &quot;insulting&quot; because he had spent &quot;far more&quot; than that amount. During his 2020 libel trial, Depp admitted to having been addicted to Roxicodone and to having misused alcohol. He also admitted to using other substances such as marijuana, MDMA and cocaine but denied ever having been addicted to any of them.

=== Political views ===
In November 2016, Depp joined the campaign Imprisoned for Art to call for the release of Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was being held in custody in Russia.

At the Glastonbury Festival 2017, Depp, criticizing President Donald Trump, asked: &quot;When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify: I&#x27;m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it&#x27;s been a while and maybe it&#x27;s time. I&#x27;m not insinuating anything.&quot; The comment was interpreted as a reference to John Wilkes Booth, the actor who assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Shawn Holtzclaw of the Secret Service told CNN they were aware of Depp&#x27;s comment, but that &quot;for security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities&quot;. Depp apologized shortly afterward, saying the remark &quot;did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice&quot;.

<text>Roch Carrier (born 13 May 1937) is a French Canadian novelist and author of &quot;contes&quot; (a very brief form of the short story). He is among the best known Quebec writers in English Canada.

==Life==

He was born in Sainte-Justine, Quebec, and studied at Collège St-Louis in New Brunswick, the Université de Montréal in Quebec, and at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France, where he received a doctorate in literature.

From 1994 to 1997, he served as head of the Canada Council. In 1998, he ran as an electoral candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party under Jean Charest, in the riding of Crémazie. He was defeated by 309 votes.

In 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. From 1999 to 2004, Carrier was National Librarian of Canada. With Ian E. Wilson, the then National Archivist, he developed the process to unify the National Archive and National Library.

In 1992, Carrier&#x27;s &quot;Prayers of a Very Wise Child&quot; (&quot;Prières d&#x27;un enfant très très sage&quot;) won the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.

Carrier championed Jacques Poulin&#x27;s novel &quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot; in &quot;Canada Reads 2005&quot;.

Also involved in theatre (having served as playwright at the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde), Carrier has adapted &quot;La guerre, yes sir!&quot; and &quot;Floralie, où es-tu?&quot; for the stage. &quot;La guerre, yes sir!&quot; was produced as a play in 1970, was performed in English at the Stratford festival, and has been made into a film. &quot;Floralie, où es-tu?&quot; was performed by Théâtre du Nouveau-Monde in 1974. The trilogy consisting of these two novels and &quot;Il est par là, le soleil&quot; sold better in English than in French.

A quote from &quot;Le chandail de hockey&quot; (&quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;), one of Carrier&#x27;s &quot;contes&quot;, was reprinted on the back of the Canadian five-dollar bill. The story, about when Carrier was a young boy who orders a Montreal Canadiens sweater from the Eaton&#x27;s catalogue, but receives a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey instead, is considered by many to be a literary allegory for the linguistic and cultural tensions between English and French Canadians, and is thus considered essential reading for anybody who seeks to understand the complex realities of linguistic and cultural identity in Canada. But it is also a much-beloved children&#x27;s story in anglophone Canada without such complex overtones as it may have in a broader context. The National Film Board of Canada has made this story into an animated short film, narrated by Carrier in both the French and English versions.

&quot;Heartbreaks Along The Road&quot; (&quot;De l&#x27;amour dans la ferraille&quot;) is a work of magical realism - he pokes fun at political and religious figures, using ridiculous scenarios, and exaggerated personality characteristics, while telling the story from different characters&#x27; points of view. There are many levels to his satire and his writing is flowery and descriptive.

Sheila Fischman has won various awards for translation of his books into English.

Two schools are named after Roch Carrier: Roch Carrier French Immersion Public School in Woodstock, Ontario, and Roch Carrier Elementary School in Kanata, Ontario.

Roch Carrier was president on the board of directors for Experiences Canada (formerly known as the Society for Educational Visits and Exchanges in Canada, or SEVEC) from 2008 to 2009. Upon his retirement from the board he was made an Honorary Member.

<text>FIPS state codes were numeric and two-letter alphabetic codes defined in U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (&quot;FIPS PUB&quot;) 5-2 to identify U.S. states and certain other associated areas. The standard superseded FIPS PUB 5-1 on May 28, 1987, and was superseded on September 2, 2008, by ANSI standard INCITS 38:2009.

The codes are used in Geographic Names Information System, overseen by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The codes were assigned by NIST and each uniquely identified a state, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the U.S. These codes were used by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Department of Agriculture to form milk-processing plant numbers, some cash registers during check approval, and in the Emergency Alert System (EAS).

The FCC assigned additional numeric codes used with the EAS for territorial waters of the U.S., but these were not part of the FIPS standard.

The FIPS state alpha code for each U.S. states and the District of Columbia are identical to the postal abbreviations by the United States Postal Service. From September 3, 1987, the same was true of the alpha code for each of the outlying areas, with the exception of U.S. Minor Outlying Islands (UM) as the USPS routes mail for these islands indirectly.

Each of the various minor outlying islands that fell within alpha code UM had an individual numeric code, but no individual alpha code.

On September 2, 2008, FIPS 5-2 was one of ten standards withdrawn by NIST as a Federal Information Processing Standard.

== FIPS state codes ==

The following table enumerates the FIPS state alpha and numeric codes for the states, the District of Columbia, the outlying areas of the United States, the freely associated states, and trust territory, and FIPS state numeric codes for the individual minor outlying island territories.

Only actual U.S. states and the District of Columbia had FIPS state numeric codes in the range 01 through 56.

FIPS PUB 5-1 (published on June 15, 1970, and superseded by FIPS PUB 5-2 on May 28, 1987) stated that certain numeric codes &quot;are reserved for possible future use in identifying American Samoa (03), Canal Zone (07), Guam (14), Puerto Rico (43), and Virgin Islands (52)&quot;, but these codes were omitted from FIPS PUB 5-2 without comment. These areas are marked with a * and highlighted in red in the table below.

For states, the &quot;Status&quot; column in the table below includes a link to a list of the counties (boroughs and census areas in Alaska; parishes in Louisiana) for that state including the county codes as defined in FIPS PUB 6-4. The listings of counties for other areas are set out at the end of this article.

== County codes ==

== Supplemental codes for maritime areas ==

The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the weather radio service provided by NOAA use these codes to supplement FIPS PUB 5-2 to include certain maritime areas.

<text>The Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 6-4 (FIPS 6-4) is a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code which uniquely identified counties and county equivalents in the United States, certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states.

On September 2, 2008, the US Department of Commerce, following three years of review and comments from &quot;public, research communities, manufacturers, voluntary standards organizations, and Federal, State, and local government organizations&quot;, announced that FIPS 6-4 was one of ten FIPS standards withdrawn by the department&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Deemed &quot;obsolete, or have not been updated to adopt current voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, federal data standards, or current good practices for information security&quot;, the NIST replaced FIPS 6-4 with &quot;INCITS 31 – 2009&quot; codes for the &quot;Identification of the States and Equivalent Areas within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Insular Areas&quot;.

The five-digit codes of FIPS 6-4 used the two digit FIPS state code (FIPS Publication 5-2, also withdrawn on September 2, 2008), followed by the three digits of the county code within the state or possession. County FIPS codes in the United States are usually (with a few exceptions) in the same sequence as alphabetized county names within a state. They are usually (but not always) odd numbers, so that new or changed county names can be fit in their alphabetical sequence slot.

In response to the NIST decision, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that it would replace the FIPS 6-4 codes with the INCITS 31 codes after the 2010 census, with the Census bureau assigning new codes as needed for their internal use during the transition. The Census Bureau decided that, based on decades of using the terminology FIPS to describe its codes, it would continue to use the FIPS name for its updated codes, where FIPS now stood for FIP &quot;Series&quot;, since there no longer existed an official FIP &quot;Standard&quot;.

FIPS county codes are still used by the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) to define geographic locations for their SAME-based public alerting systems. In this application, a &quot;0&quot; (zero) is added as the first digit and used as a &quot;placeholder&quot;, making each FIPS code a six-digit sequence. In the future, the first digit may be utilized in this numerical scheme to represent a predefined county subdivision.

<text>Marwan Barghouti (also transliterated al-Barghuthi; ; born 6 June 1959) is a Palestinian political leader convicted and imprisoned for his role in deadly attacks against Israel. He is regarded as a leader of the First and Second Intifadas. Barghouti at one time supported the peace process, but later became disillusioned after 2000, becoming a leader of Tanzim, a paramilitary offshoot of Fatah.

Barghouti was born in the village of Kobar in the West Bank in 1959. At the age of 15, he joined Fatah and co-founded its Youth Movement, and was consequently arrested by Israel three years later. During his four-year first imprisonment, Barghouthi completed his secondary education and gained fluency in Hebrew. In 1983, Barghouti enrolled at the Birzeit University and gained his B.A. in History and Political Science in 1994, earning soon after an M.A. in International Relations in 1998. In 1984, Barghouthi married a fellow student, Fadwa Ibrahim, a prominent advocate for Palestinian prisoners, who later became the leading campaigner for her husband&#x27;s release during his current imprisonment. 
Israeli authorities have called Barghouti a terrorist, accusing him of directing numerous attacks, including suicide bombings, against civilian and military targets alike. Barghouti was arrested by Israel Defense Forces in 2002 in Ramallah. He was tried and convicted on charges of murder, and sentenced to five life sentences. Marwan Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. Barghouti still exerts great influence in Fatah from within prison. With popularity reaching further than that, there has been some speculation whether he could be a unifying candidate in a bid to succeed Mahmoud Abbas.

In the negotiations over the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Hamas insisted on including Barghouti in the deal with Israel; however, Israel was unwilling to concede to that demand. Despite initial reports that he was going to be released in the 11 October 2011 deal between Israel and Hamas, it was soon denied by Israeli sources. In November 2014, Barghouti urged the Palestinian Authority to immediately end security cooperation with Israel and called for a Third Intifada against Israel.

== Biography ==
Barghouti was born in the village of Kobar near Ramallah, and comes from the Barghouti clan, an extended family from Deir Ghassaneh. Mustafa Barghouti, a fellow Palestinian political figure, is a distant cousin. Barghouti was one of seven children, and his father was a migrant worker in Lebanon. His younger brother Muqbel described him as &quot;a naughty and rebellious boy&quot;.

Barghouti joined Fatah at age 15, and he was a co-founder of the Fatah Youth Movement (Shabiba) on the West Bank. By the age of 18 in 1976, Barghouti was arrested by Israel for his involvement with Palestinian militant groups. He completed his secondary education and received a high school diploma while serving a four-year term in jail, where he gained fluency in Hebrew.

Barghouti enrolled at Birzeit University (BZU) in 1983, though arrest and exile meant that he did not receive his B.A. (History and Political Science) until 1994. He earned an M.A. in International Relations, also from Birzeit, in 1998. As an undergraduate, he was active in student politics on behalf of Fatah and headed the BZU Student Council. On 21 October 1984, he married a fellow student, Fadwa Ibrahim. Fadwa took bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in law and was a prominent advocate in her own right on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, before becoming the leading campaigner for her husband&#x27;s release from his current jail term. The couple has a daughter, Ruba (born 1986), and three sons, Qassam (born 1985), Sharaf (born 1989) and Arab (born 1990).

== First Intifada, the Oslo Accords and the aftermath==
Barghouti became one of the major leaders in the West Bank of the First Intifada in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation. During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan for incitement, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994.

Although he was a strong supporter of the peace process he doubted that Israel was committed to land-for-peace deals. In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, following which he began his active advocacy of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Barghouti campaigned against corruption in Arafat&#x27;s administration and human rights violations by its security services, and he established relationships with a number of Israeli politicians and members of Israel&#x27;s peace movement. The formal position occupied by Barghouti was Secretary-General of Fatah in the West Bank. By the summer of 2000, particularly after the Camp David summit failed, Barghouti was disillusioned and said that popular protests and &quot;new forms of military struggle&quot; would be features of the &quot;next Intifada&quot;.

== Second Intifada ==
===Tanzim leadership===
In September 2000, the Second Intifada began. Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah armed branch, the Tanzim, seen as one of the major forces fighting against the Israel Defense Forces. Barghouti led marches to Israeli checkpoints, where riots broke out against Israeli soldiers and spurred on Palestinians in speeches at funerals and demonstrations, advocating the use of force to expel Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He has stated that, &quot;I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom&quot; and has said, &quot;I still seek peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine based on full withdrawal from Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.&quot;

As the Palestinian death toll in the Second Intifada increased, Barghouti called for Palestinians to target Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. During the second intifada Barghouti was accused by Israel of being a senior member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, an organization which conducted numerous attacks and suicide bombings on civilians both within and outside of Israel proper, and has been accused of having directed some of these bombings personally. While some Palestinian militants advocated adopting tactics based on those used by Hezbollah to drive the Israeli army out of Lebanon, Barghouti was seen as less radical, supporting violent actions based on popular movements but exclusively within the Palestinian territories.

According to National Public Radio, Barghouti &quot;cut his ideological teeth as the political leader of Fatah&#x27;s armed militant wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades.

=== Israeli trial and imprisonment ===
Israel accused him of founding the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades and attempted to assassinate him in 2001. The missile hit his bodyguard&#x27;s car, killing the bodyguard. Barghouti survived but was arrested by the Israeli Army in Ramallah, on 15 April 2002 and transferred to the &#x27;Russian Compound&#x27; police station in Jerusalem.

Amos Harel wrote in &quot;Haaretz&quot; that Barghouti was arrested by soldiers of the Duchifat Battalion who had approached the building hidden in an ambulance to avoid detection: &quot;The Duchifat soldiers were squeezed into a protected ambulance in order to arrive as quickly as possible at the house where Barghouti was hiding, and to seal it off.&quot;

Several months later, he was indicted in an Israeli civilian court on 26 charges of murder and attempted murder stemming from attacks carried out by the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. The Israeli verdict against him in effect removed Arafat&#x27;s only political rival. Barghouti stressed that he supported armed resistance to the Israeli occupation, but condemned attacks on civilians inside Israel. According to the case argued by Israel at his trial, he had supported and authorized such attacks. On 20 May 2004, he was convicted of five counts of murder: authorizing and organizing the murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis (aka Father Germanos, a Greek Orthodox monk-priest), a shooting adjacent to Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev in which a civilian was killed, and the Seafood Market attack in Tel Aviv in which three civilians were killed. In addition, he was convicted of attempted murder for a failed car bomb attack near Malha Mall that exploded prematurely, resulting in the deaths of two suicide bombers, and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. He was acquitted of 21 counts of murder in 33 other attacks as no proof was brought to link Barghouti directly with the specific decisions of the local leadership of the Tanzim to carry out these particular attacks. On 6 June 2004, he was sentenced to the maximum possible punishment for his convictions: five cumulative life sentences for the murders and an additional 40 years, consisting of 20 years each for attempted murder and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union reviewed the case and released a report that criticized Barghouti&#x27;s arrest, treatment while in detention, and trial. It said his rights were violated and international treaties and norms were contravened.

=== Campaign for release ===

Since Barghouti&#x27;s arrest, many of his supporters have campaigned for his release. They include prominent Palestinian figures, members of European Parliament and the Israeli group Gush Shalom. Reuters reported that some see Barghouti &quot;as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, the man who could galvanize a drifting and divided national movement if only he were set free by Israel&quot;. According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;[u]nlike many in the Western media, Palestinian journalists and writers have rarely - if ever - referred to Barghouti as...the &#x27;Palestinian Nelson Mandela.&#x27;&quot;

Another approach is to suggest that Israel&#x27;s freeing of Barghouti would be an excellent show of good faith in the peace process. This view gained popularity among the Israeli left after the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip. Still others, operating from a realpolitik perspective, have pointed out that allowing Barghouti to re-enter Palestinian politics could serve to bolster Fatah against gains in Hamas&#x27; popularity. According to Pinhas Inbari of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs,

&quot;Hamas understands it needs to provide its supporters with some comfort, especially seeing the suffering of the Palestinian people. For this reason, Hamas is willing to accept Barghouti&#x27;s release and to deal with him after he is free. Without the severe state of the Palestinian people, Hamas would object to the release of Barghouti.&quot;

Following Barghouti&#x27;s January 2006 re-election to the Palestinian Legislative Council, a debate over Barghouti&#x27;s fate began anew in Israel, ranging from former MK Yossi Beilin&#x27;s support for a Presidential pardon to the total refusal of any idea of early release. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stated,

&quot;We must not forget that he is a cold-blooded murderer who was sentenced by the court to five life sentences... It is out of the question to free an assassin who has blood on his hands and was duly sentenced by a court.&quot;

However several MKs, including Kadima MK Meir Sheetrit, suggested that Barghouti will likely be released as part of future peace negotiations, although they did not specify when. In January 2007, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres declared that he would sign a presidential pardon for Marwan Barghouti if elected to the Israeli presidency. However, despite Peres winning the presidency, a pardon was not issued.

== Split from Fatah ==

On 14 December 2005, Barghouti announced that he had formed a new political party, al-Mustaqbal (&quot;The Future&quot;), mainly composed of members of Fatah&#x27;s &quot;Young Guard&quot;, who repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party. The list, which was presented to the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s central elections committee on that day, included Mohammed Dahlan, Kadoura Fares, Samir Mashharawi and Jibril Rajoub.

The split followed Barghouti&#x27;s earlier refusal of Mahmoud Abbas&#x27; offer to be second on the Fatah party&#x27;s parliamentary list, behind Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei. Barghouti had actually topped the list, but this had not become apparent until after the new party had been registered.

Reactions to the news was split. Some suggested that the move was a positive step towards peace, as Barghouti&#x27;s new party could help reform major problems in Palestinian government. Others raised concern that it could wind up splitting the Fatah vote, inadvertently helping Hamas. Barghouti&#x27;s supporters argued that al-Mustaqbal would split the votes of both parties, both from disenchanted Fatah members as well as moderate Hamas voters who do not agree with Hamas&#x27; political goals, but rather its social work and hard position on corruption. Some observers also hypothesized that the formation of al-Mustaqbal was mostly a negotiating tactic to get members of the Young Guard into higher positions of power within Fatah and its electoral list.

Barghouti eventually was convinced that the idea of leading a new party, especially one that was created by splitting from Fatah, would be unrealistic while he was still in prison. Instead he stood as a Fatah candidate in the January 2006 PLC elections, comfortably regaining his seat in the Palestinian Parliament.

== Political activity in prison ==
In late 2004, Barghouti announced from his Israeli prison his intention to run in the Palestinian Authority presidential election in January 2005, called for following the death of President Yasser Arafat in November. On 26 November 2004, it appeared he would withdraw from the contest following pressure from the Fatah faction to support Abbas&#x27; candidacy. However, just before the deadline on 1 December, Barghouti&#x27;s wife registered him as an independent candidate. On 12 December, facing pressure from Fatah to withdraw in favor of Abbas, he chose to abandon his candidacy for the benefit of Palestinian unity. On 11 May 2006, Palestinian leaders held in Israeli prisons released the National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners. The document was a proposal initiated by Marwan Barghouti and leaders of Hamas, the PFLP, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the DFLP that proposed a basis upon which a coalition government should be formed in the Palestinian Legislative Council. This came as a result of the political stalemate in the Palestinian territories that followed Hamas&#x27; election to the PLC in January 2006. Crucially, the document also called for negotiation with the state of Israel in order to achieve lasting peace. The document quickly gained popular currency and is now considered the bedrock upon which a national unity government should be achieved. According to Haaretz, Barghouti, although not officially represented in the negotiations of a Palestinian unity government in February 2007, played a major role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah and formulating the compromise reached on 8 February 2007. In 2009, he was elected to party leadership at the Fatah Conference in Bethlehem.

In April 2017 he organized a hunger strike of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails. He laid out the motivation behind the strike in an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. On 7 May, the Israel Prison Service released videos allegedly showing Barghouti hiding in the toilet stall of his cell while eating cookies and candy, then trying to flush the wrappers. The videos were recorded on 27 April and on 5 May, a period during which almost 1,000 of Barghouti&#x27;s fellow prisoners were refusing all food. Anonymous sources in the prison service confirmed the authenticity of the videos, saying that the food was made available to Barghouti to test his adherence to the hunger strike. Barghouti&#x27;s attorney refused to respond to the videos, while his wife claimed that they had been &quot;fabricated&quot; to discredit him. Israeli media reported that this was not Barghouti&#x27;s first time being caught secretly breaking a hunger strike, and that in 2004 he had been photographed hiding a plate after eating off it in his cell.

Barghouti remains popular among the Palestinian people. According to polling data in mid-2012, 60% of Palestinians would vote for him for president of the Palestinian Authority, beating both Abbas and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

In August 2023, Barghouti&#x27;s wife Fadwa held meetings with senior officials and diplomats across the world, including Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, to advocate for her husband&#x27;s release and position him as a successor to Abbas. According to Al-Sharq al-Awsat, Barghouti would run in Palestinian presidential elections and maintained a polling lead over all other candidates. During the Israel–Hamas war in February 2024, Hamas called for Barghouti&#x27;s release, but he has been placed in solitary confinement.

Since 7 October 2023 Barghouti has been held in solitary confinement, and according to his lawyer, denied medical treatment sustained during beatings. The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel has described the conditions under which he lives as &#x27;torture&#x27;. In March 2024, Barghouti&#x27;s family reported that he was beaten by guards in prison. The Prison Service denied any mistreatment, and stated that Barghouti had recently filed a petition that had been rejected by the courts. Israeli prison authorities were again accused of assaulting Barghouti in September 2024.

<text>An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization. They were designed in 1996 by Rebecca Allen, an Amazon software engineer, when it became clear that Amazon was going to sell products other than just books. The 10-character format of the ASIN was adopted so that Amazon databases and software, which were designed to expect a 10-character International Standard Book Number (ISBN) field, would not have to be changed to accommodate the new identification format.

==Usage and structure==
Each product on Amazon.com is given a unique ASIN. For books with a 10-digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN), the ASIN and the ISBN are the same. The Kindle edition of a book will not use its ISBN as the ASIN, although the electronic version of a book may have its own ISBN. The ASIN forms part of the URL of a product detail page on Amazon&#x27;s website.

<text>Lincoln Cathedral, also called Lincoln Minster, and formally the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln, is a Church of England cathedral in Lincoln, England. It is the seat of the bishop of Lincoln and is the mother church of the diocese of Lincoln. The cathedral is governed by its dean and chapter, and is a grade I listed building.

The earliest parts of the current building date to 1072, when bishop Remigius de Fécamp moved his seat from Dorchester on Thames to Lincoln. The building was completed in 1092, but severely damaged in an earthquake in 1185. It was rebuilt over the following centuries in different phases of the Gothic style, with significant surviving parts of the cathedral in Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular.

The cathedral holds one of the four remaining copies of the original Magna Carta, which is now displayed in Lincoln Castle. It is the fourth largest cathedral in the UK by floor area, at approximately , after Liverpool Cathedral, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and York Minster. It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: &quot;I have always held ... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have.&quot;

== History ==

The first Bishop of Lincoln Remigius de Fécamp moved the episcopal seat (&quot;cathedra&quot;) there &quot;some time between 1072 and 1092&quot;. About this, James Essex writes that &quot;Remigius ... laid the foundations of his Cathedral in 1072&quot; and &quot;it is probable that he, being a Norman, employed Norman masons to superintend the building ... though he could not complete the whole before his death.&quot;

Before that, writes B Winkles, &quot;It is well known that Remigius appropriated the parish church of St Mary Magdalene in Lincoln, although it is not known what use he made of it.&quot;

When Lincoln Cathedral was first built, William the Conqueror granted the parish of Welton to Remigius in order to endow six prebends which provided income to support six canons attached to the cathedral. These were subsequently confirmed by William II and Henry I.

Until then St Mary&#x27;s Church in Stow was considered to be the &quot;mother church&quot; of Lincolnshire (although it was not a cathedral, because the seat of the diocese was at Dorchester Abbey in Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire). However, Lincoln was more central to a diocese that stretched from the Thames to the Humber.

Remigius built the first Lincoln Cathedral on the present site, finishing it in 1092 and then dying on 7 May of that year, two days before it was consecrated. In 1124, the timber roofing was destroyed in a fire. Alexander (bishop, 1123–48) rebuilt and expanded the cathedral, but it was mostly destroyed by an earthquake about forty years later, in 1185 (dated by the British Geological Survey as occurring 15 April 1185). The earthquake was one of the largest felt in the UK: it has an estimated magnitude of over 5. The damage to the cathedral is thought to have been very extensive: the cathedral is described as having &quot;split from top to bottom&quot;; in the current building, only the lower part of the west end and its two attached towers remain of the pre-earthquake cathedral.

Some (Kidson, 1986; Woo, 1991) have suggested that the damage to Lincoln Cathedral was probably exacerbated by poor construction or design, with the actual collapse most probably caused by a vault failure.

After the earthquake, a new bishop was appointed. He was Hugh de Burgundy of Avalon, France, who became known as St Hugh of Lincoln. He began a massive rebuilding and expansion programme. With his appointment of William de Montibus as master of the cathedral school and chancellor, Lincoln briefly became one of the leading educational centres in England, producing writers such as Samuel Presbiter and Richard of Wetheringsett, though it declined in importance after William&#x27;s death in 1213. Rebuilding began with the choir (St Hugh&#x27;s Choir) and the eastern transepts between 1192 and 1210. The central nave was then built in the Early English Gothic architectural style. Lincoln Cathedral soon followed other architectural advances of the time – pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting were added to the cathedral. This allowed support for incorporating larger windows. 

There are thirteen bells in the south-west tower, two in the north-west tower, and five in the central tower (including Great Tom). Accompanying the cathedral&#x27;s large bell, Great Tom of Lincoln, is a quarter-hour striking clock which was installed in the early 19th century. The two large stained glass rose windows, the matching Dean&#x27;s Eye and the Bishop&#x27;s Eye were added to the cathedral during the late Middle Ages. The former, the Dean&#x27;s Eye in the north transept dates from the 1192 rebuild begun by St Hugh, completed in 1235. The latter, the Bishop&#x27;s Eye, in the south transept was reconstructed a hundred years later in 1330. A contemporary record, &quot;The Metrical Life of St Hugh&quot;, refers to the meaning of these two windows (one on the dark, north, side and the other on the light, south, side of the building):


After the additions of the Dean&#x27;s eye and other major Gothic additions it is believed some mistakes in the support of the tower occurred, for in 1237 the main tower collapsed. A new tower was soon started and in 1255 the cathedral petitioned Henry III to allow them to take down part of the town wall to enlarge and expand the cathedral, including the rebuilding of the central tower and spire. They replaced the small rounded chapels (built at the time of St Hugh) with a larger east end to the cathedral. This was to handle the increasing number of pilgrims to the cathedral, who came to worship at the shrine of Hugh of Lincoln.

In 1290 Eleanor of Castile died and King Edward I of England decided to honour her, his Queen Consort, with an elegant funeral procession. After her body had been embalmed, which in the 13th century involved evisceration, Eleanor&#x27;s viscera were buried in Lincoln cathedral and Edward placed a duplicate of the Westminster Abbey tomb there. The Lincoln tomb&#x27;s original stone chest survives; its effigy was destroyed in the 17th century and replaced with a 19th-century copy. On the outside of Lincoln Cathedral are two prominent statues often identified as Edward and Eleanor, but these images were heavily restored in the 19th century and they were probably not originally intended to depict the couple.

Between 1307 and 1311 the central tower was raised to its present height of . The western towers and front of the cathedral were also improved and heightened. At this time, a tall lead-encased wooden spire topped the central tower but was blown down in a storm in 1548. Around 1380, the western towers were raised to their current height. They were capped with wooden spires covered with lead in 1420, but by 1807 they were dismantled. With its spire the tower reputedly reached a height of , making it the world&#x27;s tallest structure at the time, though some consider this doubtful.

Other additions to the cathedral at this time included its elaborate carved screen and the 14th-century misericords, as was the Angel Choir. For a large part of the length of the cathedral, the walls have arches in relief with a second layer in front to give the illusion of a passageway along the wall. However the illusion does not work, as the stonemason, copying techniques from France, did not make the arches the correct length needed for the illusion to be effective.

In 1398 John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford founded a chantry in the cathedral to pray for the welfare of their souls. In the 15th century the building of the cathedral turned to chantry or memorial chapels. The chapels next to the Angel Choir were built in the Perpendicular style, with an emphasis on strong vertical lines, which survive today in the window tracery and wall panelling.

=== Magna Carta ===

Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, was one of the signatories to Magna Carta and for hundreds of years the cathedral held one of the four remaining copies of the original, now securely displayed in Lincoln Castle.

The Lincoln Magna Carta was on display at the British Pavilion during the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In March 1941, the Foreign Office proposed that the Lincoln Magna Carta be gifted to the United States, citing the &quot;many thousands of Americans who waited in long queues to view it&quot; and the US passage of the Lend-Lease Act, among other reasons. In 2009 the Lincoln Magna Carta was lent to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

There are three other surviving copies: two at the British Library and one at Salisbury Cathedral.

=== Little Saint Hugh ===

In August 1255 the body of an eight-year-old boy was found in a well in Lincoln. He had been missing for nearly a month. This incident became the source of a blood libel in the city, with Jews accused of his abduction, torture, and murder. Many Jews were arrested and eighteen were hanged. The boy became known as Little Saint Hugh, to distinguish him from Saint Hugh of Lincoln, but he was never canonised.

The cathedral benefited from these events because Hugh was seen as a martyr, and many devotees came to the city and cathedral to venerate him. Geoffrey Chaucer mentions the case in &quot;The Prioress&#x27;s Tale&quot; and a ballad was written about it in 1783. In 1955 a plaque was placed near &quot;the remains of the shrine of &#x27;Little St Hugh in the cathedral, that decries the &quot;Trumped up stories of &#x27;ritual murders&#x27; of Christian boys by Jewish communities.&quot;

== Features ==

=== Lincoln Imp ===
A carving in the Angel Choir is known as the Lincoln Imp, and since the late nineteenth century it has become the symbol of the city. The carving dates from the 13th century but received little attention until the late 19th century, when it figured in Arnold Frost&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Ballad of the Wind, the Devil and Lincoln Minster&quot;.

=== Wren library ===

The Wren Library houses a rare collection of over 277 manuscripts, including the fifteenth-century &quot;Thornton Romances&quot; found in the Lincoln Thornton Manuscript.

=== Rose windows ===
Lincoln Cathedral features two major rose windows, which are a highly uncommon feature among medieval architecture in England. On the north side of the cathedral is the &quot;Dean&#x27;s Eye&quot; which survives from the original structure of the building and on the south side is the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Eye&quot; which was most likely rebuilt –1350. This south window is one of the largest examples of curvilinear tracery seen in medieval architecture. Curvilinear tracery is a form of tracery where the patterns are continuous curves. This form was often done within pointed arches and squared windows because those are the easiest shapes, so the circular space of the window was a unique challenge to the designers. 

A solution was created that called for the circle to be divided into smaller shapes that would make it simpler to design and create. Curves were drawn within the window which created four distinct areas of the circle. This made the spaces within the circle where the tracery would go much smaller, and easier to work with. This window is also unique in that the focus of the tracery was shifted away from the centre of the circle and instead placed in other sections. The glazing of the window was difficult as the tracery for many of the same reasons; therefore, the designers cut back on the amount of iconography within the window.

Most cathedral windows during this time displayed many colourful images of the Bible; however, at Lincoln there are very few images. Some of those images that can be seen within the window include saints Paul, Andrew, and James.

=== Vaults ===

One major architectural features of Lincoln Cathedral are the vaults. The varying vaults within the cathedral are said to be both original and experimental. They demonstrate the experimental aspect seen at Lincoln. The vaults differ between the nave, aisles, choir, and chapels. Along the North Aisle there is a continuous ridge rib with a regular arcade that ignores the bays. In the South Aisle there is a discontinuous ridge rib that puts an emphasis on each bay. The North West Chapel has quadripartite vaults and the South Chapel has vaults that stem from one central support column. The use of sexpartite vaults allowed for more natural light to enter the cathedral through the clerestory windows, which were placed inside of each bay.

Saint Hugh&#x27;s Choir exhibits a series of asymmetrical vaults that appear to almost be a diagonal line created by two ribs on one side translating into only a single rib on the other side of the vault. This pattern divides the space of the vaults and bays, placing the emphasis on the bays.

The chapter house is a decagonal building with a single, central column from which twenty ribs rise producing unusual vaulting.

Each area of Lincoln can be identified solely by the different vaults of the space. Each vault, or each variation of the vault, is unique. The vaults are attributed to French-Normand master mason Geoffrey de Noiers. de Noiers was succeeded by Alexander the Mason, who developed the nave&#x27;s more elaborate, but symmetrical tierceron vaulting, the crossing vaulting, Galilee Porch and western facade screen.

=== Tower clock ===

A clock by John Thwaite was installed in the north west tower in 1775. This was later improved by Benjamin Vulliamy and moved to the broad tower around 1835. It was replaced in 1880 by a new clock built by Potts and Sons of Leeds, under the instruction of Edmund Beckett QC. Cambridge Chimes were a feature of the new clock. The machinery, featuring a double three-legged gravity escapement to Beckett&#x27;s designs, weighs about , with the driving weights being , suspended by steel-wire ropes long, and the pendulum weight of . The beat is 1.5 seconds. 

The hour hammer is , striking upon the Great Tom bell. The striking trains require winding daily, when done manually it took 20 minutes. The going train required winding twice per week. The clock mechanism contains the inscription &quot;Quod bene vortat Deus Opt. Max., Consiliis Edmundi Beckett, Baronetti, LL.D., Opera Gul. Potts et Filiorum, civium Leodiensium, Sumptibus Decani et Capituli, Novum in Turri positum est Horologium, A.D. MDCCCLXXX&quot;.
=== Bells ===

The South West tower of the cathedral contains a fine ring of 13 bells, all cast by John Taylor &amp; Co in Loughborough. The back 8 bells were cast in 1913, with 4 new trebles being added in 1927. In 1948 a flat 6th was added to allow for ringing on the middle 8 bells. The treble bell weighs 5cwt 0qr 2lb (281 kg), with the tenor weighing 23cwt 3qr 23lb (1,217 kg) and striking the note D (nominal 600.0 Hz). The bells are rung from the section of the tower just above The Great West Front, with the ringing chamber having three windows on all but one side. The bells themselves are hung below the louvres to minimise tower movement as much as possible.

== Modern history ==


=== Wartime history ===

Sometime during the later stages of the Second World War, the accomplished RAF pilot and future Black British civil rights leader, Billy Strachan, almost crashed his aircraft into Lincoln Cathedral. Strachan credited this experience with ending his piloting career, as he found it psychologically impossible to continue flying combat missions.

Lincolnshire was home to many Bomber Command airfields during the Second World War, giving rise to the nickname of &quot;Bomber County&quot;. The station badge for the nearby RAF Waddington depicts Lincoln Cathedral rising through the clouds. Until the opening of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in 2012, the cathedral had the only memorial in the United Kingdom dedicated to Bomber Command&#x27;s large losses of aircrew in the Second World War.

During the war, &quot;priceless British treasures&quot; were placed in a chamber sixty feet beneath the cathedral for safekeeping. This did not include the cathedral&#x27;s copy of Magna Carta as it was on loan in the United States.

=== 21st century ===

A major renovation of the West Front was undertaken in 2000. It was discovered that the flying buttresses on the east end were no longer connected to the adjoining stonework, and repairs were made to prevent collapse. Additionally, the stonework of the Dean&#x27;s Eye window in the transept was crumbling, meaning that a complete reconstruction of the window has had to be carried out according to the conservation criteria set out by the International Council on Monuments and Sites. There was a period of great anxiety when it emerged that the stonework needed to shift only for the entire window to collapse. Specialist engineers removed the window&#x27;s tracery before installing a strengthened, more stable replacement. In addition to this the original stained glass was cleaned and set behind a new clear isothermal glass which offers better protection from the elements. By April 2006 the renovation project was completed at a cost of £2 million.

It was announced in January 2020 that since 2016, archaeologists had found over 50 burials during the renovations, including a priest buried with a chalice and paten. Among the artifacts recovered was a coin depicting Edward the Confessor, who was king from 1042 to 1066. During the dig, sections of some extensively decorated Roman buildings and related artifacts were also discovered. Some of the Roman, medieval and Saxon objects were to be displayed at the visitor centre which was expected to open later in 2020. In 2022 the scaffolding of the Lincoln Cathedral was removed from its west front after 36 years.

Maintaining the cathedral costs £5.86 million a year (as at 2016). Between 2006 and 2009, 200,000 to 208,000 people visited Lincoln Cathedral annually. In 2010 the figure dropped to 150,000, making it the 16th-most visited attraction in the East Midlands. The fall in visitor numbers was attributed to the cancellation of the Lincoln Christmas Market that year.

The cathedral website states: &quot;Everyone is free to enter and gaze at the glory of the nave; you can sit in the peace of the Morning Chapel or visit the shop. If you want to explore further, we do ask you to pay.&quot; The cathedral offers tours of the cathedral, the tower and the roof. The peak of its season is the Lincoln Christmas Market, accompanied by an annual production of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

=== Cathedral stone ===

Lincoln Cathedral is one of the few English cathedrals built from the rock on which it stands. It is mostly built from Lincolnshire Limestone. The cathedral has owned the existing quarry, on Riseholme Road, Lincoln, since 1876. As of 2016, the quarry was expected to run out of stone in 2021. The cathedral&#x27;s stonemasons use more than 100 tonnes of stone per year for maintenance and repairs.

== Music ==

=== Choir and organists ===

The choir is currently formed of adult singers (who are either lay vicars or choral scholars), and teams of about 20 girls and 20 boys. The cathedral accepted female choristers in 1995. Lincoln was the second cathedral in the country to adopt a separate girls&#x27; choir (after Salisbury Cathedral) and remains one of few which provides the same musical opportunities and equal weekly singing duties to both girls and boys. The choristers can now attend any school and are currently drawn from over ten local schools.

The Master of the Choristers (director of music) is Aric Prentice, who conducts the choir of boys and men; the Cathedral Organist and assistant director of music is Jeffrey Makinson, who conducts the choir of girls and men. The organist emeritus is Colin Walsh, previously organist and master of the choristers and then organist laureate.

The records of cathedral organists at Lincoln are continuous from 1439 when John Ingleton was the incumbent. Notable organists have included the Renaissance composers William Byrd and John Reading and the biographer of Mendelssohn, William Thomas Freemantle.

=== Organ ===
One of the best examples of the work of &quot;Father&quot; Henry Willis, and the last he designed before his death, the cathedral organ dates from 1898. Willis had completed the design by 1885 but a shortfall in funding delayed construction and installation. This was made possible in 1898, after a donation of £1,000 () from Alfred Shuttleworth, an engineer and later chairman of Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth. This, together with other private gifts and a public subscription, allowed work to progress. On St Hugh&#x27;s Day, 17 November 1898, the organ was inaugurated at a service attended by 4,700 people. Willis had intended that the organ be electrically-powered, the first organ in an English cathedral to be powered in this way. As the Brayford Wharf Power Station had not yet been completed, manual power was instead provided by infantrymen from the Lincolnshire Regiment.

The organ has been restored twice, in 1960 and in 1998. On both occasions the work was undertaken by Harrison &amp; Harrison. It is one of only two Willis organs in English cathedrals with its original tonal scheme. The organ specification is held on the National Pipe Organ Register.

=== In literature ===

In Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;Lincoln Cathedral&quot; to a painting by Thomas Allom, she remarks on the derivation of Gothic tracery from &quot;the arches of the old oak trees&quot;. This was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837.

=== In media ===
The cathedral was used for the filming of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (based on the book of the same name). Filming took place mainly within the cloisters, and chapter house, of the cathedral, and remained a closed set. The cathedral took on the role of Westminster Abbey, as the abbey had refused to permit filming. Although there was protest at the filming, the filming was completed by the end of August 2005. To make the Lincoln chapter house appear similar to the Westminster chapter house, murals were painted on a special layer over the existing wall, and elsewhere polystyrene replicas of Isaac Newton&#x27;s tomb and other abbey monuments were set up. For a time these murals and replicas remained in the chapter house, as part of a Da Vinci Code exhibit for visitors, but in January 2008 they were all sold off in an auction to raise money for the cathedral.

The cathedral also doubled as Westminster Abbey for the film &quot;Young Victoria&quot;, filmed in September 2007, and did again in June 2018 for the Netflix Shakespeare film &quot;The King&quot;.

During 2022 the cathedral was also one of the locations for the 2023 Ridley Scott film &quot;Napoleon&quot;, in which it serves both as Notre-Dame cathedral for the coronation scene and Milan cathedral in a sequence shown within the extended director&#x27;s cut of the film.

The cathedral is LCR FM&#x27;s transmitter site.

<doc id="71908" wikidata="Q311197" url="?curid=71908" title="Earl Warren">
<text>Earl Warren (March 19, 1891 – July 9, 1974) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 30th governor of California from 1943 to 1953 and as the 14th Chief Justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969. The Warren Court presided over a major shift in American constitutional jurisprudence, which has been recognized by many as a &quot;Constitutional Revolution&quot; in the liberal direction, with Warren writing the majority opinions in landmark cases such as &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964), &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966), and &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967). Warren also led the Warren Commission, a presidential commission that investigated the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He served as Governor of California from 1943 to 1953, and is the last chief justice to have served in an elected office before nomination to the Supreme Court. Warren is generally considered to be one of the most influential Supreme Court justices and political leaders in the history of the United States.

Warren was born in 1891 in Los Angeles and was raised in Bakersfield, California. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, he began a legal career in Oakland. He was hired as a deputy district attorney for Alameda County in 1920 and was appointed district attorney in 1925. He emerged as a leader of the state Republican Party and won election as the Attorney General of California in 1938. In that position he supported, and was a firm proponent of the forced removal and internment of over 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. In the 1942 California gubernatorial election, Warren defeated incumbent Democratic governor Culbert Olson. As the 30th Governor of California, Warren presided over a period of major growth—for the state as well as the nation. Serving from 1943 to 1953, Warren is the only governor of California to be elected for three consecutive terms.

Warren served as Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s running mate in the 1948 presidential election, but the ticket lost the election to incumbent President Harry S. Truman and Senator Alben W. Barkley in an election upset. Warren sought the Republican nomination in the 1952 presidential election, but the party nominated General Dwight D. Eisenhower. After Eisenhower won election as president, he appointed Warren as Chief Justice. A series of rulings made by the Warren Court in the 1950s helped lead to the decline of McCarthyism. Warren helped arrange a unanimous decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), which ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. After &quot;Brown&quot;, the Warren Court continued to issue rulings that helped bring an end to the segregationist Jim Crow laws that were prevalent throughout the Southern United States. In &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States&quot; (1964), the Court upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that prohibits racial segregation in public institutions and public accommodations.

In the 1960s, the Warren Court handed down several landmark rulings that significantly transformed criminal procedure, redistricting, and other areas of the law. Many of the Court&#x27;s decisions incorporated the Bill of Rights, making the protections of the Bill of Rights apply to state and local governments. &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; (1963) established a criminal defendant&#x27;s right to an attorney in felony cases, and &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966) required police officers to give what became known as the &quot;Miranda&quot; warning to suspects taken into police custody that advises them of their constitutional protections. &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964) established that all state legislative districts must be of roughly equal population size, while the Court&#x27;s holding in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; (1964) required equal populations for congressional districts, thus achieving &quot;one man, one vote&quot; in the United States. &quot;Schmerber v. California&quot; (1966) established that forced extraction of a blood sample is not compelled testimony, illuminating the limits on the protections of the 4th and 5th Amendments and &quot;Warden v. Hayden&quot; (1967) dramatically expanded the rights of police to seize evidence with a search warrant, reversing the mere evidence rule. Furthermore, &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965) established a constitutional right to privacy and struck down a state law that restricted access to contraceptives, and &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967) struck down state anti-miscegenation laws, which had banned or otherwise regulated interracial marriage. 

Warren announced his retirement in 1968 and was succeeded by Appellate Judge Warren E. Burger in 1969. The Warren Court&#x27;s rulings have received criticism but have received widespread support and acclamation from both liberals and conservatives, and few of the Court&#x27;s decisions have been overturned.

==Early life, family, and education==
Warren was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 19, 1891, to Matt Warren and his wife, Crystal. Matt, whose original family name was Vaare, was born in Stavanger, Norway, in 1864, and he and his family migrated to the United States in 1866. Crystal, whose maiden name was Hernlund, was born in Hälsingland, Sweden; she and her family migrated to the United States when she was an infant. After marrying in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Mathias and Crystal settled in Southern California in 1889, where Matthias found work with the Southern Pacific Railroad. Earl Warren was the second of two children, after his older sister, Ethel. Earl did not receive a middle name; his father later commented that &quot;when you were born I was too poor to give you a middle name.&quot; In 1896, the family resettled in Bakersfield, California, where Warren grew up. Though not an exceptional student, Warren graduated from Kern County High School in 1908.

Hoping to become a trial lawyer, Warren enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley after graduating from high school. He majored in political science and became a member of the Sigma Phi fraternity. Like many other students at Berkeley, Warren was influenced by the progressive movement, and he was especially affected by Governor Hiram Johnson of California and Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin. While at Berkeley, Warren was little more than an average student who earned decent but undistinguished grades and after his third year, he entered the school&#x27;s Department of Jurisprudence (now UC Berkeley School of Law). He received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1914. Like his classmates upon graduation, Warren was admitted to the California bar without examination. After graduation, he took a position with the Associated Oil Company in San Francisco. Warren disliked working at the company and was disgusted by the corruption he saw in San Francisco, so he took a position with the Oakland law firm of Robinson and Robinson.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Warren volunteered for an officer training camp, but was rejected due to hemorrhoids. Still hoping to become an officer, Warren underwent a procedure to remove the hemorrhoids, but by the time he fully recovered from the operation the officer training camp had closed. Warren enlisted in the United States Army as a private in August 1917, and was assigned to Company I of the 91st Division&#x27;s 363rd Infantry Regiment at Camp Lewis, Washington. He was made acting first sergeant of the company before being sent to a three-month officer training course. After he returned to the company in May 1918 as a second lieutenant, the regiment was sent to Camp Lee, Virginia, to train draftees. Warren spent the rest of the war there and was discharged less than a month after Armistice Day, following a promotion to first lieutenant. Warren remained in the United States Army Reserve until 1934, rising to the rank of captain.

==City and district attorney==
In late 1918, Warren returned to Oakland, where he accepted a position as the legislative assistant to Leon E. Gray, a newly elected member of the California State Assembly. Shortly after arriving in the state capital of Sacramento, Warren was appointed as the clerk of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. After a brief stint as a deputy city attorney for Oakland, in 1920 Warren was hired as a deputy district attorney for Alameda County. By the end of 1924, Warren had become the most senior person in the department outside of the district attorney, Ezra Decoto. Though many of his professional colleagues supported Calvin Coolidge, Warren cast his vote for Progressive Party candidate Robert La Follette in the 1924 presidential election. That same year, Warren made his first foray into electoral politics, serving as the campaign manager for his friend, Republican Assemblyman Frank Anderson.

With the support of Governor Friend Richardson and publisher Joseph R. Knowland, a leader of the conservative faction of San Francisco Bay Area Republicans, Warren was appointed as the Alameda County district attorney in 1925. Warren faced a tough re-election campaign in 1926, as local Republican boss Michael Joseph Kelly sought to unseat him. Warren rejected political contributions and largely self-funded his campaign, leaving him at a financial disadvantage to Kelly&#x27;s preferred candidate, Preston Higgins. Nonetheless, Warren won a landslide victory over Higgins, taking over two-thirds of the vote. When he ran for re-election again in 1930, he faced only token opposition.

Warren gained a statewide reputation as a tough, no-nonsense district attorney who fought corruption in government and ran his office in a nonpartisan manner. Warren strongly supported the autonomy of law enforcement agencies, but also believed that police and prosecutors had to act fairly. Unlike many other local law enforcement officials in the 1920s, Warren vigorously enforced Prohibition. In 1927, he launched a corruption investigation against Sheriff Burton Becker. After a trial that some in the press described as &quot;the most sweeping exposé of graft in the history of the country,&quot; Warren won a conviction against Becker in 1930. When one of his own undercover agents admitted that he had perjured himself in order to win convictions in bootleg cases, Warren personally took charge of prosecuting the agent. Warren&#x27;s efforts gained him national attention; a 1931 nationwide poll of law enforcement officials found that Warren was &quot;the most intelligent and politically independent district attorney in the United States&quot;.

In 1932, he argued his first Supreme Court case, Central Pacific Railway Co. v. Alameda County. That happened to be the last oral argument that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes heard, as he announced his retirement later that afternoon, and stepped down from the court just five days later. Warren would be teased by his friends, who would say &quot;He was 30 years on the State Court, he was 20 years on the Supreme Court, he listened to you just once and he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had it.&quot;

The Great Depression hit the San Francisco Bay area hard in the 1930s, leading to high levels of unemployment and a destabilization of the political order. Warren took a hard stance against labor in the buildup to the San Francisco General Strike. In &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927) Warren prosecuted a woman under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act for attending a communist meeting in Oakland. In 1936, Warren faced one of the most controversial cases of his career after George W. Alberts, the chief engineer of a freighter, was found dead. Warren believed that Alberts was murdered in a conspiracy orchestrated by radical left-wing union members, and he won the conviction of union officials George Wallace, Earl King, Ernest Ramsay, and Frank Conner. Many union members argued that the defendants had been framed by Warren&#x27;s office, and they organized protests of the trial.

===State party leader===

While continuing to serve as the district attorney of Alameda County, Warren emerged as leader of the state Republican Party. He served as the county chairman for Herbert Hoover&#x27;s 1932 campaign and, after Franklin D. Roosevelt won that election, he attacked Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies. In 1934, Warren became chairman of the state Republican Party and he took a leading public role in opposing the gubernatorial candidacy of Democrat Upton Sinclair. Warren earned national notoriety in 1936 for leading a successful campaign to elect a slate of unpledged delegates to the 1936 Republican National Convention; he was motivated largely by his opposition to the influence of Governor Frank Merriam and publisher William Randolph Hearst. In the 1936 presidential election, Warren campaigned on behalf of the unsuccessful Republican nominee, Alf Landon.

==Family and social life==

After World War I, Warren lived with his sister and her husband in Oakland. In 1921, he met Nina Elisabeth Meyers (née Palmquist), a widowed, 28-year-old store manager with a three-year-old son. Nina had been born in Sweden to a Baptist minister and his wife, and her family had migrated to the United States when she was an infant. On October 4, 1925, shortly after Warren was appointed district attorney, Warren and Nina married. Their first child, Virginia, was born in 1928, and they had four more children: Earl Jr. (born 1930), Dorothy (born 1931), Nina Elisabeth (born 1933), and Robert (born 1935). Warren also adopted Nina&#x27;s son, James. Warren was the father-in-law of John Charles Daly, the host of the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; through his daughter Virginia&#x27;s marriage. Warren enjoyed a close relationship with his wife; one of their daughters later described it as &quot;the most ideal relationship I could dream of.&quot; In 1935, the family moved to a seven-bedroom home just outside of downtown Oakland. Though the Warrens sent their children to Sunday school at a local Baptist church, Warren was not a regular churchgoer. In 1938, Warren&#x27;s father, Matt, was murdered at the family home in Bakersfield; investigators never discovered the identity of the murderer. Warren and his family moved to the state capital of Sacramento in 1943, and to the Wardman Park Hotel, a residential hotel in Washington, D.C., in 1953.

Warren was very active after 1919 in such groups as Freemasonry, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Loyal Order of Moose (obtained the Pilgrim Degree of Merit, the highest award given in the fraternity) and the American Legion. Each one introduced Warren to new friends and political connections. He rose through the ranks in the Masons, culminating in his election in 1935 as the Grand Master of the Freemasons for the state of California from 1935 to 1936. Biographer Jim Newton says that Warren &quot;thrived in the Masons because he shared their ideals, but those ideals also helped shape him, nurturing his commitment to service, deepening his conviction that society&#x27;s problems were best addressed by small groups of enlightened, well-meaning citizens. Those ideals knitted together Warren&#x27;s Progressivism, his Republicanism, and his Masonry.&quot;

==Attorney General of California==

In 1934, Warren and his allies won passage of a state ballot measure that transformed the position of Attorney General of California into a full-time office; previous officeholders had worked part-time while maintaining their own private practice. After incumbent Ulysses S. Webb announced his retirement, Warren jumped into the 1938 state attorney general election. Earlier in the 20th century, progressives had passed a state constitutional amendment allowing for &quot;cross-filing,&quot; whereby a candidate could file to run in multiple party primaries for the same office. Warren took advantage of that amendment and ran in multiple primaries. Even though he continued to serve as chairman of the state Republican Party until April 1938, Warren won the Republican, Progressive, and, crucially, Democratic primaries for attorney general. He faced no serious opposition in the 1938 elections, even while incumbent Republican Governor Frank Merriam was defeated by Democratic nominee Culbert Olson.

Once elected, he organized state law enforcement officials into regions and led a statewide anti-crime effort. One of his major initiatives was to crack down on gambling ships operating off the coast of Southern California. Warren continued many of the policies from his predecessor Ulysses S. Webb&#x27;s four decades in office. These included eugenic forced sterilizations and the confiscation of land from Japanese owners. Warren, who was a member of the outspoken anti-Asian society Native Sons of the Golden West, successfully sought legislation expanding the land confiscations. During his time as Attorney General, Warren appointed as one of his deputy attorneys general Roger J. Traynor, who was then a law professor at UC Berkeley and later became the 23rd chief justice of California, as well as one of the most influential judges of his time.

===Internment of Japanese Americans===
After World War II broke out in Europe in 1939, foreign policy became an increasingly important issue in the United States; Warren rejected the isolationist tendencies of many Republicans and supported Roosevelt&#x27;s rearmament campaign. The United States entered World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Following the attack, Warren organized the state&#x27;s civilian defense program, warning in January 1942 that &quot;the Japanese situation as it exists in this state today may well be the Achilles&#x27; heel of the entire civilian defense effort.&quot; He became a driving force behind the internment of over one hundred thousand Japanese Americans without any charges or due process.

Though the decision to intern Japanese Americans was made by General John L. DeWitt, and the internment was carried out by federal officials, Warren&#x27;s advocacy played a major role in providing public justification for the internment. In particular, Warren had claimed that Japanese Americans had willfully infiltrated &quot;every strategic spot&quot; in California coastal and valley counties, had warned of potentially greater danger from American born ethnic Japanese than from first-generation immigrants, and asserted that although there were means to test the loyalty of a &quot;Caucasian&quot; that the same could not be said for ethnic Japanese. Warren further argued that the complete lack of disloyal acts among Japanese Americans in California to date indicated that they intended to commit such acts in the future. Later, Warren vigorously protested the return of released internees back into California.

By early 1944, Warren had come to regret his role in the internment of Japanese Americans, and he eventually approved of the federal government&#x27;s decision to allow Japanese Americans to begin returning to California in December 1944; however, he long resisted any public expression of regret in spite of years of repeated requests from the Japanese American community.

In a 1972 oral history interview, Warren said that &quot;I feel that everybody who had anything to do with the relocation of the Japanese, after it was all over, had something of a guilty consciousness about it, and wanted to show that it wasn&#x27;t a racial thing as much as it was a defense matter.&quot; When during the interview Warren mentioned the faces of the children separated from their parents, he broke down in tears and the interview was temporarily halted. In 1974, shortly before his death, Warren privately confided to journalist and former internee Morse Saito that he greatly regretted his actions during the evacuation.

In his posthumously published memoirs, Warren fully acknowledged his error, stating that he

==Governor of California==
===Election===

Warren frequently clashed with Governor Culbert Olson over various issues, partly because they belonged to different parties. As early as 1939, supporters of Warren began making plans for his candidacy in California&#x27;s 1942 gubernatorial election. Though initially reluctant to run, Warren announced his gubernatorial candidacy in April 1942. He cross-filed in the Democratic and Republican primaries, ran without a party label, and refused to endorse candidates running for other offices. He sought to attract voters regardless of party, and stated &quot;I can and will support President Roosevelt better than Olson ever has or ever will.&quot; Many Democrats, including Olson, criticized Warren for &quot;put[ting] on a cloak of nonpartisanship,&quot; but Warren&#x27;s attempts to appear above parties resonated with many voters. In August, Warren easily won the Republican primary, and surprised many observers by nearly defeating Olson in the Democratic primary. In November, he decisively defeated Olson in the general election, taking just under 57 percent of the vote. Warren&#x27;s victory immediately made him a figure with national stature, and he enjoyed good relations with both the conservative wing of the Republican Party, led by Robert A. Taft, and the moderate wing of the Republican Party, led by Thomas E. Dewey.

===Policies===
Warren modernized the office of governor, and state government generally. Like most progressives, Warren believed in efficiency and planning. During World War II, he aggressively pursued postwar economic planning. Fearing another postwar decline that would rival the depression years, Governor Earl Warren initiated public works projects similar to those of the New Deal to capitalize on wartime tax surpluses and provide jobs for returning veterans. For example, his support of the Collier-Burns Act in 1947 raised gasoline taxes that funded a massive program of freeway construction. Unlike states where tolls or bonds funded highway construction, California&#x27;s gasoline taxes were earmarked for building the system. Warren&#x27;s support for the bill was crucial because his status as a popular governor strengthened his views, in contrast with opposition from trucking, oil, and gas lobbyists. The Collier-Burns Act helped influence passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, setting a pattern for national highway construction. In the mid-1940s, Warren sought to implement a state universal health care, but he was unable to pass his plan due to opposition from the medical and business communities. In 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco while Warren was the governor of California. He played an important role in the United Nations Conference on International Organization from April 25 to June 26, 1945, which resulted in the United Nations Charter.

Warren also pursued social legislation. He built up the state&#x27;s higher education system based on the University of California and its vast network of small universities and community colleges. After federal courts declared the segregation of Mexican schoolchildren illegal in &quot;Mendez v. Westminster&quot; (1947), Governor Warren signed legislation ending the segregation of American Indians and Asians. He sought the creation of a commission to study employment discrimination, but his plan was blocked by Republicans in the state legislature. Governor Warren stopped enforcing California&#x27;s anti-miscegenation law after it was declared unconstitutional in &quot;Perez v. Sharp&quot; (1948). He also improved the hospital and prison systems. These reforms provided new services to a fast-growing population; the 1950 Census showed that California&#x27;s population had grown by over 50% over the previous ten years.

===Re-election campaigns===

By 1946, California&#x27;s economy was booming, Warren was widely popular, and he enjoyed excellent relations with the state&#x27;s top Democratic officeholder, Attorney General Robert W. Kenny. At the urging of state party leaders, Kenny agreed to run against Warren in the 1946 gubernatorial election, but Kenny was reluctant to criticize his opponent and was distracted by his role in the Nuremberg trials. As in 1942, Warren refused to endorse candidates for other offices, and he sought to portray himself as an effective, nonpartisan governor. Warren easily won the Republican primary for governor and, in a much closer vote, defeated Kenny in the Democratic primary. After winning both primaries, Warren endorsed Republican William Knowland&#x27;s U.S. Senate candidacy and Goodwin Knight&#x27;s candidacy for lieutenant governor. Warren won the general election by an overwhelming margin, becoming the first Governor of California since Hiram Johnson in 1914 to win a second term.

Though he considered retiring after two terms, Warren ultimately chose to seek re-election in 1950, partly to prevent Knight from succeeding him. He easily won the Republican primary, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by James Roosevelt. Warren consistently led Roosevelt in general election polls and won re-election in a landslide, taking 65 percent of the vote. He was the first Governor of California elected to three consecutive terms. During the 1950 campaign, Warren refused to formally endorse Richard Nixon, the Republican nominee for the Senate. Warren disliked what he saw as Nixon&#x27;s ruthless approach to politics and was wary of having a conservative rival for leadership of the state party. Despite Warren&#x27;s refusal to campaign for him, Nixon defeated Democratic nominee Helen Gahagan Douglas by a decisive margin.

===National politics, 1942–1952===

After his election as governor, Warren emerged as a potential candidate for president or vice president in the 1944 election. Seeking primarily to ensure his status as the most prominent Republican in California, he ran as a favorite son candidate in the 1944 Republican primaries. Warren won the California primary with no opposition, but Thomas Dewey clinched the party&#x27;s presidential nomination by the time of the 1944 Republican National Convention. Warren delivered the keynote address of the convention, in which he called for a more liberal Republican Party. Dewey asked Warren to serve as his running mate, but Warren was uninterested in the vice presidency and correctly believed that Dewey would be defeated by President Roosevelt in the 1944 election.

After his 1946 re-election victory, Warren began planning a run for president in the 1948 election. The two front-runners for the nomination were Dewey and Robert Taft, but Warren, Harold Stassen, Arthur Vandenberg, and General Douglas MacArthur each had significant support. Prior to the 1948 Republican National Convention, Warren attempted to position himself as a dark horse candidate who might emerge as a compromise nominee. However, Dewey won the nomination on the third ballot of the convention. Dewey once again asked Warren to serve as his running mate, and this time Warren agreed. Far ahead in the polls against President Harry S. Truman, the Democratic nominee, Dewey ran a cautious campaign that largely focused on platitudes rather than issues. Warren campaigned across the country on behalf of the ticket, but was frustrated by his inability to support specific policies. To the surprise of many observers, Truman won the election, and this became the only election Warren ever lost.

After his 1950 re-election, Warren decided that he would seek the Republican nomination in the 1952 presidential election, and he announced his candidacy in November 1951. Taft also sought the nomination, but Dewey declined to make a third run for president. Dewey and his supporters instead conducted a long campaign to draft General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Republican presidential nominee. Warren ran in three Republican presidential primaries, but won just a handful of delegates outside of his home state. In the California primary, he defeated a challenge from Thomas H. Werdel, whose conservative backers alleged that Warren had &quot;abandoned Republicanism and embraced the objectives of the New Deal.&quot; After Eisenhower entered the race, Warren realized that his only hope of nomination was to emerge as a compromise nominee at the 1952 Republican National Convention after a deadlock between supporters of Eisenhower and Taft.

After the primaries, Warren had the support of 80 delegates, while Eisenhower and Taft each had about 450 delegates. Though the California delegation was pledged to support Warren, many of the delegates personally favored Eisenhower or Taft. Unknown to Warren, Eisenhower supporters had promised Richard Nixon the vice presidency if he could swing the California delegation to Eisenhower. By the time of the convention, Nixon and his supporters had convinced most California delegates to switch their votes to Eisenhower after the first presidential ballot. Eisenhower won 595 votes on the first presidential ballot of the convention, just 9 short of the majority. Before the official end of the first ballot, several states shifted their votes to Eisenhower, giving him the nomination. Warren&#x27;s decision to support a convention rule that unseated several contested delegations was critical to Eisenhower&#x27;s victory; Eisenhower himself said that &quot;if anyone ever clinched the nomination for me, it was Earl Warren.&quot; Nixon was named as Eisenhower&#x27;s running mate, and Warren campaigned on behalf of the Republican ticket in fourteen different states. Ultimately, Eisenhower defeated Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson II, taking 55 percent of the national popular vote. Nixon resigned from the Senate to become vice president, and Warren appointed Thomas Kuchel to the Senate seat vacated by Nixon.

==Chief Justice of the United States==

===Appointment===
After the 1952 election, President-elect Eisenhower promised that he would appoint Warren to the next vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. Warren turned down the position of Secretary of the Interior in the new administration, but in August 1953 he agreed to serve as the Solicitor General. In September 1953, before Warren&#x27;s nomination as solicitor general was announced, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson died. To fill the critical position of chief justice, Eisenhower first offered the position of chief justice to Thomas E. Dewey, but Dewey declined the offer. He then considered either elevating a sitting Supreme Court justice or appointing another individual with judicial experience but ultimately chose to honor his promise to appoint Warren to the first Supreme Court vacancy. Explaining Warren&#x27;s qualifications for the Court, Eisenhower wrote to his brother, &quot;Warren has had seventeen years of practice in public law, during which his record was one of remarkable accomplishment and success... He has been very definitely a liberal-conservative; he represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court.&quot;

Warren received a recess appointment in October 1953. In the winter of 1953–1954, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported him favorably by a 12–3 majority, with three southerners in James Eastland, Olin D. Johnston and Harley M. Kilgore reporting negatively. The Senate would then confirm Warren&#x27;s appointment by acclamation in March 1954; unlike the future appointments of John Marshall Harlan II and Potter Stewart (who ironically would prove the most conservative members of the Warren Court) southern senators made no effort to block Warren. As of 2024, Warren is the most recent chief justice to have held statewide elected office at any point in his career and the most recent serving politician to be appointed Chief Justice. Warren was also the first Scandinavian American to be appointed to the Supreme Court.

===Leadership and philosophy===
When Warren was appointed, all of the other Supreme Court justices had been appointed by Presidents Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman, and most were committed New Deal liberal Democrats. Nonetheless, they disagreed about the role that courts should play. Felix Frankfurter led a faction that insisted upon judicial self-restraint and deference to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction by agreeing the Court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy but favored a more activist role for the courts in matters related to individual liberties. Warren&#x27;s belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the Black and Douglas faction. William J. Brennan Jr. became the intellectual leader of the activist faction after he was appointed to the court by Eisenhower in 1956 and complemented Warren&#x27;s political skills by the strong legal skills that Warren lacked.

As chief justice, Warren&#x27;s most important prerogative was the power to assign opinions if he was in the majority. That power had a subtle but important role in shaping the Court&#x27;s majority opinions, since different justices would write different opinions. Warren initially asked the senior associate justice, Hugo Black, to preside over conferences until he became accustomed to the processes of the Court. However, Warren learned quickly and soon was in fact, as well as in name, the Court&#x27;s chief justice. Warren&#x27;s strength lay in his public gravitas, his leadership skills, and his firm belief that the Constitution guaranteed natural rights and that the Court had a unique role in protecting those rights. His arguments did not dominate judicial conferences, but Warren excelled at putting together coalitions and cajoling his colleagues in informal meetings.

Warren saw the US Constitution as the embodiment of American values, and he cared deeply about the ethical implications of the Court&#x27;s rulings. According to Justice Potter Stewart, Warren&#x27;s philosophical foundations were the &quot;eternal, rather bromidic, platitudes in which he sincerely believed&quot; and &quot;Warren&#x27;s great strength was his simple belief in the things we now laugh at: motherhood, marriage, family, flag, and the like.&quot; The constitutional historian Melvin I. Urofsky concludes that &quot;scholars agree that as a judge, Warren does not rank with Louis Brandeis, Black, or Brennan in terms of jurisprudence. His opinions were not always clearly written, and his legal logic was often muddled.&quot; Other scholars have also reached this conclusion.

===1950s===
====&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;====
Soon after joining the Court, Warren presided over the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which arose from the NAACP&#x27;s legal challenge against Jim Crow laws. The Southern United States had implemented Jim Crow laws in aftermath of the Reconstruction Era to disenfranchise African Americans and segregate public schools and other institutions. In the 1896 case of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, the Court had held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit segregation in public institutions if the institutions were &quot;separate but equal.&quot; In the decades after &quot;Plessy&quot;, the NAACP had won several incremental victories, but 17 states required the segregation of public schools by 1954. In 1951, the Vinson Court had begun hearing the NAACP&#x27;s legal challenge to segregated school systems but had not rendered a decision when Warren took office.

By the early 1950s, Warren had become personally convinced that segregation was morally wrong and legally indefensible. Warren sought not only to overturn &quot;Plessy&quot; but also to have a unanimous verdict. Warren, Black, Douglas, Burton, and Minton supported overturning the precedent, but for different reasons, Robert H. Jackson, Felix Frankfurter, Tom C. Clark, and Stanley Forman Reed were reluctant to overturn &quot;Plessy&quot;. Nonetheless, Warren won over Jackson, Frankfurter, and Clark, in part by allowing states and federal courts the flexibility to pursue desegregation of schools at different speeds. Warren extensively courted the last holdout, Reed, who finally agreed to join a unanimous verdict because he feared that a dissent would encourage resistance to the Court&#x27;s holding. After the Supreme Court formally voted to hold that the segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, Warren drafted an eight-page outline from which his law clerks drafted an opinion, and the Court handed down its decision in May 1954. In the Deep South at the time, people could view signs claiming &quot;Impeach Earl Warren.&quot;

====Other decisions and events====
In arranging a unanimous decision in &quot;Brown&quot;, Warren fully established himself as the leader of the Court. He also remained a nationally prominent figure. After a 1955 Gallup poll found that a plurality of Republican respondents favored Warren as the successor to Eisenhower, Warren publicly announced that he would not resign from the Court under any circumstance. Eisenhower seriously considered retiring after one term and encouraging Warren to run in the 1956 presidential election but ultimately chose to run after he had received a positive medical report after his heart attack. Despite that brief possibility, a split developed between Eisenhower and Warren, and some writers believe that Eisenhower once remarked that his appointment was &quot;the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made.&quot;

Meanwhile, many Southern politicians expressed outrage at the Court&#x27;s decisions and promised to resist any federal attempt to force desegregation, a strategy known as massive resistance. Although &quot;Brown&quot; did not mandate immediate school desegregation or bar other &quot;separate but equal&quot; institutions, most observers recognized that the decision marked the beginning of the end for the Jim Crow system. Throughout his years as chief justice, Warren succeeded in keeping decisions concerning segregation unanimous. &quot;Brown&quot; applied only to schools, but soon, the Court enlarged the concept to other state actions by striking down racial classification in many areas. Warren compromised by agreeing to Frankfurter&#x27;s demand for the Court to go slowly in implementing desegregation. Warren used Frankfurter&#x27;s suggestion for a 1955 decision (&quot;Brown II&quot;) to include the phrase &quot;all deliberate speed.&quot; In 1956, after the Montgomery bus boycott, the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court&#x27;s decision that segregated buses are unconstitutional. Two years later, Warren assigned Brennan to write the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;. Brennan held that state officials were legally bound to enforce the Court&#x27;s desegregation ruling in &quot;Brown&quot;.

In the 1956 term, the Warren Court received condemnation from right-wingers such as US Senator Joseph McCarthy by handing down a series of decisions, including &quot;Yates v. United States&quot;, which struck down laws designed to suppress communists and later led to the decline of McCarthyism. The Warren Court&#x27;s decisions on those cases represented a major shift from the Vinson Court, which had generally upheld such laws during the Second Red Scare. That same year, Warren was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1957, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===1960s===

After the Republican Party nominated Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, Warren privately supported the Democratic nominee, John F. Kennedy. They became personally close after Kennedy was inaugurated. Warren later wrote that &quot;no American during my long life ever set his sights higher for a better America or centered his attacks more accurately on the evils and shortcomings of our society than did [Kennedy].&quot; In 1962, Frankfurter retired and was replaced by Kennedy appointee Arthur Goldberg, which gave the liberal bloc a majority on the Court. Goldberg left the Court in 1965 but was replaced by Abe Fortas, who largely shared Goldberg&#x27;s judicial philosophy. With the liberal bloc firmly in control, the Warren Court handed down a series of momentous rulings in the 1960s.

====Bill of Rights====
The 1960s marked a major shift in constitutional interpretation, as the Warren Court continued the process of the incorporation of the Bill of Rights in which the provisions of the first ten amendments to the US Constitution were applied to the states. Warren saw the Bill of Rights as a codification of &quot;the natural rights of man&quot; against the government and believed that incorporation would bring the law &quot;into harmony with moral principles.&quot; When Warren took office, most of the provisions of the First Amendment already applied to the states, but the vast majority of the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government. The Warren Court saw the incorporation of the remaining provisions of the First Amendment as well as all or part of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. The Warren Court also handed down numerous other important decisions regarding the Bill of Rights, especially in the field of criminal procedure.

In &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, the Supreme Court reversed a libel conviction of the publisher of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. In the majority opinion, Brennan articulated the actual malice standard for libel against public officials, which has become an enduring part of constitutional law. In &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot;, the Court reversed the suspension of an eighth-grade student who wore a black armband in protest of the Vietnam War. Fortas&#x27;s majority opinion noted that students did not &quot;shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.&quot; The Court&#x27;s holding in &quot;United States v. Seeger&quot; expanded those who could be classified as conscientious objectors under the Selective Service System by allowing nonreligious individuals with ethical objections to claim conscientious objector status. Another case, &quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot;, saw the Court uphold a prohibition against burning draft-cards. Warren dissented in &quot;Street v. New York&quot; in which the Court struck down a state law that prohibited the desecration of the American flag. When his law clerks asked why he dissented in the case, Warren stated, &quot;Boys, it&#x27;s the American flag. I&#x27;m just not going to vote in favor of burning the American flag.&quot; In the 1969 case of &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, the Court held that governments cannot punish speech unless it is &quot;directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.&quot;

In 1962, &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; held that the Establishment Clause prohibits mandatory prayer in public school. The ruling sparked a strong backlash from many political and religious leaders, some of whom called for the impeachment of Warren. Warren became a favored target of right-wing groups, such as the John Birch Society, as well as the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater. &quot;Engel&quot;, the criminal procedure cases, and the persistent criticism of conservative politicians like Goldwater and Nixon contributed to a decline in the Court&#x27;s popularity in the mid- and the late 1960s. &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; had the Court strike down a state law designed to restrict access to contraception, and it established a constitutional right to privacy. &quot;Griswold&quot; later provided an important precedent for the case of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which disallowed many laws designed to restrict access to abortion.

====Criminal procedure====
In the early 1960s, the Court increasingly turned its attention to criminal procedure, which had traditionally been primarily a domain of the states. In &quot;Elkins v. United States&quot; (1960), Warren joined with the majority in striking down the &quot;Silver Platter Doctrine,&quot; a loophole to the exclusionary rule that had allowed federal officials to use evidence that had been illegally gathered by state officials. The next year, in &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition on &quot;unreasonable searches and seizures&quot; applied to state officials. Warren wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; (1968) in which the Court established that police officers may frisk a criminal suspect if they have a reasonable suspicion that the suspect is committing or is about to commit a crime. In &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; (1962), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment required states to furnish publicly funded attorneys to all criminal defendants accused of a felony and unable to afford counsel. Prior to &quot;Gideon&quot;, criminal defendants had been guaranteed the right to counsel only in federal trials and capital cases.

In &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot; (1964), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal suspects the right to speak to their counsel during police interrogations. &quot;Escobedo&quot; was limited to criminal suspects who had an attorney at the time of their arrest and requested to speak with that counsel. In the landmark case of &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, Warren wrote the majority opinion, which established a right to counsel for every criminal suspect and required police to give criminal suspects what became known as a &quot;Miranda warning&quot; in which suspects are notified of their right to an attorney and their right to silence. Warren incorporated some suggestions from Brennan, but his holding in &quot;Miranda&quot; was most influenced by his past experiences as a district attorney. Unlike many of the other Warren Court decisions, including &quot;Mapp&quot; and &quot;Gideon&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot; created standards that went far beyond anything that had been established by any of the states. &quot;Miranda&quot; received a strong backlash from law enforcement and political leaders. Conservatives angrily denounced what they called the &quot;handcuffing of the police.&quot;

====Reapportionment (one man, one vote)====
In 1959, several residents dissatisfied with Tennessee&#x27;s legislative districts brought suit against the state in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;. Like many other states, Tennessee had state legislative districts of unequal populations, and the plaintiffs sought more equitable legislative districts. In &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot; (1946), the Supreme Court had declined to become involved in legislative apportionment and instead left the issue as a matter for Congress and the states. In &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot; (1960), the Court struck down a redistricting plan designed to disenfranchise African-American voters, but many of the justices were reluctant to involve themselves further in redistricting. Frankfurter insisted that the Court should avoid the &quot;political thicket&quot; of apportionment and warned that the Court would never be able to find a clear formula to guide lower courts. Warren helped convince Associate Justice Potter Stewart to join Brennan&#x27;s majority decision in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;, which held that redistricting was not a political question and so federal courts had jurisdiction over the issue. The opinion did not directly require Tennessee to implement redistricting but instead left it to a federal district court to determine whether Tennessee&#x27;s districts violated the Constitution. In another case, &quot;Gray v. Sanders&quot;, the Court struck down Georgia&#x27;s County Unit System, which granted disproportional power to rural counties in party primaries. In a third case, &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot;, the Court required states to draw congressional districts of equal population.

In &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1963), the chief justice wrote what biographer Ed Cray terms &quot;the most influential of the 170 majority opinions [Warren] would write.&quot; While eight of the nine justices had voted to require congressional districts of equal population in &quot;Wesberry&quot;, some of the justices were reluctant to require state legislative districts to be of equal population. Warren indicated that the Equal Protection Clause required that state legislative districts be apportioned on an equal basis: &quot;legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.&quot; His holding upheld the principle of &quot;one man, one vote,&quot; which had previously been articulated by Douglas. After the decision, the states reapportioned their legislatures quickly and with minimal troubles. Numerous commentators have concluded reapportionment was the Warren Court&#x27;s great &quot;success story.&quot;

====Civil rights====
Civil rights continued to be a major issue facing the Warren Court in the 1960s. In &quot;Peterson v. Greenville&quot; (1963), Warren wrote the Court&#x27;s majority opinion, which struck down local ordinances that prohibited restaurants from serving black and white individuals in the same room. Later that decade, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States&quot;. The Court held that the Commerce Clause empowered the federal government to prohibit racial segregation in public accommodations like hotels. The ruling effectively overturned the 1883 &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; in which the Supreme Court had held that Congress could not regulate racial discrimination by private businesses. The Court upheld another landmark civil rights act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, by holding that it was valid under the authority provided to Congress by the Fifteenth Amendment.

In 1967, Warren wrote the majority opinion in the landmark case of &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; in which the Court struck down state laws banning interracial marriage. Warren was particularly pleased by the ruling in &quot;Loving&quot; since he had long regretted that the Court had not taken up the similar case of &quot;Naim v. Naim&quot; in 1955. In &quot;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections&quot; (1966), the Court struck down poll taxes in state elections. In another case, &quot;Bond v. Floyd&quot;, the Court required the Georgia legislature to seat the newly elected legislator Julian Bond; members of the legislature had refused to seat Bond because he opposed the Vietnam War.

====Warren Commission====

Shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the newly sworn-in president, Lyndon B. Johnson, convinced Warren to serve as the head of a bipartisan commission tasked with investigating the assassination. From December 1963 to October 1964, Warren simultaneously served as chief justice of the United States and chairman of the Warren Commission. Warren originally declined to head the Commission due to his belief that a sitting-Chief Justice should not be involved in non-judicial work, however when Johnson told him that he feared war would break out with the Soviet Union Warren changed his mind.

At the start of the investigation, Warren decided to hire the commission&#x27;s legal staff from outside the government to avoid any improper influence on their work.  Warren appointed Lee Rankin as general counsel and worked closely with Rankin and his assistants, Howard P. Willens and Norman Redlich, to recruit staff lawyers, supervise their investigation and publish the Commission&#x27;s report. To avoid the confusion and duplication of parallel investigations, Warren convinced the Texas authorities to defer any local inquiry into the assassination.

Warren was personally involved in several aspects of the investigation.  He supervised four days of testimony by Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s widow, Marina Oswald, and was widely criticized for telling the press that, although her testimony would be publicly disclosed, &quot;it might not be in your lifetime.&quot; He attended the closed-door interview of Jacqueline Kennedy and insisted on participating in the deposition of Jack Ruby in Dallas, where he visited the book depository. Warren also participated in the investigation of Kennedy&#x27;s medical treatment and autopsy. At Robert Kennedy&#x27;s insistence, Warren handled the unwelcome task of reviewing the autopsy photos alone.  Because the photos were so gruesome, Warren decided that they should not be included in the Commission&#x27;s records.

Warren closely supervised the drafting of the Commission&#x27;s report. He wanted to ensure that Commission members had ample opportunity to evaluate the staff&#x27;s work and to make their own judgments about important conclusions in the report. He insisted that the report should be unanimous and so he compromised on a number of issues to get all the members to sign the final version. Although a reenactment of the assassination &quot;produced convincing evidence&quot; supporting the single-bullet theory, the Commission decided not to take a position on the single-bullet theory. The Commission unanimously concluded that the assassination was the result of a single individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, who acted alone.

The Warren Commission was an unhappy experience for the chief justice. As Willens recalled, &quot;One can&#x27;t say too much about the Chief&#x27;s sacrifice. The work was a drain on his physical well-being.&quot; However, Warren always believed that the Commission&#x27;s primary conclusion, that Oswald acted alone, was correct. In his memoirs, Warren wrote that Oswald was incapable of being the key operative in a conspiracy, and that any high-level government conspiracy would inevitably have been discovered. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine quoted Warren saying that, if he handled the Oswald case as a district attorney, &quot;I could have gotten a conviction in two days and never heard about the case again.&quot; Warren wrote that &quot;the facts of the assassination itself are simple, so simple that many people believe it must be more complicated and conspiratorial to be true.&quot; Warren told the Commission staff not to worry about conspiracy theories and other criticism of the report because “history will prove us right.”

===Retirement===
By 1968, Warren was ready to retire from the Court. He hoped to travel the world with his wife, and he wanted to leave the bench before he suffered a mental decline, something that he perceived in both Hugo Black and William Douglas. He also feared that Nixon would win the 1968 presidential election and appoint a conservative successor if Warren left the Court later. On June 13, 1968, Warren submitted his letter of resignation to President Johnson (who made it official on June 21), effective upon the confirmation of a successor. In an election year, confirmation of a successor was not assured; after Warren announced his retirement, about half of the Senate Republican caucus pledged to oppose any Supreme Court appointment prior to the election.

Johnson nominated Associate Justice Fortas, a personal friend and adviser to the president, as Warren&#x27;s successor, and nominated federal appellate judge Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas. Republicans and Southern Democrats joined to scuttle Fortas&#x27;s nomination. Their opposition centered on criticism of the Warren Court, including many decisions that had been handed down before Fortas joined the Court, as well as ethical concerns related to Fortas&#x27;s paid speeches and closeness with Johnson. Though the majority of the Senate may have favored the confirmation of Fortas, opponents conducted a filibuster, which blocked the Senate from voting on the nomination, and Johnson withdrew the nomination. In early 1969, Warren learned that Fortas had made a secret lifetime contract for $20,000 a year to provide private legal advice to Louis Wolfson, a friend and financier in deep legal trouble. Warren immediately asked Fortas to resign, which he did after some consideration.

Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 presidential election and took office in January 1969. Though reluctant to be succeeded by a Nixon appointee, Warren declined to withdraw his letter of resignation. He believed that withdrawing the letter would be &quot;a crass admission that he was resigning for political reasons.&quot; Nixon and Warren jointly agreed that Warren would retire in June 1969 to ensure that the Court would have a chief justice throughout the 1968 term and to allow Nixon to focus on other matters in the first months of his presidency. Nixon did not solicit Warren&#x27;s opinion regarding the next chief justice and ultimately appointed the conservative federal appellate judge Warren E. Burger. Warren later regretted his decision to retire and reflected, &quot;If I had ever known what was going to happen to this country and this Court, I never would have resigned. They would have had to carry me out of there on a plank.&quot; In addition, he later remarked on his retirement and on the Warren Court, &quot;I would like the Court to be remembered as the people&#x27;s court.&quot;

==Final years and death==
After stepping down from the Court, Warren began working on his memoirs and took numerous speaking engagements. He also advocated for an end to the Vietnam War and the elimination of poverty. He avoided publicly criticizing the Burger Court, but was privately distressed by the Court&#x27;s increasingly conservative holdings. He closely followed investigations into the Watergate scandal, a major political scandal that stemmed from a break-in of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s headquarters and the Nixon administration&#x27;s subsequent attempts to cover up that break-in. Warren continued to hold Nixon in low regard, privately stating that Nixon was &quot;perhaps the most despicable president that this country has ever had.&quot;

Five years into retirement, Warren died due to cardiac arrest at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., at 8:10 p.m. on July 9, 1974, at the age of 83. He had been hospitalized since July 2 due to congestive heart failure and coronary insufficiency. On that same day, he was visited by Justices Brennan and Douglas, until 5:30 p.m. Warren could not resist asking his friends whether the Court would order President Nixon to release the sixty-four tapes demanded by the Watergate investigation. Both justices assured him that the court had voted unanimously in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot; for the release of the tapes. Relieved, Warren died just a few hours later, safe in the knowledge that the Court he had so loved would force justice on the man who had been his most bitter foe.

Warren had his wife and one of his daughters, Nina Elizabeth Brien, at his bedside when he died. After he lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building, his funeral was held at Washington National Cathedral, and he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. The only other former governor of California whose final funeral services did not take place in California would be Ronald Reagan, who became President of the United States and whose final funeral service also took place at Washington National Cathedral.

===Historical reputation===

Warren is generally considered to be one of the most influential U.S. Supreme Court justices, as well as political leaders in the history of the United States. The Warren Court has been recognized by many to have created a liberal &quot;Constitutional Revolution&quot;, which embodied a deep belief in equal justice, freedom, democracy, and human rights. In July 1974, after Warren died, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that &quot;Mr. Warren ranked with John Marshall and Roger Taney as one of the three most important chief justices in the nation&#x27;s history.&quot; In December 2006, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; cited Earl Warren as the 29th most influential person in the history of the United States and the second most influential Chief Justice, after John Marshall. In September 2018, &quot;The Economist&quot; named Warren as &quot;the 20th century&#x27;s most consequential American jurist&quot; and one of &quot;the 20th century&#x27;s greatest liberal jurists&quot;.

President Harry S. Truman wrote in his tribute to Warren, which appeared in the &quot;California Law Review&quot; in 1970, &quot;[t]he Warren record as Chief Justice has stamped him in the annals of history as the man who read and interpreted the Constitution in relation to its ultimate intent. He sensed the call of the times-and he rose to the call.&quot; Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas wrote, in the same article, &quot;in my view [Warren] will rank with Marshall and Hughes in the broad sweep of United States history&quot;. According to biographer Ed Cray, Warren was &quot;second in greatness only to John Marshall himself in the eyes of most impartial students of the Court as well as the Court&#x27;s critics.&quot; Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Lewis described Warren as &quot;the closest thing the United States has had to a Platonic Guardian&quot;. In 1958, Martin Luther King Jr. sent one copy of his newly published book, &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot;, to Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing on the first free end page: &quot;To: Justice Earl Warren. In appreciation for your genuine good-will, your great humanitarian concern, and your unswerving devotion to the sublime principles of our American democracy. With warm Regards, Martin L. King Jr.&quot; The book remained with Warren&#x27;s family until 2015, when it was auctioned online for US$49,335 (including the buyer&#x27;s premium).

Warren&#x27;s critics found him a boring person. Dennis J. Hutchinson wrote: &quot;Although Warren was an important and courageous figure and although he inspired passionate devotion among his followers...he was a dull man and a dull judge.&quot; Conservatives attacked the Warren Court&#x27;s rulings as inappropriate and have called for courts to be deferential to the elected political branches. In his 1977 book &quot;Government by Judiciary&quot;, originalist and legal scholar Raoul Berger accuses the Warren Court of overstepping its authority by interpreting the 14th Amendment in a way contrary to the original intent of its draftsmen and framers in order to achieve results that it found desirable as a matter of public policy.

Overall, law professor Justin Driver divides interpretations of the Warren Court into three main groups: conservatives such as Robert Bork who attack the Court as &quot;a legislator of policy...that was not theirs to make&quot;, liberals such as Morton Horwitz who strongly approve of the Court, and liberals such as Cass Sunstein who largely approve of the Court&#x27;s overall legacy but believe that it went too far in making policy in some cases. Driver offers a fourth view, arguing that the Warren Court took overly conservative stances in such cases as &quot;Powell v. Texas&quot; and &quot;Hoyt v. Florida&quot;. As for the legacy of the Warren Court, Chief Justice Burger, who succeeded Earl Warren in 1969, proved to be quite ineffective at consolidating conservative control over the Court, so the Warren Court legacy continued in many respects until about 1986, when William Rehnquist became chief justice and took firmer control of the agenda. Even the more conservative Rehnquist Court refrained from expressly overturning major Warren Court cases such as &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Gideon&quot;, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;. On occasion, the Rehnquist Court expanded Warren Court precedents, such as in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, where the Rehnquist Court applied the principles of 1960s voting rights cases to invalidate Florida&#x27;s recount in the 2000 U.S. presidential election.

===Memorials and honors===

Earl Warren was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1981. He was also honored by the United States Postal Service with a 29¢ Great Americans series postage stamp. In December 2007, Warren was inducted into the California Hall of Fame. An extensive collection of Warren&#x27;s papers, including case files from his Supreme Court service, is located at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Most of the collection is open for research.

On the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, Warren&#x27;s alma mater, &quot;Earl Warren Hall&quot; is named after him. In addition, the UC Berkeley School of Law has established &quot;The Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity and Diversity&quot;, or &quot;Warren Institute&quot; for short, in memory of Earl Warren, while the &quot;Warren Room&quot; inside the Law Building was also named in his honor.

In 2016 the United States Navy named the support ship in his honour.
