<text>The Compact Cassette, also commonly called a cassette tape, audio cassette, or simply tape or cassette, is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback. Invented by Lou Ottens and his team at the Dutch company Philips, the Compact Cassette was released in August 1963. 

Compact Cassettes come in two forms, either containing content as a prerecorded cassette (&quot;Musicassette&quot;), or as a fully recordable &quot;blank&quot; cassette. Both forms have two sides and are reversible by the user. 

Although other tape cassette formats have also existed—for example the Microcassette—the generic term &quot;cassette tape&quot; is normally used to refer to the Compact Cassette because of its ubiquity.

Compact Cassettes contain two miniature spools, between which the magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound—essentially miniaturizing reel-to-reel audio tape and enclosing it, with its reels, in a small case (cartridge)—hence &quot;cassette&quot;. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell which is at its largest dimensions. The tape itself is commonly referred to as &quot;eighth-inch&quot; tape, supposedly wide, but actually slightly larger, at . Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks are available on the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette when the tape comes to an end, or by the reversal of tape movement, known as &quot;auto-reverse&quot;, when the mechanism detects that the tape has ended.

==History==

===Precursors===
After the Second World War, magnetic tape recording technology proliferated across the world. In the United States, Ampex, using equipment obtained in Germany as a starting point, began commercial production of reel-to-reel tape recorders. First used by broadcast studios to pre-record radio programs, tape recorders quickly found their way into schools and homes. By 1953, one million US homes had tape machines, and several major record labels were releasing select titles on prerecorded reel-to-reel tapes.

In 1958, following four years of development, RCA introduced the RCA tape cartridge, which enclosed 60 minutes (30 minutes per side) of stereo quarter-inch reel-to-reel tape within a plastic cartridge that could be utilized on a compatible tape recorder/player without having to thread the tape through the machine. This format was not very successful, and RCA discontinued it in 1964.

===Development and release===
In the early 1960s Philips tasked two different teams to design a high-quality tape cartridge for home use, utilizing thinner and narrower tape compared to what was used in reel-to-reel tape recorders. A team at its Vienna factory, which had experience with dictation machines, developed the &quot;Einloch-Kassette&quot;, or single-hole cassette with involvement from Grundig. At the same time, a team in Hasselt led by Lou Ottens developed a two-hole cassette under the name &quot;Pocket Recorder&quot;.

Philips selected the two-spool cartridge as a winner and introduced the 2-track 2-direction mono version in Europe on 28 August 1963 at the Berlin Radio Show, and in the United States (under the &quot;Norelco&quot; brand) in November 1964. The same year, mass production of blank compact cassettes began in Hanover. Philips also offered a machine to play and record the cassettes, the Philips &quot;Typ EL 3300&quot;. An updated model, &quot;Typ EL 3301&quot; was offered in the US in November 1964 as Norelco &quot;Carry-Corder 150&quot;. The trademark name &quot;Compact Cassette&quot; came a year later.

Following rejection of the &quot;Einloch-Kassette&quot;, Grundig developed the DC-International (DC standing for &quot;Double Cassette&quot;) based on drawings of the Compact Cassette, introducing it in 1965 as companies were competing to establish their format as the worldwide standard. After yielding to pressure from Sony to license the Compact Cassette format to them free of charge, Philips&#x27; format achieved market dominance, with the DC-International cassette format being discontinued in 1967, just two years after its introduction.

Philips improved on the Compact Cassette&#x27;s original design to release a stereo version. By 1966 over 250,000 compact cassette recorders had been sold in the US alone and Japanese manufacturers soon became the leading source of recorders. By 1968, 85 manufacturers had sold over 2.4 million mono and stereo units. By the end of the 1960s, the cassette business was worth an estimated 150 million dollars, and by the early 1970s compact cassette machines were outselling other types of tape machines by a large margin.

===Popularity of music cassettes===
Prerecorded music cassettes (also known as &quot;Music-Cassettes&quot;, and later just Musicassettes) were launched in Europe in late 1965. The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced Musicassettes to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.

The compact cassette format, however, was initially designed for dictation and portable use, and the audio quality of early players was not well-suited for music. In 1971, the Advent Corporation introduced their Model 201 tape deck that combined Dolby type B noise reduction and chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) tape, with a commercial-grade tape transport mechanism supplied by the Wollensak camera division of 3M Corporation. This resulted in the format being taken more seriously for musical use, and started the era of high fidelity cassettes and players.

British record labels began releasing Musicassettes in October 1967, and they exploded as a mass-market medium after the first Walkman, the TPS-L2, went on sale on 1 July 1979, as cassettes provided portability, which vinyl records could not. While portable radios and boom boxes had been around for some time, the Walkman was the first truly personal portable music player, one that not only allowed users to listen to music away from home, but to do so in private. According to the technology news website The Verge, &quot;the world changed&quot; on the day the TPS-L2 was released. Stereo tape decks and boom boxes became some of the most highly sought-after consumer products of both decades, as the ability of users to take their music with them anywhere with ease led to its popularity around the globe.
Like the transistor radio in the 1950s and 1960s, the portable CD player in the 1990s, and the MP3 player in the 2000s, the Walkman defined the portable music market for the decade of the &#x27;80s, with cassette sales overtaking those of LPs. Total vinyl record sales remained higher well into the 1980s due to greater sales of singles, although cassette singles achieved popularity for a period in the 1990s. Another barrier to cassettes overtaking vinyl in sales was shoplifting; compact cassettes were small enough that a thief could easily place one inside a pocket and walk out of a shop without being noticed. To prevent this, retailers in the US would place cassettes inside oversized &quot;spaghetti box&quot; containers or locked display cases, either of which would significantly inhibit browsing, thus reducing cassette sales. 

During the early 1980s some record labels sought to solve this problem by introducing new, larger packages for cassettes which would allow them to be displayed alongside vinyl records and compact discs, or giving them a further market advantage over vinyl by adding bonus tracks. Willem Andriessen wrote that the development in technology allowed &quot;hardware designers to discover and satisfy one of the collective desires of human beings all over the world, independent of region, climate, religion, culture, race, sex, age and education: the desire to enjoy music at any time, at any place, in any desired sound quality and almost at any wanted price&quot;. Critic Robert Palmer, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1981, cited the proliferation of personal stereos as well as extra tracks not available on LP as reasons for the surge in popularity of cassettes.

Cassettes&#x27; ability to allow users to record content in public also led to a boom in bootleg cassettes made at live shows in the 1980s. The Walkman dominated the decade, selling up to 350 million units. So synonymous did the name &quot;Walkman&quot; become with all portable music players—with a German dictionary at one point defining the term as such without reference to Sony—that the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that Sony, which had not sought to have the publisher of that dictionary retract that definition, could not prevent other companies from using that name, as it had now become genericized. As a result of this, a number of Sony&#x27;s competitors produced their own version of the Walkman. Others made their own branded tape players, like JVC, Panasonic, Sharp, and Aiwa, the second-largest producer of the devices.

Between 1985, when cassettes overtook vinyl, and 1992, when they were overtaken by CDs (introduced in 1983 as a format that offered greater storage capacity and more accurate sound), the cassette tape was the most popular format in the United States and the UK. Record labels experimented with innovative packaging designs. A designer during the era explained: &quot;There was so much money in the industry at the time, we could try anything with design.&quot; The introduction of the cassette single, called a &quot;cassingle&quot;, was also part of this era and featured a music single in Compact Cassette form. Until 2005, cassettes remained the dominant medium for purchasing and listening to music in some developing countries, but compact disc (CD) technology had superseded the Compact Cassette in the vast majority of music markets throughout the world by this time.

===Cassette culture===
Compact cassettes served as catalysts for social change. Their small size, durability and ease of copying helped bring underground rock and punk music behind the Iron Curtain, creating a foothold for Western culture among the younger generations. Likewise, in Egypt cassettes empowered an unprecedented number of people to create culture, circulate information, and challenge ruling regimes before the internet became publicly accessible.
One of the political uses of cassette tapes was the dissemination of sermons by the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini throughout Iran before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, in which Khomeini urged the overthrow of the regime of the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. During the military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990) a &quot;cassette culture&quot; emerged where blacklisted music or music that was by other reasons not available as records was shared. Some pirate cassette producers created brands such as &quot;Cumbre y Cuatro&quot; that have in retrospect received praise for their contributions to popular music. Armed groups such as Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) made use of cassettes to spread their messages.

Cassette technology was a booming market for pop music in India, drawing criticism from conservatives while at the same time creating a huge market for legitimate recording companies, as well as pirated tapes. Some sales channels were associated with cassettes: in Spain filling stations often featured a display selling cassettes. While offering also mainstream music these cassettes became associated with genres such as Gipsy rhumba, light music and joke tapes that were common in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Decline===
Despite sales of CDs overtaking those of prerecorded cassettes in the early 1990s in the U.S., the format remained popular for specific applications, such as car audio, personal stereos, boomboxes, telephone answering machines, dictation, field recording, home recording, and mixtapes well into the decade. Cassette players were typically more resistant to shocks than CD players, and their lower fidelity was not considered a serious drawback in mobile use. With the introduction of electronic skip protection it became possible to use portable CD players on the go, and automotive CD players became viable. CD-R drives and media also became affordable for consumers around the same time.

By 1993, annual shipments of CD players had reached 5 million, up 21% from the year before; while cassette player shipments had dropped 7% to approximately 3.4 million. Sales of pre-recorded music cassettes in the US dropped from 442 million in 1990 to 274,000 by 2007. For audiobooks, the final year that cassettes represented more than 50% of total market sales was 2002 when they were replaced by CDs as the dominant media.

The last new car with an available cassette player was a 2014 TagAZ AQUiLA. Four years prior, Sony had stopped the production of personal cassette players. In 2011, the Oxford English Dictionary removed the phrase &quot;cassette player&quot; from its 12th edition Concise version, which prompted some media sources to mistakenly report that the term &quot;cassette tape&quot; was being removed.

In India, music continued to be released on the cassette format due to its low cost until 2009.

===21st century===
Although portable digital recorders are most common today, analog tape remains a desirable option for certain artists and consumers. Underground and DIY communities release regularly, and sometimes exclusively, on cassette format, particularly in experimental music circles and to a lesser extent in hardcore punk, death metal, and black metal circles, out of a fondness for the format. Even among major-label stars, the form has at least one devotee: Thurston Moore stated in 2009, &quot;I only listen to cassettes.&quot; By 2019, few companies still made cassettes. Among those are National Audio Company, from the US, and Mulann, also known as Recording The Masters, from France.

Sony announced the end of cassette Walkman production on 22 October 2010, a result of the emergence of MP3 players such as Apple&#x27;s iPod. As of 2022, Sony uses the Walkman brand solely for its line of digital media players.

In 2010, Botswana-based Diamond Studios announced plans for establishing a plant to mass-produce cassettes in a bid to combat piracy. It opened in 2011.

In South Korea, the early English education boom for toddlers encourages a continuous demand for English language cassettes, due to the affordable cost.

National Audio Company in Missouri, the largest of the few remaining manufacturers of audio cassettes in the US, oversaw the mass production of the &quot;Awesome Mix #1&quot; cassette from the film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; in 2014. They reported that they had produced more than 10 million tapes in 2014 and that sales were up 20 percent the following year, their best year since they opened in 1969. In 2016, cassette sales in the United States rose by 74% to 129,000. In 2018, following several years of shortage, National Audio Company began producing their own magnetic tape, becoming the world&#x27;s first known manufacturer of an all-new tape stock. Mulann, a company which acquired Pyral/RMGI in 2015 and originates from BASF, also started production of its new cassette tape stock in 2018, basing on reel tape formula.

In Japan and South Korea, the pop acts Seiko Matsuda, SHINee, and NCT 127 released their material on limited-run cassettes. In Reiwa era Japan, the revived popularity of cassette tapes is an example of Showa retro. As of 2021, Maxell was selling 8 million cassette tapes per year in Japan.

In the mid-to-late 2010s, cassette sales saw a modest resurgence concurrent with the vinyl revival. As early as 2015, the retail chain Urban Outfitters, which had long sold LPs, started selling new pre-recorded cassettes (both new and old albums), blank cassettes, and players. In 2016, cassette sales increased, a trend that continued in 2017 and 2018. In the UK, sales of cassette tapes in 2021 reached its highest number since 2003.

Cassettes are favored by some artists and listeners, including those of older genres of music such as dansband, as well as independent and underground artists, some of whom were releasing new music on tape by the 2020s, including Britney Spears and Busta Rhymes. Reasons cited for this include tradition, low cost, the DIY ease of use, and a nostalgic fondness for how the format&#x27;s imperfections lend greater vibrancy to low-fi, experimental music, despite the lack of the &quot;full-bodied richness&quot; of vinyl.

== Tape types ==

Cassette tapes are made of a polyester-type plastic film with a magnetic coating. The original magnetic material was based on gamma ferric oxide (Fe2O3). , 3M Company developed a cobalt &quot;volume-doping&quot; process combined with a double-coating technique to enhance overall tape output levels. This product was marketed as &quot;High Energy&quot; under its Scotch brand of recording tapes. Inexpensive cassettes commonly are labeled &quot;low-noise&quot;, but typically are not optimized for high frequency response. For this reason, some low-grade IEC Type I tapes have been marketed specifically as better suited for data storage than for sound recording.

In 1968, DuPont, the inventor of a chromium dioxide (CrO2) manufacturing process, began commercialization of CrO2 media. The first CrO2 cassette was introduced in 1970 by Advent, and later strongly backed by BASF, the inventor and longtime manufacturer of magnetic recording tape. Next, coatings using magnetite (Fe3O4) such as TDK&#x27;s Audua were produced in an attempt to approach or exceed the sound quality of vinyl records. Cobalt-&quot;adsorbed&quot; iron oxide (Avilyn) was introduced by TDK in 1974 and proved very successful. &quot;Type IV&quot; tapes using pure metal particles (as opposed to oxide formulations) were introduced in 1979 by 3M under the trade name Metafine. The tape coating on most cassettes sold as of 2024 are either &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;chrome&quot; consists of ferric oxide and cobalt mixed in varying ratios (and using various processes); there are very few cassettes on the market that use a pure (CrO2) coating.

Simple voice recorders and earlier cassette decks are designed to work with standard ferric formulations. Newer tape decks usually are built with switches and later detectors for the different bias and equalization requirements for higher grade tapes. The most common are iron oxide tapes (as defined by the IEC 60094 standard).

Notches on top of the cassette shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of the cassette shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization.

==Features==

The cassette was the next step following reel-to-reel audio tape recording, although, because of the limitations of the cassette&#x27;s size and speed, it initially compared poorly in quality. Unlike the 4-track stereo open-reel format, the two stereo tracks of each side lie adjacent to each other, rather than being interleaved with the tracks of the other side. This permitted monaural cassette players to play stereo recordings &quot;summed&quot; as mono tracks and permitted stereo players to play mono recordings through both speakers. The tape is wide, with each mono track wide, plus an unrecorded guard band between each track. In stereo, each track is further divided into a left and a right channel of each, with a gap of . The tape moves past the playback head at , the speed being a continuation of the increasingly slower speed series in open-reel machines operating at 30, 15, , or inches per second. For comparison, the typical open-reel -inch 4-track consumer format used tape that is wide, each track wide, and running at either twice or four times the speed of a cassette.

Very simple cassette recorders for dictation purposes did not tightly control tape speed and relied on playback on a similar device to maintain intelligible recordings. For accurate reproduction of music, a tape transport incorporating a capstan and pinch roller system was used, to ensure tape passed over the record/playback heads at a constant speed. 

=== Locating write-protect notches ===
If the cassette is held with one of the labels facing the user and the tape opening at the bottom, the write-protect notch for the corresponding side is at the top-left.

=== Tape length ===

Tape length usually is measured in minutes of total playing time. Many of the varieties of blank tape were C60 (30 minutes per side), C90 (45 minutes per side) and C120 (60 minutes per side). Maxell makes 150-minute cassettes (UR-150) - 75 minutes per side. The C46 and C60 lengths typically are thick, but C90s are and (the less common) C120s are just thick, rendering them more susceptible to stretching or breakage. Even C180 tapes were available at one point.

Other lengths are (or were) also available from some vendors, including C10, C12 and C15 (useful for saving data from early home computers and in telephone answering machines), C30, C40, C50, C54, C64, C70, C74, C80, C84, C94, C100, C105, C110, and C150. As late as 2010, Thomann still offered C10, C20, C30 and C40 IEC Type II tape cassettes for use with 4- and 8-track portastudios.

=== Track width ===
The full tape width is 3.8 mm. For mono recording the track width is 1.5 mm. In stereo mode each channel has width of 0.6 mm with a 0.3 mm separation to avoid crosstalk.

=== Head gap ===
The head-gap width is 2 μm which gives a theoretical maximum frequency of about 12 kHz (at the standard speed of 1 7/8 ips or 4.76 cm/s). A narrower gap would give a higher frequency limit but also weaker magnetization.

=== Cassette tape adapter ===
Cassette tape adapters allow external audio sources to be played back from any tape player, but were typically used for car audio systems. An attached audio cable with a phone connector converts the electrical signals to be read by the tape head, while mechanical gears simulate reel to reel movement without actual tapes when driven by the player mechanism.

===Optional mechanical elements===

In order to wind up the tape more reliably, the former BASF (from 1998 EMTEC) patented the Special Mechanism or Security Mechanism advertised with the abbreviation SM in the early 1970s, which was temporarily used under license by Agfa. This feature each includes a rail to guide the tape to the spool and prevent an unclean roll from forming.

===Flaws===
Magnetic tape is not an ideal medium for long-term archival storage, as it begins to degrade after 10 – 20 years, with some experts estimating its lifespan to be no more than 30 years.

A common mechanical problem occurs when a defective player or resistance in the tape path causes insufficient tension on the take-up spool. This would cause the magnetic tape to be fed out through the bottom of the cassette and become tangled in the mechanism of the player. In these cases, the player was said to have &quot;eaten&quot; or &quot;chewed&quot; the tape, often destroying the playability of the cassette.

==Cassette players and recorders==

The first cassette machines (e.g. the Philips EL 3300, introduced in August 1963)

One innovation was the front-loading arrangement. Pioneer&#x27;s angled cassette bay and the exposed bays of some Sansui models eventually were standardized as a front-loading door into which a cassette would be loaded. Later models would adopt electronic buttons, and replace conventional meters (which could be driven over full scale when overloaded, a condition called &quot;pegging the needle&quot; or simply &quot;pegging&quot;) with electronic LED or vacuum fluorescent displays, with level controls typically being controlled by either rotary controls or side-by-side sliders. BIC and Marantz briefly offered models that could be run at double speeds, but Nakamichi was widely recognized as one of the first companies to create decks that rivaled reel-to-reel decks with full 20–20,000 Hz frequency response, low noise, and very low wow and flutter.

Different interpretations of the cassette standard resulted in a 4 dB ambiguity at 16 kHz. Technically, both camps in this debate were still within the original cassette specification as no tolerance for frequency response is provided above 12.5 kHz and all calibration tones above 12.5 kHz are considered optional. Decreasing noise at 16 kHz also decreases the maximum signal level at 16 kHz, the High-Frequency Dynamics stay almost constant.

A third company, Bang &amp; Olufsen of Denmark, created the Dolby HX &quot;head room extension&quot; system for reliably reducing tape saturation effects at high frequencies while maintaining higher bias levels.

Note the upper-left which has a built-in CRT television for receiving analog television broadcasts]]

Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto manufacturers in the US typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation would have a Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track player obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, as the cost of building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no American manufacturer offered factory-installed cassette players.


==Applications==

===Audio===
The Compact Cassette originally was intended for use in dictation machines. In this capacity, some later-model cassette-based dictation machines could also run the tape at half speed (15⁄16 in/s) as playback quality was not critical. The cassette soon became a medium for distributing prerecorded music—initially through the Philips Record Company (and subsidiary labels Mercury and Philips in the US). As of 2009, one still found cassettes used for a variety of purposes, such as journalism, oral history, meeting and interview transcripts, audio books, and so on. Police are still big buyers of cassette tapes, as some lawyers &quot;don&#x27;t trust digital technology for interviews&quot;. However, they are starting to give way to Compact Discs and more &quot;compact&quot; digital storage media. Prerecorded cassettes were also employed as a way of providing chemotherapy information to recently diagnosed cancer patients as studies found anxiety and fear often gets in the way of the information processing.

The cassette quickly found use in the commercial music industry. One artifact found on some commercially produced music cassettes was a sequence of test tones, called SDR (Super Dynamic Range, also called XDR, or eXtended Dynamic Range) soundburst tones, at the beginning and end of the tape, heard in order of low frequency to high. These were used during SDR/XDR&#x27;s duplication process to gauge the quality of the tape medium. Many consumers objected to these tones since they were not part of the recorded music.

===Multitrack recording===
Multitrack recorders utilizing the compact cassette were introduced beginning in 1979 with the TEAC 144 Portastudio. In the simplest configuration, rather than playing a pair of stereo channels of each side of the cassette, the typical portastudio used a four-track tape head assembly to access four tracks on the cassette at once (with the tape playing in one direction). Each track could be recorded to, erased, or played back individually, allowing musicians to overdub themselves and create simple multitrack recordings easily, which could then be mixed down to a finished stereo version on an external machine. To increase audio quality in these recorders, the tape speed sometimes was doubled to 3 inches per second, in comparison to the standard 17⁄8 ips; additionally, dbx, Dolby B or Dolby C noise reduction provided compansion (compression of the signal during recording with equal and opposite expansion of the signal during playback), which yields increased dynamic range by lowering the noise level and increasing the maximum signal level before distortion occurs. Multi-track cassette recorders with built-in mixer and signal routing features ranged from easy-to-use beginner units up to professional-level recording systems. Cassette-based multitrack recorders are credited with launching the home recording revolution.

===Home dubbing===
Most cassettes were sold blank, and used for recording (dubbing) the owner&#x27;s records (as backup, to play in the car, or to make mixtape compilations), their friends&#x27; records, or music from the radio. This practice was condemned by the music industry with such alarmist slogans as &quot;Home Taping Is Killing Music&quot;. However, many claimed that the medium was ideal for spreading new music and would increase sales, and strongly defended their right to copy at least their own records onto tape. For a limited time in the early 1980s Island Records sold chromium dioxide &quot;One Plus One&quot;

Various legal cases arose surrounding the dubbing of cassettes. In the UK, in the case of &quot;CBS Songs v. Amstrad&quot; (1988), the House of Lords found in favor of Amstrad that producing equipment that facilitated the dubbing of cassettes, in this case a high-speed twin cassette deck that allowed one cassette to be copied directly onto another, did not constitute copyright infringement by the manufacturer. In a similar case, a shop owner who rented cassettes and sold blank tapes was not liable for copyright infringement even though it was clear that his customers likely were dubbing them at home. In both cases, the courts held that manufacturers and retailers could not be held accountable for the actions of consumers.

As an alternative to home dubbing, in the late 1980s, the Personics company installed booths in record stores across America that allowed customers to make personalized mixtapes from a digitally encoded back-catalogue with customised printed covers.

===Data recording ===

Floppy disk storage had become the standard data storage medium in the United States by the mid-1980s; for example, by 1983 the majority of software sold by Atari Program Exchange was on floppy. Cassette remained more popular for 8-bit computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX, and Amstrad CPC 464 in many countries such as the United Kingdom (where 8-bit software was mostly sold on cassette until that market disappeared altogether in the early 1990s). Reliability of cassettes for data storage is inconsistent, with many users recalling repeated attempts to load video games; the Commodore Datasette used very reliable, but slow, digital encoding. In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary, and the Netherlands, cassette data storage was so popular that some radio stations would broadcast computer programs that listeners could record onto cassette and then load into their computer. See BASICODE.

The cassette was adapted into what is called a streamer cassette (also known as a &quot;D/CAS&quot; cassette), a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with the other side of the top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 250 kilobytes to 600 megabytes of data.

==Rivals and successors==
Technical development of the cassette effectively ceased when digital recordable media, such as DAT and MiniDisc, were introduced in the late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, with Dolby S recorders marking the peak of Compact Cassette technology. Anticipating the switch from analog to digital format, major companies, such as Sony, shifted their focus to new media. In 1992, Philips introduced the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), a DAT-like tape in almost the same shell as a Compact Cassette. It was aimed primarily at the consumer market. A DCC deck could play back both types of cassettes. Unlike DAT, which was accepted in professional usage because it could record without lossy compression effects, DCC failed in home, mobile and professional environments, and was discontinued in 1996.

The microcassette largely supplanted the full-sized cassette in situations where voice-level fidelity is all that is required, such as in dictation machines and answering machines. Microcassettes have in turn given way to digital recorders of various descriptions. Since the rise of cheap CD-R discs, and flash memory-based digital audio players, the phenomenon of &quot;home taping&quot; has effectively switched to recording to a Compact Disc or downloading from commercial or music-sharing websites.

Because of consumer demand, the cassette has remained influential on design, more than a decade after its decline as a media mainstay. As the Compact Disc grew in popularity, cassette-shaped audio adapters were developed to provide an economical and clear way to obtain CD functionality in vehicles equipped with cassette decks but no CD player. A portable CD player would have its analog line-out connected to the adapter, which in turn fed the signal to the head of the cassette deck. These adapters continue to function with MP3 players and smartphones, and generally are more reliable than the FM transmitters that must be used to adapt CD players and digital audio players to car stereo systems. Digital audio players shaped as cassettes have also become available, which can be inserted into any cassette player and communicate with the head as if they were normal cassettes.

<text>Dave Thompson (born 30 June 1959) is an English actor, stand-up comedian and writer, who made headlines in July 1997 after being removed from the role of Tinky Winky in the children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Teletubbies&quot; after 70 episodes. The BBC said in a letter to Thompson that his &quot;interpretation of the role was not acceptable&quot;.

Thompson recounted bursting into tears upon learning the news of his termination. In interviews, he supposed that the dubbing of his voice, unlike the other actors, was an indication of dissatisfaction over his performance.

Thompson later appeared in the 2000 Ben Elton film &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; as Dave the Comedian/Mrs. Furblob. He also appeared in Harry Hill&#x27;s live tour &quot;Hooves&quot; as the minor characters of the Horse, the ballboy and the Greek man who grabs Harry&#x27;s neck. Thompson also made appearances in each night of Hill&#x27;s &quot;Hooves&quot; tour.

<text>A microphone, colloquially called a mic (), or mike, is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, and radio and television broadcasting. They are also used in computers and other electronic devices, such as mobile phones, for recording sounds, speech recognition, VoIP, and other purposes, such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.

Several types of microphone are used today, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate; and the contact microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.

==History==
In order to speak to larger groups of people, a need arose to increase the volume of the human voice. The earliest devices used to achieve this were acoustic megaphones. Some of the first examples, from fifth-century-BC Greece, were theater masks with horn-shaped mouth openings that acoustically amplified the voice of actors in amphitheaters. In 1665, the English physicist Robert Hooke was the first to experiment with a medium other than air with the invention of the &quot;lovers&#x27; telephone&quot; made of stretched wire with a cup attached at each end.

In 1856, Italian inventor Antonio Meucci developed a dynamic microphone based on the generation of electric current by moving a coil of wire to various depths in a magnetic field. This method of modulation was also the most enduring method for the technology of the telephone as well. Speaking of his device, Meucci wrote in 1857, &quot;It consists of a vibrating diaphragm and an electrified magnet with a spiral wire that wraps around it. The vibrating diaphragm alters the current of the magnet. These alterations of current, transmitted to the other end of the wire, create analogous vibrations of the receiving diaphragm and reproduce the word.&quot;

In 1861, German inventor Johann Philipp Reis built an early sound transmitter (the &quot;Reis telephone&quot;) that used a metallic strip attached to a vibrating membrane that would produce intermittent current. Better results were achieved in 1876 with the &quot;liquid transmitter&quot; design in early telephones from Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray – the diaphragm was attached to a conductive rod in an acid solution. These systems, however, gave a very poor sound quality.

The first microphone that enabled proper voice telephony was the (loose-contact) carbon microphone. This was independently developed by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877 (after a long legal dispute), Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention. The Berliner microphone found commercial success through the use by Alexander Graham Bell for his telephone and Berliner became employed by Bell. The carbon microphone was critical in the development of telephony, broadcasting and the recording industries. Thomas Edison refined the carbon microphone into his carbon-button transmitter of 1886. This microphone was employed at the first radio broadcast ever, a performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera House in 1910.

In 1916, E.C. Wente of Western Electric developed the next breakthrough with the first condenser microphone. In 1923, the first practical moving coil microphone was built. The Marconi-Sykes magnetophone, developed by Captain H. J. Round, became the standard for BBC studios in London. This was improved in 1930 by Alan Blumlein and Herbert Holman who released the HB1A and was the best standard of the day.

Also in 1923, the ribbon microphone was introduced, another electromagnetic type, believed to have been developed by Harry F. Olson, who applied the concept used in a ribbon speaker to making a microphone. Over the years these microphones were developed by several companies, most notably RCA that made large advancements in pattern control, to give the microphone directionality. With television and film technology booming there was a demand for high-fidelity microphones and greater directionality. Electro-Voice responded with their Academy Award-winning shotgun microphone in 1963.

During the second half of the 20th century, development advanced quickly with the Shure Brothers bringing out the SM58 and SM57.

== Varieties ==
Microphones are categorized by their transducer principle (condenser, dynamic, etc.) and by their directional characteristics (omni, cardioid, etc.). Sometimes other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended use or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (end- or side-address) of the microphone are used to describe the microphone.

=== Condenser ===


The condenser microphone, invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente, is also called a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone—capacitors were historically called condensers. The diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and audio vibrations produce changes in the distance between the plates. Because the capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them, the vibrations produce changes in capacitance. These changes in capacitance are used to measure the audio signal. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an &quot;element&quot; or &quot;capsule&quot;.

Condenser microphones span the range from telephone mouthpieces through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave compared to other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work.

Condenser microphones require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and is also needed to power the microphone electronics. Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns, such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example, the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.

There are two main categories of condenser microphones, depending on the method of extracting the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones.

==== DC-biased condenser ====
With a DC-biased condenser microphone, the plates are biased with a fixed charge (&quot;Q&quot;). The voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = ), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. A nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant. The capacitance of the capsule (around 5 to 100 pF) and the value of the bias resistor (100 MΩ to tens of GΩ) form a filter that is high-pass for the audio signal, and low-pass for the bias voltage. Note that the time constant of an RC circuit equals the product of the resistance and capacitance.

Within the time frame of the capacitance change (as much as 50 ms at 20 Hz audio signal), the charge is practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies above and below the bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels.

==== RF condenser ====
RF condenser microphones use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The Sennheiser MKH series of microphones use the RF biasing technique. A covert, remotely energized application of the same physical principle called the Thing was devised by Soviet Russian inventor Leon Theremin and used to bug the US Ambassador&#x27;s residence in Moscow between 1945 and 1952.

==== Electret condenser ====

An electret microphone is a type of condenser microphone invented by Gerhard Sessler and Jim West at Bell laboratories in 1962. The externally applied charge used for a conventional condenser microphone is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material. An electret is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or &quot;polarized&quot;. The name comes from &quot;electrostatic&quot; and &quot;magnet&quot;; a static charge is embedded in an electret by the alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a permanent magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.

Due to their good performance and ease of manufacture, hence low cost, the vast majority of microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and lavalier (lapel mic) use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Prior to the proliferation of MEMS microphones, nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones were electret types.

Unlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated preamplifier that does require power. This preamplifier is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. Monophonic microphones designed for personal computers (PCs), sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5 mm plug as usually used for stereo connections; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power.

==== Valve microphone ====
A valve microphone is a condenser microphone that uses a vacuum tube (valve) amplifier. They remain popular with enthusiasts of tube sound.

=== Dynamic ===


The dynamic microphone (also known as the moving-coil microphone) works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them popular for on-stage use.

Dynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm which moves the coil in the magnetic field, producing a varying voltage across the coil through electromagnetic induction.

=== Ribbon ===

Ribbon microphones use a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically connected to the microphone&#x27;s output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. Also, because the ribbon has much less mass, it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. The figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for Blumlein pair stereo recording. Other directional patterns are produced by enclosing one side of the ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from figure-eight to unidirectional. 

A good low-frequency response in older ribbon microphones could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials, have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. 

In common with other classes of dynamic microphones, ribbon microphones do not require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones (i.e. those without the aforementioned preamplifier) are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power.

=== Carbon ===

The carbon microphone was the earliest type of microphone. The carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the Berliner and Edison microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.

Unlike other microphone types, the carbon microphone can also be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long-distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. Called a Brown&#x27;s relay, these repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line.

=== Piezoelectric ===

A crystal microphone or piezo microphone uses the phenomenon of piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An example of this is potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10 MΩ) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.

Piezoelectric transducers are often used as contact microphones to amplify sound from acoustic musical instruments, to sense drum hits, for triggering electronic samples, and to record sound in challenging environments, such as underwater under high pressure. Saddle-mounted pickups on acoustic guitars are generally piezoelectric devices that contact the strings passing over the saddle. This type of microphone is different from magnetic coil pickups commonly visible on typical electric guitars, which use magnetic induction, rather than mechanical coupling, to pick up vibration.

=== Fiber-optic ===
A fiber-optic microphone converts acoustic waves into electrical signals by sensing changes in light intensity, instead of sensing changes in capacitance or magnetic fields as with conventional microphones.

During operation, light from a laser source travels through an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of a reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photodetector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber-optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.

Fiber-optic microphones do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called EMI/RFI immunity). The fiber-optic microphone design is therefore ideal for use in areas where conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside industrial turbines or in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment environments.

Fiber-optic microphones are robust, resistant to environmental changes in heat and moisture, and can be produced for any directionality or impedance matching. The distance between the microphone&#x27;s light source and its photodetector may be up to several kilometers without need for any preamplifier or another electrical device, making fiber-optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.

Fiber-optic microphones are used in very specific application areas such as for infrasound monitoring and noise cancellation. They have proven especially useful in medical applications, such as allowing radiologists, staff and patients within the powerful and noisy magnetic field to converse normally, inside the MRI suites as well as in remote control rooms. Other uses include industrial equipment monitoring and audio calibration and measurement, high-fidelity recording and law enforcement.

=== Laser ===
Laser microphones are often portrayed in movies as spy gadgets because they can be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.

In a more robust and expensive implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an interferometer, which detects movement of the surface by changes in the optical path length of the reflected beam. The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics.

A new type of laser microphone is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect sound vibrations in free air. On August 25, 2009, U.S. patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam&#x27;s path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photodetector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through October 12, 2009.

=== Liquid ===
Early microphones did not produce intelligible speech, until Alexander Graham Bell made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter. Bell&#x27;s liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water with a small amount of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle. Elisha Gray filed a caveat for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle. Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by Reginald Fessenden in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application. The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.

=== MEMS ===

The MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques and is usually accompanied with an integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built-in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic, InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies, and Omron.

More recently, since the 2010s, there has been increased interest and research into making piezoelectric MEMS microphones which are a significant architectural and material change from existing condenser style MEMS designs.

=== Plasma ===
In a plasma microphone, a plasma arc of ionized gas is used. The sound waves cause variations in the pressure around the plasma in turn causing variations in temperature which alter the conductance of the plasma. These variations in conductance can be picked up as variations superimposed on the electrical supply to the plasma. This is an experimental form of microphone.

=== Speakers as microphones ===
A loudspeaker, a transducer that turns an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is similar in construction to a dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work &quot;in reverse&quot; as microphones. Reciprocity applies, so the resulting microphone has the same impairments as a single-driver loudspeaker: limited low- and high-end frequency response, poorly controlled directivity, and low sensitivity. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high bandwidth and sensitivity are not needed such as intercoms, walkie-talkies or video game voice chat peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.

However, there is at least one practical application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size woofer placed closely in front of a &quot;kick drum&quot; (bass drum) in a drum set to act as a microphone. A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a woofer shock-mounted into a 10&quot; drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums.

== Capsule design and directivity ==
The inner elements of a microphone are the primary source of differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone&#x27;s directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.

== Polar patterns ==
A microphone&#x27;s directionality or polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis. The polar patterns illustrated above represent the locus of points in polar coordinates that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given sound pressure level (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones such as in the Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually perpendicular to the microphone body, commonly known as &quot;side fire&quot; or &quot;side address&quot;. For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as &quot;end fire&quot; or &quot;top/end address&quot;.

Some microphone designs combine several principles in creating the desired polar pattern. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction/dissipation/absorption) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.

===Omnidirectional===
An omnidirectional (or nondirectional) microphone&#x27;s response is generally considered to be a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the polar pattern for an &quot;omnidirectional&quot; microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it&#x27;s cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.

The wavelength of sound at 10 kHz is 1.4&quot; (3.5 cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4&quot; (6 mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even up to the highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the &quot;purest&quot; microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20 Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.

Areas of application: studios, old churches, theaters, on-site TV interviews, etc.

An example of a nondirectional microphone is the round black &quot;eight ball&quot;.

===Unidirectional===
A unidirectional microphone is primarily sensitive to sounds from only one direction. The diagram above (lobar) illustrates a number of these patterns. The microphone faces upwards in each diagram. The sound intensity for a particular frequency is plotted for angles radially from 0 to 360°. (Professional diagrams show these scales and include multiple plots at different frequencies. The diagrams given here provide only an overview of typical pattern shapes, and their names.)

===Cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, subcardioid ===

The most common unidirectional microphone is a cardioid microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is &quot;heart-shaped&quot; (i.e. a cardioid). The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centered around the microphone, which is the &quot;stem&quot; of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the monitors. Since these directional transducer microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the proximity effect. The SM58 has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.

The cardioid is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional (pressure) and a figure-8 (pressure gradient) microphone; for sound waves coming from the back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas, for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other. However, in low frequencies a cardioid microphone behaves as an omnidirectional microphone.

By combining the two components in different ratios, any pattern between omni and figure-8 can be achieved, which comprise the first-order cardioid family. Common shapes include:
* A hyper-cardioid microphone is similar to cardioid, but with a slightly larger figure-8 contribution, leading to a tighter area of front sensitivity and a smaller lobe of rear sensitivity. It is produced by combining the two components in a 3:1 ratio, producing nulls at 109.5°. This ratio maximizes the directivity factor (or directivity index).
* A super-cardioid microphone is similar to a hyper-cardioid, except there is more front pickup and less rear pickup. It is produced with about a 5:3 ratio, with nulls at 126.9°. This ratio maximizes the &quot;front-back ratio&quot;; the energy ratio between front and rear radiation.
* The sub-cardioid microphone has no null points. It is produced with about 7:3 ratio with 3–10 dB level between the front and back pickup.
Three such cardioid microphones/hydrophones could be orthogonally oriented as a collocated triad to improve the gain and also create a steerable beam pattern.

===Bi-directional===
&quot;Figure-8&quot; or bi-directional microphones receive sound equally from both the front and back of the element. Most ribbon microphones are of this pattern. In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the &quot;change&quot; in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are scalar transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are vector transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.

===Shotgun ===

Shotgun microphones are the most highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types. At low frequencies, they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid, while at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique is the presence of some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency and can cause some coloration effects.

===Boundary===
Several approaches have been developed for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from one or more of the surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially, this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary. While the patent has expired, &quot;Pressure Zone Microphone&quot; and &quot;PZM&quot; are still active trademarks of Crown International.

While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown&#x27;s trademark on this approach is &quot;Phase Coherent Cardioid&quot; or &quot;PCC&quot;, but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.

== Application-specific designs ==
A lavalier microphone is made for hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).

A wireless microphone transmits the audio as a radio or optical signal rather than via a cable. It usually sends its signal using a small radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system, but it can also use infrared waves if the transmitter and receiver are within sight of each other.

A contact microphone picks up vibrations directly from a solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones have been used to pick up the sound of a snail&#x27;s heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the contact microphone that picks up speech directly from a person&#x27;s throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.

A parabolic microphone uses a parabolic reflector to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in much the same way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have a poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.

A stereo microphone integrates two microphones in one unit to produce a stereophonic signal. A stereo microphone is often used for broadcast applications or field recording where it would be impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see microphone practice) for stereophonic recording. Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.

A noise-canceling microphone is a highly directional design intended for noisy environments. One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source and the second is positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm&#x27;s signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16 dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design by Crown using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears and Janet Jackson. A few noise-canceling microphones are throat microphones.

== Stereo microphone techniques ==
Various standard techniques are used with microphones used in sound reinforcement at live performances, or for recording in a studio or on a motion picture set. By suitable arrangement of one or more microphones, desirable features of the sound to be collected can be kept, while rejecting unwanted sounds.

== Powering ==
Microphones containing active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require power to operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as or T-power and DIN 45596 for phantom power. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, &quot;plug-in power&quot; is more common, for microphones using a 3.5 mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.

== Connectors and connectivity ==

The most common connectors used by microphones are:
* Male XLR connector on professional microphones
*  inch (sometimes referred to as 6.35 mm) phone connector on less expensive musician&#x27;s microphones, using an unbalanced TS (tip and sleeve) phone connector. Harmonica microphones commonly use a high impedance  inch TS connection to be run through guitar amplifiers.
* 3.5 mm (sometimes referred to as  inch mini) TRS (tip, ring and sleeve) stereo (also available as TS mono) mini phone plug on prosumer camera, recorder and computer microphones.
* USB allows direct connection to PCs. Electronics in these microphones powered over the USB connection performs preamplification and ADC before the digital audio data is transferred via the USB interface.

Some microphones use other connectors, such as a 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some lavalier (or &quot;lapel&quot;, from the days of attaching the microphone to the news reporter&#x27;s suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a radio pack. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.

=== Impedance bridging ===
When choosing a pre-amplifier for a certain microphone, the microphone&#x27;s impedance must be known. Impedance is a frequency-dependent electrical characteristic, measured in ohms (Ω), that relates voltage to current. When not concerned with power transfer, signals are generally transferred as varying voltages and this is also the case for microphones. To obtain the highest signal amplitude one uses a method called impedance bridging. In this configuration the output impedance of the microphone should be negligible in comparison with the input impedance of the pre-amplifier (in practice a pre-amp impedance at least 10 times greater than the microphone impedance is recommended). By doing so, the signal is attenuated minimally and almost no power is used in the process.

The main alternative to impedance bridging is impedance matching which maximizes power transfer for a given source impedance. However, this has not been relevant since the early 20th century when amplifiers were very expensive and produced a lot of heat. To reduce the number of amplifiers in telephone lines, power loss needed to be minimal so source and load impedances were matched. A downside to impedance matching is the 6 dB loss in signal that occurs as only half the voltage level appears at the pre-amplifier&#x27;s input. Certain ribbon and dynamic microphones however are exceptions, due to the designers&#x27; assumption of a certain load impedance being part of the internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.

Different microphones can have vastly different impedances and this depends on the design. In passive microphones, this value relates closely to the impedance of the coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the output impedance of its internal amplifier circuitry.

Low impedance is considered under 600 Ω. Medium impedance is considered between 600 Ω and 10 kΩ. High impedance is above 10 kΩ. Owing to their built-in amplifier, condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200 Ω.

=== Digital microphone interface ===
The AES42 standard, published by the Audio Engineering Society, defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or XLD male connector, rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate in accordance with the AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.

== Measurements and specifications ==
Because of differences in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. Additionally, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often not the case for music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC 60268-4.

A frequency response diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in decibels over a range of frequencies (typically 20 Hz to 20 kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0° to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: &quot;30 Hz–16 kHz ±3 dB&quot;. This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude of no more than plus or minus 3 dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how &quot;smooth&quot; the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as &quot;20 Hz–20 kHz&quot; are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones&#x27; frequency response varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC 60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in &quot;plane progressive wave&quot; conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. &quot;Close talking&quot; microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.

The self-noise or equivalent input noise level is the sound level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does in the absence of sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone&#x27;s dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: &quot;15 dBA SPL&quot; (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20 micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14 dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20 dBA SPL or 32 dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel &amp; Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0 dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and Røde that advertise noise levels between 5–7 dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the A-weighting curve while broadband noise may be increased.

The clipping level is an important indicator of maximum usable level, as the 1% total harmonic distortion (THD) figure usually quoted under max SPL is really a very mild level of distortion, quite inaudible especially on brief high peaks. Clipping is much more audible. For some microphones, the clipping level may be much higher than the max SPL.

The dynamic range of a microphone is the difference in SPL between the noise floor and the maximum SPL. If stated on its own, for example, &quot;120 dB&quot;, it conveys significantly less information than having the self-noise and maximum SPL figures individually.

Sensitivity indicates how well the microphone converts acoustic pressure to an output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device. This is a practical concern but is not directly an indication of the microphone&#x27;s quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, &quot;transduction gain&quot; being perhaps more meaningful, (or just &quot;output level&quot;) because true sensitivity is generally set by the noise floor, and too much &quot;sensitivity&quot; in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1 kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1 V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so −60  dB is more sensitive than −70 dB.
== Measurement microphones ==

Some microphones are intended for testing speakers, measuring noise levels and otherwise quantifying an acoustic experience. These are calibrated transducers and are usually supplied with a calibration certificate that states absolute sensitivity against frequency. The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to using the designations &quot;Class 1&quot;, &quot;Type 2&quot;, etc., which are references not to microphone specifications but to sound level meters. A more comprehensive standard for the description of measurement microphone performance was recently adopted.

Measurement microphones are generally scalar sensors of pressure; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. Sound intensity or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays of at least two microphones, or with hot-wire anemometers.

===Calibration===
To take a scientific measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in volts per pascal). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, it is necessary to regularly calibrate measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All microphone calibration is ultimately traceable to primary standards at a national measurement institute such as NPL in the UK, PTB in Germany and NIST in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary standard. Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.

Depending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically) and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped (most such microphones come in foam-padded cases to reduce this risk) or exposed to sounds beyond the acceptable level.

== Arrays ==
A microphone array is any number of microphones operating in tandem. There are many applications:
* Systems for extracting voice input from ambient noise (notably telephones, speech recognition systems, hearing aids)
* Surround sound and related technologies
* Locating objects by sound: acoustic source localization (e.g. military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire). Aircraft location and tracking.
* High fidelity original recordings
* 3D spatial beamforming for localized acoustic detection of subcutaneous sounds

Typically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.

== Windscreens ==

Windscreens (or interchangeably, windshields) provide a method of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam &quot;hats&quot; shield wind into the grille from all directions, and &quot;blimps&quot;, &quot;zeppelins&quot;, and &quot;baskets&quot; entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low-frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.

The shielding material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – is designed to have a significant acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material increases wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high-frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames or laminating with coarser structural elements.

Since all wind noise is generated at the first surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between the shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke, which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield and microphone combination to act as a high-pass acoustic filter.

Since turbulence at a surface is the source of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibers produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibers are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material, it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency and is hard to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest in moving away from its use.

<text>Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force (emf) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field.

Michael Faraday is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831, and James Clerk Maxwell mathematically described it as Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. Lenz&#x27;s law describes the direction of the induced field. Faraday&#x27;s law was later generalized to become the Maxwell–Faraday equation, one of the four Maxwell equations in his theory of electromagnetism.

Electromagnetic induction has found many applications, including electrical components such as inductors and transformers, and devices such as electric motors and generators.

==History==

Electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday, published in 1831. It was discovered independently by Joseph Henry in 1832.

In Faraday&#x27;s first experimental demonstration, on August 29, 1831, he wrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring or &quot;torus&quot; (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a &quot;wave of electricity&quot;, when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction was due to the change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (&quot;Faraday&#x27;s disk&quot;).

Faraday explained electromagnetic induction using a concept he called lines of force. However, scientists at the time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly because they were not formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday&#x27;s ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell&#x27;s model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday&#x27;s law even though it is slightly different from Faraday&#x27;s original formulation and does not describe motional emf. Heaviside&#x27;s version (see Maxwell–Faraday equation below) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

In 1834 Heinrich Lenz formulated the law named after him to describe the &quot;flux through the circuit&quot;. Lenz&#x27;s law gives the direction of the induced emf and current resulting from electromagnetic induction.

==Theory==

===Faraday&#x27;s law of induction and Lenz&#x27;s law===


Faraday&#x27;s law of induction makes use of the magnetic flux ΦB through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop. The magnetic flux is defined by a surface integral:
formula_1
where &quot;dA is an element of the surface Σ enclosed by the wire loop, B is the magnetic field. The dot product B·&quot;dA corresponds to an infinitesimal amount of magnetic flux. In more visual terms, the magnetic flux through the wire loop is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the loop.

When the flux through the surface changes, Faraday&#x27;s law of induction says that the wire loop acquires an electromotive force (emf). The most widespread version of this law states that the induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the emf and ΦB is the magnetic flux. The direction of the electromotive force is given by Lenz&#x27;s law which states that an induced current will flow in the direction that will oppose the change which produced it. This is due to the negative sign in the previous equation. To increase the generated emf, a common approach is to exploit flux linkage by creating a tightly wound coil of wire, composed of &quot;N&quot; identical turns, each with the same magnetic flux going through them. The resulting emf is then &quot;N&quot; times that of one single wire.
formula_4

Generating an emf through a variation of the magnetic flux through the surface of a wire loop can be achieved in several ways:
# the magnetic field B changes (e.g. an alternating magnetic field, or moving a wire loop towards a bar magnet where the B field is stronger),
# the wire loop is deformed and the surface Σ changes,
# the orientation of the surface &quot;d&quot;A changes (e.g. spinning a wire loop into a fixed magnetic field),
# any combination of the above

===Maxwell–Faraday equation===

In general, the relation between the emf formula_5 in a wire loop encircling a surface Σ, and the electric field E in the wire is given by
formula_6
where &quot;d&quot;ℓ is an element of contour of the surface Σ, combining this with the definition of flux
formula_1
we can write the integral form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation
formula_8

It is one of the four Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and therefore plays a fundamental role in the theory of classical electromagnetism.

===Faraday&#x27;s law and relativity===
Faraday&#x27;s law describes two different phenomena: the &quot;motional emf&quot; generated by a magnetic force on a moving wire (see Lorentz force), and the &quot;transformer emf&quot; that is generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (due to the differential form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation). James Clerk Maxwell drew attention to the separate physical phenomena in 1861. This is believed to be a unique example in physics of where such a fundamental law is invoked to explain two such different phenomena.

Albert Einstein noticed that the two situations both corresponded to a relative movement between a conductor and a magnet, and the outcome was unaffected by which one was moving. This was one of the principal paths that led him to develop special relativity.

==Applications==
The principles of electromagnetic induction are applied in many devices and systems, including:
===Electrical generator===
The emf generated by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying electrical generators. When a permanent magnet is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an electrical load, current will flow, and thus electrical energy is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the &quot;drum generator&quot; is based upon the figure to the bottom-right. A different implementation of this idea is the Faraday&#x27;s disc, shown in simplified form on the right.

In the Faraday&#x27;s disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. Mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère&#x27;s circuital law (labelled &quot;induced B&quot; in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz&#x27;s law). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to &quot;decrease&quot; the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the &quot;increase&quot; in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field &quot;increases&quot; the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the &quot;decrease&quot; in flux due to r the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.

===Electrical transformer===

When the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, formula_9. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the induced emf or transformer emf. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.

====Current clamp====

A current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.

===Magnetic flow meter===

Faraday&#x27;s law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage ε generated in the magnetic field &quot;B&quot; due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity &quot;v&quot; is thus given by:

:formula_10

where ℓ is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.

==Eddy currents==

Electrical conductors moving through a steady magnetic field, or stationary conductors within a changing magnetic field, will have circular currents induced within them by induction, called eddy currents. Eddy currents flow in closed loops in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They have useful applications in eddy current brakes and induction heating systems. However eddy currents induced in the metal magnetic cores of transformers and AC motors and generators are undesirable since they dissipate energy (called core losses) as heat in the resistance of the metal. Cores for these devices use a number of methods to reduce eddy currents: 
* Cores of low frequency alternating current electromagnets and transformers, instead of being solid metal, are often made of stacks of metal sheets, called &quot;laminations&quot;, separated by nonconductive coatings. These thin plates reduce the undesirable parasitic eddy currents, as described below.
* Inductors and transformers used at higher frequencies often have magnetic cores made of nonconductive magnetic materials such as ferrite or iron powder held together with a resin binder.

===Electromagnet laminations===

Eddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more magnetic lines of force than the inner portion; hence the induced electromotive force is not uniform; this tends to cause electric currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.
Only five laminations or plates are shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch (16 to 26 per centimetre), and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.
This is a rotor approximately 20 mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.
===Parasitic induction within conductors===

In this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.

High current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in switch-mode power supplies and the intermediate frequency coupling transformers of radio receivers.

<doc id="65890" wikidata="Q177831" url="?curid=65890" title="Magnetic flux">
<text>In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field B over that surface. It is usually denoted or . The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb; in derived units, volt–seconds or V⋅s), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils, and it calculates the magnetic flux from the change of voltage on the coils.

== Description ==

The magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field, where each point in space is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point (see Lorentz force). Since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize, introductory physics instruction often uses field lines to visualize this field. The magnetic flux through some surface, in this simplified picture, is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface (in some contexts, the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface; although technically misleading, this distinction is not important). The magnetic flux is the &quot;net&quot; number of field lines passing through that surface; that is, the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction (see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign).
More sophisticated physical models drop the field line analogy and define magnetic flux as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface. If the magnetic field is constant, the magnetic flux passing through a surface of vector area S is
formula_1
where &quot;B&quot; is the magnitude of the magnetic field (the magnetic flux density) having the unit of Wb/m2 (tesla), &quot;S&quot; is the area of the surface, and &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to S. For a varying magnetic field, we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element dS, where we may consider the field to be constant:
formula_2
A generic surface, S, can then be broken into infinitesimal elements and the total magnetic flux through the surface is then the surface integral
formula_3
From the definition of the magnetic vector potential A and the fundamental theorem of the curl the magnetic flux may also be defined as:
formula_4
where the line integral is taken over the boundary of the surface , which is denoted .
== Magnetic flux through a closed surface ==

Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism, which is one of the four Maxwell&#x27;s equations, states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero. (A &quot;closed surface&quot; is a surface that completely encloses a volume(s) with no holes.) This law is a consequence of the empirical observation that magnetic monopoles have never been found.

In other words, Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism is the statement:

for any closed surface &quot;S&quot;.

== Magnetic flux through an open surface ==
While the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero, the magnetic flux through an open surface need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism.

When determining the total magnetic flux through a surface only the boundary of the surface needs to be defined, the actual shape of the surface is irrelevant and the integral over any surface sharing the same boundary will be equal. This is a direct consequence of the closed surface flux being zero.

== Changing magnetic flux ==

For example, a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an electromotive force (emf), and therefore an electric current, in the loop. The relationship is given by Faraday&#x27;s law:
formula_5
where:
*formula_6 is the electromotive force (EMF), 
* The minus sign represents Lenz&#x27;s Law,
* is the magnetic flux through the open surface ,
* is the boundary of the open surface ; the surface, in general, may be in motion and deforming, and so is generally a function of time. The electromotive force is induced along this boundary.
* is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour ,
* is the velocity of the boundary ,
* is the electric field, and
* is the magnetic field.

The two equations for the EMF are, firstly, the work per unit charge done against the Lorentz force in moving a test charge around the (possibly moving) surface boundary and, secondly, as the change of magnetic flux through the open surface . This equation is the principle behind an electrical generator.


== Comparison with electric flux ==

By way of contrast, Gauss&#x27;s law for electric fields, another of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, is

where
*E is the electric field,
*&quot;S&quot; is any closed surface,
*&quot;Q&quot; is the total electric charge inside the surface &quot;S&quot;,
*&quot;ε&quot;0 is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the &quot;permittivity of free space&quot;).

The flux of E through a closed surface is &quot;not&quot; always zero; this indicates the presence of &quot;electric monopoles&quot;, that is, free positive or negative charges.

<text>Boyle&#x27;s law, also referred to as the Boyle–Mariotte law or Mariotte&#x27;s law (especially in France), is an empirical gas law that describes the relationship between pressure and volume of a confined gas. Boyle&#x27;s law has been stated as:

The absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system.

Mathematically, Boyle&#x27;s law can be stated as:

or
where is the pressure of the gas, is the volume of the gas, and is a constant for a particular temperature and amount of gas.

Boyle&#x27;s law states that when the temperature of a given mass of confined gas is constant, the product of its pressure and volume is also constant. When comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be expressed as:
formula_1

showing that as volume increases, the pressure of a gas decreases proportionally, and vice versa. 

Boyle&#x27;s law is named after Robert Boyle, who published the original law in 1662. An equivalent law is Mariotte’s law, named after French physicist Edme Mariotte.

==History==
The relationship between pressure and volume was first noted by Richard Towneley and Henry Power in the 17th century. Robert Boyle confirmed their discovery through experiments and published the results. According to Robert Gunther and other authorities, it was Boyle&#x27;s assistant, Robert Hooke, who built the experimental apparatus. Boyle&#x27;s law is based on experiments with air, which he considered to be a fluid of particles at rest in between small invisible springs. Boyle may have begun experimenting with gases due to an interest in air as an essential element of life; for example, he published works on the growth of plants without air. Boyle used a closed J-shaped tube and after pouring mercury from one side he forced the air on the other side to contract under the pressure of mercury. After repeating the experiment several times and using different amounts of mercury he found that under controlled conditions, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by it. 

The French physicist Edme Mariotte (1620–1684) discovered the same law independently of Boyle in 1679, after Boyle had published it in 1662. Mariotte did, however, discover that air volume changes with temperature. Thus this law is sometimes referred to as Mariotte&#x27;s law or the Boyle–Mariotte law. Later, in 1687 in the , Newton showed mathematically that in an elastic fluid consisting of particles at rest, between which are repulsive forces inversely proportional to their distance, the density would be directly proportional to the pressure, but this mathematical treatise does not involve any Mariott temperature dependance and is not the proper physical explanation for the observed relationship. Instead of a static theory, a kinetic theory is needed, which was developed over the next two centuries by Daniel Bernoulli (1738) and more fully by Rudolf Clausius (1857), Maxwell and Boltzmann.

This law was the first physical law to be expressed in the form of an equation describing the dependence of two variable quantities.

== Definition ==
The law itself can be stated as follows:
Boyle&#x27;s law is a gas law, stating that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship. If volume increases, then pressure decreases and vice versa, when the temperature is held constant.

Therefore, when the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved.

=== Relation with kinetic theory and ideal gases ===
As the pressure on a gas increases, the volume of the gas decreases because the gas particles are forced closer together. 

Most gases behave like ideal gases at moderate pressures and temperatures. The technology of the 17th century could not produce very high pressures or very low temperatures. Hence, the law was not likely to have deviations at the time of publication. As improvements in technology permitted higher pressures and lower temperatures, deviations from the ideal gas behavior became noticeable, and the relationship between pressure and volume can only be accurately described employing real gas theory. The deviation is expressed as the compressibility factor.

Boyle (and Mariotte) derived the law solely by experiment. The law can also be derived theoretically based on the presumed existence of atoms and molecules and assumptions about motion and perfectly elastic collisions (see kinetic theory of gases). These assumptions were met with enormous resistance in the positivist scientific community at the time, however, as they were seen as purely theoretical constructs for which there was not the slightest observational evidence.

Daniel Bernoulli (in 1737–1738) derived Boyle&#x27;s law by applying Newton&#x27;s laws of motion at the molecular level. It remained ignored until around 1845, when John Waterston published a paper building the main precepts of kinetic theory; this was rejected by the Royal Society of England. Later works of James Prescott Joule, Rudolf Clausius and in particular Ludwig Boltzmann firmly established the kinetic theory of gases and brought attention to both the theories of Bernoulli and Waterston.

The debate between proponents of energetics and atomism led Boltzmann to write a book in 1898, which endured criticism until his suicide in 1906. Albert Einstein in 1905 showed how kinetic theory applies to the Brownian motion of a fluid-suspended particle, which was confirmed in 1908 by Jean Perrin.

===Equation===

The mathematical equation for Boyle&#x27;s law is:

formula_2

where denotes the pressure of the system, denotes the volume of the gas, is a constant value representative of the temperature of the system and amount of gas.

So long as temperature remains constant the same amount of energy given to the system persists throughout its operation and therefore, theoretically, the value of will remain constant. However, due to the derivation of pressure as perpendicular applied force and the probabilistic likelihood of collisions with other particles through collision theory, the application of force to a surface may not be infinitely constant for such values of , but will have a limit when differentiating such values over a given time. Forcing the volume of the fixed quantity of gas to increase, keeping the gas at the initially measured temperature, the pressure must decrease proportionally. Conversely, reducing the volume of the gas increases the pressure. Boyle&#x27;s law is used to predict the result of introducing a change, in volume and pressure only, to the initial state of a fixed quantity of gas.

The initial and final volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the initial and final temperatures are the same (heating or cooling will be required to meet this condition), are related by the equation:

formula_3

Here and represent the original pressure and volume, respectively, and and represent the second pressure and volume.

Boyle&#x27;s law, Charles&#x27;s law, and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law form the combined gas law. The three gas laws in combination with Avogadro&#x27;s law can be generalized by the ideal gas law.

==Human breathing system==

Boyle&#x27;s law is often used as part of an explanation on how the breathing system works in the human body. This commonly involves explaining how the lung volume may be increased or decreased and thereby cause a relatively lower or higher air pressure within them (in keeping with Boyle&#x27;s law). This forms a pressure difference between the air inside the lungs and the environmental air pressure, which in turn precipitates either inhalation or exhalation as air moves from high to low pressure.

<text>In electromagnetism and electronics, electromotive force (also electromotance, abbreviated emf, denoted formula_1) is an energy transfer to an electric circuit per unit of electric charge, measured in volts. Devices called electrical &quot;transducers&quot; provide an emf by converting other forms of energy into electrical energy. Other types of electrical equipment also produce an emf, such as batteries, which convert chemical energy, and generators, which convert mechanical energy. This energy conversion is achieved by physical forces applying physical work on electric charges. However, electromotive force itself is not a physical force, and ISO/IEC standards have deprecated the term in favor of source voltage or source tension instead (denoted formula_2).

An electronic–hydraulic analogy may view emf as the mechanical work done to water by a pump, which results in a pressure difference (analogous to voltage).

In electromagnetic induction, emf can be defined around a closed loop of a conductor as the electromagnetic work that would be done on an elementary electric charge (such as an electron) if it travels once around the loop.

For two-terminal devices modeled as a Thévenin equivalent circuit, an equivalent emf can be measured as the open-circuit voltage between the two terminals. This emf can drive an electric current if an external circuit is attached to the terminals, in which case the device becomes the voltage source of that circuit.

Although an emf gives rise to a voltage and can be measured as a voltage and may sometimes informally be called a &quot;voltage&quot;, they are not the same phenomenon (see ).

==Overview==
Devices that can provide emf include electrochemical cells, thermoelectric devices, solar cells, photodiodes, electrical generators, inductors, transformers and even Van de Graaff generators. In nature, emf is generated when magnetic field fluctuations occur through a surface. For example, the shifting of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field during a geomagnetic storm induces currents in an electrical grid as the lines of the magnetic field are shifted about and cut across the conductors.

In a battery, the charge separation that gives rise to a potential difference (voltage) between the terminals is accomplished by chemical reactions at the electrodes that convert chemical potential energy into electromagnetic potential energy. A voltaic cell can be thought of as having a &quot;charge pump&quot; of atomic dimensions at each electrode, that is:
In an electrical generator, a time-varying magnetic field inside the generator creates an electric field via electromagnetic induction, which creates a potential difference between the generator terminals. Charge separation takes place within the generator because electrons flow away from one terminal toward the other, until, in the open-circuit case, an electric field is developed that makes further charge separation impossible. The emf is countered by the electrical voltage due to charge separation. If a load is attached, this voltage can drive a current. The general principle governing the emf in such electrical machines is Faraday&#x27;s law of induction.

==History==
In 1801, Alessandro Volta introduced the term &quot;force motrice électrique&quot; to describe the active agent of a battery (which he had invented around 1798).
This is called the &quot;electromotive force&quot; in English.

Around 1830, Michael Faraday established that chemical reactions at each of two electrode–electrolyte interfaces provide the &quot;seat of emf&quot; for the voltaic cell. That is, these reactions drive the current and are not an endless source of energy as the earlier obsolete theory thought. In the open-circuit case, charge separation continues until the electrical field from the separated charges is sufficient to arrest the reactions. Years earlier, Alessandro Volta, who had measured a contact potential difference at the metal–metal (electrode–electrode) interface of his cells, held the incorrect opinion that contact alone (without taking into account a chemical reaction) was the origin of the emf.

== Notation and units of measurement ==
Electromotive force is often denoted by formula_1 or &quot;ℰ&quot;.

In a device without internal resistance, if an electric charge formula_4 passing through that device gains an energy formula_5 via work, the net emf for that device is the energy gained per unit charge: formula_6 Like other measures of energy per charge, emf uses the SI unit volt, which is equivalent to a joule (SI unit of energy) per coulomb (SI unit of charge).

Electromotive force in electrostatic units is the statvolt (in the centimeter gram second system of units equal in amount to an erg per electrostatic unit of charge).

&quot;Inside&quot; a source of emf (such as a battery) that is open-circuited, a charge separation occurs between the negative terminal &quot;N&quot; and the positive terminal &quot;P&quot;.
This leads to an electrostatic field formula_7 that points from &quot;P&quot; to &quot;N&quot;, whereas the emf of the source must be able to drive current from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;P&quot; when connected to a circuit.
This led Max Abraham to introduce the concept of a nonelectrostatic field formula_8 that exists only inside the source of emf.
In the open-circuit case, formula_9, while when the source is connected to a circuit the electric field formula_10 inside the source changes but formula_8 remains essentially the same.
In the open-circuit case, the conservative electrostatic field created by separation of charge exactly cancels the forces producing the emf. 
Mathematically:

formula_12

where formula_7 is the conservative electrostatic field created by the charge separation associated with the emf, formula_14 is an element of the path from terminal &quot;N&quot; to terminal &quot;P&quot;, &#x27;formula_15&#x27; denotes the vector dot product, and formula_16 is the electric scalar potential. 
This emf is the work done on a unit charge by the source&#x27;s nonelectrostatic field formula_8 when the charge moves from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;P&quot;.

When the source is connected to a load, its emf is just
formula_18
and no longer has a simple relation to the electric field formula_10 inside it.

In the case of a closed path in the presence of a varying magnetic field, the integral of the electric field around the (stationary) closed loop formula_20 may be nonzero.
Then, the &quot;induced emf&quot; (often called the &quot;induced voltage&quot;) in the loop is:

formula_21

where formula_10 is the entire electric field, conservative and non-conservative, and the integral is around an arbitrary, but stationary, closed curve formula_20 through which there is a time-varying magnetic flux formula_24, and formula_25 is the vector potential.
The electrostatic field does not contribute to the net emf around a circuit because the electrostatic portion of the electric field is conservative (i.e., the work done against the field around a closed path is zero, see Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law, which is valid, as long as the circuit elements remain at rest and radiation is ignored).
That is, the &quot;induced emf&quot; (like the emf of a battery connected to a load) is not a &quot;voltage&quot; in the sense of a difference in the electric scalar potential.

If the loop formula_20 is a conductor that carries current formula_27 in the direction of integration around the loop, and the magnetic flux is due to that current, we have that formula_28, where formula_29 is the self inductance of the loop.
If in addition, the loop includes a coil that extends from point 1 to 2, such that the magnetic flux is largely localized to that region, it is customary to speak of that region as an inductor, and to consider that its emf is localized to that region.
Then, we can consider a different loop formula_30 that consists of the coiled conductor from 1 to 2, and an imaginary line down the center of the coil from 2 back to 1. 
The magnetic flux, and emf, in loop formula_30 is essentially the same as that in loop formula_20:formula_33

For a good conductor, formula_34 is negligible, so we have, to a good approximation,
formula_35
where formula_16 is the electric scalar potential along the centerline between points 1 and 2.

Thus, we can associate an effective &quot;voltage drop&quot; formula_37 with an inductor (even though our basic understanding of induced emf is based on the vector potential rather than the scalar potential), and consider it as a load element in Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law,

formula_38

where now the induced emf is not considered to be a source emf.

This definition can be extended to arbitrary sources of emf and paths &quot;formula_20&quot; moving with velocity formula_40 through the electric field formula_10 and magnetic field formula_42:

formula_43

which is a conceptual equation mainly, because the determination of the &quot;effective forces&quot; is difficult.
The term formula_44
is often called a &quot;motional emf&quot;.

==In (electrochemical) thermodynamics==
When multiplied by an amount of charge formula_45 the emf formula_1 yields a thermodynamic work term formula_47 that is used in the formalism for the change in Gibbs energy when charge is passed in a battery:

: formula_48

where formula_49 is the Gibbs free energy, formula_50 is the entropy, formula_16 is the system volume, formula_52 is its pressure and formula_53 is its absolute temperature.

The combination formula_54 is an example of a conjugate pair of variables. At constant pressure the above relationship produces a Maxwell relation that links the change in open cell voltage with temperature &quot;formula_53&quot; (a measurable quantity) to the change in entropy &quot;formula_50&quot; when charge is passed isothermally and isobarically. The latter is closely related to the reaction entropy of the electrochemical reaction that lends the battery its power. This Maxwell relation is:

:formula_57

If a mole of ions goes into solution (for example, in a Daniell cell, as discussed below) the charge through the external circuit is:

:formula_58

where formula_59 is the number of electrons/ion, and formula_60 is the Faraday constant and the minus sign indicates discharge of the cell. Assuming constant pressure and volume, the thermodynamic properties of the cell are related strictly to the behavior of its emf by:

:formula_61

where formula_62 is the enthalpy of reaction. The quantities on the right are all directly measurable. Assuming constant temperature and pressure:

:formula_63

which is used in the derivation of the Nernst equation.

== Distinction with potential difference ==
Although an electrical potential difference (voltage) is sometimes called an emf, they are formally distinct concepts:

* Potential difference is a more general term that includes emf.
* Emf is the cause of a potential difference. 
* In a circuit of a voltage source and a resistor, the sum of the source&#x27;s applied voltage plus the ohmic voltage drop through the resistor is zero. But the resistor provides no emf, only the voltage source does:
** For a circuit using a battery source, the emf is due solely to the chemical forces in the battery.
** For a circuit using an electric generator, the emf is due solely to a time-varying magnetic forces within the generator.
* Both a 1 volt emf and a 1 volt potential difference correspond to 1 joule per coulomb of charge.

In the case of an open circuit, the electric charge that has been separated by the mechanism generating the emf creates an electric field opposing the separation mechanism. For example, the chemical reaction in a voltaic cell stops when the opposing electric field at each electrode is strong enough to arrest the reactions. A larger opposing field can reverse the reactions in what are called &quot;reversible&quot; cells.

The electric charge that has been separated creates an electric potential difference that can (in many cases) be measured with a voltmeter between the terminals of the device, when not connected to a load. The magnitude of the emf for the battery (or other source) is the value of this open-circuit voltage. 
When the battery is charging or discharging, the emf itself cannot be measured directly using the external voltage because some voltage is lost inside the source.
It can, however, be inferred from a measurement of the current formula_27 and potential difference formula_16, provided that the internal resistance formula_66 already has been measured: &quot;formula_67&quot;

&quot;Potential difference&quot; is not the same as &quot;induced emf&quot; (often called &quot;induced voltage&quot;). 
The potential difference (difference in the electric scalar potential) between two points A and B is independent of the path we take from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. 
If a voltmeter always measured the potential difference between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, then the position of the voltmeter would make no difference. 
However, it is quite possible for the measurement by a voltmeter between points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to depend on the position of the voltmeter, if a time-dependent magnetic field is present. 
For example, consider an infinitely long solenoid using an AC current to generate a varying flux in the interior of the solenoid. 
Outside the solenoid we have two resistors connected in a ring around the solenoid. 
The resistor on the left is 100 Ω and the one on the right is 200 Ω, they are connected at the top and bottom at points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. 
The induced voltage, by Faraday&#x27;s law is formula_16, so the current formula_69 Therefore, the voltage across the 100 Ω resistor is formula_70 and the voltage across the 200 Ω resistor is formula_71, yet the two resistors are connected on both ends, but formula_72 measured with the voltmeter to the left of the solenoid is not the same as formula_72 measured with the voltmeter to the right of the solenoid.
==Generation==

===Chemical sources===


The question of how batteries (galvanic cells) generate an emf occupied scientists for most of the 19th century. The &quot;seat of the electromotive force&quot; was eventually determined in 1889 by Walther Nernst to be primarily at the interfaces between the electrodes and the electrolyte.

Atoms in molecules or solids are held together by chemical bonding, which stabilizes the molecule or solid (i.e. reduces its energy). When molecules or solids of relatively high energy are brought together, a spontaneous chemical reaction can occur that rearranges the bonding and reduces the (free) energy of the system. In batteries, coupled half-reactions, often involving metals and their ions, occur in tandem, with a gain of electrons (termed &quot;reduction&quot;) by one conductive electrode and loss of electrons (termed &quot;oxidation&quot;) by another (reduction-oxidation or redox reactions). The spontaneous overall reaction can only occur if electrons move through an external wire between the electrodes. The electrical energy given off is the free energy lost by the chemical reaction system.

As an example, a Daniell cell consists of a zinc anode (an electron collector) that is oxidized as it dissolves into a zinc sulfate solution. The dissolving zinc leaving behind its electrons in the electrode according to the oxidation reaction (&quot;s&quot; = solid electrode; &quot;aq&quot; = aqueous solution):

:formula_74

The zinc sulfate is the electrolyte in that half cell. It is a solution which contains zinc cations formula_75, and sulfate anions formula_76 with charges that balance to zero.

In the other half cell, the copper cations in a copper sulfate electrolyte move to the copper cathode to which they attach themselves as they adopt electrons from the copper electrode by the reduction reaction:

:formula_77

which leaves a deficit of electrons on the copper cathode. The difference of excess electrons on the anode and deficit of electrons on the cathode creates an electrical potential between the two electrodes. (A detailed discussion of the microscopic process of electron transfer between an electrode and the ions in an electrolyte may be found in Conway.) The electrical energy released by this reaction (213 kJ per 65.4 g of zinc) can be attributed mostly due to the 207 kJ weaker bonding (smaller magnitude of the cohesive energy) of zinc, which has filled 3d- and 4s-orbitals, compared to copper, which has an unfilled orbital available for bonding.

If the cathode and anode are connected by an external conductor, electrons pass through that external circuit (light bulb in figure), while ions pass through the salt bridge to maintain charge balance until the anode and cathode reach electrical equilibrium of zero volts as chemical equilibrium is reached in the cell. In the process the zinc anode is dissolved while the copper electrode is plated with copper. The salt bridge has to close the electrical circuit while preventing the copper ions from moving to the zinc electrode and being reduced there without generating an external current. It is not made of salt but of material able to wick cations and anions (a dissociated salt) into the solutions. The flow of positively charged cations along the bridge is equivalent to the same number of negative charges flowing in the opposite direction.

If the light bulb is removed (open circuit) the emf between the electrodes is opposed by the electric field due to the charge separation, and the reactions stop.

For this particular cell chemistry, at 298 K (room temperature), the emf formula_1 = 1.0934 V, with a temperature coefficient of formula_79 = −4.53×10−4 V/K.

====Voltaic cells====
Volta developed the voltaic cell about 1792, and presented his work March 20, 1800. Volta correctly identified the role of dissimilar electrodes in producing the voltage, but incorrectly dismissed any role for the electrolyte. Volta ordered the metals in a &#x27;tension series&#x27;, &quot;that is to say in an order such that any one in the list becomes positive when in contact with any one that succeeds, but negative by contact with any one that precedes it.&quot; A typical symbolic convention in a schematic of this circuit ( –|– ) would have a long electrode 1 and a short electrode 2, to indicate that electrode 1 dominates. Volta&#x27;s law about opposing electrode emfs implies that, given ten electrodes (for example, zinc and nine other materials), 45 unique combinations of voltaic cells (10 × 9/2) can be created.

====Typical values====
The electromotive force produced by primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) cells is usually of the order of a few volts. The figures quoted below are nominal, because emf varies according to the size of the load and the state of exhaustion of the cell.

==== Other chemical sources ====
Other chemical sources include fuel cells.

===Electromagnetic induction===
Electromagnetic induction is the production of a circulating electric field by a time-dependent magnetic field. A time-dependent magnetic field can be produced either by motion of a magnet relative to a circuit, by motion of a circuit relative to another circuit (at least one of these must be carrying an electric current), or by changing the electric current in a fixed circuit. The effect on the circuit itself, of changing the electric current, is known as self-induction; the effect on another circuit is known as mutual induction.

For a given circuit, the electromagnetically induced emf is determined purely by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit according to Faraday&#x27;s law of induction.

An emf is induced in a coil or conductor whenever there is change in the flux linkages. Depending on the way in which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is &quot;statically induced&quot;. The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as &quot;motional emf&quot;. When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is &quot;dynamically induced.&quot; The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field is often referred to as &quot;transformer emf&quot;.

===Contact potentials===

When solids of two different materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires that one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the &quot;contact potential&quot;. Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact electromotive force or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and there is now a built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.
The original difference in Fermi levels, before contact, is referred to as the emf.
The contact potential cannot drive steady current through a load attached to its terminals because that current would involve a charge transfer. No mechanism exists to continue such transfer and, hence, maintain a current, once equilibrium is attained.

One might inquire why the contact potential does not appear in Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of voltages as one contribution to the sum of potential drops. The customary answer is that any circuit involves not only a particular diode or junction, but also all the contact potentials due to wiring and so forth around the entire circuit. The sum of &quot;all&quot; the contact potentials is zero, and so they may be ignored in Kirchhoff&#x27;s law.

===Solar cell===


Operation of a solar cell can be understood from its equivalent circuit. Photons with energy greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor create mobile electron–hole pairs. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction. This electric field is created from a built-in potential, which arises from the contact potential between the two different materials in the junction. The charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across the p–n diode yields a &quot;forward voltage&quot;, the &quot;photo voltage&quot;, between the illuminated diode terminals, which drives current through any attached load. &quot;Photo voltage&quot; is sometimes referred to as the &quot;photo emf&quot;, distinguishing between the effect and the cause.

==== Solar cell current–voltage relationship ====
Two internal current losses formula_80 limit the total current formula_27 available to the external circuit. The light-induced charge separation eventually creates a forward current formula_82 through the cell&#x27;s internal resistance formula_83 in the direction opposite the light-induced current formula_84. In addition, the induced voltage tends to forward bias the junction, which at high enough voltages will cause a recombination current formula_85 in the diode opposite the light-induced current.

When the output is short-circuited, the output voltage is zeroed, and so the voltage across the diode is smallest. Thus, short-circuiting results in the smallest formula_80 losses and consequently the maximum output current, which for a high-quality solar cell is approximately equal to the light-induced current formula_87. Approximately this same current is obtained for forward voltages up to the point where the diode conduction becomes significant.

The current delivered by the illuminated diode to the external circuit can be simplified (based on certain assumptions) to:

:formula_88

formula_89 is the reverse saturation current. Two parameters that depend on the solar cell construction and to some degree upon the voltage itself are the ideality factor &quot;m&quot; and the thermal voltage formula_90, which is about 26 millivolts at room temperature.

==== Solar cell photo emf ====

Solving the illuminated diode&#x27;s above simplified current–voltage relationship for output voltage yields:

:formula_91
which is plotted against formula_92 in the figure.

The solar cell&#x27;s &quot;photo emf&quot; formula_93 has the same value as the open-circuit voltage formula_94, which is determined by zeroing the output current formula_27:

:formula_96

It has a logarithmic dependence on the light-induced current formula_84 and is where the junction&#x27;s forward bias voltage is just enough that the forward current completely balances the light-induced current. For silicon junctions, it is typically not much more than 0.5 volts. While for high-quality silicon panels it can exceed 0.7 volts in direct sunlight.

When driving a resistive load, the output voltage can be determined using Ohm&#x27;s law and will lie between the short-circuit value of zero volts and the open-circuit voltage formula_94. When that resistance is small enough such that formula_99 (the near-vertical part of the two illustrated curves), the solar cell acts more like a &quot;current generator&quot; rather than a voltage generator, since the current drawn is nearly fixed over a range of output voltages. This contrasts with batteries, which act more like voltage generators.

=== Other sources that generate emf ===

*A transformer coupling two circuits may be considered a source of emf for one of the circuits, just as if it were caused by an electrical generator; this is the origin of the term &quot;transformer emf&quot;.
*For converting sound waves into voltage signals:
**a microphone generates an emf from a moving diaphragm.
**a magnetic pickup generates an emf from a varying magnetic field produced by an instrument.
**a piezoelectric sensor generates an emf from strain on a piezoelectric crystal.
*Devices that use temperature to produce emfs include thermocouples and thermopiles.
*Any electrical transducer which converts a physical energy into electrical energy.

<doc id="65897" wikidata="Q605181" url="?curid=65897" title="Wire wrap">
<text>Wire wrap is an electronic component assembly technique that was invented to wire telephone crossbar switches, and later adapted to construct electronic circuit boards. Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated wire run between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns of uninsulated sections of the wire around a component lead or a socket pin.

Wires can be wrapped by hand or by machine, and can be hand-modified afterwards. It was popular for large-scale manufacturing in the 1960s and early 1970s, and continues today to be used for short runs and prototypes. The method eliminates the design and fabrication of a printed circuit board. Wire wrapping is unusual among other prototyping technologies since it allows for complex assemblies to be produced by automated equipment, but then easily repaired or modified by hand.

Wire wrap construction can produce assemblies that are more reliable than printed circuits: connections are less prone to fail due to vibration or physical stresses on the base board, and the lack of solder eliminates soldering faults such as corrosion, cold joints and dry joints. The connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical resistance due to cold welding of the wire to the terminal post at the corners.

Wire wrap was used for assembly of high frequency prototypes and small production runs, including gigahertz microwave circuits and supercomputers. It is unique among automated prototyping techniques in that wire lengths can be exactly controlled, and twisted pairs or magnetically shielded twisted quads can be routed together.

Wire wrap construction became popular around 1960 in circuit board manufacturing, and use has now sharply declined. Surface-mount technology has made the technique comparatively much less useful than in previous decades. Solder-less breadboards and the decreasing cost of professionally made PCBs have nearly eliminated this technology.

== History ==

Manually wrapped wires were common in early 20th century point-to-point electronic construction methods in which a strong connection was needed to hold the components in place. Wires were wrapped by hand around binding posts or spade lugs and then soldered.

Modern wire wrapping technology was developed after WWII at Bell Laboratories as a means of making electrical connections in a new relay being designed for use in the Bell Telephone system. A design team headed by Arthur C. Keller developed the “Keller Wrap Gun”, and the entire wrap system was passed over to Western Electric for industrial application. After a “make or buy” committee at Western Electric decided to have the hand tool manufactured by an outside vendor, Western Electric sent the tool contract out for bids. Keller Tool of Grand Haven, Michigan, a supplier of rotary hand tools to Western Electric, won the contract and made several design changes to make the tool easier to manufacture and to use. Keller began manufacturing the tools in 1953, and subsequently obtained a license from Western Electric allowing sale of the technology on the open market. The tool was marketed under its original name – since the name of the manufacturer was coincidentally the same as the name of the inventor.

IBM&#x27;s first transistorized computers, introduced within the late 1950s, were built with the IBM Standard Modular System that used wire-wrapped backplanes.

Wire-wrap was used by Apple Computer to make early prototypes of the original Macintosh computer (The Macintosh 128K).

== Method ==
A correctly made wire-wrap connection for 30 or 28 AWG wire is seven turns (fewer for larger wire) of bare wire with half to one and a half turns of insulated wire at the bottom for strain relief. The square hard-gold-plated post thus forms 28 redundant contacts. The silver-plated wire coating cold-welds to the gold. If corrosion occurs, it occurs on the outside of the wire, not on the gas-tight contact where oxygen cannot penetrate to form oxides. A correctly designed wire-wrap tool applies up to twenty tons of force per square inch on each joint.

The electronic parts sometimes plug into sockets. The sockets are attached with cyanoacrylate (or silicone adhesive) to thin plates of glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy (fiberglass).

The sockets have square posts. The usual posts are square, high, and spaced at intervals. Premium posts are hard-drawn beryllium copper alloy plated with a of gold to prevent corrosion. Less-expensive posts are bronze with tin plating.

30 gauge (~0.0509mm2) silver-plated soft copper wire is insulated with a fluorocarbon that does not emit dangerous gases when heated. The most common insulation is &quot;Kynar&quot;. The 30 AWG Kynar wire is cut into standard lengths, then one inch of insulation is removed on each end.

There are three ways of placing wires on a board. In professionally built wire-wrap boards, long wires are placed first so that shorter wires mechanically secure the long wires. Also, to make an assembly more repairable, wires are applied in layers. The ends of each wire are always at the same height on the post, so that at most three wires need to be replaced to replace a wire. Also, to make the layers easier to see, they are made with different colors of insulation. In space-rated or airworthy wire-wrap assemblies, the wires are boxed, and may be conformally coated with wax to reduce vibration. Epoxy is never used for the coating because it makes an assembly unrepairable.

== Tooling ==

A &quot;wire wrap tool&quot; has two holes. The wire and of insulated wire are placed in a hole near the edge of the tool. The hole in the center of the tool is placed over the post.

The tool is rapidly twisted. The result is that 1.5 to 2 turns of insulated wire are wrapped around the post, and above that, 7 to 9 turns of bare wire are wrapped around the post. The post has room for three such connections, although usually only one or two are needed. This facilitates manual wire-wrapping to be employed for modifications or repairs.

The turn and a half of insulated wire helps prevent wire fatigue where it meets the post.

Above the turn of insulated wire, the bare wire wraps around the post. The corners of the post bite in with pressures of tons per square inch. This forces all the gases out of the area between the wire&#x27;s silver plate and the post&#x27;s gold or tin corners. Further, with 28 such connections (seven turns on a four-cornered post), a very reliable connection exists between the wire and the post. Furthermore, the corners of the posts are quite &quot;sharp&quot;: they have a quite-small radius of curvature.

== Automation ==

Automated wire-wrap machines, as manufactured by the Gardner Denver Company in the 1960s and 1970s, were capable of automatically routing, cutting, stripping and wrapping wires onto an electronic &quot;backplane&quot; or &quot;circuit board&quot;. The machines were driven by wiring instructions encoded onto punched cards, Mylar punched hole tape, and early micro computers.

The earliest machines (14FB and 14FG models, for example) were initially configured as &quot;horizontal&quot;, which meant that the wire wrap board was placed upside down (pins up) onto a horizontal tooling plate, which was then rolled into the machine and locked onto a rotating (TRP table rotational position of four positions) and shifting (PLP = pallet longitudinal position of 11 positions) pallet assembly. These machines included very large hydraulic units for powering the servos that drove the ball screw mounted &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; drive carriages, a tall electronics cabinet loaded with hundreds of IBM control relays, many dozens of solenoids for controlling the various pneumatic mechanical subsystems, and an IBM 029 card reader for positioning instructions. The automatic wire wrap machines themselves were quite large, tall and square. Servicing the machines was extremely complex, and often meant climbing inside them just to work on them. This could be quite dangerous if safety interlocks were not maintained properly.

Later, somewhat smaller machines were &quot;vertical&quot; (14FV) which meant the boards were placed onto a tooling plate with pins facing the machine operator. Gone were the hydraulic units, in favor of direct drive motors to rotate the ball screws, with rotary encoders to provide positioning feedback. This generally provided better visibility of the product for the operator, although maximum wrap area was significantly less than the horizontal machines. Top speeds on horizontal machines were generally around 500-600 wires per hour, while the vertical machines could reach rates as high as 1200 per hour, depending on board quality and wiring configurations.

== Considerations ==

Wire-wrap works well with digital circuits with few discrete components, but is less convenient for analog systems with many discrete resistors, capacitors or other components (such elements can be soldered to a header and plugged into a wire wrap socket). The sockets are an additional cost compared to directly inserting integrated circuits into a printed circuit board, and add size and mass to a system. Multiple strands of wire may introduce cross-talk between circuits, of little consequence for digital circuits but a limitation for analog systems. The interconnected wires can radiate electromagnetic interference and have less predictable impedance than a printed circuit board. Wire-wrap construction cannot provide the ground planes and power distribution planes possible with multilayer printed circuit boards, increasing the possibility of noise.

<text>Digital Audio Tape (DAT or R-DAT) is a signal recording and playback medium developed by Sony and introduced in 1987. In appearance it is similar to a Compact Cassette, using 3.81 mm / 0.15&quot; (commonly referred to as 4 mm) magnetic tape enclosed in a protective shell, but is roughly half the size at 73 mm × 54 mm × 10.5 mm. The recording is digital rather than analog. DAT can record at sampling rates equal to, as well as higher and lower than a CD (44.1, 48, or 32 kHz sampling rate respectively) at 16 bits quantization. If a comparable digital source is copied without returning to the analogue domain, then the DAT will produce an exact clone, unlike other digital media such as Digital Compact Cassette or non-Hi-MD MiniDisc, both of which use a lossy data-reduction system.

Like most formats of videocassette, a DAT cassette may only be recorded and played in one direction, unlike an analog compact audio cassette, although many DAT recorders had the capability to record program numbers and IDs, which can be used to select an individual track like on a CD player.

Although intended as a replacement for analog audio compact cassettes, the format was never widely adopted by consumers because of its expense, as well as concerns from the music industry about unauthorized high-quality copies. The format saw moderate success in professional markets and as a computer storage medium, which was developed into the Digital Data Storage format. As Sony has ceased production of new recorders, it will become more difficult to play archived recordings in this format unless they are copied to other formats or hard drives. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of sticky-shed syndrome has been noted by some engineers involved in re-mastering archival recordings on DAT, which presents a further threat to audio held exclusively in this medium.

== History ==
=== Development ===
The technology of DAT is closely based on video recorders, using a rotating head and helical scan to record data. This prevents DATs from being physically edited in the cut-and-splice manner of analog tapes, or open-reel digital tapes like ProDigi or DASH. In 1983, a DAT meeting was established to unify the standards for recording digital audio on magnetic tape developed by each company and in 1985, two standards were created: R-DAT (Rotating Digital Audio Tape) using a rotary head and S-DAT (Stationary Digital Audio Tape) using a fixed head. The S-DAT format had a simple mechanism similar to the Compact Cassette format but was difficult to develop a fixed recording head for high-density recording while the rotating head of the R-DAT had a proven track record in VCR formats like VHS &amp; Betamax. As the S-DAT version was never released, R-DAT had been renamed as simply &quot;DAT&quot; by the time of its launch. However, Philips and Matsushita (Panasonic) would later release their own stationary head digital format in the form of the Digital Compact Cassette. Sony would later introduce another rotating head format in the form of NT which was intended to replace the Microcassette and Mini-Cassette.

The DAT standard allows for four sampling modes: 32 kHz at 12 bits, and 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz at 16 bits. Certain recorders operate outside the specification, allowing recording at 96 kHz and 24 bits (HHS). Some early machines aimed at the consumer market did not operate at 44.1 kHz when recording so they could not be used to &#x27;clone&#x27; a compact disc. Since each recording standard uses the same tape, the quality of the sampling has a direct relation to the duration of the recording – 32 kHz at 12 bits will allow six hours of recording onto a three-hour tape while HHS will only give 90 minutes from the same tape. Included in the signal data are subcodes to indicate the start and end of tracks or to skip a section entirely; this allows for indexing and fast seeking. Two-channel stereo recording is supported under all sampling rates and bit depths, but the R-DAT standard does support 4-channel recording at 32 kHz.

DATs are between 15 and 180 minutes in length, a 120-minute tape being 60 metres in length. DATs longer than 60 metres tend to be problematic in DAT recorders due to the thinner media. DAT machines running at 48 kHz and 44.1 kHz sample rates transport the tape at 8.15 mm/s. DAT machines running at 32 kHz sample rate transport the tape at 4.075 mm/s.

=== Predecessor formats ===
DAT was not the first digital audio tape; pulse-code modulation (PCM) was used in Japan by Denon in 1972 for the mastering and production of analogue phonograph records, using a 2-inch Quadruplex-format videotape recorder for its transport, but this was not developed into a consumer product. Denon&#x27;s development dated from its work with Japan&#x27;s NHK Broadcasting; NHK developed the first high-fidelity PCM audio recorder in the late 1960s. Denon continued development of their PCM recorders that used professional video machines as the storage medium, eventually building 8-track units used for, among other productions, a series of jazz records made in New York in the late 1970s.

In 1976, another digital audio tape format was developed by Soundstream, using wide reel-to-reel tape loaded on an instrumentation recorder manufactured by Honeywell acting as a transport, which in turn was connected to outboard digital audio encoding and decoding hardware of Soundstream&#x27;s own design. Soundstream&#x27;s format was improved through several prototypes and when it was developed to 50 kHz sampling rate at 16 bits, it was deemed good enough for professional classical recording by the company&#x27;s first client, Telarc Records of Cleveland, Ohio. Telarc&#x27;s April, 1978 recording of the Holst Suites for Band by Frederick Fennell and the Cleveland Wind Ensemble was a landmark release, and ushered in digital recording for America&#x27;s classical music labels. Soundstream&#x27;s system was also used by RCA.

Starting in 1978, 3M introduced its own line and format of digital audio tape recorders for use in a recording studio. One of the first prototypes of 3M&#x27;s system was installed in the studios of Sound 80 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This system was used in June 1978 to record Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. That record was the first Grammy-winning digital recording. The production version of the 3M Digital Mastering System was used in 1979 to record the first all-digital rock album, Ry Cooder&#x27;s &quot;Bop Till You Drop,&quot; made at Warner Brothers Studio in California.

The first consumer-oriented PCM format used consumer video tape formats (Beta and VHS) as the storage medium. These systems used the EIAJ digital format, which sampled at 44.056 kHz at 14 bits. The Sony PCM-F1 system debuted in 1981, and Sony from the start offered the option of 16-bit wordlength. Other systems were marketed by Akai, JVC, Nakamichi and others. Panasonic, via its Technics division, briefly sold a digital recorder that combined an EIAJ digital adapter with a VHS video transport, the SV-P100. These machines were marketed by consumer electronics companies to consumers, but they were very pricey compared to cassette or even reel-to-reel decks of the time. They did catch on with the more budget conscious professional recordists, and some boutique-label professional releases were recorded using these machines.

Starting in the early 1980s, professional systems using a PCM adaptor were also common as mastering formats. These systems digitized an analog audio signal and then encoded the resulting digital stream into an analog video signal so that a conventional VCR could be used as a storage medium.

One of the most significant examples of a PCM adaptor-based system was the Sony PCM-1600 digital audio mastering system, introduced in 1978. The PCM-1600 used a U-Matic-format VCR for its transport, connected to external digital audio processing hardware. It (and its later versions such as the PCM-1610 and 1630) was widely used for the production and mastering of some of the first Digital Audio CDs in the early 1980s. Once CDs were commercially introduced in 1982, tapes recorded on the PCM-1600 were sent to the CD pressing plants to be used to make the glass master disc for CD replication.

Other examples include dbx, Inc.&#x27;s Model 700 system, which, similar to later Super Audio CDs, used a high sample-rate delta-sigma modulation rather than PCM; Decca&#x27;s 1970s PCM system, which used a videotape recorder manufactured by IVC for a transport; and Mitsubishi&#x27;s X-80 digital recorder, a 6.4 mm ( in) open reel digital mastering format that used a very unusual sampling rate of 50.4 kHz.

For high-quality studio recording, all of these formats were effectively made obsolete in the early 1980s by two competing reel-to-reel formats with stationary heads: Sony&#x27;s DASH format and Mitsubishi&#x27;s continuation of the X-80 recorder, which was improved upon to become the ProDigi format. (In fact, one of the first ProDigi-format recorders, the Mitsubishi X-86C, was playback-compatible with tapes recorded on an X-80.) Both of these formats remained popular as an analog alternative until the early 1990s, when hard disk recorders rendered them obsolete.

=== Demise ===
Sony released its last DAT product with the DAT Walkman TCD-D100 in 1995 and continued to produce it until November 2005 when Sony announced that its remaining DAT machine models would be discontinued the following month. Sony had sold around 660,000 DAT products since its introduction in 1987. Sony continued to produce blank DAT tapes until 2015 when it announced it would cease production by the end of the year. Even with this, the DAT format still finds regular use in film and television recording, primarily due to the support in some recorders for SMPTE time code synchronisation, and sometimes by audio enthusiasts as a way of backing up vinyl, compact cassette and CD collections to a digital format to then be transferred to PC. Although it has been superseded by modern hard disk recording or memory card equipment, which offers much more flexibility and storage, Digital Data Storage tapes, which are broadly similar to DATs, apart from tape length and thickness on some variants, and are still manufactured today unlike DAT cassettes, are often used as substitutes in many situations.

=== Digital Compact Cassette ===
The DAT recorder mechanism was considerably more complex and expensive than an analogue cassette deck mechanism due to the rotary helical scan head, therefore Philips and Panasonic Corporation developed a rival digital tape recorder system with a stationary head based on the analogue compact cassette known as S-DAT. The Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) was cheaper and simpler mechanically than DAT, but did not make perfect digital copies as it used a lossy compression technique called PASC. (Lossy compression was necessary to reduce the data rate to a level that the DCC head could record successfully at the linear tape speed of 4.75 cm/s that the compact cassette system uses.) DCC was never a competitor to DAT in recording studios, because DAT was already established, and studios favor lossless formats. As DCC was launched at the same time as Sony&#x27;s Minidisc format (which has random access and editing features), it was not successful with consumers either. However, DCC proved that high quality digital recording could be achieved with a cheap simple mechanism using stationary heads.

== Anti-DAT lobbying ==
In the late 1980s, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) unsuccessfully lobbied against the introduction of DAT devices into the U.S. Initially, the organization threatened legal action against any manufacturer attempting to sell DAT machines in the country. It later sought to impose restrictions on DAT recorders to prevent them from being used to copy LPs, CDs, and prerecorded cassettes. One of these efforts, the Digital Audio Recorder Copycode Act of 1987 (introduced by Sen. Al Gore and Rep. Waxman), initiated by CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff, involved a technology called CopyCode and required DAT machines to include a chip to detect attempts to copy material recorded with a notch filter, meaning that copyrighted prerecorded music, whether analog or digital, whether on LP, cassette, or DAT, would have distorted sound resulting from the notch filter applied by the publisher at the time of mastering for mass reproduction. A National Bureau of Standards study showed that not only were the effects plainly audible, but that it was not even effective at preventing copying.

This opposition by CBS softened after Sony, a DAT manufacturer, bought CBS Records in January 1988. By June 1989, an agreement was reached, and the only concession the RIAA would receive was a more practical recommendation from manufacturers to Congress that legislation be enacted to require that recorders have a Serial Copy Management System to prevent digital copying for more than a single generation. This requirement was enacted as part of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, which also imposed taxes on DAT recorders and blank media. However, the computer industry successfully lobbied to have personal computers exempted from that act, setting the stage for massive consumer copying of copyrighted material on materials like recordable CDs and by extension, filesharing systems such as Napster.

== Uses ==
=== Professional recording industry ===
DAT was used professionally in the 1990s by the audio recording industry as part of an emerging all-digital production chain also including digital multi-track recorders and digital mixing consoles that was used to create a fully digital recording. In this configuration, it is possible for the audio to remain digital from the first AD converter after the mic preamp until it is in a CD player.

=== Pre-recorded albums ===
In December 1987, &quot;The Guitar And Other Machines&quot; by the British post-punk band The Durutti Column, became the first commercial release on DAT. Later in May 1988, Wire released their album &quot;The Ideal Copy&quot; on the format. Several other albums from multiple record labels were also released as pre-recorded DATs in the first few years of the format&#x27;s existence, in small quantities as well. Factory Records released a small number of albums on the format, including New Order&#x27;s best-selling compilation &quot;Substance 1987&quot;, but many planned releases were cancelled.

=== Amateur and home use ===

DAT was envisaged by proponents as the successor format to analogue audio cassettes in the way that the compact disc was the successor to vinyl-based recordings. It sold well in Japan, where high-end consumer audio stores stocked DAT recorders and tapes into the 2010s and second-hand stores generally continued to offer a wide selection of mint condition machines. However, there and in other nations, the technology was never as commercially popular as CD or cassette. DAT recorders proved to be comparatively expensive and few commercial recordings were available. Globally, DAT remained popular, for a time, for making and trading recordings of live music (see bootleg recording), since available DAT recorders predated affordable CD recorders. In the 1990s, fans of jam bands, such as the Grateful Dead and Phish, recorded and stored high-quality audience recordings of live concerts on the format.

=== Computer data storage medium ===

The format was designed for audio use, but through the ISO Digital Data Storage standard was adopted for general data storage, storing from 1.3 to 80 GB on a 60 to 180 meter tape depending on the standard and compression. It is a sequential-access medium and is commonly used for backups. Due to the higher requirements for capacity and integrity in data backups, a computer-grade DAT was introduced, called DDS (Digital Data Storage). Although functionally similar to audio DATs, only a few DDS and DAT drives (in particular, those manufactured by Archive for SGI workstations) are capable of reading the audio data from a DAT cassette. SGI DDS4 drives no longer have audio support; SGI removed the feature due to &quot;lack of demand&quot;.

<text>Picric acid is an organic compound with the formula (O2N)3C6H2OH. Its IUPAC name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP). The name &quot;picric&quot; comes from (&quot;pikros&quot;), meaning &quot;bitter&quot;, due to its bitter taste. It is one of the most acidic phenols. Like other strongly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which is its primary use. It has also been used as medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and as a dye.

== History ==
Picric acid was probably first mentioned in the 17th-century alchemical writings of Johann Rudolf Glauber. Initially, it was made by nitrating substances such as animal horn, silk, indigo, and natural resin, the synthesis from indigo first being performed by Peter Woulfe in 1771. The German chemist Justus von Liebig had named picric acid (rendered in French as ). Picric acid was given that name by the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1841. Its synthesis from phenol, and the correct determination of its formula, were accomplished during 1841. In 1799, French chemist Jean-Joseph Welter (1763–1852) produced picric acid by treating silk with nitric acid; he found that potassium picrate could explode. Not until 1830 did chemists think to use picric acid as an explosive. Before then, chemists assumed that only the salts of picric acid were explosive, not the acid itself. In 1871 Hermann Sprengel proved it could be detonated and afterwards most military powers used picric acid as their main high explosive material. A full synthesis was later found by Leonid Valerieovich Kozakov.

Picric acid was the first strongly explosive nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. Nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose (guncotton) were available earlier, but shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in an artillery barrel at the time of firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eugène Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton with the name Melinite. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, with the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an alternative stabilization approach known as Shimose powder which, instead of attempting to stabilize the material itself, removed its contact with metal by coating the inside of the shells with layer(s) of resin and wax. In 1889, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured with the name Ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with picric acid become unstable if the compound reacts with the metal shell or fuze casings to form metal picrates which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of picric acid was demonstrated by the Halifax Explosion.

Picric acid was used in the Battle of Omdurman, the Second Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. Germany began filling artillery shells with trinitrotoluene (TNT) in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but the improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused the replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.

Efforts to control the availability of phenol, the precursor to picric acid, emphasize its importance in World War I. Germans are reported to have bought US supplies of phenol and converted it to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) to keep it from the Allies. At the time, phenol was obtained from coal as a co-product of coke ovens and the manufacture of gas for gas lighting. Laclede Gas reports being asked to expand production of phenol (and toluene) to assist the war effort. Both Monsanto and Dow Chemical began manufacturing synthetic phenol in 1915, with Dow being the main producer. Dow describes picric acid as &quot;the main battlefield explosive used by the French. Large amounts [of phenol] also went to Japan, where it was made into picric acid sold to the Russians.&quot;

Thomas Edison needed phenol to manufacture phonograph records. He responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, New Jersey, facility using processes developed by his chemists. He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day. Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe. He built two plants to produce the raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany. Edison manufactured aniline dyes, which had previously been supplied by the German dye trust. Other wartime products included xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrophyllite. Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable. In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.

== Synthesis ==
The aromatic ring of phenol is activated towards electrophilic substitution reactions, and attempted nitration of phenol, even with dilute nitric acid, results in the formation of high molecular weight tars. In order to minimize these side reactions, anhydrous phenol is sulfonated with fuming sulfuric acid, and the resulting sulfonic acid is then nitrated with concentrated nitric acid. During this reaction, nitro groups are introduced, and the sulfonic acid group is displaced. The reaction is highly exothermic, and careful temperature control is required. Synthesis routes that nitrate aspirin or salicylic acid can also be used to mitigate tar formation. Carbon dioxide is lost from the former via decarboxylation, while both acetic acid and carbon dioxide are lost from the latter. Another method of picric acid synthesis is direct nitration of 2,4-dinitrophenol with nitric acid. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group &quot;Pca&quot;21 with a = 9.13 Å, b = 18.69 Å, c = 9.79 Å and α = β = γ = 90°.

== Uses ==
By far the greatest use of picric acid has been in ammunitions and explosives. Explosive D, also known as Dunnite, is the ammonium salt of picric acid. Dunnite is more powerful but less stable than the more common explosive TNT (which is produced in a similar process to picric acid but with toluene as the feedstock). Picramide, formed by aminating picric acid (typically beginning with Dunnite), can be further aminated to produce the very stable explosive TATB.

It has found some use in organic chemistry for the preparation of crystalline salts of organic bases (picrates) for the purpose of identification and characterization.

=== Optical metallography ===
In metallurgy, a 4% picric acid in ethanol etch, termed &quot;picral&quot;, has been commonly used in optical metallography to reveal prior austenite grain boundaries in ferritic steels. The hazards associated with picric acid have meant it has largely been replaced with other chemical etchants. However, it is still used to etch magnesium alloys, such as AZ31.

=== Histology ===
Bouin solution is a common picric-acid–containing fixative solution used for histology specimens. It improves the staining of acid dyes, but it can also result in hydrolysis of any DNA in the sample.

Picric acid is used in the preparation of Picrosirius red, a histological stain for collagen.

=== Blood tests ===
Clinical chemistry laboratory testing utilizes picric acid for the Jaffe reaction to test for creatinine. It forms a colored complex that can be measured using spectroscopy.

Picric acid forms red isopurpurate with hydrogen cyanide (HCN). By photometric measurement of the resulting dye, picric acid can be used to quantify hydrogen cyanide.

During the early 20th century, picric acid was used to measure blood glucose levels. When glucose, picric acid and sodium carbonate are combined and heated, a characteristic red color forms. With a calibrating glucose solution, the red color can be used to measure the glucose levels added. This is known as the Lewis and Benedict method of measuring glucose.

=== Skin dye ===
Much less commonly, wet picric acid has been used as a skin dye, or temporary branding agent. It reacts with proteins in the skin to give a dark brown color that may last as long as a month.

=== Antiseptic ===
During the early 20th century, picric acid was stocked in pharmacies as an antiseptic and as a treatment for burns, malaria, herpes, and smallpox. Picric-acid–soaked gauze was commonly stocked in first aid kits from that period as a burn treatment. It was notably used for the treatment of burns suffered by victims of the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. Picric acid was used as a treatment for trench foot suffered by soldiers stationed on the Western Front during World War I.

Picric acid has been used for many years by fly tyers to dye mole skins and feathers a dark olive green for use as fishing lures. Its popularity has been tempered by its toxic nature.

==Safety==
Modern safety precautions recommend storing picric acid wet, to minimize the danger of explosion. Dry picric acid is relatively sensitive to shock and friction, so laboratories that use it store it in bottles under a layer of water, rendering it safe. Glass or plastic bottles are required, as picric acid can easily form metal picrate salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid itself. Industrially, picric acid is especially hazardous because it is volatile and slowly sublimes even at room temperature. Over time, the buildup of picrates on exposed metal surfaces can constitute an explosion hazard.

Picric acid gauze, if found in antique first aid kits, presents a safety hazard because picric acid of that vintage (60–90 years old) will have become crystallized and unstable, and may have formed metal picrates from long storage in a metal first aid case.

Bomb disposal units are often called to dispose of picric acid if it has dried out. In the United States there was an effort to remove dried picric acid containers from high school laboratories during the 1980s. 

Munitions containing picric acid may be found in sunken warships. The buildup of metal picrates over time renders them shock-sensitive and extremely hazardous. It is recommended that shipwrecks that contain such munitions not be disturbed in any way. The hazard may subside when the shells become corroded enough to admit seawater as these materials are water-soluble. Currently there are various fluorescent probes to sense and detect picric acid in very minute quantities.

<text>An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles that are not subject to interparticle interactions. The ideal gas concept is useful because it obeys the ideal gas law, a simplified equation of state, and is amenable to analysis under statistical mechanics. The requirement of zero interaction can often be relaxed if, for example, the interaction is perfectly elastic or regarded as point-like collisions.

Under various conditions of temperature and pressure, many real gases behave qualitatively like an ideal gas where the gas molecules (or atoms for monatomic gas) play the role of the ideal particles. Many gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, noble gases, some heavier gases like carbon dioxide and mixtures such as air, can be treated as ideal gases within reasonable tolerances over a considerable parameter range around standard temperature and pressure. Generally, a gas behaves more like an ideal gas at higher temperature and lower pressure, as the potential energy due to intermolecular forces becomes less significant compared with the particles&#x27; kinetic energy, and the size of the molecules becomes less significant compared to the empty space between them. One mole of an ideal gas has a volume of (exact value based on 2019 revision of the SI) at standard temperature and pressure (a temperature of 273.15 K and an absolute pressure of exactly 105 Pa).

The ideal gas model tends to fail at lower temperatures or higher pressures, when intermolecular forces and molecular size becomes important. It also fails for most heavy gases, such as many refrigerants, and for gases with strong intermolecular forces, notably water vapor. At high pressures, the volume of a real gas is often considerably larger than that of an ideal gas. At low temperatures, the pressure of a real gas is often considerably less than that of an ideal gas. At some point of low temperature and high pressure, real gases undergo a phase transition, such as to a liquid or a solid. The model of an ideal gas, however, does not describe or allow phase transitions. These must be modeled by more complex equations of state. The deviation from the ideal gas behavior can be described by a dimensionless quantity, the compressibility factor, .

The ideal gas model has been explored in both the Newtonian dynamics (as in &quot;kinetic theory&quot;) and in quantum mechanics (as a &quot;gas in a box&quot;). The ideal gas model has also been used to model the behavior of electrons in a metal (in the Drude model and the free electron model), and it is one of the most important models in statistical mechanics.

If the pressure of an ideal gas is reduced in a throttling process the temperature of the gas does not change. (If the pressure of a real gas is reduced in a throttling process, its temperature either falls or rises, depending on whether its Joule–Thomson coefficient is positive or negative.)

== Types of ideal gas ==

There are three basic classes of ideal gas:
* the classical or Maxwell–Boltzmann ideal gas,
* the ideal quantum Bose gas, composed of bosons, and
* the ideal quantum Fermi gas, composed of fermions.

The classical ideal gas can be separated into two types: The classical thermodynamic ideal gas and the ideal quantum Boltzmann gas. Both are essentially the same, except that the classical thermodynamic ideal gas is based on classical statistical mechanics, and certain thermodynamic parameters such as the entropy are only specified to within an undetermined additive constant. The ideal quantum Boltzmann gas overcomes this limitation by taking the limit of the quantum Bose gas and quantum Fermi gas in the limit of high temperature to specify these additive constants. The behavior of a quantum Boltzmann gas is the same as that of a classical ideal gas except for the specification of these constants. The results of the quantum Boltzmann gas are used in a number of cases including the Sackur–Tetrode equation for the entropy of an ideal gas and the Saha ionization equation for a weakly ionized plasma.

== Classical thermodynamic ideal gas ==

The classical thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas can be described by two equations of state:

=== Ideal gas law ===

The ideal gas law is the equation of state for an ideal gas, given by:
formula_1
where
* is the pressure
* is the volume
* is the amount of substance of the gas (in moles)
* is the absolute temperature
* is the gas constant, which must be expressed in units consistent with those chosen for pressure, volume and temperature. For example, in SI units = 8.3145 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1 when pressure is expressed in pascals, volume in cubic meters, and absolute temperature in kelvin. 

The ideal gas law is an extension of experimentally discovered gas laws. It can also be derived from microscopic considerations.

Real fluids at low density and high temperature approximate the behavior of a classical ideal gas. However, at lower temperatures or a higher density, a real fluid deviates strongly from the behavior of an ideal gas, particularly as it condenses from a gas into a liquid or as it deposits from a gas into a solid. This deviation is expressed as a compressibility factor.

This equation is derived from
* Boyle&#x27;s law: formula_2;
* Charles&#x27;s law: formula_3;
* Avogadro&#x27;s law: formula_4.
After combining three laws we get
: formula_5
That is:
: formula_6
: formula_7.

=== Internal energy ===
The other equation of state of an ideal gas must express Joule&#x27;s second law, that the internal energy of a fixed mass of ideal gas is a function only of its temperature, with formula_8. For the present purposes it is convenient to postulate an exemplary version of this law by writing:
: formula_9
where
* is the internal energy
* is the dimensionless specific heat capacity at constant volume, approximately for a monatomic gas, for diatomic gas, and 3 for non-linear molecules if we treat translations and rotations classically and ignore quantum vibrational contribution and electronic excitation. These formulas arise from application of the classical equipartition theorem to the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. 

That for an ideal gas depends only on temperature is a consequence of the ideal gas law, although in the general case depends on temperature and an integral is needed to compute .

=== Microscopic model ===

In order to switch from macroscopic quantities (left hand side of the following equation) to microscopic ones (right hand side), we use
: formula_10
where
* formula_11 is the number of gas particles
* formula_12 is the Boltzmann constant ().

The probability distribution of particles by velocity or energy is given by the Maxwell speed distribution.

The ideal gas model depends on the following assumptions:
* The molecules of the gas are indistinguishable, small, hard spheres
* All collisions are elastic and all motion is frictionless (no energy loss in motion or collision)
* Newton&#x27;s laws apply
* The average distance between molecules is much larger than the size of the molecules
* The molecules are constantly moving in random directions with a distribution of speeds
* There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the molecules apart from those that determine their point-like collisions
* The only forces between the gas molecules and the surroundings are those that determine the point-like collisions of the molecules with the walls
* In the simplest case, there are no long-range forces between the molecules of the gas and the surroundings.

The assumption of spherical particles is necessary so that there are no rotational modes allowed, unlike in a diatomic gas. The following three assumptions are very related: molecules are hard, collisions are elastic, and there are no inter-molecular forces. The assumption that the space between particles is much larger than the particles themselves is of paramount importance, and explains why the ideal gas approximation fails at high pressures.

== Heat capacity ==
The dimensionless heat capacity at constant volume is generally defined by
: formula_13
where is the entropy. This quantity is generally a function of temperature due to intermolecular and intramolecular forces, but for moderate temperatures it is approximately constant. Specifically, the Equipartition Theorem predicts that the constant for a monatomic gas is  =  while for a diatomic gas it is  =  if vibrations are neglected (which is often an excellent approximation). Since the heat capacity depends on the atomic or molecular nature of the gas, macroscopic measurements on heat capacity provide useful information on the microscopic structure of the molecules.

The dimensionless heat capacity at constant pressure of an ideal gas is:
: formula_14
where is the enthalpy of the gas.

Sometimes, a distinction is made between an ideal gas, where and could vary with temperature, and a perfect gas, for which this is not the case.

The ratio of the constant volume and constant pressure heat capacity is the adiabatic index
: formula_15

For air, which is a mixture of gases that are mainly diatomic (nitrogen and oxygen), this ratio is often assumed to be 7/5, the value predicted by the classical Equipartition Theorem for diatomic gases.

== Entropy ==
Using the results of thermodynamics only, we can go a long way in determining the expression for the entropy of an ideal gas. This is an important step since, according to the theory of thermodynamic potentials, if we can express the entropy as a function of ( is a thermodynamic potential), volume and the number of particles , then we will have a complete statement of the thermodynamic behavior of the ideal gas. We will be able to derive both the ideal gas law and the expression for internal energy from it.

Since the entropy is an exact differential, using the chain rule, the change in entropy when going from a reference state 0 to some other state with entropy may be written as
: formula_16
where the reference variables may be functions of the number of particles . Using the definition of the heat capacity at constant volume for the first differential and the appropriate Maxwell relation for the second, we have
: formula_17

Expressing in terms of as developed in the above section, differentiating the ideal gas equation of state, and integrating yields
: formula_18
which implies that the entropy may be expressed as
: formula_19
where all constants have been incorporated into the logarithm as which is some function of the particle number having the same dimensions as in order that the argument of the logarithm be dimensionless. We now impose the constraint that the entropy is extensive, meaning that when the extensive parameters ( and ) are multiplied by a constant, the entropy is multiplied by the same constant. Mathematically:
: formula_20

From this we find an equation for the function :
: formula_21

Differentiating this with respect to , setting equal to 1, and then solving the differential equation yields
: formula_22
where may vary for different gases but is independent of the thermodynamic state of the gas. It has the dimensions of . Substituting into the equation for the entropy,
: formula_23
and using the expression for the internal energy of an ideal gas, the entropy may be written
: formula_24

Since this is an expression for entropy in terms of , , and , it is a fundamental equation from which all other properties of the ideal gas may be derived.

This is about as far as we can go using thermodynamics alone. Note that the above equation is flawed – as the temperature approaches zero, the entropy approaches negative infinity, in contradiction to the third law of thermodynamics. In the above &quot;ideal&quot; development, there is a critical point, not at absolute zero, at which the argument of the logarithm becomes unity, and the entropy becomes zero. This is unphysical. The above equation is a good approximation only when the argument of the logarithm is much larger than unity – the concept of an ideal gas breaks down at low values of . Nevertheless, there will be a &quot;best&quot; value of the constant in the sense that the predicted entropy is as close as possible to the actual entropy, given the flawed assumption of ideality. A quantum-mechanical derivation of this constant is developed in the derivation of the Sackur–Tetrode equation, which expresses the entropy of a monatomic () ideal gas. In the Sackur–Tetrode theory the constant depends only upon the mass of the gas particle. The Sackur–Tetrode equation also suffers from a divergent entropy at absolute zero but is a good approximation for the entropy of a monatomic ideal gas for high enough temperatures.

An alternative way of expressing the change in entropy is
formula_25

== Thermodynamic potentials ==

Expressing the entropy as a function of , , and :
: formula_26

The chemical potential of the ideal gas is calculated from the corresponding equation of state (see thermodynamic potential):
: formula_27
where is the Gibbs free energy and is equal to so that:
: formula_28

The chemical potential is usually referenced to the potential at some standard pressure &quot;Po&quot; so that, with formula_29:
: formula_30

For a mixture (&quot;j&quot;=1,2...) of ideal gases, each at partial pressure &quot;Pj&quot;, it can be shown that the chemical potential &quot;μj&quot; will be given by the above expression with the pressure &quot;P&quot; replaced by &quot;Pj&quot;.

The thermodynamic potentials for an ideal gas can now be written as functions of , , and as:
where, as before,
: formula_31.

The most informative way of writing the potentials is in terms of their natural variables, since each of these equations can be used to derive all of the other thermodynamic variables of the system. In terms of their natural variables, the thermodynamic potentials of a single-species ideal gas are:
: formula_32
: formula_33
: formula_34
: formula_35

In statistical mechanics, the relationship between the Helmholtz free energy and the partition function is fundamental, and is used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of matter; see configuration integral for more details.

== Speed of sound ==
The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by the Newton-Laplace formula:
: formula_36
where the isentropic Bulk modulus formula_37

For an isentropic process of an ideal gas, formula_38, therefore
: formula_39

Here,
* is the adiabatic index ()
* is the entropy per particle of the gas.
* is the mass density of the gas.
* is the pressure of the gas.
* is the universal gas constant
* is the temperature
* is the molar mass of the gas.

== Table of ideal gas equations ==
== Ideal quantum gases ==

In the above-mentioned Sackur–Tetrode equation, the best choice of the entropy constant was found to be proportional to the quantum thermal wavelength of a particle, and the point at which the argument of the logarithm becomes zero is roughly equal to the point at which the average distance between particles becomes equal to the thermal wavelength. In fact, quantum theory itself predicts the same thing. Any gas behaves as an ideal gas at high enough temperature and low enough density, but at the point where the Sackur–Tetrode equation begins to break down, the gas will begin to behave as a quantum gas, composed of either bosons or fermions. (See the gas in a box article for a derivation of the ideal quantum gases, including the ideal Boltzmann gas.)

Gases tend to behave as an ideal gas over a wider range of pressures when the temperature reaches the Boyle temperature.

=== Ideal Boltzmann gas ===

The ideal Boltzmann gas yields the same results as the classical thermodynamic gas, but makes the following identification for the undetermined constant :
: formula_40
where is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the gas and is the degeneracy of states.

=== Ideal Bose and Fermi gases ===

An ideal gas of bosons (e.g. a photon gas) will be governed by Bose–Einstein statistics and the distribution of energy will be in the form of a Bose–Einstein distribution. An ideal gas of fermions will be governed by Fermi–Dirac statistics and the distribution of energy will be in the form of a Fermi–Dirac distribution.

<doc id="65907" wikidata="Q1044799" url="?curid=65907" title="Elastic collision">
<text>In physics, an elastic collision is an encounter (collision) between two bodies in which the total kinetic energy of the two bodies remains the same. In an ideal, perfectly elastic collision, there is no net loss of kinetic energy into other forms such as heat, noise, or potential energy.

During the collision of small objects, kinetic energy is first converted to potential energy associated with a repulsive or attractive force between the particles (when the particles move against this force, i.e. the angle between the force and the relative velocity is obtuse), then this potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy (when the particles move with this force, i.e. the angle between the force and the relative velocity is acute).

Collisions of atoms are elastic, for example Rutherford backscattering.

A useful special case of elastic collision is when the two bodies have equal mass, in which case they will simply exchange their momenta.

The &quot;molecules&quot;—as distinct from atoms—of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules’ translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision. At any instant, half the collisions are, to a varying extent, &quot;inelastic collisions&quot; (the pair possesses less kinetic energy in their translational motions after the collision than before), and half could be described as “super-elastic” (possessing &quot;more&quot; kinetic energy after the collision than before). Averaged across the entire sample, molecular collisions can be regarded as essentially elastic as long as Planck&#x27;s law forbids energy from being carried away by black-body photons.

In the case of macroscopic bodies, perfectly elastic collisions are an ideal never fully realized, but approximated by the interactions of objects such as billiard balls.

When considering energies, possible rotational energy before and/or after a collision may also play a role. 

==Equations==

===One-dimensional Newtonian===
In any collision without an external force, momentum is conserved; but in an elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved. Consider particles A and B with masses &quot;m&quot;A, &quot;m&quot;B, and velocities &quot;v&quot;A1, &quot;v&quot;B1 before collision, &quot;v&quot;A2, &quot;v&quot;B2 after collision. The conservation of momentum before and after the collision is expressed by:
formula_1

Likewise, the conservation of the total kinetic energy is expressed by:
formula_2

These equations may be solved directly to find formula_3 when formula_4 are known:

formula_5

Alternatively the final velocity of a particle, v2 (vA2 or vB2) is expressed by:

formula_6

Where:
*e is the coefficient of restitution.
*vCoM is the velocity of the center of mass of the system of two particles:
formula_7
*v1 (vA1 or vB1) is the initial velocity of the particle.

If both masses are the same, we have a trivial solution:
formula_8
This simply corresponds to the bodies exchanging their initial velocities with each other.

As can be expected, the solution is invariant under adding a constant to all velocities (Galilean relativity), which is like using a frame of reference with constant translational velocity. Indeed, to derive the equations, one may first change the frame of reference so that one of the known velocities is zero, determine the unknown velocities in the new frame of reference, and convert back to the original frame of reference.

====Examples====

;Before collision:
:Ball A: mass = 3 kg, velocity = 4 m/s
:Ball B: mass = 5 kg, velocity = 0 m/s
;After collision:
:Ball A: velocity = −1 m/s
:Ball B: velocity = 3 m/s

Another situation:
The following illustrate the case of equal mass, formula_9.

In the limiting case where formula_10 is much larger than formula_11, such as a ping-pong paddle hitting a ping-pong ball or an SUV hitting a trash can, the heavier mass hardly changes velocity, while the lighter mass bounces off, reversing its velocity plus approximately twice that of the heavy one.

In the case of a large formula_12, the value of formula_13 is small if the masses are approximately the same: hitting a much lighter particle does not change the velocity much, hitting a much heavier particle causes the fast particle to bounce back with high speed. This is why a neutron moderator (a medium which slows down fast neutrons, thereby turning them into thermal neutrons capable of sustaining a chain reaction) is a material full of atoms with light nuclei which do not easily absorb neutrons: the lightest nuclei have about the same mass as a neutron.

====Derivation of solution====
To derive the above equations for formula_14 rearrange the kinetic energy and momentum equations:

formula_15

Dividing each side of the top equation by each side of the bottom equation, and using formula_16 gives:

formula_17

That is, the relative velocity of one particle with respect to the other is reversed by the collision. 

Now the above formulas follow from solving a system of linear equations for formula_14 regarding formula_19 as constants:
formula_20
Once formula_13 is determined, formula_22 can be found by symmetry.

====Center of mass frame====
With respect to the center of mass, both velocities are reversed by the collision: a heavy particle moves slowly toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the same low speed, and a light particle moves fast toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the same high speed.

The velocity of the center of mass does not change by the collision. To see this, consider the center of mass at time formula_23 before collision and time formula_24 after collision:
formula_25

Hence, the velocities of the center of mass before and after collision are:
formula_26

The numerators of formula_27 and formula_28 are the total momenta before and after collision. Since momentum is conserved, we have formula_29

===One-dimensional relativistic===
According to special relativity,
formula_30
where &quot;p&quot; denotes momentum of any particle with mass, &quot;v&quot; denotes velocity, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

In the center of momentum frame where the total momentum equals zero, 
formula_31

Here formula_32 represent the rest masses of the two colliding bodies, formula_33 represent their velocities before collision, formula_34 their velocities after collision, formula_35 their momenta, formula_36 is the speed of light in vacuum, and formula_37 denotes the total energy, the sum of rest masses and kinetic energies of the two bodies.

Since the total energy and momentum of the system are conserved and their rest masses do not change, it is shown that the momentum of the colliding body is decided by the rest masses of the colliding bodies, total energy and the total momentum. Relative to the center of momentum frame, the momentum of each colliding body does not change magnitude after collision, but reverses its direction of movement.

Comparing with classical mechanics, which gives accurate results dealing with macroscopic objects moving much slower than the speed of light, total momentum of the two colliding bodies is frame-dependent. In the center of momentum frame, according to classical mechanics,

formula_38

This agrees with the relativistic calculation formula_39 despite other differences. 

One of the postulates in Special Relativity states that the laws of physics, such as conservation of momentum, should be invariant in all inertial frames of reference. In a general inertial frame where the total momentum could be arbitrary,

formula_40
We can look at the two moving bodies as one system of which the total momentum is formula_41 the total energy is formula_37 and its velocity formula_43 is the velocity of its center of mass. Relative to the center of momentum frame the total momentum equals zero. It can be shown that formula_43 is given by:
formula_45
Now the velocities before the collision in the center of momentum frame formula_46 and formula_47 are:
formula_48

When formula_49 and formula_50
formula_51

Therefore, the classical calculation holds true when the speed of both colliding bodies is much lower than the speed of light (~300,000 kilometres per second).

===Relativistic derivation using hyperbolic functions===

Using the so-called &quot;parameter of velocity&quot; formula_52 (usually called the rapidity),

formula_53
we get
formula_54

Relativistic energy and momentum are expressed as follows:
formula_55

Equations sum of energy and momentum colliding masses formula_56 and formula_57 (velocities formula_58 correspond to the velocity parameters formula_59), after dividing by adequate power formula_36 are as follows:
formula_61

and dependent equation, the sum of above equations:
formula_62

subtract squares both sides equations &quot;momentum&quot; from &quot;energy&quot; and use the identity formula_63 after simplifying we get:
formula_64

for non-zero mass, using the hyperbolic trigonometric identity formula_65 we get:
formula_66

as functions formula_67 is even we get two solutions:
formula_68
from the last equation, leading to a non-trivial solution, we solve formula_69 and substitute into the dependent equation, we obtain formula_70 and then formula_71 we have:
formula_72

It is a solution to the problem, but expressed by the parameters of velocity. Return substitution to get the solution for velocities is:
formula_73

Substitute the previous solutions and replace:
formula_74 and formula_75 after long transformation, with substituting:
formula_76
we get:
formula_77

==Two-dimensional==

For the case of two non-spinning colliding bodies in two dimensions, the motion of the bodies is determined by the three conservation laws of momentum, kinetic energy and angular momentum. The overall velocity of each body must be split into two perpendicular velocities: one tangent to the common normal surfaces of the colliding bodies at the point of contact, the other along the line of collision. Since the collision only imparts force along the line of collision, the velocities that are tangent to the point of collision do not change. The velocities along the line of collision can then be used in the same equations as a one-dimensional collision. The final velocities can then be calculated from the two new component velocities and will depend on the point of collision. Studies of two-dimensional collisions are conducted for many bodies in the framework of a two-dimensional gas.
In a center of momentum frame at any time the velocities of the two bodies are in opposite directions, with magnitudes inversely proportional to the masses. In an elastic collision these magnitudes do not change. The directions may change depending on the shapes of the bodies and the point of impact. For example, in the case of spheres the angle depends on the distance between the (parallel) paths of the centers of the two bodies. Any non-zero change of direction is possible: if this distance is zero the velocities are reversed in the collision; if it is close to the sum of the radii of the spheres the two bodies are only slightly deflected.

Assuming that the second particle is at rest before the collision, the angles of deflection of the two particles, formula_78 and formula_79, are related to the angle of deflection formula_80 in the system of the center of mass by
formula_81
The magnitudes of the velocities of the particles after the collision are:
formula_82

===Two-dimensional collision with two moving objects===
The final x and y velocities components of the first ball can be calculated as:
formula_83
where and are the scalar sizes of the two original speeds of the objects, and are their masses, and are their movement angles, that is, formula_84 (meaning moving directly down to the right is either a −45° angle, or a 315° angle), and lowercase phi () is the contact angle. (To get the and velocities of the second ball, one needs to swap all the &#x27;1&#x27; subscripts with &#x27;2&#x27; subscripts.)

This equation is derived from the fact that the interaction between the two bodies is easily calculated along the contact angle, meaning the velocities of the objects can be calculated in one dimension by rotating the x and y axis to be parallel with the contact angle of the objects, and then rotated back to the original orientation to get the true x and y components of the velocities.

In an angle-free representation, the changed velocities are computed using the centers and at the time of contact as

where the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors.

===Other conserved quantities===
In the particular case of particles having equal masses, it can be verified by direct computation from the result above that the scalar product of the velocities before and after the collision are the same, that is formula_85 Although this product is not an additive invariant in the same way that momentum and kinetic energy are for elastic collisions, it seems that preservation of this quantity can nonetheless be used to derive higher-order conservation laws.

===Derivation of two dimensional solution===
The impulse formula_86 during the collision for each particle is:

Conservation of Momentum implies formula_87

Since the force during collision is perpendicular to both particles&#x27; surfaces at the contact point, the impulse is along the line parallel to formula_88, the relative vector between the particles&#x27; center at collision time:
: formula_89 for some formula_90 to be determined and formula_91
Then from ():

From above equations, conservation of kinetic energy now requires:
:formula_92whith formula_93
The both solutions of this equation are formula_94 and formula_95, where formula_94 corresponds to the trivial case of no collision. Substituting the non trivial value of formula_90 in () we get the desired result ().

Since all equations are in vectorial form, this derivation is valid also for three dimensions with spheres.

<text>An inelastic collision, in contrast to an elastic collision, is a collision in which kinetic energy is not conserved due to the action of internal friction.

In collisions of macroscopic bodies, some kinetic energy is turned into vibrational energy of the atoms, causing a heating effect, and the bodies are deformed.

The molecules of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules&#x27; translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision. At any one instant, half the collisions are – to a varying extent – inelastic (the pair possesses less kinetic energy after the collision than before), and half could be described as “super-elastic” (possessing &quot;more&quot; kinetic energy after the collision than before). Averaged across an entire sample, molecular collisions are elastic. 

Although inelastic collisions do not conserve kinetic energy, they do obey conservation of momentum. Simple ballistic pendulum problems obey the conservation of kinetic energy &quot;only&quot; when the block swings to its largest angle.

In nuclear physics, an inelastic collision is one in which the incoming particle causes the nucleus it strikes to become excited or to break up. Deep inelastic scattering is a method of probing the structure of subatomic particles in much the same way as Rutherford probed the inside of the atom (see Rutherford scattering). Such experiments were performed on protons in the late 1960s using high-energy electrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). As in Rutherford scattering, deep inelastic scattering of electrons by proton targets revealed that most of the incident electrons interact very little and pass straight through, with only a small number bouncing back. This indicates that the charge in the proton is concentrated in small lumps, reminiscent of Rutherford&#x27;s discovery that the positive charge in an atom is concentrated at the nucleus. However, in the case of the proton, the evidence suggested three distinct concentrations of charge (quarks) and not one.

==Formula==

The formula for the velocities after a one-dimensional collision is:
formula_1

where

*&quot;v&quot;a is the final velocity of the first object after impact
*&quot;v&quot;b is the final velocity of the second object after impact
*&quot;u&quot;a is the initial velocity of the first object before impact
*&quot;u&quot;b is the initial velocity of the second object before impact
*&quot;m&quot;a is the mass of the first object
*&quot;m&quot;b is the mass of the second object
*&quot;C&quot;R is the coefficient of restitution; if it is 1 we have an elastic collision; if it is 0 we have a perfectly inelastic collision, see below.

In a center of momentum frame the formulas reduce to:

formula_2

For two- and three-dimensional collisions the velocities in these formulas are the components perpendicular to the tangent line/plane at the point of contact.

If assuming the objects are not rotating before or after the collision, the normal impulse is:

formula_3

where formula_4 is the normal vector.

Assuming no friction, this gives the velocity updates:

formula_5

==Perfectly inelastic collision==
A perfectly inelastic collision occurs when the maximum amount of kinetic energy
of a system is lost. In a perfectly inelastic collision, i.e., a zero coefficient of restitution, the colliding particles stick together. In such a collision, kinetic energy is lost by bonding the two bodies together. This bonding energy usually results in a maximum kinetic energy loss of the system. It is necessary to consider conservation of momentum: (Note: In the sliding block example above, momentum of the two body system is only conserved if the surface has zero friction. With friction, momentum of the two bodies is transferred to the surface that the two bodies are sliding upon. Similarly, if there is air resistance, the momentum of the bodies can be transferred to the air.) The equation below holds true for the two-body (Body A, Body B) system collision in the example above. In this example, momentum of the system is conserved because there is no friction between the sliding bodies and the surface.
formula_6
where &quot;v&quot; is the final velocity, which is hence given by
formula_7The reduction of total kinetic energy is equal to the total kinetic energy before the collision in a center of momentum frame with respect to the system of two particles, because in such a frame the kinetic energy after the collision is zero. In this frame most of the kinetic energy before the collision is that of the particle with the smaller mass. In another frame, in addition to the reduction of kinetic energy there may be a transfer of kinetic energy from one particle to the other; the fact that this depends on the frame shows how relative this is. The change in kinetic energy is hence:
formula_8

where μ is the reduced mass and urel is the relative velocity of the bodies before collision. With time reversed we have the situation of two objects pushed away from each other, e.g. shooting a projectile, or a rocket applying thrust (compare the derivation of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation).

==Partially inelastic collisions==
Partially inelastic collisions are the most common form of collisions in the real world. In this type of collision, the objects involved in the collisions do not stick, but some kinetic energy is still lost. Friction, sound and heat are some ways the kinetic energy can be lost through partial inelastic collisions.

<doc id="65909" wikidata="Q1531016" url="?curid=65909" title="Neonatal heel prick">
<text>The neonatal heel prick is a blood collection procedure done on newborns. It consists of making a pinprick puncture in one heel of the newborn to collect their blood. This technique is used frequently as the main way to collect blood from neonates. Other techniques include venous or arterial needle sticks, cord blood sampling, or umbilical line collection. This technique is often utilized for the Guthrie test, where it is used to soak the blood into pre-printed collection cards known as Guthrie cards.

The classical Guthrie test is named after Robert Guthrie, an American bacteriologist and physician who devised it in 1962. The test has been widely used throughout North America and Europe as one of the core newborn screening tests since the late 1960s. The test was initially a bacterial inhibition assay, but is gradually being replaced in many areas by newer techniques such as tandem mass spectrometry that can detect a wider variety of congenital diseases.

==Detected diseases==
The blood samples can be used for a variety of metabolic tests to detect genetic conditions, including:

* Immunoreactive trypsinogen to detect cystic fibrosis.
* Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD or Branched Chain Ketonuria) a rare disorder where an error in metabolism inhibits the breakdown of amino acid leucine, isoleucine and valine. It can impair brain development.
* Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)
* Phenylketonuria, a disorder where an error in amino acid metabolism can impair brain development (PKU)
* Sickle-cell disease
* Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or Thyroxin (T4) to detect congenital hypothyroidism and hence prevent cretinism.
* Isovaleric acidemia (IVA)
* Homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)
* 17-hydroxy-progesterone (17-OHP) to detect adrenogenital syndrome, also known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia
* Galactosemia

==Mechanism==
The test uses the growth of a strain of bacteria on a specially-prepared agar plate as a sign for the presence of high levels of phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate. The compound B-2-thienylalanine will inhibit the growth of the bacterium &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; (ATCC 6051) on minimal culture media. If phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate is added to the medium, then growth is restored. Such compounds will be present in excess in the blood or urine of patients with PKU. If a suitably-prepared sample of blood or urine is applied to the seeded agar plate, the growth of the bacteria in the test will be a positive indicator for PKU in the patient.

To prepare the sample for application, a small amount of blood (from a heel puncture, for example) or urine (from a diaper, for example) is applied to a piece of filter paper. Then a small disc is punched from the center of the spot of blood or urine, and the disc applied to the surface of a seeded, minimal-medium agar plate that contains added beta-2-thienylalanine. If the sample contains phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate then these compounds will diffuse into the agar medium. If their concentrations are high enough (as with the excess levels seen with PKU), bacteria will grow under the disc, but not elsewhere. Generally an overnight incubation is enough to determine whether phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate are present in unusual concentrations in blood or urine.

==Timing==
The blood spot sample should be taken between 48 and 72 hours of age for all babies regardless of medical condition, milk feeding and prematurity. For the purpose of screening, date of birth is day 0 (some IT systems record date of birth as day 1). False positives and false negatives can sometimes occur when the screening tests are performed before 48 hours.

When the immunoassay method is utilized as a screening method for quantifying 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) in dried blood spots, it exhibits a significant rate of false positive results. As per the clinical practice guideline issued by the Endocrine Society in 2018, employing LC-MS/MS to measure 17OHP and other adrenal steroid hormones (such as 21-deoxycortisol and androstenedione) is recommended as a supplementary screening approach to enhance the accuracy of positive predictions.

With genetic tests becoming more common, a wide variety of tests may use the blood drawn by this method. Many neonatal units (SCBUs) now use this method to carry out the daily blood tests (blood count, electrolytes) required to check the progress of ill neonates.

==Data retention controversy==
In Ireland, a controversy emerged in 2012 whereby a number of hospitals retained heel prick test cards and thereby a DNA database with over a million samples from 1984, without consent or notification of parents. This resulted in a ten-year rolling destruction cycle being introduced. Similar practices exist in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and several states of the United States.

==Heel stick wound==
Heel stick wounds are a cutaneous condition characterized by a break in the skin caused by neonatal heel prick. The heel stick is an important medical screening for the child and causes low levels of pain.

<doc id="65910" wikidata="Q173350" url="?curid=65910" title="Printed circuit board">
<text>A printed circuit board (PCB), also called printed wiring board (PWB), is a laminated sandwich structure of conductive and insulating layers, each with a pattern of traces, planes and other features (similar to wires on a flat surface) etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. PCBs are used to connect or &quot;wire&quot; components to one another in an electronic circuit. Electrical components may be fixed to conductive pads on the outer layers, generally by soldering, which both electrically connects and mechanically fastens the components to the board. Another manufacturing process adds vias, metal-lined drilled holes that enable electrical interconnections between conductive layers, to boards with more than a single side.
Printed circuit boards are used in nearly all electronic products today. Alternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction, both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Electronic design automation software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation. Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout has to be done only once. PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.

PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (stacked layers of substrate with copper plating sandwiched between each and on the outside layers). Multi-layer PCBs provide much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components. The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of surface-mount technology. However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.

The world market for bare PCBs exceeded US$60.2 billion in 2014, and was estimated at $80.33 billion in 2024, forecast to be $96.57 billion for 2029, growing at 4.87% per annum.

== History ==

=== Predecessors ===
Before the development of printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic circuits were wired point-to-point on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering, or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.

Development of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century. In 1903, a German inventor, Albert Hanson, described flat foil conductors laminated to an insulating board, in multiple layers. Thomas Edison experimented with chemical methods of plating conductors onto linen paper in 1904. Arthur Berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in the UK, and in the United States Max Schoop obtained a patent to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask. Charles Ducas in 1925 patented a method of electroplating circuit patterns.

Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was John Sargrove&#x27;s 1936–1947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) that sprayed metal onto a Bakelite plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.

=== Early PCBs ===
The Austrian engineer Paul Eisler invented the printed circuit as part of a radio set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines.

Around 1943 the United States began to use the technology on a large scale to make proximity fuzes for use in World War II. Such fuzes required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Harry W. Rubinstein its Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors. This invention also represents a step in the development of integrated circuit technology, as not only wiring but also passive components were fabricated on the ceramic substrate.

=== Post-war developments ===
In 1948, the US released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the &quot;Auto-Sembly&quot; process was developed by the United States Army. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by Geoffrey Dummer, then at the RRDE.

Motorola was an early leader in bringing the process into consumer electronics, announcing in August 1952 the adoption of &quot;plated circuits&quot; in home radios after six years of research and a $1M investment. Motorola soon began using its trademarked term for the process, PLAcir, in its consumer radio advertisements. Hallicrafters released its first &quot;foto-etch&quot; printed circuit product, a clock-radio, on November 1, 1952.

Even as circuit boards became available, the point-to-point chassis construction method remained in common use in industry (such as TV and hi-fi sets) into at least the late 1960s. Printed circuit boards were introduced to reduce the size, weight, and cost of parts of the circuitry. In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain one or more circuit boards.

Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and soldered to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called &quot;through-hole&quot; construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the &quot;Auto-Sembly&quot; process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are inefficient since drilling holes is expensive and consumes drill bits and the protruding wires are cut off and discarded.

From the 1980s onward, small surface mount parts have been used increasingly instead of through-hole components; this has led to smaller boards for a given functionality and lower production costs, but with some additional difficulty in servicing faulty boards.

In the 1990s the use of multilayer surface boards became more frequent. As a result, size was further minimized and both flexible and rigid PCBs were incorporated in different devices. In 1995 PCB manufacturers began using microvia technology to produce High-Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs.

=== Recent advances ===
Recent advances in 3D printing have meant that there are several new techniques in PCB creation. 3D printed electronics (PEs) can be utilized to print items layer by layer and subsequently the item can be printed with a liquid ink that contains electronic functionalities.

HDI (High Density Interconnect) technology allows for a denser design on the PCB and thus potentially smaller PCBs with more traces and components in a given area. As a result, the paths between components can be shorter. HDIs use blind/buried vias, or a combination that includes microvias. With multi-layer HDI PCBs the interconnection of several vias stacked on top of each other (stacked vías, instead of one deep buried via) can be made stronger, thus enhancing reliability in all conditions. The most common applications for HDI technology are computer and mobile phone components as well as medical equipment and military communication equipment. A 4-layer HDI microvia PCB is equivalent in quality to an 8-layer through-hole PCB, so HDI technology can reduce costs. HDI PCBs are often made using build-up film such as ajinomoto build-up film, which is also used in the production of flip chip packages. Some PCBs have optical waveguides, similar to optical fibers built on the PCB.

== Composition ==
A basic PCB consists of a flat sheet of insulating material and a layer of copper foil, laminated to the substrate. Chemical etching divides the copper into separate conducting lines called tracks or &quot;circuit traces&quot;, pads for connections, vias to pass connections between layers of copper, and features such as solid conductive areas for electromagnetic shielding or other purposes. The tracks function as wires fixed in place, and are insulated from each other by air and the board substrate material. The surface of a PCB may have a coating that protects the copper from corrosion and reduces the chances of solder shorts between traces or undesired electrical contact with stray bare wires. For its function in helping to prevent solder shorts, the coating is called solder resist or solder mask.

The pattern to be etched into each copper layer of a PCB is called the &quot;artwork&quot;. The etching is usually done using photoresist which is coated onto the PCB, then exposed to light projected in the pattern of the artwork. The resist material protects the copper from dissolution into the etching solution. The etched board is then cleaned. A PCB design can be mass-reproduced in a way similar to the way photographs can be mass-duplicated from film negatives using a photographic printer.

FR-4 glass epoxy is the most common insulating substrate. Another substrate material is cotton paper impregnated with phenolic resin, often tan or brown.

When a PCB has no components installed, it is less ambiguously called a &quot;printed wiring board&quot; (&quot;PWB&quot;) or &quot;etched wiring board&quot;. However, the term &quot;printed wiring board&quot; has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a &quot;printed circuit assembly&quot; (&quot;PCA&quot;), &quot;printed circuit board assembly&quot; or &quot;PCB assembly&quot; (&quot;PCBA&quot;). In informal usage, the term &quot;printed circuit board&quot; most commonly means &quot;printed circuit assembly&quot; (with components). The IPC preferred term for an assembled board is &quot;circuit card assembly&quot; (&quot;CCA&quot;), and for an assembled backplane it is &quot;backplane assembly&quot;. &quot;Card&quot; is another widely used informal term for a &quot;printed circuit assembly&quot;.
For example, expansion card.

A PCB may be printed with a legend identifying the components, test points, or identifying text. Originally, silkscreen printing was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used. Normally the legend does not affect the function of a PCBA.

=== Layers ===
A printed circuit board can have multiple layers of copper which almost always are arranged in pairs. The number of layers and the interconnection designed between them (vias, PTHs) provide a general estimate of the board complexity. Using more layers allow for more routing options and better control of signal integrity, but are also time-consuming and costly to manufacture. Likewise, selection of the vias for the board also allow fine tuning of the board size, escaping of signals off complex ICs, routing, and long term reliability, but are tightly coupled with production complexity and cost.

One of the simplest boards to produce is the two-layer board. It has copper on both sides that are referred to as external layers; multi layer boards sandwich additional internal layers of copper and insulation. After two-layer PCBs, the next step up is the four-layer. The four layer board adds significantly more routing options in the internal layers as compared to the two layer board, and often some portion of the internal layers is used as ground plane or power plane, to achieve better signal integrity, higher signaling frequencies, lower EMI, and better power supply decoupling.

In multi-layer boards, the layers of material are laminated together in an alternating sandwich: copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc.; each plane of copper is etched, and any internal vias (that will not extend to both outer surfaces of the finished multilayer board) are plated-through, before the layers are laminated together. Only the outer layers need be coated; the inner copper layers are protected by the adjacent substrate layers.

=== Component mounting ===


&quot;Through hole&quot; components are mounted by their wire leads passing through the board and soldered to traces on the other side. &quot;Surface mount&quot; components are attached by their leads to copper traces on the same side of the board. A board may use both methods for mounting components. PCBs with only through-hole mounted components are now uncommon. Surface mounting is used for transistors, diodes, IC chips, resistors, and capacitors. Through-hole mounting may be used for some large components such as electrolytic capacitors and connectors.

The first PCBs used through-hole technology, mounting electronic components by lead inserted through holes on one side of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side. Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides. Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part&#x27;s mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be soldered either manually or by a wave soldering machine.

Surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s, gained momentum in the early 1980s, and became widely used by the mid-1990s. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates compared with through-hole circuit boards. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper. However, prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages, and some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.

=== Electrical properties ===
Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching. Its resistance, determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return. For microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in a planar form such as stripline or microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; conversely, they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design, as in distributed-element filters, antennae, and fuses, obviating the need for additional discrete components. High density interconnects (HDI) PCBs have tracks or vias with a width or diameter of under 152 micrometers.

== Materials ==

=== Laminates ===
Laminates are manufactured by curing layers of cloth or paper with thermoset resin under pressure and heat to form an integral final piece of uniform thickness. They can be up to in width and length. Varying cloth weaves (threads per inch or cm), cloth thickness, and resin percentage are used to achieve the desired final thickness and dielectric characteristics. Available standard laminate thickness are listed in
ANSI/IPC-D-275.

The cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate&#x27;s type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant, the dielectric constant (er), the loss tangent (tan δ), the tensile strength, the shear strength, the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the Z-axis expansion coefficient (how much the thickness changes with temperature).

There are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.

FR-4 is by far the most common material used today. The board stock with unetched copper on it is called &quot;copper-clad laminate&quot;.

With decreasing size of board features and increasing frequencies, small non-homogeneities like uneven distribution of fiberglass or other filler, thickness variations, and bubbles in the resin matrix, and the associated local variations in the dielectric constant, are gaining importance.

=== Key substrate parameters ===
The circuit-board substrates are usually dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin) and a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes non-woven, glass fibers, sometimes even paper), and in some cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).

The reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials: woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially non-homogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern. Non-woven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.

The substrates are characterized by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical (glass transition temperature, tensile strength, shear strength, thermal expansion), electrical (dielectric constant, loss tangent, dielectric breakdown voltage, leakage current, tracking resistance...), and others (e.g. moisture absorption).

At the glass transition temperature the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding Tg then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require a matrix with a high Tg.

The materials used determine the substrate&#x27;s dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the signal propagation speed, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat a dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as is achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.

Dielectric breakdown voltage determines the maximum voltage gradient the material can be subjected to before suffering a breakdown (conduction, or arcing, through the dielectric).

Tracking resistance determines how the material resists high voltage electrical discharges creeping over the board surface.

Loss tangent determines how much of the electromagnetic energy from the signals in the conductors is absorbed in the board material. This factor is important for high frequencies. Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common engineering error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. Signal degradation by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an eye pattern.

Moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water also may be soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials are not too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuit board materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating, as during soldering, and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for &quot;popcorning&quot; damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required to dry them prior to soldering.

=== Common substrates ===
Often encountered materials:
* FR-2, phenolic paper or phenolic cotton paper, paper impregnated with a phenol formaldehyde resin. Common in consumer electronics with single-sided boards. Electrical properties inferior to FR-4. Poor arc resistance. Generally rated to 105 °C. 
* FR-4, a woven fiberglass cloth impregnated with an epoxy resin. Low water absorption (up to about 0.15%), good insulation properties, good arc resistance. Very common. Several grades with somewhat different properties are available. Typically rated to 130 °C. 
* Aluminum, or &quot;metal core board&quot; or insulated metal substrate (IMS), clad with thermally conductive thin dielectric - used for parts requiring significant cooling - power switches, LEDs. Consists of usually single, sometimes double layer thin circuit board based on e.g. FR-4, laminated on aluminum sheet metal, commonly 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2 or 3 mm thick. The thicker laminates sometimes also come with thicker copper metalization.
* Flexible substrates - can be a standalone copper-clad foil or can be laminated to a thin stiffener, e.g. 50-130 μm
** Kapton or UPILEX, a polyimide foil. Used for flexible printed circuits, in this form common in small form-factor consumer electronics or for flexible interconnects. Resistant to high temperatures.
** Pyralux, a polyimide-fluoropolymer composite foil. Copper layer can delaminate during soldering.

Less-often encountered materials:

* FR-1, like FR-2, typically specified to 105 °C, some grades rated to 130 °C. Room-temperature punchable. Similar to cardboard. Poor moisture resistance. Low arc resistance.

* Polyimide, a high-temperature polymer. Expensive, high-performance. Higher water absorption (0.4%). Can be used from cryogenic temperatures to over 260 °C.

=== Copper thickness ===

Copper thickness of PCBs can be specified directly or as the weight of copper per area (in ounce per square foot) which is easier to measure. One ounce per square foot is 1.344 mils or 34 micrometers thickness (0.001344 inches). &quot;Heavy copper&quot; is a layer exceeding three ounces of copper per ft2, or approximately 4.2 mils (105 μm) (0.0042 inches) thick. Heavy copper layers are used for high current or to help dissipate heat.

On the common FR-4 substrates, 1 oz copper per ft2 (35 μm) is the most common thickness; 2 oz (70 μm) and 0.5 oz (17.5 μm) thickness is often an option. Less common are 12 and 105 μm, 9 μm is sometimes available on some substrates. Flexible substrates typically have thinner metalization. Metal-core boards for high power devices commonly use thicker copper; 35 μm is usual but also 140 and 400 μm can be encountered.

In the US, copper foil thickness is specified in units of ounces per square foot (oz/ft2), commonly referred to simply as &quot;ounce&quot;. Common thicknesses are 1/2 oz/ft2 (150 g/m), 1 oz/ft2 (300 g/m), 2 oz/ft2 (600 g/m), and 3 oz/ft2 (900 g/m). These work out to thicknesses of 17.05 μm (0.67 thou), 34.1 μm (1.34 thou), 68.2 μm (2.68 thou), and 102.3 μm (4.02 thou), respectively.

1/2 oz/ft2 foil is not widely used as a finished copper weight, but is used for outer layers when plating for through holes will increase the finished copper weight Some PCB manufacturers refer to 1 oz/ft2 copper foil as having a thickness of 35 μm (may also be referred to as 35 μ, 35 micron, or 35 mic).
* 1/0 – denotes 1 oz/ft2 copper one side, with no copper on the other side.
* 1/1 – denotes 1 oz/ft2 copper on both sides.
* H/0 or H/H – denotes 0.5 oz/ft2 copper on one or both sides, respectively.
* 2/0 or 2/2 – denotes 2 oz/ft2 copper on one or both sides, respectively.

== Manufacturing ==
Printed circuit board manufacturing involves manufacturing bare printed circuit boards and then populating them with electronic components. In large-scale board manufacturing, multiple PCBs are grouped on a single panel for efficient processing. After assembly, they are separated (depaneled).

== Types ==
=== Breakout boards ===

A minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a breakout board. The purpose of a breakout board is to &quot;break out&quot; the leads of a component on separate terminals so that manual connections to them can be made easily. Breakout boards are especially used for surface-mount components or any components with fine lead pitch.

Advanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate, such as capacitors and integrated circuits, to reduce the amount of space taken up by components on the surface of the PCB while improving electrical characteristics.

=== Multiwire boards ===
Multiwire is a patented technique of interconnection which uses machine-routed insulated wires embedded in a non-conducting matrix (often plastic resin). It was used during the 1980s and 1990s. Multiwire is still available through Hitachi.

Since it was quite easy to stack interconnections (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in a straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.

Corrections can be made to a Multiwire board layout more easily than to a PCB layout.

===Cordwood construction===


Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space was at a premium (such as fuzes, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The name comes from the way axial-lead components (capacitors, resistors, coils, and diodes) are stacked in parallel rows and columns, like a stack of firewood. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had to be used to allow reliable interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause mechanical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components at the cost of being difficult to remove the boards or replace any component that is not at the edge.

Before the advent of integrated circuits, this method allowed the highest possible component packing density; because of this, it was used by a number of computer vendors including Control Data Corporation.

== Uses ==
Printed circuit boards have been used as an alternative to their typical use for electronic and biomedical engineering thanks to the versatility of their layers, especially the copper layer. PCB layers have been used to fabricate sensors, such as capacitive pressure sensors and accelerometers, actuators such as microvalves and microheaters, as well as platforms of sensors and actuators for Lab-on-a-chip (LoC), for example to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fuel cells, to name a few.

== Repair ==
Manufacturers may not support component-level repair of printed circuit boards because of the relatively low cost to replace compared with the time and cost of troubleshooting to a component level. In board-level repair, the technician identifies the board (PCA) on which the fault resides and replaces it. This shift is economically efficient from a manufacturer&#x27;s point of view but is also materially wasteful, as a circuit board with hundreds of functional components may be discarded and replaced due to the failure of one minor and inexpensive part, such as a resistor or capacitor, and this practice is a significant contributor to the problem of e-waste.

== Legislation ==
In many countries (including all European Single Market participants, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and China), legislation restricts the use of lead, cadmium, and mercury in electrical equipment. PCBs sold in such countries must therefore use lead-free manufacturing processes and lead-free solder, and attached components must themselves be compliant.

Safety Standard UL 796 covers component safety requirements for printed wiring boards for use as components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as flammability, maximum operating temperature, electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.

<text>In physics, equations of motion are equations that describe the behavior of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time. More specifically, the equations of motion describe the behavior of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables. These variables are usually spatial coordinates and time, but may include momentum components. The most general choice are generalized coordinates which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system. The functions are defined in a Euclidean space in classical mechanics, but are replaced by curved spaces in relativity. If the dynamics of a system is known, the equations are the solutions for the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics.

==Types==
There are two main descriptions of motion: dynamics and kinematics. Dynamics is general, since the momenta, forces and energy of the particles are taken into account. In this instance, sometimes the term &quot;dynamics&quot; refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies (e.g., Newton&#x27;s second law or Euler–Lagrange equations), and sometimes to the solutions to those equations.

However, kinematics is simpler. It concerns only variables derived from the positions of objects and time. In circumstances of constant acceleration, these simpler equations of motion are usually referred to as the SUVAT equations, arising from the definitions of kinematic quantities: displacement (), initial velocity (), final velocity (), acceleration (), and time ().

A differential equation of motion, usually identified as some physical law (for example, F = ma), and applying definitions of physical quantities, is used to set up an equation to solve a kinematics problem. Solving the differential equation will lead to a general solution with arbitrary constants, the arbitrariness corresponding to a set of solutions. A particular solution can be obtained by setting the initial values, which fixes the values of the constants.

Stated formally, in general, an equation of motion is a function of the position of the object, its velocity (the first time derivative of , ), and its acceleration (the second derivative of , ), and time . Euclidean vectors in 3D are denoted throughout in bold. This is equivalent to saying an equation of motion in is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in ,

formula_1

where is time, and each overdot denotes one time derivative. The initial conditions are given by the &quot;constant&quot; values at ,

formula_2

The solution to the equation of motion, with specified initial values, describes the system for all times after . Other dynamical variables like the momentum of the object, or quantities derived from and like angular momentum, can be used in place of as the quantity to solve for from some equation of motion, although the position of the object at time is by far the most sought-after quantity.

Sometimes, the equation will be linear and is more likely to be exactly solvable. In general, the equation will be non-linear, and cannot be solved exactly so a variety of approximations must be used. The solutions to nonlinear equations may show chaotic behavior depending on how &quot;sensitive&quot; the system is to the initial conditions.

==History==

Kinematics, dynamics and the mathematical models of the universe developed incrementally over three millennia, thanks to many thinkers, only some of whose names we know. In antiquity, priests, astrologers and astronomers predicted solar and lunar eclipses, the solstices and the equinoxes of the Sun and the period of the Moon. But they had nothing other than a set of algorithms to guide them. Equations of motion were not written down for another thousand years.

Medieval scholars in the thirteenth century — for example at the relatively new universities in Oxford and Paris — drew on ancient mathematicians (Euclid and Archimedes) and philosophers (Aristotle) to develop a new body of knowledge, now called physics.

At Oxford, Merton College sheltered a group of scholars devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, who were of similar stature to the intellectuals at the University of Paris. Thomas Bradwardine extended Aristotelian quantities such as distance and velocity, and assigned intensity and extension to them. Bradwardine suggested an exponential law involving force, resistance, distance, velocity and time. Nicholas Oresme further extended Bradwardine&#x27;s arguments. The Merton school proved that the quantity of motion of a body undergoing a uniformly accelerated motion is equal to the quantity of a uniform motion at the speed achieved halfway through the accelerated motion.

For writers on kinematics before Galileo, since small time intervals could not be measured, the affinity between time and motion was obscure. They used time as a function of distance, and in free fall, greater velocity as a result of greater elevation. Only Domingo de Soto, a Spanish theologian, in his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; published in 1545, after defining &quot;uniform difform&quot; motion (which is uniformly accelerated motion) – the word velocity was not used – as proportional to time, declared correctly that this kind of motion was identifiable with freely falling bodies and projectiles, without his proving these propositions or suggesting a formula relating time, velocity and distance. De Soto&#x27;s comments are remarkably correct regarding the definitions of acceleration (acceleration was a rate of change of motion (velocity) in time) and the observation that acceleration would be negative during ascent.

Discourses such as these spread throughout Europe, shaping the work of Galileo Galilei and others, and helped in laying the foundation of kinematics. Galileo deduced the equation in his work geometrically, using the Merton rule, now known as a special case of one of the equations of kinematics.

Galileo was the first to show that the path of a projectile is a parabola. Galileo had an understanding of centrifugal force and gave a correct definition of momentum. This emphasis of momentum as a fundamental quantity in dynamics is of prime importance. He measured momentum by the product of velocity and weight; mass is a later concept, developed by Huygens and Newton. In the swinging of a simple pendulum, Galileo says in &quot;Discourses&quot; that &quot;every momentum acquired in the descent along an arc is equal to that which causes the same moving body to ascend through the same arc.&quot; His analysis on projectiles indicates that Galileo had grasped the first law and the second law of motion. He did not generalize and make them applicable to bodies not subject to the earth&#x27;s gravitation. That step was Newton&#x27;s contribution.

The term &quot;inertia&quot; was used by Kepler who applied it to bodies at rest. (The first law of motion is now often called the law of inertia.)

Galileo did not fully grasp the third law of motion, the law of the equality of action and reaction, though he corrected some errors of Aristotle. With Stevin and others Galileo also wrote on statics. He formulated the principle of the parallelogram of forces, but he did not fully recognize its scope.

Galileo also was interested by the laws of the pendulum, his first observations of which were as a young man. In 1583, while he was praying in the cathedral at Pisa, his attention was arrested by the motion of the great lamp lighted and left swinging, referencing his own pulse for time keeping. To him the period appeared the same, even after the motion had greatly diminished, discovering the isochronism of the pendulum.

More careful experiments carried out by him later, and described in his Discourses, revealed the period of oscillation varies with the square root of length but is independent of the mass the pendulum.

Thus we arrive at René Descartes, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, et al.; and the evolved forms of the equations of motion that begin to be recognized as the modern ones.

Later the equations of motion also appeared in electrodynamics, when describing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force is the general equation which serves as the definition of what is meant by an electric field and magnetic field. With the advent of special relativity and general relativity, the theoretical modifications to spacetime meant the classical equations of motion were also modified to account for the finite speed of light, and curvature of spacetime. In all these cases the differential equations were in terms of a function describing the particle&#x27;s trajectory in terms of space and time coordinates, as influenced by forces or energy transformations.

However, the equations of quantum mechanics can also be considered &quot;equations of motion&quot;, since they are differential equations of the wavefunction, which describes how a quantum state behaves analogously using the space and time coordinates of the particles. There are analogs of equations of motion in other areas of physics, for collections of physical phenomena that can be considered waves, fluids, or fields.

==Kinematic equations for one particle==

===Kinematic quantities===
From the instantaneous position , instantaneous meaning at an instant value of time , the instantaneous velocity and acceleration have the general, coordinate-independent definitions;

formula_3

Notice that velocity always points in the direction of motion, in other words for a curved path it is the tangent vector. Loosely speaking, first order derivatives are related to tangents of curves. Still for curved paths, the acceleration is directed towards the center of curvature of the path. Again, loosely speaking, second order derivatives are related to curvature.

The rotational analogues are the &quot;angular vector&quot; (angle the particle rotates about some axis) , angular velocity , and angular acceleration :

where is a unit vector in the direction of the axis of rotation, and is the angle the object turns through about the axis.

The following relation holds for a point-like particle, orbiting about some axis with angular velocity :

formula_5

where is the position vector of the particle (radial from the rotation axis) and the tangential velocity of the particle. For a rotating continuum rigid body, these relations hold for each point in the rigid body.

===Uniform acceleration===

The differential equation of motion for a particle of constant or uniform acceleration in a straight line is simple: the acceleration is constant, so the second derivative of the position of the object is constant. The results of this case are summarized below.

====Constant translational acceleration in a straight line====

These equations apply to a particle moving linearly, in three dimensions in a straight line with constant acceleration. Since the position, velocity, and acceleration are collinear (parallel, and lie on the same line) – only the magnitudes of these vectors are necessary, and because the motion is along a straight line, the problem effectively reduces from three dimensions to one.

formula_6

where:
* is the particle&#x27;s initial position
* is the particle&#x27;s final position
* is the particle&#x27;s initial velocity
* is the particle&#x27;s final velocity
* is the particle&#x27;s acceleration
* is the time interval

Equations [1] and [2] are from integrating the definitions of velocity and acceleration, subject to the initial conditions and ;

formula_7

in magnitudes,

formula_8

which breaks into the radial acceleration , centripetal acceleration , Coriolis acceleration , and angular acceleration .

Special cases of motion described by these equations are summarized qualitatively in the table below. Two have already been discussed above, in the cases that either the radial components or the angular components are zero, and the non-zero component of motion describes uniform acceleration.

===General 3D motions===

In 3D space, the equations in spherical coordinates with corresponding unit vectors , and , the position, velocity, and acceleration generalize respectively to

formula_9

In the case of a constant this reduces to the planar equations above.

==Dynamic equations of motion==

===Newtonian mechanics===

The first general equation of motion developed was Newton&#x27;s second law of motion. In its most general form it states the rate of change of momentum of an object equals the force acting on it,

formula_10

The force in the equation is &quot;not&quot; the force the object exerts. Replacing momentum by mass times velocity, the law is also written more famously as

formula_11

since is a constant in Newtonian mechanics.

Newton&#x27;s second law applies to point-like particles, and to all points in a rigid body. They also apply to each point in a mass continuum, like deformable solids or fluids, but the motion of the system must be accounted for; see material derivative. In the case the mass is not constant, it is not sufficient to use the product rule for the time derivative on the mass and velocity, and Newton&#x27;s second law requires some modification consistent with conservation of momentum; see variable-mass system.

It may be simple to write down the equations of motion in vector form using Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton&#x27;s laws are not always the most efficient way to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton&#x27;s laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.

The momentum form is preferable since this is readily generalized to more complex systems, such as special and general relativity (see four-momentum). It can also be used with the momentum conservation. However, Newton&#x27;s laws are not more fundamental than momentum conservation, because Newton&#x27;s laws are merely consistent with the fact that zero resultant force acting on an object implies constant momentum, while a resultant force implies the momentum is not constant. Momentum conservation is always true for an isolated system not subject to resultant forces.

For a number of particles (see many body problem), the equation of motion for one particle influenced by other particles is
formula_12

where is the momentum of particle , is the force on particle by particle , and is the resultant external force due to any agent not part of system. Particle does not exert a force on itself.

Euler&#x27;s laws of motion are similar to Newton&#x27;s laws, but they are applied specifically to the motion of rigid bodies. The Newton–Euler equations combine the forces and torques acting on a rigid body into a single equation.

Newton&#x27;s second law for rotation takes a similar form to the translational case,

formula_13

by equating the torque acting on the body to the rate of change of its angular momentum . Analogous to mass times acceleration, the moment of inertia tensor depends on the distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity,

formula_14

Again, these equations apply to point like particles, or at each point of a rigid body.

Likewise, for a number of particles, the equation of motion for one particle is

formula_15

where is the angular momentum of particle , the torque on particle by particle , and is resultant external torque (due to any agent not part of system). Particle does not exert a torque on itself.

===Applications===

Some examples of Newton&#x27;s law include describing the motion of a simple pendulum,

formula_16

and a damped, sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator,

formula_17

For describing the motion of masses due to gravity, Newton&#x27;s law of gravity can be combined with Newton&#x27;s second law. For two examples, a ball of mass thrown in the air, in air currents (such as wind) described by a vector field of resistive forces ,

formula_18

where is the gravitational constant, the mass of the Earth, and is the acceleration of the projectile due to the air currents at position and time .

The classical -body problem for particles each interacting with each other due to gravity is a set of nonlinear coupled second order ODEs,

formula_19

where labels the quantities (mass, position, etc.) associated with each particle.

==Analytical mechanics==

Using all three coordinates of 3D space is unnecessary if there are constraints on the system. If the system has degrees of freedom, then one can use a set of generalized coordinates , to define the configuration of the system. They can be in the form of arc lengths or angles. They are a considerable simplification to describe motion, since they take advantage of the intrinsic constraints that limit the system&#x27;s motion, and the number of coordinates is reduced to a minimum. The time derivatives of the generalized coordinates are the &quot;generalized velocities&quot;

formula_20

The Euler–Lagrange equations are

formula_21

where the &quot;Lagrangian&quot; is a function of the configuration and its time rate of change (and possibly time )

formula_22

Setting up the Lagrangian of the system, then substituting into the equations and evaluating the partial derivatives and simplifying, a set of coupled second order ODEs in the coordinates are obtained.

Hamilton&#x27;s equations are

formula_23

where the Hamiltonian

formula_24

is a function of the configuration and conjugate &quot;&quot;generalized&quot; momenta&quot;

formula_25

in which is a shorthand notation for a vector of partial derivatives with respect to the indicated variables (see for example matrix calculus for this denominator notation), and possibly time ,

Setting up the Hamiltonian of the system, then substituting into the equations and evaluating the partial derivatives and simplifying, a set of coupled first order ODEs in the coordinates and momenta are obtained.

The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is

formula_26

where

formula_27

is &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s principal function&quot;, also called the &quot;classical action&quot; is a functional of . In this case, the momenta are given by

formula_28

Although the equation has a simple general form, for a given Hamiltonian it is actually a single first order &quot;non-linear&quot; PDE, in variables. The action allows identification of conserved quantities for mechanical systems, even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved fully, because any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law, a theorem due to Emmy Noether.

All classical equations of motion can be derived from the variational principle known as Hamilton&#x27;s principle of least action

formula_29

stating the path the system takes through the configuration space is the one with the least action .

==Electrodynamics==
In electrodynamics, the force on a charged particle of charge is the Lorentz force:

formula_30

Combining with Newton&#x27;s second law gives a first order differential equation of motion, in terms of position of the particle:

formula_31

or its momentum:

formula_32

The same equation can be obtained using the Lagrangian (and applying Lagrange&#x27;s equations above) for a charged particle of mass and charge :

formula_33

where and are the electromagnetic scalar and vector potential fields. The Lagrangian indicates an additional detail: the canonical momentum in Lagrangian mechanics is given by:
formula_34
instead of just , implying the motion of a charged particle is fundamentally determined by the mass and charge of the particle. The Lagrangian expression was first used to derive the force equation.

Alternatively the Hamiltonian (and substituting into the equations):
formula_35
can derive the Lorentz force equation.

==General relativity==

===Geodesic equation of motion===

The above equations are valid in flat spacetime. In curved spacetime, things become mathematically more complicated since there is no straight line; this is generalized and replaced by a &quot;geodesic&quot; of the curved spacetime (the shortest length of curve between two points). For curved manifolds with a metric tensor , the metric provides the notion of arc length (see line element for details). The differential arc length is given by:

formula_36

and the geodesic equation is a second-order differential equation in the coordinates. The general solution is a family of geodesics:

formula_37

where is a Christoffel symbol of the second kind, which contains the metric (with respect to the coordinate system).

Given the mass-energy distribution provided by the stress–energy tensor , the Einstein field equations are a set of non-linear second-order partial differential equations in the metric, and imply the curvature of spacetime is equivalent to a gravitational field (see equivalence principle). Mass falling in curved spacetime is equivalent to a mass falling in a gravitational field - because gravity is a fictitious force. The &quot;relative acceleration&quot; of one geodesic to another in curved spacetime is given by the &quot;geodesic deviation equation&quot;:

formula_38

where is the separation vector between two geodesics, (&quot;not&quot; just ) is the covariant derivative, and is the Riemann curvature tensor, containing the Christoffel symbols. In other words, the geodesic deviation equation is the equation of motion for masses in curved spacetime, analogous to the Lorentz force equation for charges in an electromagnetic field.

For flat spacetime, the metric is a constant tensor so the Christoffel symbols vanish, and the geodesic equation has the solutions of straight lines. This is also the limiting case when masses move according to Newton&#x27;s law of gravity.

===Spinning objects===

In general relativity, rotational motion is described by the relativistic angular momentum tensor, including the spin tensor, which enter the equations of motion under covariant derivatives with respect to proper time. The Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations describe the motion of spinning objects moving in a gravitational field.

==Analogues for waves and fields==

Unlike the equations of motion for describing particle mechanics, which are systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, the analogous equations governing the dynamics of waves and fields are always partial differential equations, since the waves or fields are functions of space and time. For a particular solution, boundary conditions along with initial conditions need to be specified.

Sometimes in the following contexts, the wave or field equations are also called &quot;equations of motion&quot;.

===Field equations ===

Equations that describe the spatial dependence and time evolution of fields are called &quot;field equations&quot;. These include

* Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the electromagnetic field,
* Poisson&#x27;s equation for Newtonian gravitational or electrostatic field potentials,
* the Einstein field equation for gravitation (Newton&#x27;s law of gravity is a special case for weak gravitational fields and low velocities of particles).

This terminology is not universal: for example although the Navier–Stokes equations govern the velocity field of a fluid, they are not usually called &quot;field equations&quot;, since in this context they represent the momentum of the fluid and are called the &quot;momentum equations&quot; instead.

===Wave equations===

Equations of wave motion are called &quot;wave equations&quot;. The solutions to a wave equation give the time-evolution and spatial dependence of the amplitude. Boundary conditions determine if the solutions describe traveling waves or standing waves.

From classical equations of motion and field equations; mechanical, gravitational wave, and electromagnetic wave equations can be derived. The general linear wave equation in 3D is:

formula_39

where is any mechanical or electromagnetic field amplitude, say:

* the transverse or longitudinal displacement of a vibrating rod, wire, cable, membrane etc.,
* the fluctuating pressure of a medium, sound pressure,
* the electric fields or , or the magnetic fields or ,
* the voltage or current in an alternating current circuit,

and is the phase velocity. Nonlinear equations model the dependence of phase velocity on amplitude, replacing by . There are other linear and nonlinear wave equations for very specific applications, see for example the Korteweg–de Vries equation.

===Quantum theory===

In quantum theory, the wave and field concepts both appear.

In quantum mechanics the analogue of the classical equations of motion (Newton&#x27;s law, Euler–Lagrange equation, Hamilton–Jacobi equation, etc.) is the Schrödinger equation in its most general form:

formula_40

where is the wavefunction of the system, is the quantum Hamiltonian operator, rather than a function as in classical mechanics, and is the Planck constant divided by 2. Setting up the Hamiltonian and inserting it into the equation results in a wave equation, the solution is the wavefunction as a function of space and time. The Schrödinger equation itself reduces to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation when one considers the correspondence principle, in the limit that becomes zero. To compare to measurements, operators for observables must be applied the quantum wavefunction according to the experiment performed, leading to either wave-like or particle-like results.

Throughout all aspects of quantum theory, relativistic or non-relativistic, there are various formulations alternative to the Schrödinger equation that govern the time evolution and behavior of a quantum system, for instance: 
*the Heisenberg equation of motion resembles the time evolution of classical observables as functions of position, momentum, and time, if one replaces dynamical observables by their quantum operators and the classical Poisson bracket by the commutator, 
*the phase space formulation closely follows classical Hamiltonian mechanics, placing position and momentum on equal footing,
*the Feynman path integral formulation extends the principle of least action to quantum mechanics and field theory, placing emphasis on the use of a Lagrangians rather than Hamiltonians.

<doc id="65914" wikidata="Q11476" url="?curid=65914" title="Kinematics">
<text>Kinematics is a subfield of physics and mathematics, developed in classical mechanics, that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. Kinematics, as a field of study, is often referred to as the &quot;geometry of motion&quot; and is occasionally seen as a branch of both applied and pure mathematics since it can be studied without considering the mass of a body or the forces acting upon it. A kinematics problem begins by describing the geometry of the system and declaring the initial conditions of any known values of position, velocity and/or acceleration of points within the system. Then, using arguments from geometry, the position, velocity and acceleration of any unknown parts of the system can be determined. The study of how forces act on bodies falls within kinetics, not kinematics. For further details, see analytical dynamics.

Kinematics is used in astrophysics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and collections of such bodies. In mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics, kinematics is used to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts (multi-link systems) such as an engine, a robotic arm or the human skeleton.

Geometric transformations, also called rigid transformations, are used to describe the movement of components in a mechanical system, simplifying the derivation of the equations of motion. They are also central to dynamic analysis.

Kinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to describe motion. In engineering, for instance, kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given mechanism and, working in reverse, using kinematic synthesis to design a mechanism for a desired range of motion. In addition, kinematics applies algebraic geometry to the study of the mechanical advantage of a mechanical system or mechanism.
== Etymology ==
The term kinematic is the English version of A.M. Ampère&#x27;s &quot;cinématique&quot;, which he constructed from the Greek &quot;kinema&quot; (&quot;movement, motion&quot;), itself derived from &quot;kinein&quot; (&quot;to move&quot;).

Kinematic and cinématique are related to the French word cinéma, but neither are directly derived from it. However, they do share a root word in common, as cinéma came from the shortened form of cinématographe, &quot;motion picture projector and camera&quot;, once again from the Greek word for movement and from the Greek &quot;grapho&quot; (&quot;to write&quot;).

== Kinematics of a particle trajectory in a non-rotating frame of reference ==

Particle kinematics is the study of the trajectory of particles. The position of a particle is defined as the coordinate vector from the origin of a coordinate frame to the particle. For example, consider a tower 50 m south from your home, where the coordinate frame is centered at your home, such that east is in the direction of the &quot;x&quot;-axis and north is in the direction of the &quot;y&quot;-axis, then the coordinate vector to the base of the tower is r = (0 m, −50 m, 0 m). If the tower is 50 m high, and this height is measured along the &quot;z&quot;-axis, then the coordinate vector to the top of the tower is r = (0 m, −50 m, 50 m).

In the most general case, a three-dimensional coordinate system is used to define the position of a particle. However, if the particle is constrained to move within a plane, a two-dimensional coordinate system is sufficient. All observations in physics are incomplete without being described with respect to a reference frame.

The position vector of a particle is a vector drawn from the origin of the reference frame to the particle. It expresses both the distance of the point from the origin and its direction from the origin. In three dimensions, the position vector formula_1 can be expressed as
formula_2
where formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 are the Cartesian coordinates and formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8 are the unit vectors along the formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 coordinate axes, respectively. The magnitude of the position vector formula_12 gives the distance between the point formula_13 and the origin.
formula_14
The direction cosines of the position vector provide a quantitative measure of direction. In general, an object&#x27;s position vector will depend on the frame of reference; different frames will lead to different values for the position vector.

The &quot;trajectory&quot; of a particle is a vector function of time, formula_15, which defines the curve traced by the moving particle, given by
formula_16
where formula_17, formula_18, and formula_19 describe each coordinate of the particle&#x27;s position as a function of time.
===Velocity and speed===
The velocity of a particle is a vector quantity that describes the &quot;direction&quot; as well as the magnitude of motion of the particle. More mathematically, the rate of change of the position vector of a point with respect to time is the velocity of the point. Consider the ratio formed by dividing the difference of two positions of a particle (displacement) by the time interval. This ratio is called the average velocity over that time interval and is defined asformula_20where formula_21 is the displacement vector during the time interval formula_22. In the limit that the time interval formula_22 approaches zero, the average velocity approaches the instantaneous velocity, defined as the time derivative of the position vector,
formula_24
Thus, a particle&#x27;s velocity is the time rate of change of its position. Furthermore, this velocity is tangent to the particle&#x27;s trajectory at every position along its path. In a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.

The speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity. It is a scalar quantity:
formula_25
where formula_26 is the arc-length measured along the trajectory of the particle. This arc-length must always increase as the particle moves. Hence, formula_27 is non-negative, which implies that speed is also non-negative.

===Acceleration===
The velocity vector can change in magnitude and in direction or both at once. Hence, the acceleration accounts for both the rate of change of the magnitude of the velocity vector and the rate of change of direction of that vector. The same reasoning used with respect to the position of a particle to define velocity, can be applied to the velocity to define acceleration. The acceleration of a particle is the vector defined by the rate of change of the velocity vector. The average acceleration of a particle over a time interval is defined as the ratio.
formula_28
where Δv is the average velocity and Δ&quot;t&quot; is the time interval.

The acceleration of the particle is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero, which is the time derivative,
formula_29

Alternatively,
formula_30

Thus, acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity vector and the second derivative of the position vector of that particle. In a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.

The magnitude of the acceleration of an object is the magnitude |a| of its acceleration vector. It is a scalar quantity:
formula_31

===Relative position vector===
A relative position vector is a vector that defines the position of one point relative to another. It is the difference in position of the two points.
The position of one point &quot;A&quot; relative to another point &quot;B&quot; is simply the difference between their positions

:formula_32

which is the difference between the components of their position vectors.

If point &quot;A&quot; has position components formula_33

and point &quot;B&quot; has position components formula_34

then the position of point &quot;A&quot; relative to point &quot;B&quot; is the difference between their components: formula_35

===Relative velocity===

The velocity of one point relative to another is simply the difference between their velocities
formula_36
which is the difference between the components of their velocities.

If point &quot;A&quot; has velocity components formula_37 and point &quot;B&quot; has velocity components formula_38 then the velocity of point &quot;A&quot; relative to point &quot;B&quot; is the difference between their components:
formula_39

Alternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the time derivative of the relative position vector rB/A.

===Relative acceleration===

The acceleration of one point &quot;C&quot; relative to another point &quot;B&quot; is simply the difference between their accelerations.
formula_40
which is the difference between the components of their accelerations.

If point &quot;C&quot; has acceleration components formula_41
and point &quot;B&quot; has acceleration components formula_42
then the acceleration of point &quot;C&quot; relative to point &quot;B&quot; is the difference between their components: formula_43

Alternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the second time derivative of the relative position vector rB/A.

Assuming that the initial conditions of the position, formula_44, and velocity formula_45 at time formula_46 are known, the first integration yields the velocity of the particle as a function of time.
formula_47

A second integration yields its path (trajectory),
formula_48

Additional relations between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time can be derived. Since the acceleration is constant,
formula_49 can be substituted into the above equation to give:
formula_50

A relationship between velocity, position and acceleration without explicit time dependence can be had by solving the average acceleration for time and substituting and simplifying

formula_51

formula_52
where formula_53 denotes the dot product, which is appropriate as the products are scalars rather than vectors.
formula_54

The dot product can be replaced by the cosine of the angle between the vectors (see Geometric interpretation of the dot product for more details) and the vectors by their magnitudes, in which case:
formula_55

In the case of acceleration always in the direction of the motion and the direction of motion should be in positive or negative, the angle between the vectors () is 0, so formula_56, and
formula_57
This can be simplified using the notation for the magnitudes of the vectors formula_58 where formula_59 can be any curvaceous path taken as the constant tangential acceleration is applied along that path, so
formula_60
This reduces the parametric equations of motion of the particle to a Cartesian relationship of speed versus position. This relation is useful when time is unknown. We also know that formula_61 or formula_59 is the area under a velocity–time graph. We can take formula_59 by adding the top area and the bottom area. The bottom area is a rectangle, and the area of a rectangle is the formula_64 where formula_65 is the width and formula_66 is the height. In this case formula_67 and formula_68 (the formula_65 here is different from the acceleration formula_70). This means that the bottom area is formula_71. Now let&#x27;s find the top area (a triangle). The area of a triangle is formula_72 where formula_66 is the base and formula_74 is the height. In this case, formula_75 and formula_76 or formula_77. Adding formula_78 and formula_79 results in the equation formula_59 results in the equation formula_81. This equation is applicable when the final velocity is unknown.

== Particle trajectories in cylindrical-polar coordinates ==
It is often convenient to formulate the trajectory of a particle r(&quot;t&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;z&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)) using polar coordinates in the &quot;X&quot;–&quot;Y&quot; plane. In this case, its velocity and acceleration take a convenient form.

Recall that the trajectory of a particle &quot;P&quot; is defined by its coordinate vector r measured in a fixed reference frame &quot;F&quot;. As the particle moves, its coordinate vector r(&quot;t&quot;) traces its trajectory, which is a curve in space, given by:
formula_16
where x̂, ŷ, and ẑ are the unit vectors along the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; axes of the reference frame &quot;F&quot;, respectively.

Consider a particle &quot;P&quot; that moves only on the surface of a circular cylinder &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = constant, it is possible to align the &quot;z&quot; axis of the fixed frame &quot;F&quot; with the axis of the cylinder. Then, the angle &quot;θ&quot; around this axis in the &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; plane can be used to define the trajectory as,
formula_83
where the constant distance from the center is denoted as &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a function of time.

The cylindrical coordinates for r(&quot;t&quot;) can be simplified by introducing the radial and tangential unit vectors,
formula_84
and their time derivatives from elementary calculus:
formula_85
formula_86

formula_87
formula_88

Using this notation, r(&quot;t&quot;) takes the form,
formula_89
In general, the trajectory r(&quot;t&quot;) is not constrained to lie on a circular cylinder, so the radius &quot;R&quot; varies with time and the trajectory of the particle in cylindrical-polar coordinates becomes:
formula_90
Where &quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; might be continuously differentiable functions of time and the function notation is dropped for simplicity. The velocity vector v&quot;P&quot; is the time derivative of the trajectory r(&quot;t&quot;), which yields:
formula_91

Similarly, the acceleration a&quot;P&quot;, which is the time derivative of the velocity v&quot;P&quot;, is given by:
formula_92

The term formula_93 acts toward the center of curvature of the path at that point on the path, is commonly called the centripetal acceleration. The term formula_94 is called the Coriolis acceleration.

===Constant radius===
If the trajectory of the particle is constrained to lie on a cylinder, then the radius &quot;r&quot; is constant and the velocity and acceleration vectors simplify. The velocity of vP is the time derivative of the trajectory r(&quot;t&quot;),
formula_95

===Planar circular trajectories===

A special case of a particle trajectory on a circular cylinder occurs when there is no movement along the &quot;z&quot; axis:
formula_96
where &quot;r&quot; and &quot;z&quot;0 are constants. In this case, the velocity v&quot;P&quot; is given by:
formula_97
where formula_98 is the angular velocity of the unit vector around the &quot;z&quot; axis of the cylinder.

The acceleration a&quot;P&quot; of the particle &quot;P&quot; is now given by:
formula_99

The components
formula_100
are called, respectively, the &quot;radial&quot; and &quot;tangential components&quot; of acceleration.

The notation for angular velocity and angular acceleration is often defined as
formula_101
so the radial and tangential acceleration components for circular trajectories are also written as
formula_102

== Point trajectories in a body moving in the plane ==

The movement of components of a mechanical system are analyzed by attaching a reference frame to each part and determining how the various reference frames move relative to each other. If the structural stiffness of the parts are sufficient, then their deformation can be neglected and rigid transformations can be used to define this relative movement. This reduces the description of the motion of the various parts of a complicated mechanical system to a problem of describing the geometry of each part and geometric association of each part relative to other parts.

Geometry is the study of the properties of figures that remain the same while the space is transformed in various ways—more technically, it is the study of invariants under a set of transformations. These transformations can cause the displacement of the triangle in the plane, while leaving the vertex angle and the distances between vertices unchanged. Kinematics is often described as applied geometry, where the movement of a mechanical system is described using the rigid transformations of Euclidean geometry.

The coordinates of points in a plane are two-dimensional vectors in R2 (two dimensional space). Rigid transformations are those that preserve the distance between any two points. The set of rigid transformations in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space is called the special Euclidean group on R&quot;n&quot;, and denoted SE(&quot;n&quot;).

===Displacements and motion===

The position of one component of a mechanical system relative to another is defined by introducing a reference frame, say &quot;M&quot;, on one that moves relative to a fixed frame, &quot;F,&quot; on the other. The rigid transformation, or displacement, of &quot;M&quot; relative to &quot;F&quot; defines the relative position of the two components. A displacement consists of the combination of a rotation and a translation.

The set of all displacements of &quot;M&quot; relative to &quot;F&quot; is called the configuration space of &quot;M.&quot; A smooth curve from one position to another in this configuration space is a continuous set of displacements, called the motion of &quot;M&quot; relative to &quot;F.&quot; The motion of a body consists of a continuous set of rotations and translations.

===Matrix representation===
The combination of a rotation and translation in the plane R2 can be represented by a certain type of 3×3 matrix known as a homogeneous transform. The 3×3 homogeneous transform is constructed from a 2×2 rotation matrix &quot;A&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;) and the 2×1 translation vector d = (&quot;dx&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;), as:
formula_103
These homogeneous transforms perform rigid transformations on the points in the plane &quot;z&quot; = 1, that is, on points with coordinates r = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, 1).

In particular, let r define the coordinates of points in a reference frame &quot;M&quot; coincident with a fixed frame &quot;F&quot;. Then, when the origin of &quot;M&quot; is displaced by the translation vector d relative to the origin of &quot;F&quot; and rotated by the angle φ relative to the x-axis of &quot;F&quot;, the new coordinates in &quot;F&quot; of points in &quot;M&quot; are given by:
formula_104

Homogeneous transforms represent affine transformations. This formulation is necessary because a translation is not a linear transformation of R2. However, using projective geometry, so that R2 is considered a subset of R3, translations become affine linear transformations.

== Pure translation ==

If a rigid body moves so that its reference frame &quot;M&quot; does not rotate (&quot;θ&quot; = 0) relative to the fixed frame &quot;F&quot;, the motion is called pure translation. In this case, the trajectory of every point in the body is an offset of the trajectory d(&quot;t&quot;) of the origin of &quot;M,&quot; that is:
formula_105

Thus, for bodies in pure translation, the velocity and acceleration of every point &quot;P&quot; in the body are given by:
formula_106
where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time and v&quot;O&quot; and a&quot;O&quot; are the velocity and acceleration, respectively, of the origin of the moving frame &quot;M&quot;. Recall the coordinate vector p in &quot;M&quot; is constant, so its derivative is zero.

== Rotation of a body around a fixed axis ==

Objects like a playground merry-go-round, ventilation fans, or hinged doors can be modeled as rigid bodies rotating about a single fixed axis. The &quot;z&quot;-axis has been chosen by convention.

=== Position ===
This allows the description of a rotation as the angular position of a planar reference frame &quot;M&quot; relative to a fixed &quot;F&quot; about this shared &quot;z&quot;-axis. Coordinates p = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) in &quot;M&quot; are related to coordinates P = (X, Y) in &quot;F&quot; by the matrix equation:
formula_107

where
formula_108
is the rotation matrix that defines the angular position of &quot;M&quot; relative to &quot;F&quot; as a function of time.

=== Velocity ===
If the point p does not move in &quot;M&quot;, its velocity in &quot;F&quot; is given by
formula_109
It is convenient to eliminate the coordinates p and write this as an operation on the trajectory P(&quot;t&quot;),
formula_110
where the matrix
formula_111
is known as the angular velocity matrix of &quot;M&quot; relative to &quot;F&quot;. The parameter &quot;ω&quot; is the time derivative of the angle &quot;θ&quot;, that is:
formula_112

=== Acceleration ===
The acceleration of P(&quot;t&quot;) in &quot;F&quot; is obtained as the time derivative of the velocity,
formula_113
which becomes
formula_114
where
formula_115
is the angular acceleration matrix of &quot;M&quot; on &quot;F&quot;, and
formula_116

The description of rotation then involves these three quantities:

* Angular position: the oriented distance from a selected origin on the rotational axis to a point of an object is a vector r(&quot;t&quot;) locating the point. The vector r(&quot;t&quot;) has some projection (or, equivalently, some component) r⊥(&quot;t&quot;) on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Then the &quot;angular position&quot; of that point is the angle &quot;θ&quot; from a reference axis (typically the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis) to the vector r⊥(&quot;t&quot;) in a known rotation sense (typically given by the right-hand rule).
* Angular velocity: the angular velocity &quot;ω&quot; is the rate at which the angular position &quot;θ&quot; changes with respect to time &quot;t&quot;: formula_117 The angular velocity is represented in Figure 1 by a vector Ω pointing along the axis of rotation with magnitude &quot;ω&quot; and sense determined by the direction of rotation as given by the right-hand rule.
* Angular acceleration: the magnitude of the angular acceleration &quot;α&quot; is the rate at which the angular velocity &quot;ω&quot; changes with respect to time &quot;t&quot;: formula_118

The equations of translational kinematics can easily be extended to planar rotational kinematics for constant angular acceleration with simple variable exchanges:
formula_119
formula_120
formula_121
formula_122

Here &quot;θ&quot;i and &quot;θ&quot;f are, respectively, the initial and final angular positions, &quot;ω&quot;i and &quot;ω&quot;f are, respectively, the initial and final angular velocities, and &quot;α&quot; is the constant angular acceleration. Although position in space and velocity in space are both true vectors (in terms of their properties under rotation), as is angular velocity, angle itself is not a true vector.

== Point trajectories in body moving in three dimensions ==

Important formulas in kinematics define the velocity and acceleration of points in a moving body as they trace trajectories in three-dimensional space. This is particularly important for the center of mass of a body, which is used to derive equations of motion using either Newton&#x27;s second law or Lagrange&#x27;s equations.

===Position===
In order to define these formulas, the movement of a component &quot;B&quot; of a mechanical system is defined by the set of rotations [A(&quot;t&quot;)] and translations d(&quot;t&quot;) assembled into the homogeneous transformation [T(&quot;t&quot;)]=[A(&quot;t&quot;), d(&quot;t&quot;)]. If p is the coordinates of a point &quot;P&quot; in &quot;B&quot; measured in the moving reference frame &quot;M&quot;, then the trajectory of this point traced in &quot;F&quot; is given by:
formula_123
This notation does not distinguish between P = (X, Y, Z, 1), and P = (X, Y, Z), which is hopefully clear in context.

This equation for the trajectory of &quot;P&quot; can be inverted to compute the coordinate vector p in &quot;M&quot; as:
formula_124
This expression uses the fact that the transpose of a rotation matrix is also its inverse, that is:
formula_125

===Velocity===
The velocity of the point &quot;P&quot; along its trajectory P(&quot;t&quot;) is obtained as the time derivative of this position vector,
formula_126
The dot denotes the derivative with respect to time; because p is constant, its derivative is zero.

This formula can be modified to obtain the velocity of &quot;P&quot; by operating on its trajectory P(&quot;t&quot;) measured in the fixed frame &quot;F&quot;. Substituting the inverse transform for p into the velocity equation yields:
formula_127
The matrix [&quot;S&quot;] is given by:
formula_128
where
formula_129
is the angular velocity matrix.

Multiplying by the operator [&quot;S&quot;], the formula for the velocity vP takes the form:
formula_130
where the vector &quot;ω&quot; is the angular velocity vector obtained from the components of the matrix [Ω]; the vector
formula_131
is the position of &quot;P&quot; relative to the origin &quot;O&quot; of the moving frame &quot;M&quot;; and
formula_132
is the velocity of the origin &quot;O&quot;.

===Acceleration===
The acceleration of a point &quot;P&quot; in a moving body &quot;B&quot; is obtained as the time derivative of its velocity vector:
formula_133

This equation can be expanded firstly by computing
formula_134
and
formula_135

The formula for the acceleration A&quot;P&quot; can now be obtained as:
formula_136
or
formula_137
where &quot;α&quot; is the angular acceleration vector obtained from the derivative of the angular velocity vector;
formula_138
is the relative position vector (the position of &quot;P&quot; relative to the origin &quot;O&quot; of the moving frame &quot;M&quot;); and
formula_139
is the acceleration of the origin of the moving frame &quot;M&quot;.

== Kinematic constraints ==

Kinematic constraints are constraints on the movement of components of a mechanical system. Kinematic constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from hinges, sliders and cam joints that define the construction of the system, called holonomic constraints, and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called non-holonomic constraints. The following are some common examples.

===Kinematic coupling===
A kinematic coupling exactly constrains all 6 degrees of freedom.

===Rolling without slipping===
An object that rolls against a surface without slipping obeys the condition that the velocity of its center of mass is equal to the cross product of its angular velocity with a vector from the point of contact to the center of mass:
formula_140

For the case of an object that does not tip or turn, this reduces to formula_141.

===Inextensible cord===
This is the case where bodies are connected by an idealized cord that remains in tension and cannot change length. The constraint is that the sum of lengths of all segments of the cord is the total length, and accordingly the time derivative of this sum is zero. A dynamic problem of this type is the pendulum. Another example is a drum turned by the pull of gravity upon a falling weight attached to the rim by the inextensible cord. An &quot;equilibrium&quot; problem (i.e. not kinematic) of this type is the catenary.

===Kinematic pairs===

Reuleaux called the ideal connections between components that form a machine kinematic pairs. He distinguished between higher pairs which were said to have line contact between the two links and lower pairs that have area contact between the links. J. Phillips shows that there are many ways to construct pairs that do not fit this simple classification.

====Lower pair====
A lower pair is an ideal joint, or holonomic constraint, that maintains contact between a point, line or plane in a moving solid (three-dimensional) body to a corresponding point line or plane in the fixed solid body. There are the following cases:
* A revolute pair, or hinged joint, requires a line, or axis, in the moving body to remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom, which is pure rotation about the axis of the hinge.
* A prismatic joint, or slider, requires that a line, or axis, in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane parallel to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar parallel plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom. This degree of freedom is the distance of the slide along the line.
* A cylindrical joint requires that a line, or axis, in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body. It is a combination of a revolute joint and a sliding joint. This joint has two degrees of freedom. The position of the moving body is defined by both the rotation about and slide along the axis.
* A spherical joint, or ball joint, requires that a point in the moving body maintain contact with a point in the fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom.
* A planar joint requires that a plane in the moving body maintain contact with a plane in fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom.

====Higher pairs====
Generally speaking, a higher pair is a constraint that requires a curve or surface in the moving body to maintain contact with a curve or surface in the fixed body. For example, the contact between a cam and its follower is a higher pair called a &quot;cam joint&quot;. Similarly, the contact between the involute curves that form the meshing teeth of two gears are cam joints.

===Kinematic chains===

Rigid bodies (&quot;links&quot;) connected by kinematic pairs (&quot;joints&quot;) are known as &quot;kinematic chains&quot;. Mechanisms and robots are examples of kinematic chains. The degree of freedom of a kinematic chain is computed from the number of links and the number and type of joints using the mobility formula. This formula can also be used to enumerate the topologies of kinematic chains that have a given degree of freedom, which is known as &quot;type synthesis&quot; in machine design.

====Examples====
The planar one degree-of-freedom linkages assembled from &quot;N&quot; links and &quot;j&quot; hinges or sliding joints are:
* &quot;N&quot; = 2, &quot;j&quot; = 1 : a two-bar linkage that is the lever;
* &quot;N&quot; = 4, &quot;j&quot; = 4 : the four-bar linkage;
* &quot;N&quot; = 6, &quot;j&quot; = 7 : a six-bar linkage. This must have two links (&quot;ternary links&quot;) that support three joints. There are two distinct topologies that depend on how the two ternary linkages are connected. In the Watt topology, the two ternary links have a common joint; in the Stephenson topology, the two ternary links do not have a common joint and are connected by binary links.
* &quot;N&quot; = 8, &quot;j&quot; = 10 : eight-bar linkage with 16 different topologies;
* &quot;N&quot; = 10, &quot;j&quot; = 13 : ten-bar linkage with 230 different topologies;
* &quot;N&quot; = 12, &quot;j&quot; = 16 : twelve-bar linkage with 6,856 topologies.

For larger chains and their linkage topologies, see R. P. Sunkari and L. C. Schmidt, &quot;Structural synthesis of planar kinematic chains by adapting a Mckay-type algorithm&quot;, &quot;Mechanism and Machine Theory&quot; #41, pp. 1021–1030 (2006).

<text>The following is a list of [[comic strip]]s. Dates after names indicate the time frames when the strips appeared. There is usually a fair degree of accuracy about a start date, but because of rights being transferred or the very gradual loss of appeal of a particular strip, the termination date is sometimes uncertain. In the event a strip has its own page, the originator of the strip is listed. Otherwise, all creators who worked on a strip are listed. Many of characters appeared in both strip and comic book format as well as in other media.

The word Reuben after a name identifies winners of the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, but many of leading strip artists worked in the years before the first Reuben and Billy DeBeck Awards in 1946.

Webcomics are comic strips that exist only on the World Wide Web and are not created primarily for newspapers or magazines. Primary sites for webcomics are Modern Tales, Serializer and KeenSpot.

<doc id="65919" wikidata="Q2626905" url="?curid=65919" title="Point-to-point construction">
<text>In electronics, point-to-point construction is a non-automated technique for constructing circuits which was widely used before the use of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and automated assembly gradually became widespread following their introduction in the 1950s. Circuits using thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) were relatively large, relatively simple (the number of large, hot, expensive devices which needed replacing was minimised), and used large sockets, all of which made the PCB less obviously advantageous than with later complex semiconductor circuits. Point-to-point construction is still widespread in power electronics, where components are bulky and serviceability is a consideration, and to construct prototype equipment with few or heavy electronic components. A common practice, especially in older point-to-point construction, is to use the leads of components such as resistors and capacitors to bridge as much of the distance between connections as possible, reducing the need to add additional wire between the components.

Before point-to-point connection, electrical assemblies used screws or wire nuts to hold wires to an insulating wooden or ceramic board. The resulting devices were prone to fail from corroded contacts, or mechanical loosening of the connections. Early premium marine radios, especially from Marconi, sometimes used welded copper in the bus-bar circuits, but this was expensive. The crucial invention was to apply soldering to electrical assembly. In soldering, an alloy of tin and lead (and/or other metals), known as solder, is melted and adheres to other, nonmolten metals, such as copper or tinned steel. Solder makes a strong electrical and mechanical connection.

Point-to-point wiring is not suitable for automated assembly (though see wire wrap, a similar method that is) and is carried out manually, making it both more expensive and more susceptible to wiring errors than PCBs, as connections are determined by the person doing assembly rather than by an etched circuit board. For production, rather than prototyping, errors can be minimised by carefully designed operating procedures.

An intermediate form of construction uses terminal strips (sometimes called &quot;tag boards&quot;), eyelet boards or turret boards. Note that if components are arranged on boards with tags, eyelets or turrets at both ends and wires going to the next components, then the construction is correctly called tag, eyelet or turret construction respectively, as the components are not going from point to point. Although cordwood construction can be wired in a similar way the density means that component placement is usually fixed by a substrate that components are inserted into.

== Terminal strip construction ==


Terminal strip construction, which is often referred to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called &quot;tag boards&quot;). A terminal strip has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.

The chassis was constructed first, from sheet metal or wood. Insulated terminal strips were then riveted, nailed or screwed to the underside or interior of the chassis. Transformers, large capacitors, tube sockets and other large components were mounted to the top of the chassis. Their wires were led through holes to the underside or interior. The ends of lengths of wire or wire-ended components such as capacitors and resistors were pushed through the terminals, and usually looped and twisted. When all wires to be connected had been fitted to the terminal, they were soldered together (and to the terminal).

Professional electronics assemblers used to operate from books of photographs and follow an exact assembly sequence to ensure that they did not miss any components. This process is labor-intensive, subject to error and not suitable for automated production. Even after the introduction of printed circuit boards, it did not require laying out and manufacturing circuit boards.

Point-to-point and terminal strip construction continued to be used for some vacuum tube equipment even after the introduction of printed circuit boards. The heat of the tubes can degrade the circuit boards and cause them to become brittle and break. Circuit board degradation is often seen on inexpensive tube radios produced in the 1960s, especially around the hot output and rectifier tubes. American manufacturer Zenith continued to use point-to-point wiring in its tube-based television sets until the early 1970s.

Some audiophile equipment, such as amplifiers, continues to be point-to-point wired using terminal pins, often in very small quantities. In this application modern point-to-point wiring is often used as a marketing design feature rather than a result of the economics of very-small-scale production.

Sometimes true point-to-point wiring—without terminal strips—with very short connections, is still used at very high radio frequencies (in the gigahertz range) to minimise stray capacitance and inductance; the capacitance between a circuit-board trace and some other conductor, and the inductance of a short track, become significant or dominant at high frequencies. In some cases careful PCB layout on a substrate with good high-frequency properties (e.g., ceramic) is sufficient. An example of this design is illustrated in an application note describing an avalanche transistor-based generator of pulses with risetime of a fraction of a nanosecond; the (few) critical components are connected directly to each other and to the output connector with the shortest possible leads.

Particularly in complex equipment, wired circuits are often laid out as a &quot;ladder&quot; of side-by-side components, which need connecting to ladders or components by wire links. A good layout minimizes such links and wiring complexity, often approaching that of direct point-to-point. Amongst complex devices, the pre-PCB Tektronix vacuum-tube oscilloscopes stand out for their very well-designed point-to-point wiring.

If parasitic effects are significant, point-to-point and terminal strip wiring have variable parasitic components, while the inductance and capacitance due to a PCB are the same for all samples and can be compensated for reliably which may be essential for some RF circuits. In some heavily optimised point-to-point RF constructions the circuit can be tuned by bending wires around.

Placing the completed unit in an enclosure protects the circuit from its environment, and users from electrical hazards.

A few large brand names still use terminal strip-type point-to-point boards, but usually for special product lines. Electric guitar amplifier manufacturer Marshall have reissued some of their older models, using this type of construction as a design feature, although their standard products have long used PCBs. Thermionic valve equipment usually does not have the valves mounted on the PCB in order to avoid heat damage, but instead use PCBs for the wiring, achieving the economy of mass-produced PCBs without the heat damage.

==Breadboard==

Prototypes which are subject to modification are often not made on PCBs, using instead breadboard construction. Historically this could be literally a breadboard, a wooden board with components attached to it and joined up with wire. More recently the term is applied to a board of thin insulating material with holes at standard 0.1-inch pitch; components are pushed through the holes to anchor them, and point-to-point wired on the other side of the board. A type of breadboard specifically for prototyping has this layout, but with strips of metal spring contacts beneath a grid of holes into which components are pushed to make electrical connections like any removable connector. Some portion of the terminals in a straight line in one direction are electrically connected, commonly in groups of 5-10 with multiple groups per row, these may be interspersed with columns that span the height of the board for the more common connections (typically the power supply rails). Such breadboards, and stripboards, fall somewhere between PCBs and point-to-point; they do not require design and manufacture of a PCB, and are as easily modified as a point-to-point setup.

==Stripboard==

A stripboard is a board with holes in square grid pattern, commonly with a 0.1-inch pitch; all the holes in a straight line are connected by a copper strip as on a PCB. Components are pushed through from the side without strips and soldered in place. The strips can be interrupted by scraping out a section of the copper, stripboard cutters are available for this task which are effectively a drill bit with a handle, they are used by rotating on the holes in a strip.

== &quot;Dead bug&quot; construction ==
Free-form construction can be used in cases where a PCB would be too big or too much work to manufacture for a small number of components. Several methods of construction are used. At one extreme a wiring pen can be used with a perforated board, producing neat and professional results. At the other extreme is &quot;dead bug&quot; style, with the ICs flipped upside-down with their pins sticking up into the air like a dead insect, the leads of components are usually soldered directly to other components where possible, with many small circuits having no added wires. While it is messy-looking, free-form construction can be used to make more compact circuits than other methods. This is often used in BEAM robotics and in RF circuits where component leads must be kept short. This form of construction is used by amateurs for one-off circuits, and also professionally for circuit development, particularly at high frequencies.

For high-frequency work, a grounded solderable metallic base such as the copper side of an unetched printed circuit board can be used as base and ground plane. Information on high-frequency breadboarding and illustrations of dead bug with ground plane construction are in a Linear Technologies application note.

<text>The , also known as the Treaty of Maguan () in China or the in Japan, was signed at the hotel in Shimonoseki, Japan, on April 17, 1895, between the Empire of Japan and Qing China. It was an unequal treaty and ended the First Sino-Japanese War, in which Chinese land and naval forces were decisively defeated by the Japanese. The treaty was signed by Count Ito Hirobumi and Viscount Mutsu Munemitsu for Japan and Li Hongzhang and his son Li Jingfang on behalf of China.

The peace conference took place from March 20 to April 17, 1895, and the treaty followed and superseded the Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty of 1871. It consisted of 11 articles which provided for the termination of China&#x27;s tributary relations with Korea; required that China pay an indemnity of 200 million taels and cede Taiwan (Formosa), the Penghu (Pescadores) Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan; and opened four cities (Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou) to Japan as trading ports. However, due to the diplomatic Triple Intervention of Russia, Germany, and France just one week after the treaty was signed, the Japanese withdrew their claim to the Liaodong Peninsula in return for an additional war indemnity of 30 million taels from China.

Chinese scholars and officials vigorously opposed the harsh terms of the treaty, but it was ratified by the Guangxu Emperor. The cession of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands met with strong resistance by the local populace, and the islands were not taken over by Japan until October 1895. At the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945, Japan surrendered and later signed the Treaty of Taipei with the Republic of China on 28 April 1952, which officially abrogated the Treaty of Shimonoseki.

==Treaty terms==

*Article 1: China recognizes definitively the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea, and, in consequence, the payment of tribute and the performance of ceremonies and formalities by Korea to China, that are in derogation of such independence and autonomy, shall wholly cease for the future.
*Articles 2 &amp; 3: China cedes to Japan in perpetuity and full sovereignty of the Penghu (Pescadores) Islands, Taiwan (Formosa) and the Liaodong Peninsula together with all fortifications, arsenals, and public property.
*Article 4: China agrees to pay to Japan as a war indemnity the sum of 200,000,000 Kuping taels ( 7,500,000 kilograms/16,534,500 pounds of silver).
*Article 5: China opens Shashi (Shashih), Chongqing (Chungking), Suzhou (Soochow) and Hangzhou (Hangchow) to Japan. Moreover, China is to grant Japan most favoured nation status for foreign trade (which is equal to, not above, the trade relations granted to the United Kingdom, United States, and France in 1843–44 and to Russia in 1858),

The treaty ended the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 as a clear victory for Japan.

China recognized the &quot;full and complete independence and autonomy&quot; of Joseon (the kingdom of Korea) and formally renounced China&#x27;s traditional claims of imperial overlordship. The ceremonies in which Joseon acknowledged subordination to China were permanently abolished. In the next year, the Yeongeunmun gate outside Seoul, where those ceremonies were performed, was demolished leaving its two stone pillars.

China ceded to Japan the Island of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula in the southern part of present-day Liaoning province (including the city of Dalian). However, Liaodong was subsequently returned to Qing dynasty due to diplomatic intervention of Russia, Germany, and France, which forced Japan to back down and withdraw from the peninsula in the same year.

China paid Japan a war indemnity of 200 million Kuping taels, paid over seven years.

China opened various ports and rivers to Japanese trade, and granted Japan the same status regarding trade as various western powers had gained in the aftermath of the First and Second Opium Wars.
===Value of the indemnity===
Qing China&#x27;s indemnity to Japan of 200 million silver Kuping taels, or about . After the Triple intervention, they paid another 30 million taels for a total of over silver, worth about $5 billion US dollars in 2015.

===Treaty and Taiwan===

During the summit between Japanese and Qing representatives in March and April 1895, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi and Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu wanted to reduce the power of the Qing dynasty on not only the Korean Peninsula but also the Taiwan islands. Moreover, Mutsu had already noticed its importance in order to expand Japanese military power towards South China and Southeast Asia. It was also the age of imperialism, so Japan wished to mimic what the Western nations were doing. Imperial Japan was seeking colonies and resources in the Korean Peninsula and mainland China to compete with the presence of Western powers at that time. This was the way the Japanese leadership chose to illustrate how fast Imperial Japan had advanced compared to the West since the 1867 Meiji Restoration, and the extent it wanted to amend the unequal treaties that were held in the Far East by the Western powers.

At the peace conference between Imperial Japan and the Qing dynasty, Li Hongzhang and Li Jingfang, the ambassadors at the negotiation desk of the Qing dynasty, originally did not plan to cede Taiwan because they also realized Taiwan&#x27;s great location for trading with the West. Therefore, even though the Qing had lost wars against Britain and France in the 19th century, the Qing emperor was serious about keeping Taiwan under its rule, which began in 1683. On March 20, 1895, at Shunpanrō () in Shimonoseki in Japan, a one month long peace conference began.

At the first half of the conference, Ito and Li talked mainly about a cease-fire agreement, and during the second half of the conference, the contents of the peace treaty were discussed. Ito and Mutsu claimed that yielding the full sovereignty of Taiwan was an absolute condition and requested Li to hand over full sovereignty of the Penghu Islands and the eastern portion of the bay at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula. Li Hongzhang refused on the grounds that Taiwan had never been a battlefield during the first Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895. By the final stage of the conference, while Li Hongzhang agreed to the transfer of full sovereignty of the Penghu islands and the portion of Liaodong to Imperial Japan, he still refused to hand over Taiwan. As Taiwan had been a province since 1885, Li stated, &quot;Taiwan is already a province, and therefore not to be given away ().&quot;
However, Imperial Japan had the military advantage, and eventually Li gave Taiwan up. On April 17, 1895, the peace treaty between Imperial Japan and the Qing dynasty had been signed and was followed by the successful Japanese invasion of Taiwan. This had a huge and lasting impact on Taiwan, the turning over of the island to Imperial Japan marking the end of 200 years of Qing rule despite local resistance in Taiwan against the annexation, which was quashed swiftly by the Japanese. Therefore, Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, until the end of World War II by the surrender of Japan.

==Signatories and diplomats==

The treaty was drafted with John W. Foster, former American secretary of state, advising the Qing Empire. It was signed by Count Itō Hirobumi and Viscount Mutsu Munemitsu for the emperor of Japan and Li Hongzhang and Li Jingfang on behalf of the emperor of China. Before the treaty was signed, Li Hongzhang was attacked by a right-wing Japanese extremist on 24 March: he was fired at and wounded on his way back to his lodgings at Injoji temple. The public outcry aroused by the assassination attempt caused the Japanese to temper their demands and agree to a temporary armistice. The conference was temporarily adjourned and resumed on 10 April.

==Aftermath==
===Entry of the Western powers===
The conditions imposed by Japan on China led to the Triple Intervention of Russia, France, and Germany, western powers all active in China, with established enclaves and ports, just six days after its signing. They demanded that Japan withdraw its claim on the Liaodong peninsula, concerned that Lüshun, then called Port Arthur by Westerners, would fall under Japanese control. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (an ally of France) and his imperial advisors, including Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, had designs on Port Arthur, which could serve as Russia&#x27;s long sought-after &#x27;ice-free&#x27; port.
Under threat of war from three Western political powers, in November 1895, Japan — a weaker emerging nation not yet perceived as even a regional power — returned control of the territory and withdrew its &quot;de jure&quot; claim on the Liaodong Peninsula in return for an increased war indemnity from China of 30 million Taels. At that time, the European powers were not concerned with any of the other conditions, or the free hand Japan had been granted in Korea under the other terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This would prove to be a mistake, as Japan would end up occupying Korea by 1905 and expand into Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence with the Russo-Japanese war, and then encroach upon Germany&#x27;s port in Shandong during World War I.

Within months after Japan returned the Liaodong peninsula, Russia started construction on the peninsula and a railway to Harbin from Port Arthur, despite Chinese protests. Eventually, Russia agreed to offer a diplomatic solution (See Russian Dalian) to the Chinese Empire, and agreed to a token lease of the region to save face, instead of annexing Manchuria outright, which was its effect. Within two years, Germany, France, and Great Britain had similarly taken advantage of the economic and political opportunities in the weak Chinese Empire (See Scramble for China), each taking control of significant local regions. Japan also took note of how the international community allowed the great powers to treat weaker nation states, and continued its remarkable measures to bootstrap itself into a modern industrial state and military power, with great success as it would demonstrate in the Russo-Japanese War less than a decade later.

In Taiwan, pro-Qing officials and elements of the local gentry declared a Republic of Formosa in 1895, but failed to win international recognition.

In China, the Treaty was considered a national humiliation by the bureaucracy and greatly weakened support for the Qing dynasty. The previous decades of the Self-Strengthening Movement were considered to be a failure, and support grew for more radical changes in China&#x27;s political and social systems which led to Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898. When the latter movement failed due to resistance from the Manchu nobility, a series of uprisings culminated in the fall of the Qing dynasty itself in 1911.

The Triple Intervention is regarded by many Japanese historians as being a crucial historic turning point in Japanese foreign affairs – from this point on, the nationalist, expansionist, and militant elements began to join ranks and steer Japan from a foreign policy based mainly on economic hegemony toward outright imperialism — a case of &quot;the coerced&quot; turning increasingly &quot;to coercion&quot;.

Both the Republic of China, now controlling Taiwan, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, now controlling mainland China, consider the transfer of Taiwan to Japan to have been reversed by the Instrument of Surrender of Japan. Additionally, the Treaty of Shimonoseki is allegedly nullified by the Treaty of Taipei with the Republic of China. However, pro-independence activist Ng Chiau-tong argues that the terms subject to nullification should be limited to those not entirely fulfilled yet, to the exclusion of the cession provision. The People&#x27;s Republic of China does not recognize the Treaty of Taipei.

===Prelude to war===

Russia wasted little time after the Triple Intervention to move men and materials down into the Liaodong to start building a railroad from both ends — Port Arthur and Harbin, as it already had railway construction in progress across northern Manchuria to shorten the rail route to Russia&#x27;s principal Pacific Ocean naval base at Vladivostok, a port closed by ice four months of each year. Russia also improved the port facilities at Port Arthur and founded a commercial town nearby at Dalniy (modern-day Dalian, which now encompasses Port Arthur as its Lüshunkou District), before inking the lease of the territory.

When the de facto governance of Port Arthur and the Liaodong peninsula was granted de jure to Russia by China along with an increase in other rights she had obtained in Manchuria (especially those in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces) the construction of the 550 mile Southern spurline of the Manchurian Railway was redoubled. Russia finally seemed to have gotten what the Russian Empire had been wanting in its quest to become a global power since the reign of Peter the Great. This ice-free natural harbor of Port Arthur/Lüshun would serve to make Russia a great sea as well as the largest land power. Russia needed this ice-free port to achieve world power status as it was tired of being blocked by the balance of power politics in Europe (The Ottoman Empire and its allies had repeatedly frustrated Russian power fruition).

However, the omission of the geopolitical reality in ignoring the free hand Japan had been granted by the Treaty (of Shimonoseki) with respect to Korea and Taiwan was short-sighted of Russia with respect to its strategic goals; to get to and maintain a strong point in Port Arthur Russia would have to dominate and control many additional hundreds of miles of Eastern Manchuria (the Fengtian province of Imperial China, modern Jilin and Heilongjiang) up to Harbin. Japan had long considered the lands paralleling the whole Korean border as part of its strategic sphere of influence. By leasing &quot;Liaodong&quot; and railway concessions, Russia crashed its Sphere of Influence squarely into Japan&#x27;s.

This acted as a further goad to emerging Japanese anger at their disrespectful treatment by all the West. In the immediate fallout of the &quot;Triple Intervention&quot;, Japanese popular resentment at Russia&#x27;s deviousness and the perceived weakness of its own government caving in to foreign pressure led to riots in Tokyo. The disturbance almost brought down the government, as well as a strengthening of imperial and expansionist factions within Japan. The Russian spear into the sphere also brought about the ensuing struggle with Russia for dominance in Korea and Manchuria. These events eventually led to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 by a renewed and modernized Japanese military, which led to a major defeat for Russia that marked the beginning of the end for the Romanov dynasty.

<text>The Surgeon of Crowthorne: A Tale of Murder, Madness and the Love of Words is a non-fiction history book by British writer Simon Winchester, first published in England in 1998. It was retitled The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary in the United States and Canada.

==Plot==
The book tells the story of the making of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) and one of its most prolific early contributors, William Chester Minor, a retired United States Army surgeon. Minor was, at the time, imprisoned in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, near the village of Crowthorne, in Berkshire, England.

The &quot;professor&quot; referred to in the North American title is Sir James Murray, the chief editor of the &quot;OED&quot; during most of the project. Murray was a talented linguist and had other scholarly interests, and had taught in schools and worked in banking. Faced with the enormous task of producing a comprehensive dictionary, with a quotation illustrating the uses of each meaning of each word, and with evidence for the earliest use of each, Murray enlisted the help of dozens of amateur philologists as volunteer researchers.

==History of creation==
A journalist with three decades of experience, and the author of a dozen travel-inspired books, Winchester&#x27;s initial proposal to write a book about an obscure lexicographer was originally met with rejection. Only when HarperCollins editor Larry Ashmead read the proposal and championed the book did Winchester pursue the necessary research in earnest. Of the project Ashmead said &quot;we can make lexicography cool&quot;. It was Ashmead who persuaded Winchester to call the North American edition &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; (over Winchester&#x27;s objection that Murray was not a professor), saying &quot;No one here knows what the hell a Crowthorne is.&quot;

==Reception==
The book was a major success. Winchester went on to write &quot;The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (2003) about the broader history of the &quot;OED&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation of the book, starring Mel Gibson as Murray and Sean Penn as Minor and directed by Farhad Safinia under the pseudonym P. B. Shemran, was released in 2019 with the title &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot;. The movie rights for the book were bought by Gibson&#x27;s Icon Productions in 1998. John Boorman wrote a script and was at one time tapped to direct, as was Luc Besson. Production began in 2016, but the release was delayed by legal disputes between parties in the film&#x27;s production.

<doc id="65924" wikidata="Q3381613" url="?curid=65924" title="Photoplotter">
<text>A photoplotter is a specialized electro-opto-mechanical machine that exposes a latent image on a medium, usually high-contrast monochromatic (black-and-white) photographic film, using a light source being controlled by a computer. Once the film has been exposed, it must be processed before it is ready for use. Photoplotters are used primarily for industrial production of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuit (IC) packaging.

In the PCB industry, photoplotting is the first step of making photolithography masks for printed circuit boards. These masks are called &quot;photoplots&quot; and are limited in resolution by the technology in use; in 1998, photoplots with resolvable details of 2.5 μm or more were possible. Integrated circuits are made in a similar fashion utilizing &quot;photomasks&quot; with sub-micrometer feature sizes; photomasks are traditionally made by photoreducing photoplotter output. 

Other application of photoplotters include chemical milling and specialized graphic arts.

==History==
The first photoplotter was introduced by Gerber Scientific, Inc. in the 1960s. The company&#x27;s file standard, the Gerber format for PCB files, eventually became an industry standard for describing the printed circuit board images such as the copper layers, solder mask and legend.

Early machines used a xenon flash lamp, and projected an image mounted in a rotating &quot;aperture wheel&quot; onto the photosensitive surface of the film or glass plate. The imaging head assembly traversed over the surface of the media without touching it to produce &quot;draws&quot; and &quot;flashes&quot;. Draws are vectors or arcs created by continuous illumination as the imaging head moves over the photosensitive surface. A flash creates a single simple graphic in a location by shining light through an aperture of the appropriate shape at a fixed location.

Modern photoplotters are generally raster-scan devices that use a laser beam focused to one or more spots, modulated at multi-megahertz rates to form the image.

The most recent development related to photoplotting is laser direct imaging (LDI) which utilizes a high-power laser or xenon lamp to directly expose photoresist on a coated substrate instead of exposing photographic film. This eliminates the handling of photographic film.

The input of photoplotters is a vector graphics file, typically in Gerber format.

Manufacturers of photoplotters include Gerber Scientific, Orbotech and Ucamco.

<doc id="65926" wikidata="Q3305038" url="?curid=65926" title="Angular displacement">
<text>The angular displacement (symbol θ, , or φ) – also called angle of rotation, rotational displacement, or rotary displacement – of a physical body is the angle (in units of radians, degrees, turns, etc.) through which the body rotates (revolves or spins) around a centre or axis of rotation. Angular displacement may be signed, indicating the sense of rotation (e.g., clockwise); it may also be greater (in absolute value) than a full turn.

==Context==

When a body rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, as in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time. When dealing with the rotation of a body, it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid. A body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the body&#x27;s motion, so for example parts of its mass are not flying off. In a realistic sense, all things can be deformable, however this impact is minimal and negligible.

== Example ==
In the example illustrated to the right (or above in some mobile versions), a particle or body P is at a fixed distance &quot;r&quot; from the origin, &quot;O&quot;, rotating counterclockwise. It becomes important to then represent the position of particle P in terms of its polar coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;). In this particular example, the value of &quot;θ&quot; is changing, while the value of the radius remains the same. (In rectangular coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; vary with time.) As the particle moves along the circle, it travels an arc length &quot;s&quot;, which becomes related to the angular position through the relationship:
:formula_1

== Definition and units ==
Angular displacement may be expressed in radians or degrees. Using radians provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle (&quot;circular arc length&quot;) and the distance &quot;r&quot; from the centre (&quot;radius&quot;):

:formula_2

For example, if a body rotates 360° around a circle of radius &quot;r&quot;, the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2π&quot;r&quot; - divided by the radius: formula_3 which easily simplifies to: formula_4. Therefore, 1 revolution is formula_5 radians.

The above definition is part of the International System of Quantities (ISQ), formalized in the international standard ISO 80000-3 (Space and time), and adopted in the International System of Units (SI).

Angular displacement may be signed, indicating the sense of rotation (e.g., clockwise); it may also be greater (in absolute value) than a full turn.
In the ISQ/SI, angular displacement is used to define the &quot;number of revolutions&quot;, &quot;N&quot;θ/(2π rad), a ratio-type quantity of dimension one.

== In three dimensions ==


In three dimensions, angular displacement is an entity with a direction and a magnitude. The direction specifies the axis of rotation, which always exists by virtue of the Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem; the magnitude specifies the rotation in radians about that axis (using the right-hand rule to determine direction). This entity is called an axis-angle.

Despite having direction and magnitude, angular displacement is not a vector because it does not obey the commutative law for addition. Nevertheless, when dealing with infinitesimal rotations, second order infinitesimals can be discarded and in this case commutativity appears.

=== Rotation matrices ===
Several ways to describe rotations exist, like rotation matrices or Euler angles. See charts on SO(3) for others.

Given that any frame in the space can be described by a rotation matrix, the displacement among them can also be described by a rotation matrix. Being formula_6 and formula_7 two matrices, the angular displacement matrix between them can be obtained as formula_8. When this product is performed having a very small difference between both frames we will obtain a matrix close to the identity.

In the limit, we will have an infinitesimal rotation matrix.

<text>In physics, angular velocity (symbol  or formula_1, the lowercase Greek letter omega), also known as the angular frequency vector, is a pseudovector representation of how the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time, i.e. how quickly an object rotates (spins or revolves) around an axis of rotation and how fast the axis itself changes direction. 

The magnitude of the pseudovector, formula_2, represents the &quot;angular speed&quot; (or &quot;angular frequency&quot;), the angular rate at which the object rotates (spins or revolves). The pseudovector direction formula_3 is normal to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement. 

There are two types of angular velocity:
* Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point object revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. 
* Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its center of rotation and is independent of the choice of origin, in contrast to orbital angular velocity.

Angular velocity has dimension of angle per unit time; this is analogous to linear velocity, with angle replacing distance, with time in common. The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second, although degrees per second (°/s) is also common. The radian is a dimensionless quantity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are dimensionally equivalent to reciprocal seconds, s−1, although rad/s is preferable to avoid confusion with rotation velocity in units of hertz (also equivalent to s−1). 

The sense of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule, implying clockwise rotations (as viewed on the plane of rotation); negation (multiplication by −1) leaves the magnitude unchanged but flips the axis in the opposite direction.

For example, a geostationary satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator (360 degrees per 24 hours) has angular velocity magnitude (angular speed) &quot;ω&quot; = 360°/24 h = 15°/h (or 2π rad/24 h ≈ 0.26 rad/h) and angular velocity direction (a unit vector) parallel to Earth&#x27;s rotation axis (formula_4, in the geocentric coordinate system). If angle is measured in radians, the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, formula_5. With orbital radius 42,000 km from the Earth&#x27;s center, the satellite&#x27;s tangential speed through space is thus &quot;v&quot; = 42,000 km × 0.26/h ≈ 11,000 km/h. The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels prograde with the Earth&#x27;s rotation (the same direction as the rotation of Earth).

 Geosynchronous satellites actually orbit based on a sidereal day which is 23h 56m 04s, but 24h is assumed in this example for simplicity.

== Orbital angular velocity of a point particle ==

=== Particle in two dimensions ===
In the simplest case of circular motion at radius formula_6, with position given by the angular displacement formula_7 from the x-axis, the orbital angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: formula_8. If formula_9 is measured in radians, the arc-length from the positive x-axis around the circle to the particle is formula_10, and the linear velocity is formula_11, so that formula_12.

In the general case of a particle moving in the plane, the orbital angular velocity is the rate at which the position vector relative to a chosen origin &quot;sweeps out&quot; angle. The diagram shows the position vector formula_13 from the origin formula_14 to a particle formula_15, with its polar coordinates formula_16. (All variables are functions of time formula_17.) The particle has linear velocity splitting as formula_18, with the radial component formula_19 parallel to the radius, and the cross-radial (or tangential) component formula_20 perpendicular to the radius. When there is no radial component, the particle moves around the origin in a circle; but when there is no cross-radial component, it moves in a straight line from the origin. Since radial motion leaves the angle unchanged, only the cross-radial component of linear velocity contributes to angular velocity.

The angular velocity &quot;ω&quot; is the rate of change of angular position with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as:

formula_21

Here the cross-radial speed formula_22 is the signed magnitude of formula_20, positive for counter-clockwise motion, negative for clockwise. Taking polar coordinates for the linear velocity formula_24 gives magnitude formula_25 (linear speed) and angle formula_26 relative to the radius vector; in these terms, formula_27, so that

formula_28

These formulas may be derived doing formula_29, being formula_6 a function of the distance to the origin with respect to time, and formula_31 a function of the angle between the vector and the x axis. Then:
formula_32
which is equal to:
formula_33
(see Unit vector in cylindrical coordinates). 

Knowing formula_34, we conclude that the radial component of the velocity is given by formula_35, because formula_36 is a radial unit vector; and the perpendicular component is given by formula_37 because formula_38 is a perpendicular unit vector.

In two dimensions, angular velocity is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity then may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.

=== Particle in three dimensions ===
In three-dimensional space, we again have the position vector r of a moving particle. Here, orbital angular velocity is a pseudovector whose magnitude is the rate at which r sweeps out angle (in radians per unit of time), and whose direction is perpendicular to the instantaneous plane in which r sweeps out angle (i.e. the plane spanned by r and v). However, as there are &quot;two&quot; directions perpendicular to any plane, an additional condition is necessary to uniquely specify the direction of the angular velocity; conventionally, the right-hand rule is used.

Let the pseudovector formula_39 be the unit vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by r and v, so that the right-hand rule is satisfied (i.e. the instantaneous direction of angular displacement is counter-clockwise looking from the top of formula_39). Taking polar coordinates formula_41 in this plane, as in the two-dimensional case above, one may define the orbital angular velocity vector as:

: formula_42

where &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between r and v. In terms of the cross product, this is:

: formula_43

From the above equation, one can recover the tangential velocity as:

:formula_44

== Spin angular velocity of a rigid body or reference frame ==

Given a rotating frame of three unit coordinate vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed at each instant. In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius.

The rotating frame appears in the context of rigid bodies, and special tools have been developed for it: the spin angular velocity may be described as a vector or equivalently as a tensor.

Consistent with the general definition, the spin angular velocity of a frame is defined as the orbital angular velocity of any of the three vectors (same for all) with respect to its own center of rotation. The addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a gimbal. All components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames (Euler angles or rotation matrices). As in the general case, addition is commutative: formula_45.

By Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem, any rotating frame possesses an instantaneous axis of rotation, which is the direction of the angular velocity vector, and the magnitude of the angular velocity is consistent with the two-dimensional case.

If we choose a reference point formula_46 fixed in the rigid body, the velocity formula_47 of any point in the body is given by

:formula_48

=== Components from the basis vectors of a body-fixed frame ===

Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed point O. Construct a reference frame in the body consisting of an orthonormal set of vectors formula_49 fixed to the body and with their common origin at O. The spin angular velocity vector of both frame and body about O is then
: formula_50
where formula_51 is the time rate of change of the frame vector formula_52 due to the rotation.

This formula is incompatible with the expression for &quot;orbital&quot; angular velocity

: formula_53

as that formula defines angular velocity for a &quot;single point&quot; about O, while the formula in this section applies to a frame or rigid body. In the case of a rigid body a &quot;single&quot; formula_54 has to account for the motion of &quot;all&quot; particles in the body.

=== Components from Euler angles ===

The components of the spin angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by Leonhard Euler using his Euler angles and the use of an intermediate frame:
* One axis of the reference frame (the precession axis)
* The line of nodes of the moving frame with respect to the reference frame (nutation axis)
* One axis of the moving frame (the intrinsic rotation axis)

Euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector on each of these three axes is the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instantaneous rotation into three instantaneous Euler rotations). Therefore:

: formula_55

This basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:

: formula_56

where formula_57 are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.

<doc id="65928" wikidata="Q171846" url="?curid=65928" title="Bass Strait">
<text>Bass Strait () is a strait separating the island state of Tasmania from the Australian mainland (more specifically the coast of Victoria, with the exception of the land border across Boundary Islet). The strait provides the most direct waterway between the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea, and is also the only maritime route into the economically prominent Port Phillip Bay.

Formed 8,000 years ago by rising sea levels at the end of the last glacial period, the strait was named after English explorer and physician George Bass (1771–1803) by European colonists.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Bass Strait as follows:

:&quot;On the west.&quot; The eastern limit of the Great Australian Bight [being a line from Cape Otway, Australia, to King Island and thence to Cape Grim, the northwest extreme of Tasmania].

:&quot;On the east.&quot; The western limit of the Tasman Sea between Gabo Island and Eddystone Point [being a line from Gabo Island (near Cape Howe, 37°30&#x27;S) to the northeast point of East Sister Island (148°E) thence along the 148th meridian to Flinders Island; beyond this Island a line running to the Eastward of the Vansittart Shoals to [Cape] Barren Island, and from Cape Barren (the easternmost point of [Cape] Barren Island) to Eddystone Point (41°S) [in Tasmania].
===Differing views of location and context===
Some authorities consider the strait to be part of the Pacific Ocean as in the never-approved 2002 IHO &quot;Limits of Oceans and Seas&quot; draft. In the currently in-force IHO 1953 draft, it is instead associated with the Great Australian Bight; the Bight is numbered 62, while the Bass Strait is designated 62-A.

The Australian Hydrographic Service does not consider it to be part of its expanded definition of the Southern Ocean, but rather states that it lies with the Tasman Sea. The strait between the Furneaux Islands and Tasmania is Banks Strait, a subdivision of Bass Strait.

==Discovery and exploration==
===By Aboriginal peoples===

Aboriginal Tasmanians arrived in Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago during the last glacial period, across a broad prehistoric land bridge called the Bassian Plain between the nowaday southern Victoria coastline (from Wilsons Promontory to Cape Otway) and the northern Tasmanian shores (from Cape Portland to Cape Grim). After the glacial period ended, sea levels rose and flooded the Bassian Plain to form Bass Strait at around 8,000 years ago, leaving them isolated from the Australian mainland. Aboriginal people lived on Flinders Island until around 4,000 years ago.

Based on the recorded language groups, there were at least three successive waves of Aboriginal colonisation.

===By Europeans===
The strait was possibly detected by Captain Abel Tasman when he charted Tasmania&#x27;s coast in 1642. On 5 December Tasman was following the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent hunting.

The next European to approach the strait was Captain James Cook in &quot;HMS Endeavour&quot; in April 1770. However, after sailing for two hours westward towards the strait against the wind, he turned back east and noted in his journal that he was &quot;doubtful whether they [i.e. Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and New Holland] are one land or no&quot;.

The strait was named after George Bass, after he and Matthew Flinders sailed across it while circumnavigating Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now named Tasmania) in the &quot;Norfolk&quot; in 1798–99. At Flinders&#x27; recommendation, the Governor of New South Wales, John Hunter, in 1800 named the stretch of water between the mainland and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land &quot;Bass&#x27;s Straits&quot;. In 1798 it became known as Bass Strait.

The existence of the strait had been suggested in 1797 by the master of &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; when he reached Sydney after deliberately grounding his foundering ship and being stranded on Preservation Island (at the eastern end of the strait). He reported that the strong south westerly swell and the tides and currents suggested that the island was in a channel linking the Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. Governor Hunter thus wrote to Joseph Banks in August 1797 that it seemed certain a strait existed.

When news of the 1798 discovery of Bass Strait reached Europe, the French government despatched a reconnaissance expedition commanded by Nicolas Baudin. This prompted Governor King to send two vessels from Sydney to the island to establish a garrison at Hobart.

==Maritime history==
Strong currents between the Antarctic-driven southeast portions of the Indian Ocean and the Tasman Sea&#x27;s Pacific Ocean waters provide a strait of powerful, wild storm waves. The shipwrecks on the Tasmanian and Victorian coastlines number in the hundreds, although stronger metal ships and modern marine navigation have greatly reduced the danger.

Many vessels, some quite large, have disappeared without a trace, or left scant evidence of their passing. Despite myths and legends of piracy, wrecking and alleged supernatural phenomena akin to those of the Bermuda Triangle, such disappearances can be invariably ascribed to treacherous combinations of wind and sea conditions, and the numerous semi-submerged rocks and reefs within the Straits.

Despite the strait&#x27;s difficult waters, it provided a safer and less boisterous passage for ships on the route from Europe or India to Sydney in the early 19th century. The strait also saved on the voyage.

==Geography==

Bass Strait is approximately wide and long, with an average depth of . The widest opening is about between Cape Portland on the northeastern tip of Tasmania and Point Hicks on the Australian mainland.

Jennings&#x27; study of the submarine topography of Bass Strait described the bathymetric Bass Basin, a shallow depression approximately wide and long (over in area) in the centre of Bass Strait, a maximum depth is the channel between Inner Sister Island and Flinders Island, which navigation charts indicate reaches . Two underwater plateaus, the &quot;Bassian Rise&quot; and &quot;King Island Rise&quot; located on the eastern and western margins of Bass Strait, respectively, are composed of a basement of Paleozoic granite. These features form sills separating Bass Basin from the adjacent ocean basins. Associated with the less than -deep Bassian Rise is the Furneaux Islands, the largest of which is Flinders Island (maximum elevation ). The surface of the King Island Rise also occurs in water depths of less than , and includes the shallow () &quot;Tail Bank&quot; at its northern margin as well as King Island itself. Subaqueous dunes (sandwaves) and tidal current ridges cover approximately of the seabed in Bass Strait.

During Pleistocene, low sea level stands the central basin of Bass Strait was enclosed by raised sills forming a large shallow lake. This occurred during the last glacial maximum (18,000 BP) when the basin was completely isolated. Sea level rise during the marine transgression flooded the basin, forming a westward embayment from 11,800 BP to 8700 BP, and the basin rim was completely flooded by about 8000 BP, at which point Bass Strait was formed and Tasmania became an isolated island.

Like the rest of the waters surrounding Tasmania, and particularly because of its limited depth, it is notoriously rough, with many ships lost there during the 19th century. A lighthouse was erected on Deal Island in 1848 to assist ships navigating in the eastern part of the Straits, but there were no guides to the western entrance until the Cape Otway Lighthouse was first lit in 1848, followed by another at Cape Wickham at the northern end of King Island in 1861.

==Islands==

There are over 50 islands in Bass Strait. Major islands include:

Western section:
* King Island
* Three Hummock Island
* Hunter Island
* Robbins Island

South eastern section:
* Furneaux Group
** Flinders Island (where the surviving Aboriginal Tasmanians were exiled)
** Cape Barren Island
** Clarke Island
** Sister Islands Group
** and several other islands

North eastern section:
* Kent Group
** Deal Island
** and 3 smaller islands
* Hogan Island
* Curtis Island

==Protected areas==

===Federal===
Within Bass Strait there are several Commonwealth marine reserves, which are all part of the South-east Network. The two larger reserves, Flinders and Zeehan, extend mostly outside of the Bass Strait area.
* Apollo
* Beagle
* Boags
* East Gippsland
* Flinders
* Franklin
* Zeehan
===State===
The smaller islands of Bass Strait typically have some form of protection status. Most notably the Kent Group National Park covers the Kent Group islands of Tasmania, as well as the surrounding state waters which is a dedicated marine reserve. The national park is wholly contained by the Beagle Commonwealth Marine Reserve.

Victoria has several marine national parks in Bass Strait, and are all adjacent to the mainland coastline:
* Bunurong
* Ninety Mile Beach
* Point Addis
* Port Phillip Heads
* Twelve Apostles
* Wilsons Promontory
==Natural resources==

A number of oil and gas fields exist in the eastern portion of Bass Strait, in what is known as the Gippsland Basin. Most large fields were discovered in the 1960s, and are located about off the coast of Gippsland in water depths of about . These oil fields include the Halibut Field discovered in 1967, the Cobia Field discovered in 1972, the Kingfish Field, the Mackerel Field, and the Fortescue Field discovered in 1978. Large gas fields include the Whiptail field, the Barracouta Field, the Snapper Field, and the Marlin Field. Oil and gas are produced from the Cretaceous-Eocene clastic rocks of the Latrobe Group, deposited with the break-up of Australia and Antarctica. In 2020 activist group No Gas Across the Bass was set up after American company ConocoPhillips put in an application to seismic blast 27km from King Island. Further environmental campaigning followed the Australian government&#x27;s 2020 Oil and Gas acreage release as this opened up new areas of Tasmania&#x27;s oceans for exploration.

The western field, known as the Otway Basin, was discovered in the 1990s offshore near Port Campbell. Its exploitation began in 2005.

The oil and gas is sent via pipeline to gas processing facilities and oil refineries at Longford (Longford gas plant), Western Port (Westernport Refinery closed 1985), Altona (Altona Refinery scheduled to close in 2021) and Geelong (Geelong Oil Refinery), as well as by tanker to New South Wales. Pipelines from the Otway Basin gas fields lead to several processing facilities in the vicinity of Port Campbell (Iona Gas Plant and Otway Gas Plant).

In June 2017, the Government of Victoria announced a three-year feasibility study for Australia&#x27;s first offshore wind farm. The project, which could have 250 wind turbines within a area, is projected to deliver around 8,000 GWh of electricity, representing some 18 per cent of Victoria&#x27;s power usage and replacing a large part of the output of Hazelwood Power Station, which was closed in early 2017.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===

The fastest and often the cheapest method of travel across Bass Strait is by air. The major airports in Tasmania are Hobart Airport and Launceston Airport, where the main airlines are Jetstar and Virgin Australia. Qantas also operates services. The smaller airports in the north of the state and on the islands in the strait are served either by Rex Airlines, QantasLink or King Island Airlines.

Commercial Freight

Major commercial freight operator SeaRoad, complete daily sailings between Devonport and Port Melbourne Mon-Sat.

====Ferries====
The domestic sea route is serviced by two Spirit of Tasmania passenger vehicle ferries, based in Devonport, Tasmania. The ships travel daily between Devonport and Spirit of Tasmania Quay in Geelong as overnight trips, with additional daytime trips during the peak summer season.

===Energy===

The Basslink HVDC electrical cable has been in service since 2006. It has the capacity to carry up to 630 megawatts of electrical power across the strait.

Alinta owns a submarine gas pipeline, delivering natural gas to large industrial customers near George Town, as well as the Powerco gas network in Tasmania.

===Communications===
The first submarine communications cable across Bass Strait was laid in 1859. Starting at Cape Otway, Victoria, it went via King Island and Three Hummock Island, made contact with the Tasmanian mainland at Stanley Head, and then continued on to George Town. It started failing within a few weeks of completion, and by 1861 it failed completely.

Tasmania is currently connected to the mainland via two Telstra-operated fibre optic cables; since 2006, dark fibre capacity has also been available on the Basslink HVDC cable.

Other submarine cables include:

==Popular culture==

In 1978, one of the most famous UFO incidents in Australian history occurred over Bass Strait. Frederick Valentich was flying a small aeroplane over the strait when he reported to personnel at a local airport that a strange object was buzzing his plane. He then claimed that the object had moved directly in front of his plane; the airport personnel then heard a metallic &quot;scraping&quot; sound, followed by silence. Valentich and his plane subsequently vanished and neither Valentich nor his plane were ever seen again.

The issue of planes, ships and people having been lost in the strait over time has spawned a number of theories. Perhaps the most thorough list of losses and disappearances has been the oft reprinted book of Jack Loney though it is possible that most losses can be adequately explained by extreme weather events.

On the popular Australian soap &quot;Neighbours&quot;, one of its most dramatic storylines unfolded when a 1940s themed joy flight to Tasmania was sabotaged by a bomb. The plane crashed into Bass Strait in the middle of the night and many character&#x27;s lives were put at risk, with some drowning.

==Non-motorised crossings==
Bass Strait is regularly crossed by sailing vessels, including during the annual Melbourne to Hobart Yacht Race. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race passes generally east of the strait but is affected by its weather conditions.

===Sailing===
The first windsurfer crossing was in 1982 by Mark Paul and Les Tokolyi. In 1998 Australian offshore sailor Nick Moloney took on a different challenge by being the first person to windsurf unaided across the Bass Strait in a time of 22 hours.

In terms of dinghy sailing many crossings have been made but in March 2005 Australian Olympic medallist Michael Blackburn set a record when he crossed the strait in just over 13 hours in a Laser sailing dinghy.

In March 2009 two young dinghy sailors sailed a B14 (dinghy) from Stanley in north west Tasmania to Walkerville South in Victoria. The purpose of the voyage was to raise funds for the treatment of the endangered Tasmanian Devil, an animal species suffering from a facial tumour disease and, if possible, break the dinghy sailing time record for the crossing. The sailors Adrian Beswick and Josh Philips accompanied by a support vessel successfully completed the crossing in 14 hours 53 minutes.

Kitesurfers have also completed the crossing with Natalie Clark in 2010 become the first female to do the crossing.

===Rowing / Paddling===
In 1971 lone rower David Bowen from Mount Martha crossed Bass Strait in a dory, leaving from Devonport he landed on Wilson&#x27;s Promontory.

The first crossing by paddleboard was made by Jack Bark, Brad Gaul and Zeb Walsh, leaving Wilsons Promontory in Victoria on 25 February 2014 and arriving at Cape Portland in northeastern Tasmania on 4 March 2014.

Rod Harris, Ian and Peter Richards are credited with the first kayak crossing in 1971. Many sea kayakers have since made the crossing, usually by island hopping on the eastern side of the strait. Fewer sea kayak crossings have been made via King Island, due to the leg between Cape Wickam and Apollo Bay. Andrew McAuley was the first person to cross Bass Strait non-stop in a sea kayak in 2003. He made two more crossings of Bass Strait before he died attempting to cross the Tasman Sea in February 2007.

===Swimming===

Tammy van Wisse swam part of the strait in 1996, from King Island to Apollo Bay in Victoria, a distance of about in 17 hours and 46 minutes.

<doc id="65929" wikidata="Q186300" url="?curid=65929" title="Angular acceleration">
<text>In physics, angular acceleration (symbol α, alpha) is the time rate of change of angular velocity. Following the two types of angular velocity, &quot;spin angular velocity&quot; and &quot;orbital angular velocity&quot;, the respective types of angular acceleration are: spin angular acceleration, involving a rigid body about an axis of rotation intersecting the body&#x27;s centroid; and orbital angular acceleration, involving a point particle and an external axis.

Angular acceleration has physical dimensions of angle per time squared, measured in SI units of radians per second squared (rads−2). In two dimensions, angular acceleration is a pseudoscalar whose sign is taken to be positive if the angular speed increases counterclockwise or decreases clockwise, and is taken to be negative if the angular speed increases clockwise or decreases counterclockwise. In three dimensions, angular acceleration is a pseudovector.

== Orbital angular acceleration of a point particle ==

=== Particle in two dimensions ===

In two dimensions, the orbital angular acceleration is the rate at which the two-dimensional orbital angular velocity of the particle about the origin changes. The instantaneous angular velocity &quot;ω&quot; at any point in time is given by

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the distance from the origin and formula_3 is the cross-radial component of the instantaneous velocity (i.e. the component perpendicular to the position vector), which by convention is positive for counter-clockwise motion and negative for clockwise motion.

Therefore, the instantaneous angular acceleration &quot;α&quot; of the particle is given by

: formula_4

Expanding the right-hand-side using the product rule from differential calculus, this becomes

: formula_5

In the special case where the particle undergoes circular motion about the origin, formula_6 becomes just the tangential acceleration formula_7, and formula_8 vanishes (since the distance from the origin stays constant), so the above equation simplifies to

: formula_9

In two dimensions, angular acceleration is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the angular speed increases in the counter-clockwise direction or decreases in the clockwise direction, and the sign is taken negative if the angular speed increases in the clockwise direction or decreases in the counter-clockwise direction. Angular acceleration then may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.

=== Particle in three dimensions ===

In three dimensions, the orbital angular acceleration is the rate at which three-dimensional orbital angular velocity vector changes with time. The instantaneous angular velocity vector formula_10 at any point in time is given by

: formula_11

where formula_12 is the particle&#x27;s position vector, formula_2 its distance from the origin, and formula_14 its velocity vector.

Therefore, the orbital angular acceleration is the vector formula_15 defined by

: formula_16

Expanding this derivative using the product rule for cross-products and the ordinary quotient rule, one gets:

: formula_17

Since formula_18 is just formula_19, the second term may be rewritten as formula_20. In the case where the distance formula_2 of the particle from the origin does not change with time (which includes circular motion as a subcase), the second term vanishes and the above formula simplifies to

: formula_22

From the above equation, one can recover the cross-radial acceleration in this special case as:

: formula_23

Unlike in two dimensions, the angular acceleration in three dimensions need not be associated with a change in the angular &quot;speed formula_24&quot;: If the particle&#x27;s position vector &quot;twists&quot; in space, changing its instantaneous plane of angular displacement, the change in the &quot;direction&quot; of the angular velocity formula_25 will still produce a nonzero angular acceleration. This cannot not happen if the position vector is restricted to a fixed plane, in which case formula_25 has a fixed direction perpendicular to the plane.

The angular acceleration vector is more properly called a pseudovector: It has three components which transform under rotations in the same way as the Cartesian coordinates of a point do, but which do not transform like Cartesian coordinates under reflections.

=== Relation to torque ===

The net &quot;torque&quot; on a point particle is defined to be the pseudovector

: formula_27

where formula_28 is the net force on the particle.

Torque is the rotational analogue of force: it induces change in the rotational state of a system, just as force induces change in the translational state of a system. As force on a particle is connected to acceleration by the equation formula_29, one may write a similar equation connecting torque on a particle to angular acceleration, though this relation is necessarily more complicated.

First, substituting formula_30 into the above equation for torque, one gets

: formula_31

From the previous section:

: formula_32

where formula_33 is orbital angular acceleration and formula_25 is orbital angular velocity. Therefore:

: formula_35

In the special case of constant distance formula_2 of the particle from the origin (formula_37), the second term in the above equation vanishes and the above equation simplifies to

: formula_38

which can be interpreted as a &quot;rotational analogue&quot; to formula_30, where the quantity formula_40 (known as the moment of inertia of the particle) plays the role of the mass formula_41. However, unlike formula_30, this equation does &quot;not&quot; apply to an arbitrary trajectory, only to a trajectory contained within a spherical shell about the origin.

<text>ANSI escape sequences are a standard for in-band signaling to control cursor location, color, font styling, and other options on video text terminals and terminal emulators. Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.

ANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s. Although hardware text terminals have become increasingly rare in the 21st century, the relevance of the ANSI standard persists because a great majority of terminal emulators and command consoles interpret at least a portion of the ANSI standard.

== History ==
Almost all manufacturers of video terminals added vendor-specific escape sequences to perform operations such as placing the cursor at arbitrary positions on the screen. One example is the VT52 terminal, which allowed the cursor to be placed at an x,y location on the screen by sending the character, a character, and then two characters representing numerical values equal to the x,y location plus 32 (thus starting at the ASCII space character and avoiding the control characters). The Hazeltine 1500 had a similar feature, invoked using , and then the X and Y positions separated with a comma. While the two terminals had identical functionality in this regard, different control sequences had to be used to invoke them.

As these sequences were different for different terminals, elaborate libraries such as termcap (&quot;terminal capabilities&quot;) and utilities such as tput had to be created so programs could use the same API to work with any terminal. In addition, many of these terminals required sending numbers (such as row and column) as the binary values of the characters; for some programming languages, and for systems that did not use ASCII internally, it was often difficult to turn a number into the correct character.

The ANSI standard attempted to address these problems by making a command set that all terminals would use and requiring all numeric information to be transmitted as ASCII numbers. The first standard in the series was ECMA-48, adopted in 1976. It was a continuation of a series of character coding standards, the first one being ECMA-6 from 1965, a 7-bit standard from which ISO 646 originates. The name &quot;ANSI escape sequence&quot; dates from 1979 when ANSI adopted ANSI X3.64. The ANSI X3L2 committee collaborated with the ECMA committee TC 1 to produce nearly identical standards. These two standards were merged into an international standard, ISO 6429. In 1994, ANSI withdrew its standard in favor of the international standard.
The first popular video terminal to support these sequences was the Digital VT100, introduced in 1978. This model was very successful in the market, which sparked a variety of VT100 clones, among the earliest and most popular of which was the much more affordable Zenith Z-19 in 1979. Others included the Qume QVT-108, Televideo TVI-970, Wyse WY-99GT as well as optional &quot;VT100&quot; or &quot;VT103&quot; or &quot;ANSI&quot; modes with varying degrees of compatibility on many other brands. The popularity of these gradually led to more and more software (especially bulletin board systems and other online services) assuming the escape sequences worked, leading to almost all new terminals and emulator programs supporting them.

In 1981, ANSI X3.64 was adopted for use in the US government by FIPS publication 86. Later, the US government stopped duplicating industry standards, so FIPS pub. 86 was withdrawn.

ECMA-48 has been updated several times and is currently at its 5th edition, from 1991. It is also adopted by ISO and IEC as standard ISO/IEC 6429. A version is adopted as a Japanese Industrial Standard, as JIS X 0211.

Related standards include ITU T.61, the Teletex standard, and the ISO/IEC 8613, the Open Document Architecture standard (mainly ISO/IEC 8613-6 or ITU T.416). The two systems share many escape codes with the ANSI system, with extensions that are not necessarily meaningful to computer terminals. Both systems quickly fell into disuse, but ECMA-48 does mark the extensions used in them as reserved.

== Platform support ==

In the early 1980s, large amounts of software directly used these sequences to update screen displays. This included everything on VMS (which assumed DEC terminals), most software designed to be portable on CP/M home computers, and even lots of Unix software as it was easier to use than the termcap libraries, such as the shell script examples below in this article.

Terminal emulators for communicating with remote machines almost always implement ANSI escape codes. This includes anything written to communicate with bulletin-board systems on home and personal computers. On Unix terminal emulators such as xterm also can communicate with software running on the same machine, and thus software running in X11 under a terminal emulator could assume the ability to write these sequences.

As computers got more powerful even built-in displays started supporting them, allowing software to be portable between CP/M systems. There were attempts to extend the escape sequences to support printers and as an early PDF-like document storage format, the Open Document Architecture.

=== DOS and Windows ===
The IBM PC, introduced in 1981, did not support these or any other escape sequences for updating the screen. Only a few control characters (BEL, CR, LF, BS) were interpreted by the underlying BIOS. Any display effects had to be done with BIOS calls, which were notoriously slow, or by directly manipulating the IBM PC hardware. This made any interesting software non-portable and led to the need to duplicate details of the display hardware in PC Clones.

DOS version 2.0 included an optional device driver named . Poor performance, and the fact that it was not installed by default, meant software rarely (if ever) took advantage of it.

The Windows Console did not support ANSI escape sequences, nor did Microsoft provide any method to enable them. Some replacements such as JP Software&#x27;s TCC (formerly 4NT), Michael J. Mefford&#x27;s ANSI.COM, Jason Hood&#x27;s and Maximus5&#x27;s ConEmu enabled ANSI escape sequences. Software such as the Python colorama package or Cygwin modified text in-process as it was sent to the console, extracting the ANSI Escape sequences and emulating them with Windows calls.

In 2016, Microsoft released the Windows 10 version 1511 update which unexpectedly implemented support for ANSI escape sequences, over three decades after the debut of Windows. This was done alongside Windows Subsystem for Linux, apparently to allow Unix-like terminal-based software to use the Windows Console. Windows PowerShell 5.1 enabled this by default, and PowerShell 6 made it possible to embed the necessary ESC character into a string with . 

Windows Terminal, introduced in 2019, supports the sequences by default, and Microsoft intends to replace the Windows Console with Windows Terminal.

== C0 control codes ==
Almost all users assume some functions of some single-byte characters. Initially defined as part of ASCII, the default C0 control code set is now defined in ISO 6429 (ECMA-48), making it part of the same standard as the C1 set invoked by the ANSI escape sequences (although ISO 2022 allows the ISO 6429 C0 set to be used without the ISO 6429 C1 set, and &quot;vice versa&quot;, provided that 0x1B is always ESC). This is used to shorten the amount of data transmitted, or to perform some functions that are unavailable from escape sequences:

Escape sequences vary in length. The general format for an ANSI-compliant escape sequence is defined by ANSI X3.41 (equivalent to ECMA-35 or ISO/IEC 2022). The escape sequences consist only of bytes in the range (all the non-control ASCII characters), and can be parsed without looking ahead. The behavior when a control character, a byte with the high bit set, or a byte that is not part of any valid sequence, is encountered before the end is undefined.

== Fe Escape sequences ==

If the  is followed by a byte in the range 0x40 to 0x5F, the escape sequence is of type . Its interpretation is delegated to the applicable C1 control code standard. Accordingly, all escape sequences corresponding to C1 control codes from ANSI X3.64 / ECMA-48 follow this format.

The standard says that, in 8-bit environments, the control functions corresponding to type escape sequences (those from the set of C1 control codes) can be represented as single bytes in the 0x80–0x9F range. This is possible in character encodings conforming to the provisions for an 8-bit code made in ISO 2022, such as the ISO 8859 series. However, in character encodings used on modern devices such as UTF-8 or CP-1252, those codes are often used for other purposes, so only the 2-byte sequence is typically used. In the case of UTF-8, representing a C1 control code via the C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement block results in a different two-byte code (e.g. for ), but no space is saved this way.





== Control Sequence Introducer commands ==

For Control Sequence Introducer, or CSI, commands, the (written as , or in several programming languages) is followed by any number (including none) of &quot;parameter bytes&quot; in the range 0x30–0x3F (ASCII codice_1), then by any number of &quot;intermediate bytes&quot; in the range 0x20–0x2F (ASCII space and ), then finally by a single &quot;final byte&quot; in the range 0x40–0x7E (ASCII codice_2 to codice_3 are the same as the ANSI output sequences. The codice_4 is normally omitted if no modifier keys are pressed, but most implementations always emit the codice_4 for . (draft section)

Xterm has a comprehensive documentation page on the various function-key and mouse input sequence schemes from DEC&#x27;s VT terminals and various other terminals it emulates. Thomas Dickey has added a lot of support to it over time; he also maintains a list of default keys used by other terminal emulators for comparison.

* On the Linux console, certain function keys generate sequences of the form codice_6. The CSI sequence should terminate on the codice_7.
* Old versions of Terminator generate codice_8 when are pressed with modifiers. The faulty behavior was copied from GNOME Terminal.
* xterm replies codice_9 if asked for cursor position and codice_10 if the key is pressed with modifiers, which collide in the case of codice_11. This can be avoided by using the &quot;?&quot; private modifier as codice_12, which will be reflected in the response as codice_13.
* many terminals prepend codice_14 to any character that is typed with the alt key down. This creates ambiguity for uppercase letters and symbols codice_15, which would form C1 codes.
* Konsole generates codice_16 when are pressed with modifiers.
* iTerm2 supports reporting additional keys via an enhanced CSI u mode.

<doc id="65931" wikidata="Q359251" url="?curid=65931" title="Jean Hersholt">
<text>Jean Pierre Carl Buron (12 July 1886 – 2 June 1956), known professionally as Jean Hersholt, was a Danish-American actor. He is most famous for starring on the CBS radio series &quot;Dr. Christian&quot; from 1937–1954, which later inspired a TV series with the same name from 1956-1957. He also co-starred with Shirley Temple in the film &quot;Heidi&quot; (1937). When asked how to pronounce his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;, &quot;in English &quot;her&#x27;sholt&quot;; in Danish, &quot;hairs&#x27;hult&quot;.&quot; From 1924 to 1955, he had 140 motion picture credits: 75 silent film and 65 &quot;talkies&quot;; he directed four.

==Early life==
Hersholt was born Jean Pierre Carl Buron on 12 July 1886 in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. He claimed to have been born into a family of actors, but in reality, both of his parents, Henri Pierre Buron and Clara (née Petersen), were hairdressers.
Henri was the son of a French Roman Catholic father and a Danish Protestant mother, while Clara was the daughter of a Danish Protestant father and a Danish Jewish mother. Initially, Henri worked as a hairdresser but later became a cigar and wine merchant/vendor. Hersholt appeared in two of the first short films of the Danish film studio Nordisk Film in 1906, but did not find much success in his early years in Denmark. Hersholt emigrated to the United States in 1913, and spent the remainder of his acting career in America.

==Career==
Hersholt is best remembered for his roles in two iconic films. In 1924, he played Marcus Schouler in the silent film classic &quot;Greed&quot; directed by Erich von Stroheim. A decade later, he co-starred with world-famous child actress Shirley Temple as her beloved grandfather living in the remote Alps in the 1937 film version of the classic 1880 children&#x27;s book, &quot;Heidi&quot;, written by Swiss author Johanna Spyri. Throughout his extensive film career, he portrayed a wide range of characters, from villains in early silent films to supporting roles where his gentle Danish language accent and pleasant voice made him well-suited to portray a succession of benevolent fathers, doctors, professors, and European noblemen. Hersholt&#x27;s final on-screen appearance was in the 1955 movie &quot;Run for Cover&quot;.

In the 1936 movie &quot;The Country Doctor&quot;, starring the famous Dionne quintuplets children, Hersholt portrayed Dr. John Luke, a character based on Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe, the Canadian obstetrician who delivered and cared for the Dionne quintuplets. Two sequels followed the movie. Hersholt wanted to portray the role on radio but could not obtain the rights. He chose to create his own doctor character for radio. Since he was a fan of fairy tale anthology author Hans Christian Andersen, he borrowed that name for his character portrayal. This character, &quot;Dr. Paul Christian,&quot; was a philosophical doctor who practiced in the typical Midwestern town of River&#x27;s End. He received assistance from Nurse Judy Price and occasionally from others. On 7 November 1937, &quot;Dr. Christian&quot; debuted on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio network as part of the &#x27;Vaseline Program&#x27; opening with the theme music, &quot;Rainbow on the River.&quot;

The small-town physician&#x27;s good humor, innate common sense, and scientific training helped drive off a series of villainous types attempting to disrupt the peaceful lifestyle of River&#x27;s End. The radio series, produced by Dorothy McCann, became a popular long-running hit. It aired on the CBS network for 17 years until 6 January 1954. Hersholt was so strongly associated with the role that he received mail asking for real-life medical advice. The Dr. Christian series spawned several spin-offs, making it one of the earliest media franchises. For example, Hersholt co-wrote a Dr. Christian novel and starred in a series of six family feature films as Dr. Christian in a franchise spanning two years, from 1939 to 1941. An example of one of these films is &quot;Dr. Christian Meets the Women&quot; released in 1940.

In 1956, two years after the long-running radio program concluded, the character Dr. Christian made the transition to television and its unique programming style. The script for this new television program was written by a young Gene Roddenberry, who would later become famous for creating the original TV series &#x27;Star Trek&#x27; in 1966. This led to the renowned science fiction franchise over the next few decades. The new &#x27;Dr. Christian&#x27; TV show differed from the radio series by introducing a new younger character portrayed by Macdonald Carey as the elder Christian&#x27;s nephew, &quot;Dr. Mark Christian&quot;. The show was syndicated through CBS and its production company, Ziv Television, and ran for two seasons from 1956-1957. It was mostly broadcast at non-traditional times on local stations nationwide, after Jean Hersholt&#x27;s death in early 1956.

From the late 1930s through the mid 1950s, Neil Reagan, the brother of actor and future U.S. president Ronald Reagan, worked as a traveling industry spokesman for the General Electric Company. Additionally, Neil directed the earlier CBS radio series &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, with Jean Hersholt.

In 1939, Hersholt broadened his social interests and played a critical role in establishing the Motion Picture Relief Fund, now known as the Motion Picture and Television Fund. This fund provides medical care and support for Hollywood industry employees at various levels, offering assistance when experiencing difficulties due to illness, old age, or other challenges. This occurred just four years after the establishment of America&#x27;s &quot;social safety net&quot; with the passage of Social Security old age pension system by the Roosevelt administration. The fund Hersholt supported was used to establish the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. After his death in 1956, his philanthropic endeavors led to the establishment of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. This honorary Academy Award, also known as the &quot;Oscar,&quot; is presented to an &quot;individual in the motion picture industry whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry.&quot; The fund was later expanded to include those working in the television field.

As president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Hersholt was actively involved in various activities to promote and preserve American cinema. On March 20, 1948, during the 20th anniversary of the academy&#x27;s founding, he presented special awards to several pioneers of the American motion pictures/film industry. The recipients included Colonel William N. Selig, Albert E. Smith, George K. Spoor, and Thomas Armat. These individuals were often referred to as &quot;the Men Who Invented Hollywood&quot;.

Hersholt&#x27;s extensive collection of books and other materials by the famous Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is now housed in the special collections division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.. He translated over 160 of Andersen&#x27;s fairy tales into English. These were published in 1949 in six volumes as &quot;The Complete Andersen&quot;, this work is &quot;... rated as &quot;The&quot; standard translation, being one of the best&quot; in English cited by the Hans Christian Andersen Center of the University of Southern Denmark.

Hersholt was appointed a knight of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog and awarded a medal in 1948, partly due to this literary academic endeavor.

On August 31, 1952, the accomplished elder Hersholt appeared as the mystery guest on the popular long-running CBS-TV panel/quiz show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; less than four years before his death. The show aired from the 1950s and into the 1960s and was hosted by John Charles Daly.

==Family==
Hersholt married Via Andersen on 11 April 1914. They had one son, Allan Hersholt.

He was the paternal half-uncle (by marriage) of actor Leslie Nielsen and former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Erik Nielsen.

==Death==
Hersholt died of cancer in Hollywood in 1956 and is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. His grave is marked with a statue of Klods-Hans (English: Clumsy Hans), a Hans Christian Andersen character who left home to find his way in the world — much as Hersholt himself had done.

==Honors and awards==
Hersholt was honored for his services to the industry three times with an honorary Academy Award, first in 1940 and the second time in 1949 and the third time in 1950. In his honor, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He is one of only 11 people with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One is located at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard for his work in motion pictures, and another one is located at 6701 Hollywood Boulevard for his work in radio.

<doc id="65937" wikidata="Q876244" url="?curid=65937" title="Tael">
<text>Tael (), or liang, also known as the tahil and by other names, can refer to any one of several weight measures used in East and Southeast Asia. It usually refers to the Chinese tael, a part of the Chinese system of weights and currency. The Chinese tael was standardized to 50 grams in 1959.

In Hong Kong and Singapore, it is equivalent to 10 mace () or catty, albeit with slightly different metric equivalents in these two places. These Chinese units of measurement are usually used in Chinese herbal medicine stores as well as gold and silver exchange.

== Names ==

The English word &quot;tael&quot; comes through Portuguese from the Malay word , meaning &quot;weight&quot;. Early English forms of the name such as &quot;tay&quot; or &quot;taes&quot; derive from the Portuguese plural of tael, .

Tahil ( in Singaporean English) is used in Malay &quot;and&quot; English today when referring to the weight in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, where it is still used in some contexts especially related to the significant Overseas Chinese population.

In Chinese, tael is written (simplified as ) and has the Mandarin pronunciation &quot;liǎng&quot;. The phrase &quot;half a catty, eight taels&quot; &quot;bàn jīn, bā liǎng&quot;) is still used to mean two options are exactly equivalent, similar to the English &quot;six of one, half a dozen of the other&quot;.

== Historical usage ==

In China, there were many different weighting standards of tael depending on the region or type of trade. In general the silver tael weighed around . The most common government measure was the &quot;Kuping&quot; () tael, weighing . A common commercial weight, the &quot;Caoping&quot; () tael weighed of marginally less pure silver.

As in China, other parts of East Asia such as Japan and Korea have also used the tael () as both a unit of weight and, by extension, a currency.

=== Tael currency ===
==== Imperial China ====
Traditional Chinese silver sycees and other currencies of fine metals were not denominated or made by a central mint and their value was determined by their weight in taels. They were made by individual silversmiths for local exchange, and as such the shape and amount of extra detail on each ingot were highly variable; square and oval shapes were common but &quot;boat&quot;, flower, tortoise and others are known. The tael was still used in Qing dynasty coinage as the basis of the silver currency and sycee remained in use until the end of the dynasty in 1911. Common weights were 50, 10, 5 and one tael. Before the year 1840 the government of the Qing dynasty had set the official exchange rate between silver sycees and copper-alloy cash coins was set at 1,000 &quot;wén&quot; for 1 tael of silver before 1820, but after the year 1840 this official exchange rate was double to 2,000 &quot;wén&quot; to 1 tael.

During the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor, the government of the Qing dynasty was forced to re-introduce paper money, among the paper money it produced were the Hubu Guanpiao (戶部官票) silver notes that were denominated in taels.

The forced opening of China during the Qing dynasty created a number of treaty ports alongside the China&#x27;s main waterways and its coastal areas, these treaty ports would fundamentally change both the monetary system of China as well as its banking system, these changes were introduced by the establishment of European and American merchant houses and later banks that would engage in the Chinese money exchange and trade finance.

Between the years 1840 and 1900, 1 market tael was worth 1.38 Spanish dollars.

Various Western banking companies, the largest of which were the HSBC, and later Japanese banking companies started to begin to accept deposits. They would issue banknotes which were convertible into silver; these banknotes were popularized among the Chinese public that resided in the treaty ports.

An important development during this era was the establishment of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. This agency was placed in charge of collecting transit taxes for traded goods that were shipped both in and out of the Chinese Empire, these rules and regulations were all stipulated in various trade treaties that were imposed on the Qing by the Western colonial powers. Because these changes were implemented during the height of the Taiping Rebellion, the Western powers had managed to take over the complete administration of the Qing&#x27;s maritime customs from the imperial Chinese governmental bureaucracy.

The Imperial Maritime Customs Service developed the Haikwan tael (海關兩), this new form of measurement was an abstract unit of silver tael that would become the nationwide standard unit of account in silver for any form of Customs tax. The Haikwan tael was preferred over the Kuping tael (庫平兩) by many merchants across China, this was because the units of the Kuping tael varied often to the advantage of imperial tax collectors, this form of corruption was an extra source of income for government bureaucrats at the expense of traders. The Haikwan tael unit was completely uniform, it was very carefully defined, and its creation had been negotiated among the various colonial powers and the government of the Qing dynasty. The Haikwan tael was on average 5% to 10% larger than the various local tael units that had existed in China, this was done as it deliberately excluded any form of extra surcharges which were embedded in the other units of the silver tael that existed as a form of intermediary income for local government tax collection, these surcharges were added to local taels as a form of corruption and these taxes never reached the imperial government under the traditional fiscal regime.

Near the end of the Qing dynasty, one (sycee, or ) is about 50 taels.

==== Conversion rates in imperial China ====

The local tael took precedence over any central measure. Thus, the Canton tael weighed , the Convention or Shanghai tael was , and the &quot;Haiguan&quot; () tael . The conversion rates between various common taels were well known.

==== Republic of China ====

In the year 1933 the government of the Republic of China abolished the tael and completely replaced it with the yuan in a process known as the &quot;fei liang gai yuan&quot; (). During this time the Republican government cleared all banknotes denominated in the ancient tael currency, making all bills which used this currency unit obsolete.

==== Purchasing power ====

Modern studies suggest that, on purchasing power parity basis, one tael of silver was worth about 4,130 yuan RMB in the early Tang dynasty, 2,065 yuan RMB in the late Tang dynasty, and 660.8 yuan RMB in the mid Ming dynasty. the price of silver is about 254 yuan RMB/tael of 50 g.

== Current usage ==

The tael is still in use as a weight measurement in a number of countries though usually only in limited contexts. In English-speaking countries, measurement scales that support Tael as a unit will typically abbreviate it as &quot;tl&quot;.

===Sinophone world===
==== Mainland China ====

China&#x27;s standard &quot;market tael&quot; () of 31.25 g was modified by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1959. The new market tael was 50 g or catty (500 g) to make it compatible with metric measures. (see Chinese unit for details.) In Shanghai, silver is still traded in taels.

Some foodstuffs in China are sold in units also called &quot;taels&quot;, but which do not necessarily weigh one tael. For cooked rice, the weight of the tael is approximated using special tael-sized ladles. Other items sold in taels include the &quot;shengjian mantou&quot; and the &quot;xiaolongbao&quot;, both small bao buns commonly sold in Shanghai. In these cases, one tael is traditionally four and eight buns respectively.

==== Hong Kong and Singapore ====
The tael is a legal weight measure in Hong Kong, and is still in active use. In Hong Kong, one tael is 37.799364167 g, and in ordinance 22 of 1884 is oz. avoir. Similar to Hong Kong, in Singapore, one tael is defined as ounce and is approximated as 37.7994 g

==== Taiwan ====
The Taiwan tael is 37.5 g and is still used in some contexts. The Taiwan tael is derived from the tael or of the Japanese system (equal to 10 &quot;momme&quot;) which was 37.5 g. Although the catty (equal to 16 taels) is still frequently used in Taiwan, the tael is only used for precious metals and herbal medicines.

===Elsewhere===
==== Thailand ====
The Thai equivalent of the tael is known as the &quot;tamlueng&quot;, a term derived from Khmer. It was used as a unit of currency equal to four baht; nowadays, as a unit of weight it is fixed at 60 grams.

==== Vietnam ====
In French Indochina, the colonial administration fixed the tael &quot;()&quot; as 100 g, which is commonly used at food markets where many items typically weigh in the 100–900 g range. However, a different tael (called , , or ) unit of 37.5 g is used for domestic transactions in gold. Real estate prices are often quoted in taels of gold rather than the local currency over concerns over monetary inflation.

<text>Judith Mavis Durham (née Cock; 3 July 1943 – 5 August 2022) was an Australian singer, songwriter, and musician who became the lead singer of the Australian folk music group the Seekers in 1962.

The group became the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States and have sold over 50 million records worldwide. Durham left the group in mid-1968 to pursue her solo career. In 1993, she began to make sporadic recordings and performances with the Seekers, though she remained primarily a solo performer. On 1 July 2015, during the annual Victoria Day celebrations, she was named Victorian of the Year for her services to music and a range of charities.

==Early life==
Durham was born Judith Mavis Cock on 3 July 1943 in Essendon, Victoria, to William Alexander Cock, a navigator and World War II pathfinder, and his wife, Hazel (&quot;née&quot; Durham). From her birth until 1949, she lived on Mount Alexander Road, Essendon. She spent summer holidays at her family&#x27;s weatherboard house (which since has been demolished) on the west side of Durham Place in Rosebud.

Her father accepted work in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1949. From early 1950, the family lived in Taroona, a suburb of Hobart, where Durham attended the Fahan School before moving back to Melbourne, residing in Georgian Court, Balwyn, in 1956. She was educated at Ruyton Girls&#x27; School Kew and then enrolled at RMIT.

Durham at first planned to be a pianist and gained the qualification of Associate in Music, Australia (AMusA), in classical piano at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium. She had some professional engagements playing piano, had classical vocal training as a soprano, and performed blues, gospel, and jazz pieces. Her singing career began one night at the age of 18 when she asked Nicholas Ribush, leader of the Melbourne University Jazz Band, at the Memphis Jazz Club in Malvern, whether she could sing with the band. In 1963, she began performing at the same club with Frank Traynor&#x27;s Jazz Preachers, using her mother&#x27;s maiden name of Durham. In that year she also recorded her first EP, &quot;Judy Durham&quot;, with Frank Traynor&#x27;s Jazz Preachers for W&amp;G Records.

==The Seekers==

The Seekers consisted of Durham, Athol Guy, Bruce Woodley, and Keith Potger, an ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corp.) radio producer. Through Potger&#x27;s position the three were able to make a demo tape in their spare time. This was given to W&amp;G Records, which wanted another sample of Durham&#x27;s voice before agreeing to record a Jazz Preachers&#x27; album. W&amp;G instead signed the Seekers for an album, &quot;Introducing the Seekers&quot;, in 1963. Durham, however, recorded two other songs with the Jazz Preachers, &quot;Muddy Water&quot; (which appeared on their album &quot;Jazz from the Pulpit&quot;) and &quot;Trombone Frankie&quot; (an adapted version of Bessie Smith&#x27;s &quot;Trombone Cholly&quot;).

In early 1964, the Seekers sailed to the United Kingdom on SS &quot;Fairsky&quot; on which the group provided the musical entertainment. Originally they had planned to return after ten weeks, but they received a steady stream of bookings through the Grade Agency because they had sent the agency a copy of their first album. On 4 November 1964 at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, the Seekers recorded &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You.&quot; In February 1965, the song reached number one in the UK and Australia. The group had further Top 10 hits with &quot;A World of Our Own,&quot; &quot;Morningtown Ride,&quot; and &quot;Someday, One Day.&quot; &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; reached number two (&quot;Billboard&quot; chart) and number one (&quot;Cashbox&quot; chart) in the United States. &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; is still one of the top 50 best-selling singles in the UK.

On 12 March 1967, the Seekers set an official all-time Australian record when more than 200,000 people (nearly one tenth of the city&#x27;s entire population at that time) flocked to their performance at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, Australia. Their TV special &quot;The Seekers Down Under&quot; scored the biggest TV audience ever (with a 67 rating), and early in 1968 they were all awarded the nation&#x27;s top honour as &quot;Australians of the Year 1967.&quot; On a tour of New Zealand in February 1968, Durham advised the group that she was leaving the Seekers. Their last concert before Durham left the band was on a live BBC production on 7 July, where they performed many of their all-time hits.

==Solo career==

Durham returned to Australia in August 1968, and her first solo television special, &quot;An Evening with Judith Durham&quot;, screened on the Nine Network in September. During her solo career, she released albums titled &quot;For Christmas with Love&quot;, &quot;Gift of Song&quot; and &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;. In 1970, she made the television special &quot;Meet Judith Durham&quot; in London, ending with her rendition of &quot;When You Come to the End of a Perfect Day&quot; by Carrie Jacobs-Bond (1862–1946).

In 1975, Durham starred in an acting and singing role as Sarah Simmonds, a burlesque type performer in &quot;The Golden Girl&quot;, an episode of the Australian television series &quot;Cash and Co.&quot; Set in the 1800s Australian goldfields, the episode also featured Durham&#x27;s husband, Ron Edgeworth, on piano. She performed six songs; &quot;Oh Susanna&quot;, &quot;When Starlight Fades&quot;, &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Home&quot; and &quot;The Lord Is My Shepherd&quot;.

Durham staged a series of concerts at The Troubadour, Melbourne in 1987 with Edgeworth, performing originals the two had written. They returned again the following year.

In January 1992, Durham released &quot;Australia Land of Today&quot; which peaked at number 124 on the ARIA charts.&quot;

In 2003, Durham toured the UK in &quot;The Diamond Tour&quot; celebrating her 60th birthday. The tour included the Royal Festival Hall and a CD and DVD of the concert was issued.

In 2006, Durham started modernising the music and phrases of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;. the Australian National Anthem; the Aboriginal singer/songwriter Kutcha Edwards also contributed lyrics, Durham first performed it in May 2009 at Federation Hall, St Kilda Road. It was released as a CD single.

Durham recorded &quot;The Australian Cities Suite&quot; album with all proceeds to go to the charitable sector. The album was released in October 2008. This project was to benefit charities working with the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Charitable Fund, including Orchestra Victoria and the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Australia (Durham was national patron).

On 13 February 2009, Durham made a surprise return to the Myer Music Bowl when she performed the closing number at the &quot;RocKwiz Salutes the Bowl – Sidney Myer Music Bowl 50th Anniversary&quot; with &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;. On 23 May 2009, she performed a one-hour &#x27;a cappella&#x27; concert in Melbourne as a launch for her album &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot;.

In October 2011, Durham signed an exclusive international deal with Decca Records. George Ash, president of Universal Music Australasia, said that &quot;It is an honour to have Judith Durham join Decca&#x27;s wonderful roster of artists. When you think of the legends that have graced the Decca Records catalogue it is the perfect home to welcome Judith to, and we couldn&#x27;t be more excited to work with Judith on not only her new recordings but her incredible catalogue as well.&quot;

In June 2018, to celebrate Durham&#x27;s 75th birthday, a collection of 14 previously unreleased songs was released on the album &quot;So Much More&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 21 November 1969, Durham married her musical director, British pianist Ron Edgeworth, at Scots&#x27; Church in Melbourne. Edgeworth had been with a group, the Trebletones, on the same tour. They chose not to have children. Durham and her husband were vegetarian; she became a vegan after 2015. She also avoided alcohol and caffeine.

They lived in the UK and Switzerland until the mid-1980s when they bought property in Nambour, Queensland. In 1990, Durham, Edgeworth and their tour manager, Peter Summers, were involved in a car accident on the Calder Freeway. The driver of the other car died at the scene and Durham sustained a fractured wrist and leg. The response from her fans led to Durham’s considering getting back together with the other members of the Seekers for a silver jubilee show. During this reunion Edgeworth was diagnosed with motor neurone disease also known as ALS. He died from the disease on 10 December 1994 with Durham by his side.

In the late 1990s, Durham was stalked by a former president of a Judith Durham fan club, a woman who sent her over 40 doormats, as an admonishment for , and numerous abusive faxes, one promising another doormat delivery worth over $45,000. The woman was subsequently prosecuted, and later imprisoned for other serial crimes.

In 2000, Durham broke her hip and was unable to sing &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney with the Seekers. However, she sang it from a wheelchair at the 2000 Paralympics shortly thereafter.

In May 2013, during the Seekers&#x27; golden jubilee tour, Durham suffered a stroke that diminished her ability to read and write both visual language and musical scores. During her convalescence, she made progress to rebuild those skills. Her singing ability was not affected by the stroke.

==Beliefs==
Durham was a devout Christian who was hesitant about secular music. Durham frequently sang Gospel and Jazz, which reflected this trait. One of Durham&#x27;s songs, &quot;My Faith&quot;, described her own faith. About how her faith had lit her life, had made her see &quot;the beauty in everything around her, and had filled her heart with beauty and grace&quot;. She also followed an added eastern spiritual path which also provided more moral and ethical framework for the way she lived. In the Salvation Army War Cry magazine of November 12, 2016, she revealed more information on her beliefs and spirituality, and added that her &quot;love songs were for the Lord.&quot;
&quot;Judith describes herself as a deeply spiritual person with a proud belief in the love of God and Jesus Christ, and feels that many of the songs of her long career reflect that reality. The spirituality of the lyrics crosses over from being not just love songs, but love songs for the Lord-songs like &quot;I&#x27;ll Never find Another You&quot;, &quot;Walk with Me&quot; and many others, Judith tells Warcry.&quot;

On December 22, 2016, Durham posted a message on her Official Facebook page. It gave a full explanation of her concept of God.

Part of it includes:

“When I was just a child, growing up with dear Mum and Dad and sister Beverley, we were wisely taught to say our prayers each night, feeling protected and loved:
&quot;...God Bless Mummy and Daddy and Judy and Beverley
And Grandma and Grandpa and Grandma Cock
I never questioned any of it. For me, to this day, God and the Lord are real and I feel safe and nurtured by that ever-present reality…..” 

She also posted: &quot;A couple of years later, after we moved to Hobart, we started going to &quot;Sunday School&quot; and
I learned to sing. &quot;Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so&quot;. Through the years I have a deeper spiritual understanding. There is a multi cultural, global truth for so many billions of loving souls. We all love the Lord God and God Incarnate according to many different pathways all over the world, and that the spirit of Christmas celebrations always bring that same joyous message. We were taught from our early age to honour our father and mother, and to live in love. peace and humility in the spirit of giving.
Let us all be thankful for the food we eat this Christmas and all the blessings showered upon us everyday.&quot;

Durham felt that the values that were instilled into her since her youth were still imprinted in her to the present. Durham also stated that she had a very wide perception, and that she had begun feeling interested in esoteric things.

==Death==
Durham was born with asthma and at age four caught measles, which left her with a life-long chronic lung disease, bronchiectasis. Durham died from the disease at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne on 5 August 2022, at age 79. She was given a state memorial service by the state of Victoria on 6 September 2022 at Hamer Hall. Durham is interred with her husband, Ron Edgeworth, at Springvale Botanical Cemetery, Springvale.

<doc id="65944" wikidata="Q34280" url="?curid=65944" title="Plankalkül">
<text>Plankalkül () is a programming language designed for engineering purposes by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. It was the first high-level programming language to be designed for a computer.

&quot;Kalkül&quot; (from Latin &quot;calculus&quot;) is the German term for a formal system—as in &quot;Hilbert-Kalkül&quot;, the original name for the Hilbert-style deduction system—so &quot;Plankalkül&quot; refers to a formal system for planning.

==History of programming==
In the domain of creating computing machines, Zuse was self-taught, and developed them without knowledge about other mechanical computing machines that existed already – although later on (building the Z3) being inspired by Hilbert&#x27;s and Ackermann&#x27;s book on elementary mathematical logic (see Principles of Mathematical Logic). To describe logical circuits, Zuse invented his own diagram and notation system, which he called &quot;combinatorics of conditionals&quot; (). After finishing the Z1 in 1938, Zuse discovered that the calculus he had independently devised already existed and was known as propositional calculus. What Zuse had in mind, however, needed to be much more powerful (propositional calculus is not Turing-complete and is not able to describe even simple arithmetic calculations). In May 1939, he described his plans for the development of what would become Plankalkül. He wrote the following in his notebook:

While working on his doctoral dissertation, Zuse developed the first known formal system of algorithm notation capable of handling branches and loops. In 1942 he began writing a chess program in Plankalkül. In 1944, Zuse met with the German logician and philosopher Heinrich Scholz, who expressed appreciation for Zuse&#x27;s utilization of logical calculus. In 1945, Zuse described Plankalkül in an unpublished book. The collapse of Nazi Germany, however, prevented him from submitting his manuscript.

At that time the only two working computers in the world were ENIAC and Harvard Mark I, neither of which used a compiler, and ENIAC needed to be reprogrammed for each task by changing how the wires were connected.

Although most of his computers were destroyed by Allied bombs, Zuse was able to rescue one machine, the Z4, and move it to the Alpine village of Hinterstein (part of Bad Hindelang).

Unable to continue building computers – which was also forbidden by the Allied Powers – Zuse devoted his time to the development of a higher-level programming model and language. In 1948, he published a paper in the &quot;Archiv der Mathematik&quot; and presented at the Annual Meeting of the GAMM. His work failed to attract much attention. In a 1957 lecture, Zuse expressed his hope that Plankalkül, &quot;after some time as a Sleeping Beauty, will yet come to life.&quot; He expressed disappointment that the designers of ALGOL 58 never acknowledged the influence of Plankalkül on their own work.

Plankalkül was republished with commentary in 1972. The first compiler for Plankalkül was implemented by Joachim Hohmann in his 1975 dissertation. Other independent implementations followed in 1998 and 2000 at the Free University of Berlin.

==Description==
Plankalkül has drawn comparisons to the language APL, and to relational algebra. It includes assignment statements, subroutines, conditional statements, iteration, floating-point arithmetic, arrays, hierarchical record structures, assertions, exception handling, and other advanced features such as goal-directed execution. The Plankalkül provides a data structure called &quot;generalized graph&quot; (), which can be used to represent geometrical structures.

Many features of the Plankalkül reappear in later programming languages; an exception is its idiosyncratic two-dimensional notation using multiple lines. 

Some features of the Plankalkül:
* only local variables
* functions do not support recursion
* only supports call by value
* composite types are arrays and tuples
* contains conditional expressions
* contains a for loop and a while loop
* no goto

===Data types===
The only primitive data type in the Plankalkül is a single bit or Boolean ( – yes-no value in Zuse&#x27;s terminology). It is denoted by the identifier formula_1. All the further data types are composite, and build up from primitive by means of &quot;arrays&quot; and &quot;records&quot;.

So, a sequence of eight bits (which in modern computing could be regarded as byte) is denoted by formula_2, and Boolean matrix of size formula_3 by formula_4  is described by formula_5. There also exists a shortened notation, so one could write formula_6 instead of formula_7.

Type formula_1 could have two possible values formula_9 and formula_10. So 4-bit sequence could be written like L00L, but in cases where such a sequence represents a number, the programmer could use the decimal representation 9.

Record of two components formula_11 and formula_12 is written as formula_13.

Type () in Plankalkül consists of 3 elements: structured value (), pragmatic meaning () and possible restriction on possible values (). User defined types are identified by letter A with number, like formula_14 – first user defined type.

====Examples====
Zuse used a lot of examples from chess theory:
===Identifiers===
Identifiers are alphanumeric characters with a number. There are the following kinds of identifiers for variables:

* Input values () — marked with a letter V.
* Intermediate, temporary values () — marked with a letter Z.
* Constants () — marked with a letter С.
* Output values () — marked with a letter R.

Particular variable of some kind is identified by number, written under the kind. For example:

: formula_15, formula_16, formula_17 etc.

Programs and subprograms are marked with a letter P, followed by a program (and optionally a subprogram) number. For example formula_18, formula_19.

Output value of program formula_18 saved there in variable formula_21 is available for other subprograms under the identifier formula_22, and reading value of that variable also means executing related subprogram.

===Accessing elements by index===
Plankalkül allows access for separate elements of variable by using &quot;component index&quot; (). When, for example, program receives input in variable formula_15 of type formula_24 (game state), then formula_25 — gives board state, formula_26 — piece on square number i, and formula_27 bit number j of that piece.

In modern programming languages, that would be described by notation similar to codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 (although to access a single bit in modern programming languages a bitmask is typically used).

===Two-dimensional syntax===
Because indexes of variables are written vertically, each Plankalkül instruction requires multiple rows to write down.

First row contains variable kind, then variable number marked with letter V (), then indexes of variable subcomponents marked with K (), and then () marked with S, which describes variable type. Type is not required, but Zuse notes that this helps with reading and understanding the program.

In the line formula_28 types formula_1 and formula_30 could be shortened to formula_9 and formula_32.

Examples:

Indexes could be not only constants. Variables could be used as indexes for other variables, and that is marked with a line, which shows in which component index would value of variable be used:

===Assignment operation===
Zuse introduced in his calculus an assignment operator, unknown in mathematics before him. He marked it with «formula_33», and called it yields-sign (). Use of concept of assignment is one of the key differences between mathematics and computer science.

Zuse wrote that the expression:
: formula_34

is analogous to the more traditional mathematical equation:

: formula_35

There are claims that Konrad Zuse initially used the glyph as a sign for assignment, and started to use formula_33 under the influence of Heinz Rutishauser. Knuth and Pardo believe that Zuse always wrote formula_33, and that was introduced by publishers of «Über den allgemeinen Plankalkül als Mittel zur Formulierung schematisch-kombinativer Aufgaben» in 1948. In the ALGOL 58 conference in Zürich, European participants proposed to use the assignment character introduced by Zuse, but the American delegation insisted on codice_4.

The variable that stores the result of an assignment (l-value) is written to the right side of assignment operator. The first assignment to the variable is considered to be a declaration.

The left side of assignment operator is used for an expression (), that defines which value will be assigned to the variable. Expressions could use arithmetic operators, Boolean operators, and comparison operators (formula_38 etc.).

The exponentiation operation is written similarly to the indexing operation - using lines in the two-dimensional notation: 

===Control flow===
Boolean values were represented as integers with and . Conditional control flow took the form of a guarded statement , which executed the block if was true. There was also an iteration operator, of the form } which repeats until all guards are false.

===Terminology===
Zuse called a single program a &quot;Rechenplan&quot; (&quot;computation plan&quot;). He envisioned what he called a &quot;Planfertigungsgerät&quot; (&quot;plan assembly device&quot;), which would automatically translate the mathematical formulation of a program into machine-readable punched film stock, something today would be called a translator or compiler.

===Example===
The original notation was two-dimensional. For a later implementation in the 1990s, a linear notation was developed.

The following example defines a function codice_5 (in a linear transcription) that calculates the maximum of three variables:

 P1 max3 (V0[:8.0],V1[:8.0],V2[:8.0]) → R0[:8.0]
 max(V0[:8.0],V1[:8.0]) → Z1[:8.0]
 max(Z1[:8.0],V2[:8.0]) → R0[:8.0]
 END
 P2 max (V0[:8.0],V1[:8.0]) → R0[:8.0]
 V0[:8.0] → Z1[:8.0]
 (Z1[:8.0] &lt; V1[:8.0]) → V1[:8.0] → Z1[:8.0]
 Z1[:8.0] → R0[:8.0]
 END

<doc id="65946" wikidata="Q1128416" url="?curid=65946" title="Consumer confidence index">
<text>A consumer confidence index (CCI) is an economic indicator published by various organizations in several countries.

In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption. Decreasing consumer confidence implies slowing economic growth, and so consumers are likely to decrease their spending. The idea is that the more confident people feel about the economy and their jobs and incomes, the more likely they are to make purchases. Declining consumer confidence is a sign of slowing economic growth and may indicate that the economy is headed into trouble.

== Usage ==
Manufacturers, retailers, banks and the government monitor changes in the CCI in order to factor in the data in their decision-making processes. While index changes of less than 5% are often dismissed as inconsequential, moves of 5% or more often indicate a change in the direction of the economy.

A month-on-month decreasing trend suggests consumers have a negative outlook on their ability to secure and retain good jobs. Thus, manufacturers may expect consumers to avoid retail purchases, particularly large-ticket items that require financing. Manufacturers may pare down inventories to reduce overhead or delay investing in new projects and facilities. Likewise, banks can anticipate a decrease in lending activity, mortgage applications and credit card use. When faced with a down-trending index, the government has a variety of options, such as issuing a tax rebate or taking other fiscal or monetary action to stimulate the economy.

Conversely, a rising trend in consumer confidence indicates improvements in consumer buying patterns. Manufacturers can increase production and hiring. Banks can expect increased demand for credit. Builders can prepare for a rise in home construction, and government can anticipate improved tax revenues based on the increase in consumer spending.

== Consumer-demand surveys versus consumer-confidence and -sentiment surveys ==
Consumer-demand surveys are interview-based statistical surveys that measure the percentage of households that will buy a car, white goods, PCs, TVs, home furnishings, kitchenware, or toys in, for example, the next three-month period. The surveys provide a percentage of those who will purchase more, less, or the same amount of food and clothing in the next three months than in the corresponding period the year before. If you ask people about their purchasing behavior within the coming six or 12 months, there will be more of those who &quot;hope to be able to buy&quot;, than if consumers are asked about what they will purchase in the next three months. The shorter the time spans, the closer to actual behavior.

Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys measure how people are doing financially, how they look at the overall economy of the country or business conditions in the country, if they think that the government is doing a good or a poor job and if people think that it is a good or a bad time to buy a car or to buy or sell a house.

When the business cycle is fairly stable, consumer demand surveys and consumer confidence and sentiment indices will often correlate closely and indicate the same direction of the economy, but in times with a high degree of economic or political uncertainty or during a prolonged crisis, the two types of consumer surveys might differ significantly. In 2011, confidence and sentiment surveys went up from March to April, while consumer demand surveys dropped significantly. In August 2011, the confidence and sentiment surveys dropped significantly and stayed low during September and October, while consumer demand surveys showed resilience, a development confirmed later by official statistics.

A 2022 study found that the consumer confidence index always plays a positive and statistically significant function in the development of consumption.

== In Canada ==
The Conference Board of Canada&#x27;s index of consumer confidence has been ongoing since 1980. It is constructed from responses to four attitudinal questions posed to a random sample of Canadian households. Those surveyed are asked to give their views about their households&#x27; current and expected financial positions and the short-term employment outlook. They are also asked to assess whether now is a good or a bad time to make a major purchase, such as a house, car or other big-ticket items.

== In Indonesia ==
Consumer Survey-Bank Indonesia (CS-BI) is a monthly survey that has been conducted since October 1999 by Bank Indonesia. The survey represents the consumer confidence about the overall economic condition, general price level, household income, and consumption plans three and six months ahead. Since January 2007, the survey is conducted with approximately 4,600 household respondents (stratified random sampling) in 18 cities: Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Makassar, Bandar Lampung, Palembang, Banjarmasin, Padang, Pontianak, Samarinda, Manado, Denpasar, Mataram, Pangkal Pinang, Ambon, and Banten. At a significance level of 99%, the survey has a sampling error of 2%. Data canvassing run through interviews by phone and direct visits in particular cities that is based on rotational system. The Balance Score Method (net balance + 100) has been adopted to construct the index, where the index above 100 points indicates optimism (positive responses) and vice versa. The consumer confidence index (CCI), is an average of the current economic condition index (CECI) and consumer expectation index (CEI).

=== Other indexes ===
Danareksa conducts a monthly consumer survey to produce the Consumer Confidence Index.

== In the Republic of Ireland ==
In the Republic of Ireland, KBC Bank Ireland (formerly IIB Bank) and the Economic and Social Research Institute (a think-tank) have published a monthly consumer sentiment index since January 1996.

== In the United States ==
In the United States, The Conference Board, an independent economic research organization, issues monthly measures of consumer confidence based on 5,000 households. Such measurement is indicative of the consumption component level of the gross domestic product. The Federal Reserve looks at the CCI when determining interest rate changes.

Consumer confidence is defined by The Conference Board as the degree of optimism on the state of the United States economy that consumers are expressing through their activities of savings and spending. Global consumer confidence is not measured. Country-by-country analysis indicates huge variance around the globe. In an interconnected global economy, tracking international consumer confidence is a lead indicator of economic trends.

The consumer confidence index started in 1967 and is benchmarked to 1985 = 100. The index is calculated each month on the basis of a household survey of consumers&#x27; opinions on current conditions and future expectations of the economy. Opinions on current conditions make up 40% of the index, with expectations of future conditions comprising the remaining 60%. In the glossary on its website, The Conference Board defines the Consumer Confidence Survey as &quot;a monthly report detailing consumer attitudes and buying intentions, with data available by age, income and region&quot;.

Each month, The Conference Board surveys 5,000 US households. The survey consists of five questions that ask the respondents&#x27; opinions about the following:

# Current business conditions
# Business conditions for the next six months
# Current employment conditions
# Employment conditions for the next six months
# Total family income for the next six months

Survey participants are asked to answer each question as &quot;positive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;neutral.&quot; The preliminary results from the consumer confidence survey are released on the last Tuesday of each month at 10am EST.

Once the data have been gathered, a proportion known as the &quot;relative value&quot; is calculated for each question separately. Each question&#x27;s positive responses are divided by the sum of its positive and negative responses. The relative value for each question is then compared against each relative value from 1985. This comparison of the relative values results in an &quot;index value&quot; for each question.

The index values for all five questions are then averaged together to form the consumer confidence index; the average of index values for questions one and three form the present situation index, and the average of index values for questions two, four and five form the expectations index. The data are calculated for the United States as a whole and for each of the country&#x27;s nine census regions.

=== Other indexes ===
In addition to the Conference Board&#x27;s CCI, other survey-based indices attempt to track consumer confidence in the United States:
* The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI) is a consumer confidence index published monthly by the University of Michigan. It uses an ongoing, nationally representative survey based on telephonic household interviews to gather information on consumer expectations regarding the overall economy.

Given the potential for sampling biases of individual survey reports, researchers and investors try sometimes to average the values of different index reports into a single aggregated measure of consumer confidence.

<doc id="65948" wikidata="Q1230226" url="?curid=65948" title="Disulfide">
<text>In chemistry, a disulfide (or disulphide in British English) is a compound containing a functional group or the anion. The linkage is also called an SS-bond or sometimes a disulfide bridge and usually derived from two thiol groups.

In inorganic chemistry, the anion appears in a few rare minerals, but the functional group has tremendous importance in biochemistry. Disulfide bridges formed between thiol groups in two cysteine residues are an important component of the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins.

Compounds of the form are usually called &quot;persulfides&quot; instead.

==Organic disulfides==
===Structure===
Disulfides have a C-S-S-C dihedral angle approaching 90°. The S-S bond length is 2.03 Å in diphenyl disulfide, similar to that in elemental sulfur.

Disulfides are usually symmetric but they can also be unsymmetric. Symmetrical disulfides are compounds of the formula . Most disulfides encountered in organosulfur chemistry are symmetrical disulfides. Unsymmetrical disulfides (also called heterodisulfides or mixed disulfides) are compounds of the formula . Unsymmetrical disulfide are less common in organic chemistry, but many disulfides in nature are unsymmetrical. Illustrative of a symmetric disulfide is cystine. 

====Cyclic disulfides====
Disulfides can be components of rings. Lipoic acid, a 1,2-dithiolane is a major example. Rings with more than one disulfide usually tend to polymerize.

====Other specialized organic disulfides====
Thiuram disulfides, with the formula (R2NCSS)2, are disulfides but they behave distinctly because of the thiocarbonyl group.

===Properties===
Disulfide bonds are strong, with a typical bond dissociation energy of 60 kcal/mol (251 kJ mol−1). However, being about 40% weaker than and bonds, the disulfide bond is often the &quot;weak link&quot; in many molecules. Furthermore, reflecting the polarizability of divalent sulfur, the bond is susceptible to scission by polar reagents, both electrophiles and especially nucleophiles (Nu): &lt;chem display=block&gt;RS-SR + Nu- -&gt; RS-Nu + RS-&lt;/chem&gt; 

The disulfide bond is about 2.05 Å in length, about 0.5 Å longer than a bond. Rotation about the axis is subject to a low barrier. Disulfides show a distinct preference for dihedral angles approaching 90°. When the angle approaches 0° or 180°, then the disulfide is a significantly better oxidant.

Disulfides where the two R groups are the same are called symmetric, examples being diphenyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide. When the two R groups are not identical, the compound is said to be an asymmetric or mixed disulfide.

Although the hydrogenation of disulfides is usually not practical, the equilibrium constant for the reaction provides a measure of the standard redox potential for disulfides:
:&lt;chem&gt;RSSR + H2 -&gt; 2 RSH&lt;/chem&gt;
This value is about −250 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode (pH = 7). By comparison, the standard reduction potential for ferrodoxins is about −430 mV.

===Synthesis===
Disulfide bonds are usually formed from the oxidation of sulfhydryl () groups, especially in biological contexts. The transformation is depicted as follows:
:&lt;chem&gt;2 RSH &lt;=&gt; RS-SR + 2 H+ + 2 e-&lt;/chem&gt;
A variety of oxidants participate in this reaction including oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Such reactions are thought to proceed via sulfenic acid intermediates. In the laboratory, iodine in the presence of base is commonly employed to oxidize thiols to disulfides. Several metals, such as copper(II) and iron(III) complexes affect this reaction. Alternatively, disulfide bonds in proteins often formed by thiol-disulfide exchange:
: &lt;chem&gt;RS-SR + R&#x27;SH &lt;=&gt; R&#x27;S-SR + RSH&lt;/chem&gt;
Such reactions are mediated by enzymes in some cases and in other cases are under equilibrium control, especially in the presence of a catalytic amount of base.

The alkylation of alkali metal di- and polysulfides gives disulfides. &quot;Thiokol&quot; polymers arise when sodium polysulfide is treated with an alkyl dihalide. In the converse reaction, carbanionic reagents react with elemental sulfur to afford mixtures of the thioether, disulfide, and higher polysulfides. These reactions are often unselective but can be optimized for specific applications.

===Synthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides (heterodisulfides)===
Many specialized methods have been developed for forming unsymmetrical disulfides. Reagents that deliver the equivalent of &quot;&quot; react with thiols to give asymmetrical disulfides:
: &lt;chem&gt;RSH + R&#x27;SNR&quot;_2 -&gt; RS-SR&#x27; + HNR&quot;_2&lt;/chem&gt;
where is the phthalimido group.
Bunte salts, derivatives of the type are also used to generate unsymmetrical disulfides:
:&lt;chem&gt;Na[O3S2R] + NaSR&#x27; -&gt; RSSR&#x27; + Na2SO3&lt;/chem&gt;

===Reactions===
The most important aspect of disulfide bonds is their scission, as the bond is usually the weakest bond in an organic molecule. Many specialized organic reactions have been developed to cleave the bond. 

A variety of reductants reduce disulfides to thiols. Hydride agents are typical reagents, and a common laboratory demonstration &quot;uncooks&quot; eggs with sodium borohydride. Alkali metals effect the same reaction more aggressively: &lt;chem display=block&gt;RS-SR + 2 Na -&gt; 2 NaSR,&lt;/chem&gt; followed by protonation of the resulting metal thiolate: &lt;chem display=block&gt;NaSR + HCl -&gt; HSR + NaCl&lt;/chem&gt; 

In biochemistry labwork, thiols such as β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) or dithiothreitol (DTT) serve as reductants through thiol-disulfide exchange. The thiol reagents are used in excess to drive the equilibrium to the right: &lt;chem display=block&gt;RS-SR + 2 HOCH2CH2SH &lt;=&gt; HOCH2CH2S-SCH2CH2OH + 2 RSH&lt;/chem&gt;
The reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) is useful, beside being odorless compared to β-ME and DTT, because it is selective, working at both alkaline and acidic conditions (unlike DTT), is more hydrophilic and more resistant to oxidation in air. Furthermore, it is often not needed to remove TCEP before modification of protein thiols.

In Zincke cleavage, halogens oxidize disulfides to a sulfenyl halide:&lt;chem display=block&gt;ArSSAr + Cl2 -&gt; 2 ArSCl&lt;/chem&gt;

More unusually, oxidation of disulfides gives first thiosulfinates and then thiosulfonates:
:RSSR + [O] → RS(=O)SR
:RS(=O)SR + [O] → RS(=O)2SR

====Thiol-disulfide exchange====
In thiol–disulfide exchange, a thiolate group displaces one sulfur atom in a disulfide bond . The original disulfide bond is broken, and its other sulfur atom is released as a new thiolate, carrying away the negative charge. Meanwhile, a new disulfide bond forms between the attacking thiolate and the original sulfur atom.

Thiolates, not thiols, attack disulfide bonds. Hence, thiol–disulfide exchange is inhibited at low pH (typically, below 8) where the protonated thiol form is favored relative to the deprotonated thiolate form. (The p&quot;K&quot;a of a typical thiol group is roughly 8.3, but can vary due to its environment.)

Thiol–disulfide exchange is the principal reaction by which disulfide bonds are formed and rearranged in a protein. The rearrangement of disulfide bonds within a protein generally occurs via intra-protein thiol–disulfide exchange reactions; a thiolate group of a cysteine residue attacks one of the protein&#x27;s own disulfide bonds. This process of disulfide rearrangement (known as &quot;disulfide shuffling&quot;) does not change the number of disulfide bonds within a protein, merely their location (i.e., which cysteines are bonded). Disulfide reshuffling is generally much faster than oxidation/reduction reactions, which change the number of disulfide bonds within a protein. The oxidation and reduction of protein disulfide bonds &quot;in vitro&quot; also generally occurs via thiol–disulfide exchange reactions. Typically, the thiolate of a redox reagent such as glutathione, dithiothreitol attacks the disulfide bond on a protein forming a &quot;mixed disulfide bond&quot; between the protein and the reagent. This mixed disulfide bond when attacked by another thiolate from the reagent, leaves the cysteine oxidized. In effect, the disulfide bond is transferred from the protein to the reagent in two steps, both thiol–disulfide exchange reactions.

The &quot;in vivo&quot; oxidation and reduction of protein disulfide bonds by thiol–disulfide exchange is facilitated by a protein called thioredoxin. This small protein, essential in all known organisms, contains two cysteine amino acid residues in a vicinal arrangement (i.e., next to each other), which allows it to form an internal disulfide bond, or disulfide bonds with other proteins. As such, it can be used as a repository of reduced or oxidized disulfide bond moieties.

===Nomenclature and misnomers===

Thiosulfoxides are isomeric with disulfides, having the second sulfur branching from the first and not partaking in a continuous chain, i.e. &gt;S=S rather than −S−S−.

Compounds with three sulfur atoms, such as CH3S−S−SCH3, are called trisulfides. More extended species are well known, especially in rings.

Disulfide is also used to refer to compounds that contain two sulfide (S2−) centers. The compound carbon disulfide, CS2 is described with the structural formula i.e. S=C=S. This molecule is not a disulfide in the sense that it lacks a S-S bond. Similarly, molybdenum disulfide, MoS2, is not a disulfide in the sense again that its sulfur atoms are not linked.

Disulfide bonds are analogous but more common than related peroxide, thioselenide, and diselenide bonds. Intermediate compounds of these also exist, for example thioperoxides such as hydrogen thioperoxide, have the formula R1OSR2 (equivalently R2SOR1). These are isomeric to sulfoxides in a similar manner to the above; i.e. &gt;S=O rather than −S−O−.

== Occurrence in biology ==
===Occurrence in proteins===
Disulfide bonds can be formed under oxidising conditions and play an important role in the folding and stability of some proteins, usually proteins secreted to the extracellular medium. Since most cellular compartments are reducing environments, in general, disulfide bonds are unstable in the cytosol, with some exceptions as noted below, unless a sulfhydryl oxidase is present.

Disulfide bonds in proteins are formed between the thiol groups of cysteine residues by the process of oxidative folding. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is typically denoted by hyphenating the abbreviations for cysteine, e.g., when referring to ribonuclease A the &quot;Cys26–Cys84 disulfide bond&quot;, or the &quot;26–84 disulfide bond&quot;, or most simply as &quot;C26–C84&quot; where the disulfide bond is understood and does not need to be mentioned. The prototype of a protein disulfide bond is the two-amino-acid peptide cystine, which is composed of two cysteine amino acids joined by a disulfide bond. The structure of a disulfide bond can be described by its &quot;χ&quot;ss dihedral angle between the Cβ−Sγ−Sγ−Cβ atoms, which is usually close to ±90°.

The disulfide bond stabilizes the folded form of a protein in several ways:

# It holds two portions of the protein together, biasing the protein towards the folded topology. That is, the disulfide bond &quot;destabilizes the unfolded form&quot; of the protein by lowering its entropy.
# The disulfide bond may form the nucleus of a hydrophobic core of the folded protein, i.e., local hydrophobic residues may condense around the disulfide bond and onto each other through hydrophobic interactions.
# Related to 1 and 2, the disulfide bond &quot;links&quot; two segments of the protein chain, &quot;increases&quot; the effective local concentration of protein residues, and &quot;lowers&quot; the effective local concentration of water molecules. Since water molecules attack amide-amide hydrogen bonds and break up secondary structure, a disulfide bond stabilizes secondary structure in its vicinity. For example, researchers have identified several pairs of peptides that are unstructured in isolation, but adopt stable secondary and tertiary structure upon formation of a disulfide bond between them.

A &quot;disulfide species&quot; is a particular pairing of cysteines in a disulfide-bonded protein and is usually depicted by listing the disulfide bonds in parentheses, e.g., the &quot;(26–84, 58–110) disulfide species&quot;. A &quot;disulfide ensemble&quot; is a grouping of all disulfide species with the same number of disulfide bonds, and is usually denoted as the 1S ensemble, the 2S ensemble, etc. for disulfide species having one, two, etc. disulfide bonds. Thus, the (26–84) disulfide species belongs to the 1S ensemble, whereas the (26–84, 58–110) species belongs to the 2S ensemble. The single species with no disulfide bonds is usually denoted as R for &quot;fully reduced&quot;. Under typical conditions, disulfide reshuffling is much faster than the formation of new disulfide bonds or their reduction; hence, the disulfide species within an ensemble equilibrate more quickly than between ensembles.

The native form of a protein is usually a single disulfide species, although some proteins may cycle between a few disulfide states as part of their function, e.g., thioredoxin. In proteins with more than two cysteines, non-native disulfide species may be formed, which are almost always misfolded. As the number of cysteines increases, the number of nonnative species increases factorially.
====In bacteria and archaea====
Disulfide bonds play an important protective role for bacteria as a reversible switch that turns a protein on or off when bacterial cells are exposed to oxidation reactions. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in particular could severely damage DNA and kill the bacterium at low concentrations if not for the protective action of the SS-bond. Archaea typically have fewer disulfides than higher organisms.

====In eukaryotes====
In eukaryotic cells, in general, stable disulfide bonds are formed in the lumen of the RER (rough endoplasmic reticulum) and the mitochondrial intermembrane space but not in the cytosol. This is due to the more oxidizing environment of the aforementioned compartments and more reducing environment of the cytosol (see glutathione). Thus disulfide bonds are mostly found in secretory proteins, lysosomal proteins, and the exoplasmic domains of membrane proteins.

There are notable exceptions to this rule. For example, many nuclear and cytosolic proteins can become disulfide-crosslinked during necrotic cell death. Similarly, a number of cytosolic proteins which have cysteine residues in proximity to each other that function as oxidation sensors or redox catalysts; when the reductive potential of the cell fails, they oxidize and trigger cellular response mechanisms. The virus &quot;Vaccinia&quot; also produces cytosolic proteins and peptides that have many disulfide bonds; although the reason for this is unknown presumably they have protective effects against intracellular proteolysis machinery.

Disulfide bonds are also formed within and between protamines in the sperm chromatin of many mammalian species.

====Disulfides in regulatory proteins====
As disulfide bonds can be reversibly reduced and re-oxidized, the redox state of these bonds has evolved into a signaling element. In chloroplasts, for example, the enzymatic reduction of disulfide bonds has been linked to the control of numerous metabolic pathways as well as gene expression. The reductive signaling activity has been shown, thus far, to be carried by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, channeling electrons from the light reactions of photosystem I to catalytically reduce disulfides in regulated proteins in a light dependent manner. In this way chloroplasts adjust the activity of key processes such as the Calvin–Benson cycle, starch degradation, ATP production and gene expression according to light intensity. Additionally, It has been reported that disulfides plays a significant role on redox state regulation of Two-component systems (TCSs), which could be found in certain bacteria including photogenic strain. A unique intramolecular cysteine disulfide bonds in the ATP-binding domain of SrrAB TCs found in &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is a good example of disulfides in regulatory proteins, which the redox state of SrrB molecule is controlled by cysteine disulfide bonds, leading to the modification of SrrA activity including gene regulation.

====In hair and feathers====
Over 90% of the dry weight of hair comprises proteins called keratins, which have a high disulfide content, from the amino acid cysteine. The robustness conferred in part by disulfide linkages is illustrated by the recovery of virtually intact hair from ancient Egyptian tombs. Feathers have similar keratins and are extremely resistant to protein digestive enzymes. The stiffness of hair and feather is determined by the disulfide content. Manipulating disulfide bonds in hair is the basis for the permanent wave in hairstyling. Reagents that affect the making and breaking of S−S bonds are key, e.g., ammonium thioglycolate. The high disulfide content of feathers dictates the high sulfur content of bird eggs. The high sulfur content of hair and feathers contributes to the disagreeable odor that results when they are burned.

====In disease====
Cystinosis is a condition where cystine precipitates in various organs. This accumulation interferes with bodily function and can be fatal. This disorder can be resolved by treatment with cysteamine. Cysteamine acts to solubilize the cystine by (1) forming the mixed disulfide cysteine-cysteamine, which is more soluble and exportable, and (2) reducing cystine to cysteine.

==Inorganic disulfides==
The disulfide anion is , or −S−S−. In disulfide, sulfur exists in the reduced state with oxidation number −1. Its electron configuration then resembles that of a chlorine atom. It thus tends to form a covalent bond with another S− center to form group, similar to elemental chlorine existing as the diatomic Cl2. Oxygen may also behave similarly, e.g. in peroxides such as H2O2. Examples:
* Hydrogen disulfide (S2H2), the simplest inorganic disulfide
* Disulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), a distillable liquid.
* Iron disulfide (FeS2), or pyrite.

==Applications==
Aside from the major role in biology, disulfides are found in rubber that has been vulcanized with sulfur. The vulcanization of rubber results in crosslinking groups which consist of disulfide (and polysulfide) bonds; in analogy to the role of disulfides in proteins, the S−S linkages in rubber strongly affect the stability and rheology of the material. Although the exact mechanism underlying the vulcanization process is not entirely understood (as multiple reaction pathways are present but the predominant one is unknown), it has been extensively shown that the extent to which the process is allowed to proceed determines the physical properties of the resulting rubber—namely, a greater degree of crosslinking corresponds to a stronger and more rigid material. The current conventional methods of rubber manufacturing are typically irreversible, as the unregulated reaction mechanisms can result in complex networks of sulfide linkages; as such, rubber is considered to be a thermoset material.

<text>Fielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the striking batter, to limit the number of runs that the striker scores and/or to get a batter out by either catching a hit ball before it bounces, or by running out either batter before they can complete their current run. There are a number of recognised fielding positions and they can be categorised into the offside and leg side of the field. Fielding also involves trying to prevent the ball from making a boundary where four &quot;runs&quot; are awarded for reaching the perimeter and six for crossing it without touching the grass. 
A fielder may field the ball with any part of their body. However, if, while the ball is in play, he/she wilfully fields it otherwise (e.g. by using their hat) the ball becomes dead and five penalty runs are awarded to the batting side, unless the ball previously struck a batter not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are set out in Law 28 of the &quot;Laws of cricket&quot;. Fake fielding is the action when a fielder makes bodily movements to feign fielding to fool batters into making mistakes and is a punishable offence under the ICC rules.

==Fielding position names and locations==
There are 11 players in a team: one is the bowler and another is the wicket-keeper, so only nine other fielding positions can be occupied at any time. Where fielders are positioned is a tactical decision made by the captain of the fielding team. The captain (usually in consultation with the bowler and sometimes other members of the team) may move players between fielding positions at any time except when a bowler is in the act of bowling to a batter, though there are exceptions for fielders moving in anticipation of the ball being hit to a particular area.

There are a number of named basic fielding positions, some of which are employed very commonly and others that are used less often. However, these positions are neither fixed nor precisely defined, and fielders can be placed in positions that differ from the basic positions. The nomenclature of the positions is somewhat esoteric, but roughly follows a system of polar coordinates – one word (leg, cover, mid-wicket) specifies the angle from the batter, and is sometimes preceded by an adjective describing the distance from the batter (silly, short, deep or long). Words such as &quot;backward&quot;, &quot;forward&quot;, or &quot;square&quot; can further indicate the angle.

The image shows the location of most of the named fielding positions based on a right-handed batter. The area to the left of a right-handed batter (from the batter&#x27;s point of view – facing the bowler) is called the &quot;leg side&quot; or &quot;on side&quot;, while that to the right is the &quot;off side&quot;. If the batter is left-handed, the leg and off sides are reversed and the fielding positions are a mirror image of those shown.

=== Catching positions ===
Some fielding positions are used offensively. That is, players are put there with the main aim being to catch out the batter rather than to stop or slow down the scoring of runs. These positions include Slip (often there are multiple slips next to each other, designated &quot;First slip&quot;, &quot;Second slip&quot;, &quot;Third slip&quot;, etc., numbered outwards from the wicket-keeper – collectively known as the &quot;slip cordon&quot;) meant to catch balls that just edge off the bat; Gully; Fly slip; Leg slip; Leg gully; the &quot;short&quot; and &quot;silly&quot; positions. &quot;Short leg&quot;, also known as &quot;bat pad&quot;, is a position specifically intended to catch balls that unintentionally strike the bat and leg pad, and thus end up only a metre or two to the leg side.

=== Other positions ===

*Wicket-keeper
*Long stop, who stands behind the wicket-keeper towards the boundary (usually when a wicket-keeper is believed to be inept; the position is almost never seen in professional cricket). It was an important position in the early days of cricket, but with the development of wicket-keeping techniques from the 1880s, notably at first by the Australian wicket-keeper Jack Blackham, it became obsolete at the highest levels of the game. The position is sometimes euphemistically referred to as &quot;very fine leg&quot;.
*Sweeper, an alternative name for &quot;deep cover&quot;, &quot;deep extra cover&quot; or &quot;deep midwicket&quot; (that is, near the boundary on the off side or the on side), usually defensive and intended to prevent a four being scored.
*Cow corner, an informal jocular term for the position on the boundary between &quot;deep midwicket&quot; and &quot;long on&quot;.
*On the 45. A position on the leg side 45° behind square, defending the single. An alternative description for backward short leg or short fine leg.
The bowler after delivering the ball must avoid running on the pitch, and so usually ends up fielding near silly mid on or silly mid off. Fast bowlers will continue running to exit the pitch and only change direction for balls dropped in front of the wicket. Spin bowlers with the slowest run-ups will usually cease their movement immediately after their delivery, planting their feet before the ball arrives to the batsman to react to a ball hit back up the pitch toward them. The bowler is generally understood to have the responsibility to defend the stumps at the non-strikers end of the pitch and so after a shot is made they will return to the stumps to catch any incoming throw, on rare occasions where a wicket-keeper has fallen or had to run to gather the ball the bowler may be the closest to the non-strikers stumps as well and so will move to the other end of the pitch. Once the play is dead they will walk back toward their bowling mark. In the laws of cricket the ball play is considered dead after the runners have ceased attempting to score and the ball has been returned to either the wicket-keeper or the bowler.

=== Modifiers ===

; &quot;Saving one&quot; or &quot;On the single&quot;: As close as the fielder needs to be to prevent the batters from running a quick single, normally about from the wicket.
; &quot;Saving two&quot;: As close as the fielder needs to be to prevent the batters from running two runs, normally about from the wicket.
; &quot;Right on&quot;: Literally, right on the boundary. 
; &quot;Deep&quot;, &quot;long&quot;: Farther away from the batter.
; &quot;Short&quot;: Closer to the batter.
; &quot;Silly&quot;: Very close to the batter, so-called because of the perceived danger of doing so.
; &quot;Square&quot;: Somewhere along an imaginary extension of the popping crease.
; &quot;Fine&quot;: Closer to an extension of an imaginary line along the middle of the pitch bisecting the stumps, when describing a fielder behind square.
; &quot;Straight&quot;: Closer to an extension of an imaginary line along the middle of the pitch bisecting the stumps, when describing a fielder in front of square.
; &quot;Wide&quot;: Further from an extension of an imaginary line along the middle of the pitch bisecting the stumps.
; &quot;Forward&quot;: In front of &quot;square&quot;; further towards the end occupied by the bowler and further away from the end occupied by the batter on strike.
; &quot;Backward&quot;: Behind &quot;square&quot;; further towards the end occupied by the batter on strike and further away from the end occupied by the bowler.

Additionally, commentators or spectators discussing the details of field placement will often use the terms for descriptive phrases such as &quot;gully is a bit wider than normal&quot; (meaning he/she is more to the side than normal) or &quot;mid off is standing too deep, he/she should come in shorter&quot; (meaning he/she is too far away and should be positioned closer to the batter).

==Restrictions on field placement==
Fielders may be placed anywhere on the field, subject to the following rules. At the time the ball is bowled:
*No fielder may be standing on or with any part of their body over the pitch (the central strip of the playing area between the wickets). If their body casts a shadow over the pitch, the shadow must not move until after the batter has played (or had the opportunity to play) at the ball.
*There may be no more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, standing in the quadrant of the field behind square leg. See Bodyline for details on one reason this rule exists.
*In some one-day matches:
**During designated overs of an innings (see Powerplay), there may be no more than two fielders standing outside an oval line marked on the field, being semicircles centred on the middle stump of each wicket of radius , joined by straight lines parallel to the pitch. This is known as the fielding circle.
** For overs no. 11–40 (powerplay 2), no more than four fielders should be outside the 30-yard circle.
** For overs no. 41–50 (powerplay 3) maximum of five fielders are allowed to be outside the 30-yard circle.

:The restriction for one-day cricket is designed to prevent the fielding team from setting extremely defensive fields and concentrating solely on preventing the batting team from scoring runs.

If any of these rules is violated, an umpire will call the delivery a no-ball. Additionally a player may not make any significant movement that is not in response to the striker&#x27;s actions after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. If this happens, an umpire will call and signal &#x27;dead ball&#x27;. For close fielders, anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker&#x27;s wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.

==Tactics of field placement==
With only nine fielders (in addition to the bowler and wicket-keeper), there are not enough to cover every part of the field simultaneously. The captain of the fielding team must decide which fielding positions to use, and which to leave vacant. The placement of fielders is one of the major tactical considerations for the fielding captain.

===Attacking and defending===

An attacking field is one in which fielders are positioned in such a way that they are likely to take catches, and thus likely to get the batter out. Such a field generally involves having many fielders close to the batter. For a pace bowler, an attacking field will usually include multiple slips (termed a &quot;cordon&quot;) and a gully; these are common positions for catching mishit shots. For a spin bowler, attacking positions include one or two slips, short leg or silly point.

A defensive field is one in which most of the field is within easy reach of one or more fielders; the batter will therefore find it difficult to score runs. This generally involves having most fielders some distance from, and in front of, the batter, in positions where the ball is most likely to be hit. Defensive fields generally have multiple fielders stationed close to the boundary rope to prevent fours being scored, and others close to the fielding circle, where they can prevent singles.

Many elements govern the decisions on field placements, including: the tactical situation in the match; which bowler is bowling; how long the batter has been in; the wear on the ball; the state of the wicket; the light and weather conditions; or the time remaining until the next interval in play.

===Off- and leg-side fields===
Another consideration when setting a field is how many fielders to have on each side of the pitch. With nine fielders to place, the division must necessarily be unequal, but the degree of inequality varies.

When describing a field setting, the numbers of fielders on the off side and leg side are often abbreviated into a shortened form, with the off side number quoted first. For example, a &quot;5–4 field&quot; means 5 fielders on the off side and 4 on the leg side.

Usually, most fielders are placed on the off side. This is because most bowlers tend to concentrate the line of their deliveries on or outside the off stump, so most shots are hit into the off side.

When attacking, there may be 3 or 4 slips and 1 or 2 gullies, potentially using up to six fielders in that region alone. This would typically be accompanied by a mid off, mid on, and fine leg, making it a 7–2 field. Although there are only two fielders on the leg side, they should get relatively little work as long as the bowlers maintain a line outside off stump. This type of field leaves large gaps in front of the wicket, and is used to entice the batters to attack there, with the hope that they make a misjudgment and edge the ball to the catchers waiting behind them.

As fields get progressively more defensive, fielders will move out of the slip and gully area to cover more of the field, leading to 6–3 and 5–4 fields.

If a bowler, usually a leg spin bowler, decides to attack the batter&#x27;s legs in an attempt to force a stumping, bowl him behind their legs, or induce a catch on the leg side, the field may stack 4–5 towards the leg side. It is unusual to see more than five fielders on the leg side, because of the restriction that there must be no more than two fielders placed behind square leg. 
Sometimes a spinner will bowl leg theory and have seven fielders on the leg side, and will bowl significantly wide of the leg stump to prevent scoring. Often the ball is so wide that the batter cannot hit the ball straight of mid-on while standing still, and cannot hit to the off side unless they try unorthodox and risky shots such as a reverse sweep or pull, or switch their handedness. The batter can back away to the leg side to hit through the off side, but can expose their stumps in doing so.

The reverse tactic can be used, by fast and slow bowlers alike, by placing seven or eight fielders on the off side and bowling far outside off stump. The batter can safely allow the ball to pass without fear of it hitting the stumps, but will not score. If they want to score they will have to try and risk an edge to a wide ball and hit through the packed off side, or try to drag the ball from far outside the stumps to the sparsely-populated leg side.

Another attacking placement on the leg side is the &quot;leg side trap&quot;, which involves placing fielders near the boundary at deep square and backward square leg and bowling bouncers to try to induce the batter to hook the ball into the air. For slower bowlers, the leg trap fieldsmen tend to be placed within 10–15 m from the bat behind square, to catch leg glances and sweeps.

== Protective equipment ==
No member of the fielding side other than the wicket-keeper may wear gloves or external leg guards, though fielders (in particular players fielding near to the bat) may also wear shin protectors, groin protectors (&#x27;boxes&#x27;) and chest protectors beneath their clothing. Apart from the wicket-keeper, protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires.

Fielders are permitted to wear a helmet and face guard. This is usually employed in a position such as silly point or silly mid-wicket, where proximity to the batter gives little time to avoid a shot directly at their head. If the helmet is only being used for overs from one end, it will be placed behind the wicket-keeper when not in use. Some grounds have purpose-built temporary storage for the helmet, shin pads etc., in the form of a cavity beneath the field, accessed through a hatch about across flush with the grass. 5 penalty runs are awarded to the batting side should the ball touch a fielder&#x27;s headgear whilst it is not being worn, unless the ball previously struck a batter not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. This rule was introduced in the 19th century to prevent the unfair practice of a fielder using a hat (often a top hat) to take a catch.

As cricket balls are hard and can travel at high speeds off the bat, protective equipment is recommended to prevent injury. There have been a few recorded deaths in cricket, but they are extremely rare, and not always related to fielding.

== Fielding skills ==
Fielding in cricket requires a range of skills.

Close catchers require the ability to be able to take quick reaction catches with a high degree of consistency. This can require considerable efforts of concentration as a catcher may only be required to take one catch in an entire game, but their success in taking that catch may have a considerable effect on the outcome of the match.

Infielders field between 20 and 40 yards away from the batter. The ball will often be hit at them extremely hard, and they require excellent athleticism as well as courage in stopping it from passing them. Infield catches range from simple, slow moving chances known as &quot;dollies&quot; to hard hit balls that require a spectacular diving catch. Finally, infielders are the main source of run outs in a game of cricket, and their ability to get to the ball quickly, throw it straight and hard and make a direct hit on the stumps is an important skill.

Outfielders field furthest from the bat, typically right on the boundary edge. Their main role is to prevent the ball from going over the boundary and scoring four or six runs. They need good footspeed to be able to get around the field quickly, and a strong arm to be able to make the 50–80-yard throw. Outfielders also often have to catch high hit balls that go over the infield.

===Fielding specialities===
Many cricketers are particularly adept in one fielding position and will usually be found there:
* Slips and bat pad require fast reactions, an ability to anticipate the trajectory of the ball as soon as it takes the edge, and intense concentration. Most top slip fielders tend to be top-order batters, as these are both skills that require excellent hand–eye coordination. Wicket-keepers and bat-pad tend to be amongst the shortest players of the team.
* It is common for the captain of a team to position themselves at slip or a similar close in fielding position. This enables them to remain close to the bowler, wicket-keeper and central umpire and to be able to survey the field from a central location in a similar manner to the batsman. It also reduces the energy they use during fielding as such positions are unlikely to require significant running or needing to shuttle back and forth swapping sides of the pitch when the batting partnership is one right and one left handed batter. Australian and New South Wales captain Mark Taylor was a specialist first slip fielder during his long career as an opening batsman. In his first match as the One-Day International captain for Australia he took four catches at first slip against the West Indies, and in Test Matches he effected 157 catches with a significant amount at first slip.
* Pace bowlers will often be found fielding in the third man, fine leg and deep backward square positions during the overs between those they are bowling. These positions mean that they are at the correct end for their bowling over. They should see relatively little fielding action with plenty of time to react, allowing them to rest between overs. They also usually have an ability to throw the ball long distances accurately.
* Players noted for their agility, acceleration, ground diving and throwing accuracy will often field in the infield positions such as point, cover and mid-wicket. In short forms like T20 and One-Day internationals, the fastest players on a team will be used as &quot;sweepers&quot;, on the sides the field at the very edge of the boundary where their pace can enable them to stop a ball from going for 6 or 4 runs.

Players are not selected purely because of their fielding skills in modern organised cricket. All players are expected to win their place in the team as a specialist batter, bowler or all-rounder. Due to the lack of restrictions on substitute fielders some teams will use a well regarded fielder from local club sides as an &#x27;emergency fielder&#x27;, who temporarily takes the place of another player and is prohibited from bowling, batting or acting as captain. An example of this was in the 2005 Ashes series with England using Gary Pratt, a 24 year old batter who was already past the peak of his batting career in first class cricket. Pratt fielded a quick single from Damien Martyn then threw down the stumps to dismiss Australian Captain Ricky Ponting.

Wicket-keepers were the one exception to the rule, as their specialist position was viewed as being so important that fielding as a keeper was more important than their batting, although they were still generally expected to be competent enough to play at the #7 position in the batting order, before the usual four bowlers. Jack Russell and Alec Stewart were in a constant selection battle for England&#x27;s wicket-keeper position, with Stewart&#x27;s superior batting competing with Russell who was considered the best wicket-keeper in the world. The back and forth over who should keep wickets lasted for Russell&#x27;s entire test career from 1989 through to his retirement in 1998. In the early 2000&#x27;s the role of Wicket-keeper-batter was introduced with the success of the heavy hitting Adam Gilchrist, elevating the expectations on the batting side of a wicket-keeper while retaining high level fielding ability. Wicket-keepers are allowed to bowl though this is extremely rare at higher levels, and no serious attempt has been made to use a wicket-keeper as a regular bowler in top level international cricket.

===Throwing a cricket ball===

There have been many competitions for throwing a cricket ball the furthest distance, particularly in the earlier years of the game. &quot;Wisden&quot; describes how the record was set around 1882, by one Robert Percival at Durham Sands Racecourse, at 140 yards and two feet (128.7 m). Former Essex all-rounder Ian Pont threw a ball 138 yards (126.19 m) in Cape Town in 1981. There are unconfirmed reports that Jānis Lūsis, the non-cricketer Soviet javelin thrower, who won the Olympic gold medal in 1968, once threw a ball 150 yards.

===Specialist fielding coaches===

The use of specialist fielding coaches has become more prevalent since the turn of the 21st century, following the trend of specialist batting and bowling coaches within professional cricket. According to cricket broadcaster Henry Blofeld, &quot;Dressing rooms were once populated by the team and the twelfth man, one physiotherapist at most, perhaps a selector and the occasional visitor. That was all. Now, apart from the two main coaches, there are &#x27;emergency fielders&#x27; galore; you can hardly see yourself for batting, bowling, fielding coaches, psychoanalysts and statistical wizards and a whole army of physiotherapists&quot;. Baseball fielding coaches have been sought out for this purpose before.

<doc id="65952" wikidata="Q575371" url="?curid=65952" title="Antigonae">
<text>Antigonae (&quot;Antigone&quot;), written by Carl Orff, was first presented on 9 August 1949 under the direction of Ferenc Fricsay in the Felsenreitschule, Salzburg, Austria, as part of the Salzburg Festival. Antigonae is in Orff&#x27;s words a &quot;musical setting&quot; for the Greek tragedy of the same name by Sophocles. However, it functions as an opera.

The opera is a line-by-line setting of the German translation of Sophocles&#x27; play by Friedrich Hölderlin. However, Orff did not treat Hölderlin&#x27;s translation of the play as a traditional opera libretto, but rather as the basis for a &quot;musical transformation&quot; of the tragic language of the drama of Ancient Greece. Sophocles&#x27;s play was written in 442 BC, and Hölderlin&#x27;s 1804 translation copies faithfully the mood and movement of Greek tragedy.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

The opera begins in the early morning following a battle in Thebes between the armies of the two sons of Oedipus: Eteocles and Polynices. King Kreon (Creon), who ascended the throne of Thebes after both brothers are killed in battle, decrees that Polynices is not to be buried. Antigonae, his sister, defies the order, but is caught. Kreon decrees that she be buried alive in spite of the fact that she is betrothed to his son, Haemon. The gods, through the blind prophet Tiresias, express their disapproval of Kreon&#x27;s decision, which convinces him to rescind his order, and he goes to bury Polynices. However, Antigonae has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. When Kreon arrives at the tomb where she was to be interred, his son, Haemon, attacks him and then kills himself. Finally, when Kreon&#x27;s wife, Eurydice, is informed of Haemon&#x27;s and Antigonae&#x27;s death she, too, takes her own life. At the end of the play, and the opera, Kreon is the only principal left alive.

== Music ==
Orff&#x27;s musical setting of Friedrich Hölderlin&#x27;s Sophocles translation from 1804 created a novel form of musical theatre in which the poetic text itself becomes musicalized through the declamation of the singing voices. An extraordinary reduction of the structures of the pitch domain, in connection with the predominance of rhythmic patterns, has been described as an essential feature of Orff&#x27;s late style. Especially the large choruses, which exhibit a pronounced tendency to build up large soundscapes from highly individual timbres, demonstrate the composer&#x27;s method of thinking in constellations of basic pitches without veritable chord syntax. Orff&#x27;s renunciation of the grammar of harmonic tonality allowed the composer, as the musical equivalent of Hölderlin&#x27;s archaic language, to turn the declamation of the singing voices itself into the vehicle for the dramatic action. As Pietro Massa has been able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist Wolfgang Schadewaldt, the musicologist Thrasybulos Georgiades and the stage director Wieland Wagner, who had originally been selected as director for the world premieres of &quot;Oedipus der Tyrann&quot; and &quot;Prometheus&quot; by the composer, accompanied the genesis of Orff&#x27;s operas on Greek drama.

Concentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with and without definite pitches, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra&#x27;s only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, also appears to be a veritable patent solution for a composer who is interested in creating pitch organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of musical functions, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, appears in the orchestra of Orff&#x27;s operas on Hölderlin’s translations from Sophokles transposed on instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of &quot;Antigonae&quot;, six grand pianos and a group of xylophones, which were mostly given only marginal tasks in the traditional orchestra, take on the role that the group of strings had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, traditional instruments of the European orchestral tradition – such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses – become entrusted in &quot;Antigonae&quot; and &quot;Oedipus der Tyrann&quot; with functions that had been reserved to rare percussion instruments in the orchestra of the 19th century: As special timbres with an almost exotic sound appeal, they appear reserved for the turning points of the work&#x27;s dramaturgical structure.

In the history of 20th-century music, Orff&#x27;s operas on Greek Antiquity constitute an extraordinarily original and highly personal pathway for the avantgarde music theatre after 1950. In the course of the last two decades, Orff&#x27;s Hölderlin operas have received more attention than in the years before 2000, not least because of pronounced similarities between Orff&#x27;s musical language and more recent tendencies of Minimal Music. Of his three operas on drama from Greek Antiquity, especially &quot;Antigonae&quot; has been able to assert itself in the repertoire, since Arthur Honegger &#x27;s opera &quot;Antigone&quot; (Brussels, Théâtre de la Monnaie, 1927), despite its libretto by Jean Cocteau, has not been able to enter the standard operatic repertory.

==Instrumentation==
According to the score, which is published by Schott Music, &quot;Antigonae&quot; is scored for an unusual orchestra with a strong percussion section. This orchestra is to be well screened from the audience when the opera is performed.

* 6 flutes all doubling piccolos
* 6 oboes with which 3 double cor anglais
* 6 trumpets with mutes

* 4 harps
* 6 grand pianos with 2 players each*
* 9 contrabasses

(*) At several points, the strings are struck with various items, including wooden drum sticks on the higher strings, timpani sticks on the lower strings, and also a plectrum.

The percussion section requires 10 to 15 players to perform on the following instruments:
* 7–8 timpani (including a drum on high A)
* lithophone (soprano-range)
* 2–3 xylophones
* 10 &quot;trough xylophones&quot; (2 soprano-xylophones, 6 tenor-xylophones, 2 bass-xylophones)*
* 1 small wood drum
* 1 large African slit-drum
* 2 high bells in D(5) and E(5)
* 3 glockenspiel (2 high-range)
* 4 pairs of antique cymbals

* 3 suspended cymbals (Turkish)
* 3 pairs of crash cymbals (Turkish)
* Small anvil
* 3 triangles
* 2 bass drums
* 6 tambourines
* 6 pairs of castanets
* 10 large Javanese gongs pitched in G(1), C(2), D(2), E(2), G(2), A(3), C(3), D(3), E(3) and F(3)

(*) These are Orff Schulwerk instruments.

For the percussion, Carl Orff insisted on using the right kind of instruments. The two bells must be of typical shape; tubular bells and &quot;plate&quot; bells are not acceptable. The castanets must be of the type without handles, e.g. those only connected together via a string.

Carl Orff also gave extensive performance directions that should be taken into account at performances. For instance, some of the 12 pianists switch to other pianos at several sections. In another place, the entire trumpet section is required to perform some passages backstage before returning to the orchestra.

<doc id="65953" wikidata="Q241077" url="?curid=65953" title="Antigone (Sophocles play)">
<text>Antigone ( ; ) is an Athenian tragedy written by Sophocles in (or before) 441 BC and first performed at the Festival of Dionysus of the same year. It is thought to be the second-oldest surviving play of Sophocles, preceded by &quot;Ajax&quot;, which was written around the same period. The play is one of a triad of tragedies known as the three Theban plays, following &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;. Even though the events in Antigone occur last in the order of events depicted in the plays, Sophocles wrote &quot;Antigone&quot; first. The story expands on the Theban legend that predates it, and it picks up where Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; ends. The play is named after the main protagonist Antigone.

After Oedipus&#x27; self-exile, his sons Eteocles and Polynices engaged in a civil war for the Theban throne, which resulted in both brothers dying while fighting each other. Oedipus&#x27; brother-in-law and new Theban ruler Creon ordered the public honoring of Eteocles and the public shaming of Thebes&#x27; traitor Polynices. The play follows the attempts of their sister Antigone to bury the body of Polynices, going against the decision of her uncle Creon and placing her relationship with her brother above human laws.

==Synopsis==
Prior to the beginning of the play, the brothers Eteocles and Polynices, leading opposite sides in Thebes&#x27; civil war, died fighting each other for the throne. Creon, the new ruler of Thebes and brother of the former Queen Jocasta, has decided that Eteocles will be honored and Polynices will be in public shame. The rebel brother&#x27;s body will not be sanctified by holy rites and will lie unburied on the battlefield, prey for carrion animals, the harshest punishment at the time. Antigone and Ismene are the sisters of the dead Polynices and Eteocles.




In the opening of the play, Antigone brings Ismene outside the palace gates late at night for a secret meeting: Antigone wants to bury Polynices&#x27; body, in defiance of Creon&#x27;s edict, as the Greeks believed that to omission of proper burial rights is an insult to human dignity. Ismene refuses to help her, not believing that it will actually be possible to bury their brother, who is under guard, but she is unable to stop Antigone from going to bury her brother herself.

:The Chorus, consisting of Theban elders, enter and cast the background story of the Seven against Thebes into a mythic and heroic context.

Creon enters and seeks the support of the Chorus in the days to come and, in particular, wants them to back his edict regarding the disposal of Polynices&#x27; body. The leader of the Chorus pledges his support out of deference to Creon. A sentry enters, fearfully reporting that the body has been given funeral rites and a symbolic burial with a thin covering of earth, though no one saw who actually committed the crime. Creon, furious, orders the sentry to find the culprit or face death himself, the sentry leaves. 

:The Chorus sings of the ingenuity of human beings; but add that they do not wish to live in the same city as law-breakers.

The sentry returns, bringing Antigone with him. The sentry explains that the watchmen uncovered Polynices&#x27; body and then caught Antigone as she did the funeral rituals. Creon questions her after sending the sentry away, and she does not deny what she has done. She argues unflinchingly with Creon about the immorality of the edict and the morality of her actions. Creon becomes furious, and seeing Ismene upset, thinks she must have known of Antigone&#x27;s plan. He summons her. Ismene tries to confess falsely to the crime, wishing to die alongside her sister, but Antigone will not have it. Creon orders that the two women be imprisoned.

:The Chorus sings of the troubles of the house of Oedipus.

Haemon, Creon&#x27;s son, enters to pledge allegiance to his father, even though he is engaged to Antigone. He initially seems willing to forsake Antigone, but when he gently tries to persuade his father to spare Antigone, claiming that &quot;under cover of darkness the city mourns for the girl&quot;, the discussion deteriorates, and the two men are soon bitterly insulting each other. When Creon threatens to execute Antigone in front of his son, Haemon leaves, vowing never to see Creon again.

:The Chorus sings of the power of love.

Antigone is brought in under guard on her way to execution. She sings a lament. The Chorus compares her to the goddess Niobe, who was turned into a rock, and say it is a wonderful thing to be compared to a goddess. Antigone accuses them of mocking her.

Creon decides to spare Ismene and to bury Antigone alive in a cave. By not killing her directly, he hopes to pay minimal respects to the gods. She is brought out of the house, and this time, she is sorrowful instead of defiant. She expresses her regrets at not having married and dying for following the laws of the gods. She is taken away to her living tomb.

:The Chorus encourages Antigone by singing of the great women of myth who suffered.

Tiresias, the blind prophet, enters. Tiresias warns Creon that Polynices should now be urgently buried because the gods are displeased, refusing to accept any sacrifices or prayers from Thebes. However, Creon accuses Tiresias of being corrupt. Tiresias responds that Creon will lose &quot;a son of [his] own loins&quot; for the crimes of leaving Polynices unburied and putting Antigone into the earth (he does not say that Antigone should not be condemned to death, only that it is improper to keep a living body underneath the earth). Tiresias also prophesies that all of Greece will despise Creon and that the sacrificial offerings of Thebes will not be accepted by the gods. The leader of the Chorus, terrified, asks Creon to take Tiresias&#x27; advice to free Antigone and bury Polynices. Creon assents, leaving with a retinue of men.

:The Chorus delivers a choral ode to the god Dionysus.

A messenger enters to tell the leader of the Chorus that Haemon has killed himself. Eurydice, Creon&#x27;s wife and Haemon&#x27;s mother, enters and asks the messenger to tell her everything. The messenger reports that Creon saw to the burial of Polynices. When Creon arrived at Antigone&#x27;s cave, he found Haemon lamenting over Antigone, who had hanged herself. Haemon unsuccessfully attempted to stab Creon, then stabbed himself. Having listened to the messenger&#x27;s account, Eurydice silently disappears into the palace.

Creon enters, carrying Haemon&#x27;s body. He understands that his own actions have caused these events and blames himself. A second messenger arrives to tell Creon and the Chorus that Eurydice has also killed herself. With her last breath, she cursed her husband for the deaths of her sons, Haemon and Megareus. Creon blames himself for everything that has happened, and, a broken man, he asks his servants to help him inside. The order he valued so much has been protected, and he is still the king, but he has acted against the gods and lost his children and his wife as a result. After Creon condemns himself, the leader of the Chorus closes by saying that although the gods punish the proud, punishment brings wisdom.

===Characters===
* Antigone, the oldest daughter of Oedipus, the exiled king of Thebes and queen Jocasta. Antigone is a sister of Polynices, Eteocles and Ismene. Compared with her docile sister, Antigone is portrayed as a heroine who recognizes her familial duty. Her dialogues with Ismene reveal her to be as stubborn as her uncle. She defies Creon&#x27;s decree despite the consequences she may face, in order to honor her deceased brother Polynices.
* Ismene serves as a foil for Antigone, presenting the contrast in their respective responses to the royal decree. Considered the beautiful one, she is more lawful and obedient to authority. She hesitates to bury Polynices because she fears Creon.
* Creon is the current King of Thebes, who views law as the guarantor of personal happiness. He can also be seen as a tragic hero, losing everything for upholding what he believes is right. Even when he is forced to amend his decree to please the gods, he first tends to the dead Polynices before releasing Antigone.
* Eurydice of Thebes is the Queen of Thebes and Creon&#x27;s wife. She appears towards the end and only to hear confirmation of her son Haemon&#x27;s death. In her grief, she dies by suicide, cursing Creon, whom she blames for her son&#x27;s death.
* Haemon is the son of Creon and Eurydice, betrothed to Antigone. Proved to be more reasonable than Creon, he attempts to reason with his father for the sake of Antigone. However, when Creon refuses to listen to him, Haemon leaves angrily and shouts he will never see him again. He dies by suicide after finding Antigone dead.
* Koryphaios is the assistant to the King (Creon) and the leader of the Chorus. He is often interpreted as a close advisor to the King, and therefore a close family friend. This role is highlighted in the end when Creon chooses to listen to Koryphaios&#x27; advice.
* Tiresias is the blind prophet whose prediction brings about the eventual proper burial of Polynices. Portrayed as wise and full of reason, Tiresias attempts to warn Creon of his foolishness and tells him the gods are angry. He manages to convince Creon, but is too late to save the impetuous Antigone.
* The Chorus, a group of elderly Theban men, is at first deferential to the king. Their purpose is to comment on the action in the play and add to the suspense and emotions, as well as connecting the story to myths. As the play progresses they counsel Creon to be more moderate. Their pleading persuades Creon to spare Ismene. They also advise Creon to take Tiresias&#x27;s advice.

==Historical context==
&quot;Antigone&quot; was written at a time of national fervor. In 441 BCE, shortly after the play was performed, Sophocles was appointed as one of the ten generals to lead a military expedition against Samos. It is striking that a prominent play in a time of such imperialism contains little political propaganda, no impassioned apostrophe, and—with the exception of the epiklerate (the right of the daughter to continue her dead father&#x27;s lineage) and arguments against anarchy—makes no contemporary allusion or passing reference to Athens. Rather than become sidetracked with the issues of the time, &quot;Antigone&quot; remains focused on the characters and themes within the play. It does, however, expose the dangers of the absolute ruler, or tyrant, in the person of Creon, a king to whom few will speak freely and openly their true opinions, and who therefore makes the grievous error of condemning Antigone, an act that he pitifully regrets in the play&#x27;s final lines. Athenians, proud of their democratic tradition, would have identified his error in the many lines of dialogue which emphasize that the people of Thebes believe he is wrong, but have no voice to tell him so. Athenians would identify the folly of tyranny.

==Notable features==
The Chorus in &quot;Antigone&quot; contrasts with the chorus in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, the play of which &quot;Antigone&quot; is a continuation. In a scene modern scholars believe to have been written after Aeschylus&#x27;s death in order to make it consonant with Sophocles&#x27;s play, the chorus in &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; is largely supportive of Antigone&#x27;s decision to bury her brother. Here, the chorus is composed of old men who are largely unwilling to see civil disobedience in a positive light. The chorus also represents a typical difference in Sophocles&#x27; plays from those of both Aeschylus and Euripides. A chorus of Aeschylus&#x27; almost always continues or intensifies the moral nature of the play, while one of Euripides&#x27; frequently strays far from the main moral theme. The chorus in &quot;Antigone&quot; lies somewhere in between; it remains within the general moral in the immediate scene, but allows itself to be carried away from the occasion or the initial reason for speaking.

==Significance and interpretation==
Once Creon has discovered that Antigone buried her brother against his orders, the ensuing discussion of her fate is devoid of arguments for mercy because of youth or sisterly love from the Chorus, Haemon or Antigone herself. Most of the arguments to save her center on a debate over which course adheres best to strict justice.

Both Antigone and Creon claim divine sanction for their actions; but Tiresias the prophet supports Antigone&#x27;s claim that the gods demand Polynices&#x27; burial. It is not until the interview with Tiresias that Creon transgresses and is guilty of sin. He had no divine intimation that his edict would be displeasing to the gods and against their will. He is here warned that it is, but he defends it and insults the prophet of the gods. This is his sin, and it is this that leads to his punishment. The terrible calamities that overtake Creon are not the result of his exalting the law of the state over the unwritten and divine law that Antigone vindicates, but are his intemperance that led him to disregard the warnings of Tiresias until it was too late. This is emphasized by the Chorus in the lines that conclude the play.

The German poet Friedrich Hölderlin, whose translation had a strong impact on the philosopher Martin Heidegger, brings out a more subtle reading of the play: he focuses on Antigone&#x27;s legal and political status within the palace, her privilege to be the heiress (according to the legal instrument of the epiklerate) and thus protected by Zeus. According to the legal practice of classical Athens, Creon is obliged to marry his closest relative (Haemon) to the late king&#x27;s daughter in an inverted marriage rite, which would oblige Haemon to produce a son and heir for his dead father in law. Creon would be deprived of grandchildren and heirs to his lineage – a fact that provides a strong realistic motive for his hatred against Antigone. This modern perspective has remained submerged for a long time.

Heidegger, in his essay, &quot;The Ode on Man in Sophocles&#x27; Antigone&quot;, focuses on the chorus&#x27; sequence of strophe and antistrophe that begins on line 278. His interpretation is in three phases: first to consider the essential meaning of the verse, and then to move through the sequence with that understanding, and finally to discern what was nature of humankind that Sophocles was expressing in this poem. In the first two lines of the first strophe, in the translation Heidegger used, the chorus says that there are many strange things on earth, but there is nothing stranger than man. Beginnings are important to Heidegger, and he considered those two lines to describe the primary trait of the essence of humanity within which all other aspects must find their essence. Those two lines are so fundamental that the rest of the verse is spent catching up with them. The authentic Greek definition of humankind is the one who is strangest of all. Heidegger&#x27;s interpretation of the text describes humankind in one word that captures the extremes — &quot;deinotaton&quot;. Man is &quot;deinon&quot; in the sense that he is the terrible, violent one, and also in the sense that he uses violence against the overpowering. Man is twice &quot;deinon&quot;. In a series of lectures in 1942, &quot;Hölderlin&#x27;s Hymn, The Ister&quot;, Heidegger goes further in interpreting this play, and considers that Antigone takes on the destiny she has been given, but does not follow a path that is opposed to that of the humankind described in the choral ode. When Antigone opposes Creon, her suffering the uncanny is her supreme action.

===The problem of the second burial===
An important issue still debated regarding Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot; is the problem of the second burial. When she poured dust over her brother&#x27;s body, Antigone completed the burial rituals and thus fulfilled her duty to him. Having been properly buried, Polynices&#x27; soul could proceed to the underworld whether or not the dust was removed from his body. However, Antigone went back after his body was uncovered and performed the ritual again, an act that seems to be completely unmotivated by anything other than a plot necessity so that she could be caught in the act of disobedience, leaving no doubt of her guilt. More than one commentator has suggested that it was the gods, not Antigone, who performed the first burial, citing both the guard&#x27;s description of the scene and the chorus&#x27;s observation. It&#x27;s possible, however, that Antigone not only wants her brother to have burial rites, but that she wants his body to stay buried. The guard states that after they found that someone covered Polynices&#x27; body with dirt, the birds and animals left the body alone (lines 257–258). But when the guards removed the dirt, then the birds and animals returned, and Tiresias emphasizes that birds and dogs have defiled the city&#x27;s altars and hearths with the rotting flesh from Polynices&#x27; body; as a result of which the gods will no longer accept the peoples&#x27; sacrifices and prayers (lines 1015–1020). It&#x27;s possible, therefore, that after the guards remove the dirt protecting the body, Antigone buries him again to prevent the offense to the gods. Even though Antigone has already performed the burial rite for Polynices, Creon, on the advice of Tiresias (lines 1023–1030), makes a complete and permanent burial for his body.

Richard C. Jebb suggests that the only reason for Antigone&#x27;s return to the burial site is that the first time she forgot the Choaí (libations), and &quot;perhaps the rite was considered completed only if the Choaí were poured while the dust still covered the corpse.&quot;

Gilbert Norwood explains Antigone&#x27;s performance of the second burial in terms of her stubbornness. His argument says that had Antigone not been so obsessed with the idea of keeping her brother covered, none of the deaths of the play would have happened. This argument states that if nothing had happened, nothing would have happened, and does not take much of a stand in explaining why Antigone returned for the second burial when the first would have fulfilled her religious obligation, regardless of how stubborn she was. This leaves that she acted only in passionate defiance of Creon and respect to her brother&#x27;s earthly vessel.

Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff justifies the need for the second burial by comparing Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot; to a theoretical version where Antigone is apprehended during the first burial. In this situation, news of the illegal burial and Antigone&#x27;s arrest would arrive at the same time and there would be no period of time in which Antigone&#x27;s defiance and victory could be appreciated.

J. L. Rose maintains that the problem of the second burial is solved by close examination of Antigone as a tragic character. Being a tragic character, she is completely obsessed by one idea, and for her this is giving her brother his due respect in death and demonstrating her love for him and for what is right. When she sees her brother&#x27;s body uncovered, therefore, she is overcome by emotion and acts impulsively to cover him again, with no regards to the necessity of the action or its consequences for her safety.

Bonnie Honig uses the problem of the second burial as the basis for her claim that Ismene performs the first burial, and that her pseudo-confession before Creon is actually an honest admission of guilt.

==Themes==

===Civil disobedience===

A well established theme in &quot;Antigone&quot; is the right of the individual to reject society&#x27;s infringement on one&#x27;s freedom to perform a personal obligation. Antigone comments to Ismene, regarding Creon&#x27;s edict, that &quot;He has no right to keep me from my own.&quot; Related to this theme is the question of whether Antigone&#x27;s will to bury her brother is based on rational thought or instinct, a debate whose contributors include Goethe.

The contrasting views of Creon and Antigone with regard to laws higher than those of state inform their different conclusions about civil disobedience. Creon demands obedience to the law above all else, right or wrong. He says that &quot;there is nothing worse than disobedience to authority&quot; (&quot;An.&quot; 671). Antigone responds with the idea that state law is not absolute, and that it can be broken in civil disobedience in extreme cases, such as honoring the gods, whose rule and authority outweigh Creon&#x27;s.

===Natural law and contemporary legal institutions===
Creon&#x27;s decree to leave Polynices unburied in itself makes a bold statement about what it means to be a citizen, and what constitutes abdication of citizenship. It was the firmly kept custom of the Greeks that each city was responsible for the burial of its citizens. Herodotus discussed how members of each city would collect their own dead after a large battle to bury them. In &quot;Antigone&quot;, it is therefore natural that the people of Thebes did not bury the Argives, but very striking that Creon prohibited the burial of Polynices. Since he is a citizen of Thebes, it would have been natural for the Thebans to bury him. Creon is telling his people that Polynices has distanced himself from them, and that they are prohibited from treating him as a fellow-citizen and burying him as is the custom for citizens.

In prohibiting the people of Thebes from burying Polynices, Creon is essentially placing him on the level of the other attackers—the foreign Argives. For Creon, the fact that Polynices has attacked the city effectively revokes his citizenship and makes him a foreigner. As defined by this decree, citizenship is based on loyalty. It is revoked when Polynices commits what in Creon&#x27;s eyes amounts to treason. When pitted against Antigone&#x27;s view, this understanding of citizenship creates a new axis of conflict. Antigone does not deny that Polynices has betrayed the state, she simply acts as if this betrayal does not rob him of the connection that he would have otherwise had with the city. Creon, on the other hand, believes that citizenship is a contract; it is not absolute or inalienable, and can be lost in certain circumstances. These two opposing views – that citizenship is absolute and undeniable and alternatively that citizenship is based on certain behavior – are known respectively as citizenship &#x27;by nature&#x27; and citizenship &#x27;by law.&#x27;

===Fidelity===
Antigone&#x27;s determination to bury Polynices arises from a desire to bring honor to her family, and to honor the higher law of the gods. She repeatedly declares that she must act to please &quot;those that are dead&quot; (&quot;An.&quot; 77), because they hold more weight than any ruler, that is the weight of divine law. In the opening scene, she makes an emotional appeal to her sister Ismene saying that they must protect their brother out of sisterly love, even if he did betray their state. Antigone believes that there are rights that are inalienable because they come from the highest authority, or authority itself, that is the divine law.

While he rejects Antigone&#x27;s actions based on family honor, Creon appears to value family himself. When talking to Haemon, Creon demands of him not only obedience as a citizen, but also as a son. Creon says &quot;everything else shall be second to your father&#x27;s decision&quot; (&quot;An.&quot; 640–641). His emphasis on being Haemon&#x27;s father rather than his king may seem odd, especially in light of the fact that Creon elsewhere advocates obedience to the state above all else. It is not clear how he would personally handle these two values in conflict, but it is a moot point in the play, for, as absolute ruler of Thebes, Creon is the state, and the state is Creon. It is clear how he feels about these two values in conflict when encountered in another person, Antigone: loyalty to the state comes before family fealty, and he sentences her to death.

===Portrayal of the gods===
In &quot;Antigone&quot; as well as the other Theban Plays, there are very few references to the gods. Hades is the god who is most commonly referred to, but he is referred to more as a personification of Death. Zeus is referenced a total of 13 times by name in the entire play, and Apollo is referenced only as a personification of prophecy. This lack of mention portrays the tragic events that occur as the result of human error, and not divine intervention. The gods are portrayed as chthonic, as near the beginning there is a reference to &quot;Justice who dwells with the gods beneath the earth.&quot; Sophocles references Olympus twice in &quot;Antigone.&quot; This contrasts with the other Athenian tragedians, who reference Olympus often.

===Love for family===
Antigone&#x27;s love for family is shown when she buries her brother, Polynices. Haemon was deeply in love with his cousin and fiancée Antigone, and he killed himself in grief when he found out that his beloved Antigone had hanged herself.

=== Equity ===
Following in the Aristotelian tradition, &quot;Antigone&quot; is also seen as a case-study for equity. Catharine Titi has likened &quot;Antigone&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;divine&#x27; law to modern peremptory norms of customary international law (ius cogens) and she has discussed Antigone&#x27;s dilemma as a situation that invites the application of equity &quot;contra legem&quot; in order to correct the law.

==Modern adaptations==

The text was published by NoPassport Press as a single edition in 2009 with introductions by classics scholar Marianne McDonald and playwright Lisa Schlesinger.
* Bangladeshi director Tanvir Mokammel in his 2008 film &quot;Rabeya (The Sister)&quot; also draws inspiration from &quot;Antigone&quot; to parallel the story to the martyrs of the 1971 Bangladeshi Liberation War who were denied a proper burial.

<doc id="65954" wikidata="Q180727" url="?curid=65954" title="John Cage">
<text>John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 – August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage&#x27;s romantic partner for most of their lives.

Cage&#x27;s teachers included Henry Cowell (1933) and Arnold Schoenberg (1933–35), both known for their radical innovations in music, but Cage&#x27;s major influences lay in various East and South Asian cultures. Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s, Cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chance-controlled music, which he started composing in 1951. The &quot;I Ching&quot;, an ancient Chinese classic text and decision-making tool, became Cage&#x27;s standard composition tool for the rest of his life. In a 1957 lecture, &quot;Experimental Music&quot;, he described music as &quot;a purposeless play&quot; which is &quot;an affirmation of life – not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we&#x27;re living&quot;.

Cage&#x27;s best known work is the 1952 composition &quot;4′33″&quot;, a piece performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians who perform the work do nothing but be present for the duration specified by the title. The content of the composition is intended to be the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance. The work&#x27;s challenge to assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made it a popular and controversial topic both in musicology and the broader aesthetics of art and performance. Cage was also a pioneer of the prepared piano (a piano with its sound altered by objects placed between or on its strings or hammers), for which he wrote numerous dance-related works and a few concert pieces. These include &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; (1946–48).

==Life==

===1912–1931: Early years===
Cage was born September 5, 1912, at Good Samaritan Hospital in downtown Los Angeles. His father, John Milton Cage Sr. (1886–1964), was an inventor, and his mother, Lucretia (&quot;Crete&quot;) Harvey (1881–1968), worked intermittently as a journalist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The family&#x27;s roots were deeply American: in a 1976 interview, Cage mentioned that George Washington was assisted by an ancestor named John Cage in the task of surveying the Colony of Virginia. Cage described his mother as a woman with &quot;a sense of society&quot; who was &quot;never happy&quot;, while his father is perhaps best characterized by his inventions: sometimes idealistic, such as a diesel-fueled submarine that gave off exhaust bubbles, the senior Cage being uninterested in an undetectable submarine; others revolutionary and against the scientific norms, such as the &quot;electrostatic field theory&quot; of the universe. John Cage Sr. taught his son that &quot;if someone says &#x27;can&#x27;t&#x27; that shows you what to do.&quot; In 1944–45 Cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated to his parents: &quot;Crete&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot;. The latter is a short lively piece that ends abruptly, while &quot;Crete&quot; is a slightly longer, mostly melodic contrapuntal work.

Cage&#x27;s first experiences with music were from private piano teachers in the Greater Los Angeles area and several relatives, particularly his aunt Phoebe Harvey James who introduced him to the piano music of the 19th century. He received first piano lessons when he was in the fourth grade at school, but although he liked music, he expressed more interest in sight reading than in developing virtuoso piano technique, and apparently was not thinking of composition. During high school, one of his music teachers was Fannie Charles Dillon. By 1928, though, Cage was convinced that he wanted to be a writer. He graduated that year from Los Angeles High School as a valedictorian, having also in the spring given a prize-winning speech at the Hollywood Bowl proposing a day of quiet for all Americans. By being &quot;hushed and silent,&quot; he said, &quot;we should have the opportunity to hear what other people think,&quot; anticipating &quot;4′33″&quot; by more than thirty years.

Cage enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont as a theology major in 1928. Often crossing disciplines again, though, he encountered at Pomona the work of artist Marcel Duchamp via Professor José Pijoan, of writer James Joyce via Don Sample, of philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy and of Henry Cowell. In 1930 he dropped out, having come to believe that &quot;college was of no use to a writer&quot; after an incident described in his 1991 autobiographical statement:

Cage persuaded his parents that a trip to Europe would be more beneficial to a future writer than college studies. He subsequently hitchhiked to Galveston and sailed to Le Havre, where he took a train to Paris. Cage stayed in Europe for some 18 months, trying his hand at various forms of art. First, he studied Gothic and Greek architecture, but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it. He then took up painting, poetry and music. It was in Europe that, encouraged by his teacher Lazare Lévy, he first heard the music of contemporary composers (such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith) and finally got to know the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he had not experienced before.

After several months in Paris, Cage&#x27;s enthusiasm for America was revived after he read Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;—he wanted to return immediately, but his parents, with whom he regularly exchanged letters during the entire trip, persuaded him to stay in Europe for a little longer and explore the continent. Cage started traveling, visiting various places in France, Germany, and Spain, as well as Capri and, most importantly, Majorca, where he started composing. His first compositions were created using dense mathematical formulas, but Cage was displeased with the results and left the finished pieces behind when he left. Cage&#x27;s association with theater also started in Europe: during a walk in Seville he witnessed, in his own words, &quot;the multiplicity of simultaneous visual and audible events all going together in one&#x27;s experience and producing enjoyment.&quot;

===1931–1936: Apprenticeship===
Cage returned to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as Richard Buhlig (who became his first composition teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933, Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. &quot;The people who heard my music had better things to say about it than the people who looked at my paintings had to say about my paintings&quot;, Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a &quot;rather vague letter&quot;, in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage&#x27;s musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil. Weiss was asked by Schoenberg to be his assistant and to train students who may not be ready for Schoenberg&#x27;s teaching.

Following Cowell&#x27;s advice, Cage travelled to New York City in 1933 and started studying with Weiss as well as taking lessons from Cowell himself at The New School. He supported himself financially by taking up a job washing walls at a YWCA (World Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association) in Brooklyn. Cage&#x27;s routine during that period was apparently very tiring, with just four hours of sleep on most nights, and four hours of composition every day starting at 4 am. Several months later, still in 1933, Cage became sufficiently good at composition to approach Schoenberg. He could not afford Schoenberg&#x27;s price, and when he mentioned it, the older composer asked whether Cage would devote his life to music. After Cage replied that he would, Schoenberg offered to tutor him free of charge.

Cage studied with Schoenberg in California: first at University of Southern California and then at University of California, Los Angeles, as well as privately. The older composer became one of the biggest influences on Cage, who &quot;literally worshipped him&quot;, particularly as an example of how to live one&#x27;s life being a composer. The vow Cage gave, to dedicate his life to music, was apparently still important some 40 years later, when Cage &quot;had no need for it [i.e. writing music]&quot;, he continued composing partly because of the promise he gave. Schoenberg&#x27;s methods and their influence on Cage are well documented by Cage himself in various lectures and writings. Particularly well-known is the conversation mentioned in the 1958 lecture &quot;Indeterminacy&quot;:

Cage studied with Schoenberg for two years, but although he admired his teacher, he decided to leave after Schoenberg told the assembled students that he was trying to make it impossible for them to write music. Much later, Cage recounted the incident: &quot;... When he said that, I revolted, not against him, but against what he had said. I determined then and there, more than ever before, to write music.&quot; Although Schoenberg was not impressed with Cage&#x27;s compositional abilities during these two years, in a later interview, where he initially said that none of his American pupils were interesting, he further stated in reference to Cage: &quot;There was one ... of course he&#x27;s not a composer, but he&#x27;s an inventor—of genius.&quot; Cage would later adopt the &quot;inventor&quot; moniker and deny that he was in fact a composer.

At some point in 1934–35, during his studies with Schoenberg, Cage was working at his mother&#x27;s arts and crafts shop, where he met artist Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff. She was an Alaskan-born daughter of a Russian priest; her work encompassed fine bookbinding, sculpture and collage. Although Cage was involved in relationships with Don Sample and with architect Rudolph Schindler&#x27;s wife Pauline, when he met Xenia, he fell in love immediately. Cage and Kashevaroff were married in the desert at Yuma, Arizona, on June 7, 1935.

===1937–1949: Modern dance and Eastern influences===

The newly married couple first lived with Cage&#x27;s parents in Pacific Palisades, then moved to Hollywood. During 1936–38 Cage changed numerous jobs, including one that started his lifelong association with modern dance: dance accompanist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He produced music for choreographies and at one point taught a course on &quot;Musical Accompaniments for Rhythmic Expression&quot; at UCLA, with his aunt Phoebe. It was during that time that Cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments, such as household items, metal sheets, and so on. This was inspired by Oskar Fischinger, who told Cage that &quot;everything in the world has a spirit that can be released through its sound.&quot; Although Cage did not share the idea of spirits, these words inspired him to begin exploring the sounds produced by hitting various non-musical objects.

In 1938, on Cowell&#x27;s recommendation, Cage drove to San Francisco to find employment and to seek out fellow Cowell student and composer Lou Harrison. According to Cowell, the two composers had a shared interest in percussion and dance and would likely hit it off if introduced to one another. Indeed, the two immediately established a strong bond upon meeting and began a working relationship that continued for several years. Harrison soon helped Cage to secure a faculty member position at Mills College, teaching the same program as at UCLA, and collaborating with choreographer Marian van Tuyl. Several famous dance groups were present, and Cage&#x27;s interest in modern dance grew further. After several months he left and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he found work as composer and accompanist for choreographer Bonnie Bird at the Cornish College of the Arts. The Cornish School years proved to be a particularly important period in Cage&#x27;s life. Aside from teaching and working as accompanist, Cage organized a percussion ensemble that toured the West Coast and brought the composer his first fame. His reputation was enhanced further with the invention of the prepared piano—a piano which has had its sound altered by objects placed on, beneath or between the strings—in 1940. This concept was originally intended for a performance staged in a room too small to include a full percussion ensemble. It was also at the Cornish School that Cage met several people who became lifelong friends, such as painter Mark Tobey and dancer Merce Cunningham. The latter was to become Cage&#x27;s lifelong romantic partner and artistic collaborator.

Cage left Seattle in the summer of 1941 after the painter László Moholy-Nagy invited him to teach at the Chicago School of Design (what later became the IIT Institute of Design). The composer accepted partly because he hoped to find opportunities in Chicago, that were not available in Seattle, to organize a center for experimental music. These opportunities did not materialize. Cage taught at the Chicago School of Design and worked as accompanist and composer at the University of Chicago. At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by Kenneth Patchen. The result, &quot;The City Wears a Slouch Hat&quot;, was received well, and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow. Hoping to find these, he left Chicago for New York City in the spring of 1942.

In New York, the Cages first stayed with painter Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim. Through them, Cage met important artists such as Piet Mondrian, André Breton, Jackson Pollock, and Marcel Duchamp, and many others. Guggenheim was very supportive: the Cages could stay with her and Ernst for any length of time, and she offered to organize a concert of Cage&#x27;s music at the opening of her gallery, which included paying for transportation of Cage&#x27;s percussion instruments from Chicago. After she learned that Cage secured another concert, at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Guggenheim withdrew all support, and, even after the ultimately successful MoMA concert, Cage was left homeless, unemployed and penniless. The commissions he hoped for did not happen. He and Xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer Jean Erdman and her husband Joseph Campbell. Without the percussion instruments, Cage again turned to prepared piano, producing a substantial body of works for performances by various choreographers, including Merce Cunningham, who had moved to New York City several years earlier. Cage and Cunningham eventually became romantically involved, and Cage&#x27;s marriage, already breaking up during the early 1940s, ended in divorce in 1945. Cunningham remained Cage&#x27;s partner for the rest of his life. Cage also countered the lack of percussion instruments by writing, on one occasion, for voice and closed piano: the resulting piece, &quot;The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs&quot; (1942), quickly became popular and was performed by the celebrated duo of Cathy Berberian and Luciano Berio. In 1944, he appeared in Maya Deren&#x27;s At Land, a 15-minute silent experimental film.

Like his personal life, Cage&#x27;s artistic life went through a crisis in mid-1940s. The composer was experiencing a growing disillusionment with the idea of music as means of communication: the public rarely accepted his work, and Cage himself, too, had trouble understanding the music of his colleagues. In early 1946 Cage agreed to tutor Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the US to study Western music. In return, he asked her to teach him about Indian music and philosophy. Cage also attended, in late 1940s and early 1950s, D. T. Suzuki&#x27;s lectures on Zen Buddhism, and read further the works of Coomaraswamy. The first fruits of these studies were works inspired by Indian concepts: &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; for prepared piano, &quot;String Quartet in Four Parts&quot;, and others. Cage accepted the goal of music as explained to him by Sarabhai: &quot;to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences&quot;.

Early in 1946, his former teacher Richard Buhlig arranged for Cage to meet Berlin-born pianist Grete Sultan, who had escaped from Nazi persecution to New York in 1941. They became close, lifelong friends, and Cage later dedicated part of his &quot;Music for Piano&quot; and his monumental piano cycle &quot;Etudes Australes&quot; to her. In 1949, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship.

===1950s: Discovering chance===
After a 1949 performance at Carnegie Hall, New York, Cage received a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which enabled him to make a trip to Europe, where he met composers such as Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez. More important was Cage&#x27;s chance encounter with Morton Feldman in New York City in early 1950. Both composers attended a New York Philharmonic concert, where the orchestra performed Anton Webern&#x27;s Symphony, followed by a piece by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Cage felt so overwhelmed by Webern&#x27;s piece that he left before the Rachmaninoff; and in the lobby, he met Feldman, who was leaving for the same reason. The two composers quickly became friends; some time later Cage, Feldman, Earle Brown, David Tudor and Cage&#x27;s pupil Christian Wolff came to be referred to as &quot;the New York school&quot;.

In early 1951, Wolff presented Cage with a copy of the &quot;I Ching&quot;—a Chinese classic text which describes a symbol system used to identify order in chance events. This version of the &quot;I Ching&quot; was the first complete English translation and had been published by Wolff&#x27;s father, Kurt Wolff of Pantheon Books in 1950. The &quot;I Ching&quot; is commonly used for divination, but for Cage it became a tool to compose using chance. To compose a piece of music, Cage would come up with questions to ask the &quot;I Ching&quot;; the book would then be used in much the same way as it is used for divination. For Cage, this meant &quot;imitating nature in its manner of operation&quot;. His lifelong interest in sound itself culminated in an approach that yielded works in which sounds were free from the composer&#x27;s will:

Although Cage had used chance on a few earlier occasions, most notably in the third movement of &quot;Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra&quot; (1950–51), the &quot;I Ching&quot; opened new possibilities in this field for him. The first results of the new approach were &quot;Imaginary Landscape No. 4&quot; for 12 radio receivers, and &quot;Music of Changes&quot; for piano. The latter work was written for David Tudor, whom Cage met through Feldman—another friendship that lasted until Cage&#x27;s death. Tudor premiered most of Cage&#x27;s works until the early 1960s, when he stopped performing on the piano and concentrated on composing music. The &quot;I Ching&quot; became Cage&#x27;s standard tool for composition: he used it in practically every work composed after 1951, and eventually settled on a computer algorithm that calculated numbers in a manner similar to throwing coins for the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

Despite the fame &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; earned him, and the connections he cultivated with American and European composers and musicians, Cage was quite poor. Although he still had an apartment at 326 Monroe Street (which he occupied since around 1946), his financial situation in 1951 worsened so much that while working on &quot;Music of Changes&quot;, he prepared a set of instructions for Tudor as to how to complete the piece in the event of his death. Nevertheless, Cage managed to survive and maintained an active artistic life, giving lectures and performances, etc.

In 1952–1953 he completed another mammoth project—the &quot;Williams Mix&quot;, a piece of tape music, which Earle Brown and Morton Feldman helped to put together. Also in 1952, Cage composed the piece that became his best-known and most controversial creation: &quot;4′33″&quot;. The score instructs the performer not to play the instrument during the entire duration of the piece—four minutes, thirty-three seconds—and is meant to be perceived as consisting of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed. Cage conceived &quot;a silent piece&quot; years earlier, but was reluctant to write it down; and indeed, the premiere (given by Tudor on August 29, 1952, at Woodstock, New York) caused an uproar in the audience. The reaction to &quot;4′33″&quot; was just a part of the larger picture: on the whole, it was the adoption of chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for Cage&#x27;s reputation. The press, which used to react favorably to earlier percussion and prepared piano music, ignored his new works, and many valuable friendships and connections were lost. Pierre Boulez, who used to promote Cage&#x27;s work in Europe, was opposed to Cage&#x27;s particular approach to the use of chance, and so were other composers who came to prominence during the 1950s, e.g. Karlheinz Stockhausen.

During this time Cage was also teaching at the avant-garde Black Mountain College just outside Asheville, North Carolina. Cage taught at the college in the summers of 1948 and 1952 and was in residence the summer of 1953. While at Black Mountain College in 1952, he organized what has been called the first &quot;happening&quot; (see discussion below) in the United States, later titled &quot;Theatre Piece No. 1&quot;, a multi-layered, multi-media performance event staged the same day as Cage conceived it that &quot;that would greatly influence 1950s and 60s artistic practices&quot;. In addition to Cage, the participants included Cunningham and Tudor.

From 1953 onward, Cage was busy composing music for modern dance, particularly Cunningham&#x27;s dances (Cage&#x27;s partner adopted chance too, out of fascination for the movement of the human body), as well as developing new methods of using chance, in a series of works he referred to as &quot;The Ten Thousand Things&quot;. In the summer of 1954 he moved out of New York and settled in Gate Hill Cooperative, a community in Stony Point, New York, where his neighbors included David Tudor, M. C. Richards, Karen Karnes, Stan VanDerBeek, and Sari Dienes. The composer&#x27;s financial situation gradually improved: in late 1954 he and Tudor were able to embark on a European tour. From 1956 to 1961 Cage taught classes in experimental composition at The New School, and from 1956 to 1958 he also worked as an art director and designer of typography. Among his works completed during the last years of the decade were &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (1957–58), a seminal work in the history of graphic notation, and &quot;Variations I&quot; (1958).

===1960s: Fame===
Cage was affiliated with Wesleyan University and collaborated with members of its music department from the 1950s until his death in 1992. At the university, the philosopher, poet, and professor of classics Norman O. Brown befriended Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both. In 1960 the composer was appointed a fellow on the faculty of the Center for Advanced Studies (now the Center for Humanities) in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wesleyan, where he started teaching classes in experimental music. In October 1961, Wesleyan University Press published &quot;Silence&quot;, a collection of Cage&#x27;s lectures and writings on a wide variety of subjects, including the famous &quot;Lecture on Nothing&quot; that was composed using a complex time length scheme, much like some of Cage&#x27;s music. &quot;Silence&quot; was Cage&#x27;s first book of six but it remains his most widely read and influential. In the early 1960s Cage began his lifelong association with C.F. Peters Corporation. Walter Hinrichsen, the president of the corporation, offered Cage an exclusive contract and instigated the publication of a catalog of Cage&#x27;s works, which appeared in 1962.

Edition Peters soon published a large number of scores by Cage, and this, together with the publication of &quot;Silence&quot;, led to much higher prominence for the composer than ever before—one of the positive consequences of this was that in 1965 Betty Freeman set up an annual grant for living expenses for Cage, to be issued from 1965 to his death. By the mid-1960s, Cage was receiving so many commissions and requests for appearances that he was unable to fulfill them. This was accompanied by a busy touring schedule; consequently Cage&#x27;s compositional output from that decade was scant. After the orchestral &quot;Atlas Eclipticalis&quot; (1961–62), a work based on star charts, which was fully notated, Cage gradually shifted to, in his own words, &quot;music (not composition).&quot; The score of &quot;0′00″&quot;, completed in 1962, originally comprised a single sentence: &quot;In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action&quot;, and in the first performance the disciplined action was Cage writing that sentence. The score of &quot;Variations III&quot; (1962) abounds in instructions to the performers, but makes no references to music, musical instruments, or sounds.

Many of the &quot;Variations&quot; and other 1960s pieces were in fact &quot;happenings&quot;, an art form established by Cage and his students in late 1950s. Cage&#x27;s &quot;Experimental Composition&quot; classes at The New School have become legendary as an American source of Fluxus, an international network of artists, composers, and designers. The majority of his students had little or no background in music. Most were artists. They included Jackson Mac Low, Allan Kaprow, Al Hansen, George Brecht, Ben Patterson, and Dick Higgins, as well as many others Cage invited unofficially. Famous pieces that resulted from the classes include George Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Time Table Music&quot; and Al Hansen&#x27;s &quot;Alice Denham in 48 Seconds&quot;. As set forth by Cage, happenings were theatrical events that abandon the traditional concept of stage-audience and occur without a sense of definite duration. Instead, they are left to chance. They have a minimal script, with no plot. In fact, a &quot;happening&quot; is so-named because it occurs in the present, attempting to arrest the concept of passing time. Cage believed that theater was the closest route to integrating art and real life. The term &quot;happenings&quot; was coined by Allan Kaprow, one of his students, who defined it as a genre in the late fifties. Cage met Kaprow while on a mushroom hunt with George Segal and invited him to join his class. In following these developments Cage was strongly influenced by Antonin Artaud&#x27;s seminal treatise &quot;The Theatre and Its Double&quot;, and the happenings of this period can be viewed as a forerunner to the ensuing Fluxus movement. In October 1960, Mary Bauermeister&#x27;s Cologne studio hosted a joint concert by Cage and the video artist Nam June Paik (Cage&#x27;s friend and mentee), who in the course of his performance of &quot;Etude for Piano&quot; cut off Cage&#x27;s tie and then poured a bottle of shampoo over the heads of Cage and Tudor.

In 1967, Cage&#x27;s book &quot;A Year from Monday&quot; was first published by Wesleyan University Press. Cage&#x27;s parents died during the decade: his father in 1964, and his mother in 1969. Cage had their ashes scattered in Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, and asked for the same to be done to him after his death.

===1969–1987: New departures===
Cage&#x27;s work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting the mood of the era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. &quot;HPSCHD&quot; (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with 52 tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 slides of designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four slide projectors, with 40 motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.

Also in 1969, Cage produced the first fully notated work in years: &quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; for piano. The piece is a chance-controlled reworking of Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Socrate&quot;, and, as both listeners and Cage himself noted, openly sympathetic to its source. Although Cage&#x27;s affection for Satie&#x27;s music was well-known, it was highly unusual for him to compose a personal work, one in which the composer &quot;is&quot; present. When asked about this apparent contradiction, Cage replied: &quot;Obviously, &quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; lies outside of what may seem necessary in my work in general, and that&#x27;s disturbing. I&#x27;m the first to be disturbed by it.&quot; Cage&#x27;s fondness for the piece resulted in a recording—a rare occurrence, since Cage disliked making recordings of his music—made in 1976. Overall, &quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; marked a major change in Cage&#x27;s music: he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments, and tried out several new approaches, such as improvisation, which he previously discouraged, but was able to use in works from the 1970s, such as &quot;Child of Tree&quot; (1975).
&quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; became the last work Cage performed in public himself. Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960, and by the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform. Nevertheless, he still played &quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; during the 1970s, before finally having to give up performing. Preparing manuscripts also became difficult: before, published versions of pieces were done in Cage&#x27;s calligraphic script; now, manuscripts for publication had to be completed by assistants. Matters were complicated further by David Tudor&#x27;s departure from performing, which happened in the early 1970s. Tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead, and so Cage, for the first time in two decades, had to start relying on commissions from other performers, and their respective abilities. Such performers included Grete Sultan, Paul Zukofsky, Margaret Leng Tan, and many others. Aside from music, Cage continued writing books of prose and poetry (mesostics). &quot;M&quot; was first published by Wesleyan University Press in 1973. In January 1978 Cage was invited by Kathan Brown of Crown Point Press to engage in printmaking, and Cage would go on to produce series of prints every year until his death; these, together with some late watercolors, constitute the largest portion of his extant visual art. In 1979 Cage&#x27;s &quot;Empty Words&quot; was first published by Wesleyan University Press.

===1987–1992: Final years and death===

In 1987, Cage completed a piece called &quot;Two&quot;, for flute and piano, dedicated to performers Roberto Fabbriciani and Carlo Neri. The title referred to the number of performers needed; the music consisted of short notated fragments to be played at any tempo within the indicated time constraints. Cage went on to write some forty such &quot;Number Pieces&quot;, as they came to be known, one of the last being &quot;Eighty&quot; (1992, premiered in Munich on October 28, 2011), usually employing a variant of the same technique. The process of composition, in many of the later Number Pieces, was simple selection of pitch range and pitches from that range, using chance procedures; the music has been linked to Cage&#x27;s anarchic leanings. &quot;One11&quot; (i.e., the eleventh piece for a single performer), completed in early 1992, was Cage&#x27;s first and only foray into film. Cage conceived his last musical work with Michael Bach Bachtischa: &quot;ONE13&quot; for violoncello with curved bow and three loudspeakers, which was published years later.

Another new direction, also taken in 1987, was opera: Cage produced five operas, all sharing the same title &quot;Europera&quot;, in 1987–91. &quot;Europeras I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; require greater forces than &quot;III&quot;, &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, which are on a chamber scale. They were commissioned by the Frankfurt Opera to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, and according to music critic Mark Swed, they took &quot;an enormous effort on the composer&#x27;s part–requiring two full-time assistants and two computers humming day and night.&quot; These pieces caused quite a stir in the world of opera at the time with their unconventional methods for staging and sequencing. Many standard pieces of operatic repertoire were used, but not in any preset order; rather, they were selected by chance, meaning no two performances were exactly alike. Many of those who were to be a part of these performances refused to participate, citing the impossibility of the requests Cage was making. Days before Europas 1 &amp; 2 were to be premiered,  Frankfurt&#x27;s opera house burned down, setting into motion a series of setbacks leading to a theatrical run met with mixed reactions, including a performance so bad that Cage penned a letter to his musicians criticizing their interpretation of his composition.
In the course of the 1980s, Cage&#x27;s health worsened progressively. He suffered not only from arthritis, but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis. He had a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted, and, in 1985, broke an arm. During this time, Cage pursued a macrobiotic diet. Nevertheless, ever since arthritis started plaguing him, the composer was aware of his age, and, as biographer David Revill observed, &quot;the fire which he began to incorporate in his visual work in 1985 is not only the fire he has set aside for so long—the fire of passion—but also fire as transitoriness and fragility.&quot; On August 11, 1992, while preparing evening tea for himself and Cunningham, Cage had another stroke. He was taken to St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan, where he died on the morning of August 12. He was 79.

According to his wishes, Cage&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, New York, at the same place where he had scattered the ashes of his parents. The composer&#x27;s death occurred only weeks before a celebration of his 80th birthday organized in Frankfurt by composer Walter Zimmermann and musicologist Stefan Schaedler. The event went ahead as planned, including a performance of the &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot; by David Tudor and Ensemble Modern. Merce Cunningham died of natural causes in July 2009.

==Music==
===Early works, rhythmic structure, and new approaches to harmony===
Cage&#x27;s first completed pieces have been lost. According to the composer, the earliest works were very short pieces for piano, composed using complex mathematical procedures and lacking in &quot;sensual appeal and expressive power.&quot; Cage then started producing pieces by improvising and writing down the results, until Richard Buhlig stressed to him the importance of structure. Most works from the early 1930s, such as &quot;Sonata for Clarinet&quot; (1933) and &quot;Composition for 3 Voices&quot; (1934), are highly chromatic and betray Cage&#x27;s interest in counterpoint. Around the same time, the composer also developed a type of a tone row technique with 25-note rows. After studies with Schoenberg, who never taught dodecaphony to his students, Cage developed another tone row technique, in which the row was split into short motives, which would then be repeated and transposed according to a set of rules. This approach was first used in &quot;Two Pieces for Piano&quot; (), and then, with modifications, in larger works such as &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;Five Songs&quot; (both 1938).
Soon after Cage started writing percussion music and music for modern dance, he started using a technique that placed the rhythmic structure of the piece into the foreground. In &quot;Imaginary Landscape No. 1&quot; (1939) there are four large sections of 16, 17, 18, and 19 bars, and each section is divided into four subsections, the first three of which were all 5 bars long. &quot;First Construction (in Metal)&quot; (1939) expands on the concept: there are five sections of 4, 3, 2, 3, and 4 units respectively. Each unit contains 16 bars, and is divided the same way: 4 bars, 3 bars, 2 bars, etc. Finally, the musical content of the piece is based on sixteen motives. Such &quot;nested proportions&quot;, as Cage called them, became a regular feature of his music throughout the 1940s. The technique was elevated to great complexity in later pieces such as &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; for prepared piano (1946–48), in which many proportions used non-integer numbers (1¼, ¾, 1¼, ¾, 1½, and 1½ for &quot;Sonata I&quot;, for example), or &quot;A Flower&quot;, a song for voice and closed piano, in which two sets of proportions are used simultaneously.

In late 1940s, Cage started developing further methods of breaking away with traditional harmony. For instance, in &quot;String Quartet in Four Parts&quot; (1950) Cage first composed a number of &quot;gamuts&quot;: chords with fixed instrumentation. The piece progresses from one &quot;gamut&quot; to another. In each instance the &quot;gamut&quot; was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody, and so the rest of the notes do not form any directional harmony. &quot;Concerto for prepared piano&quot; (1950–51) used a system of charts of durations, dynamics, melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric patterns. The last movement of the concerto was a step towards using chance procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards.

===Chance===
A chart system was also used (along with nested proportions) for the large piano work &quot;Music of Changes&quot; (1951), only here material would be selected from the charts by using the &quot;I Ching&quot;. All of Cage&#x27;s music since 1951 was composed using chance procedures, most commonly using the &quot;I Ching&quot;. For example, works from &quot;Music for Piano&quot; were based on paper imperfections: the imperfections themselves provided pitches, coin tosses and &quot;I Ching&quot; hexagram numbers were used to determine the accidentals, clefs, and playing techniques. A whole series of works was created by applying chance operations, i.e. the &quot;I Ching&quot;, to star charts: &quot;Atlas Eclipticalis&quot; (1961–62), and a series of etudes: &quot;Etudes Australes&quot; (1974–75), &quot;Freeman Etudes&quot; (1977–90), and &quot;Etudes Boreales&quot; (1978). Cage&#x27;s etudes are all extremely difficult to perform, a characteristic dictated by Cage&#x27;s social and political views: the difficulty would ensure that &quot;a performance would show that the impossible is not impossible&quot;—this being Cage&#x27;s answer to the notion that solving the world&#x27;s political and social problems is impossible. Cage described himself as an anarchist, and was influenced by Henry David Thoreau.

Another series of works applied chance procedures to pre-existing music by other composers: &quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; (1969; based on Erik Satie), &quot;Some of &quot;The Harmony of Maine&quot;&quot; (1978; based on Belcher), and &quot;Hymns and Variations&quot; (1979). In these works, Cage would borrow the rhythmic structure of the originals and fill it with pitches determined through chance procedures, or just replace some of the originals&#x27; pitches. Yet another series of works, the so-called &quot;Number Pieces&quot;, all completed during the last five years of the composer&#x27;s life, make use of &quot;time brackets&quot;: the score consists of short fragments with indications of when to start and to end them (e.g. from anywhere between 1′15&quot; and 1′45&quot;, and to anywhere from 2′00&quot; to 2′30&quot;).

Cage&#x27;s method of using the &quot;I Ching&quot; was far from simple randomization. The procedures varied from composition to composition, and were usually complex. For example, in the case of &quot;Cheap Imitation&quot;, the exact questions asked to the &quot;I Ching&quot; were these:
# Which of the seven modes, if we take as modes the seven scales beginning on white notes and remaining on white notes, which of those am I using?
# Which of the twelve possible chromatic transpositions am I using?
# For this phrase for which this transposition of this mode will apply, which note am I using of the seven to imitate the note that Satie wrote?
In another example of late music by Cage, &quot;Etudes Australes&quot;, the compositional procedure involved placing a transparent strip on the star chart, identifying the pitches from the chart, transferring them to paper, then asking the &quot;I Ching&quot; which of these pitches were to remain single, and which should become parts of aggregates (chords), and the aggregates were selected from a table of some 550 possible aggregates, compiled beforehand.

Finally, some of Cage&#x27;s works, particularly those completed during the 1960s, feature instructions to the performer, rather than fully notated music. The score of &quot;Variations I&quot; (1958) presents the performer with six transparent squares, one with points of various sizes, five with five intersecting lines. The performer combines the squares and uses lines and points as a coordinate system, in which the lines are axes of various characteristics of the sounds, such as lowest frequency, simplest overtone structure, etc. Some of Cage&#x27;s graphic scores (e.g. &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Fontana Mix&quot; (both 1958)) present the performer with similar difficulties. Still other works from the same period consist just of text instructions. The score of &quot;0′00″&quot; (1962; also known as &quot;4′33″ No. 2&quot;) consists of a single sentence: &quot;In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action.&quot; The first performance had Cage write that sentence.

&quot;Musicircus&quot; (1967) simply invites the performers to assemble and play together. The first &quot;Musicircus&quot; featured multiple performers and groups in a large space who were all to commence and stop playing at two particular time periods, with instructions on when to play individually or in groups within these two periods. The result was a mass superimposition of many different musics on top of one another as determined by chance distribution, producing an event with a specifically theatric feel. Many Musicircuses have subsequently been held, and continue to occur even after Cage&#x27;s death. The English National Opera (ENO) became the first opera company to hold a Cage Musicircus on March 3, 2012, at the London Coliseum. The ENO&#x27;s Musicircus featured artists including Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and composer Michael Finnissy alongside ENO music director Edward Gardner, the ENO Community Choir, ENO Opera Works singers, and a collective of professional and amateur talents performing in the bars and front of house at London&#x27;s Coliseum Opera House.

This concept of circus was to remain important to Cage throughout his life and featured strongly in such pieces as &quot;Roaratorio, an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake&quot; (1979), a many-tiered rendering in sound of both his text &quot;Writing for the Second Time Through Finnegans Wake&quot;, and traditional musical and field recordings made around Ireland. The piece was based on James Joyce&#x27;s famous novel, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, which was one of Cage&#x27;s favorite books, and one from which he derived texts for several more of his works.

===Improvisation===
Since chance procedures were used by Cage to eliminate the composer&#x27;s and the performer&#x27;s likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to the performer&#x27;s preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In &quot;Child of Tree&quot; (1975) and &quot;Branches&quot; (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers had no knowledge of the instruments. In &quot;Inlets&quot; (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.

==Visual art, writings, and other activities==

Although Cage started painting in his youth, he gave it up to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, &quot;Not Wanting to Say Anything About Marcel&quot;, dates from 1969. The work comprises two lithographs and a group of what Cage called &quot;plexigrams&quot;: silk screen printing on plexiglas panels. The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.

From 1978 to his death Cage worked at Crown Point Press, producing series of prints every year. The earliest project completed there was the etching &quot;Score Without Parts&quot; (1978), created from fully notated instructions, and based on various combinations of drawings by Henry David Thoreau. This was followed, the same year, by &quot;Seven Day Diary&quot;, which Cage drew with his eyes closed, but which conformed to a strict structure developed using chance operations. Finally, Thoreau&#x27;s drawings informed the last works produced in 1978, &quot;Signals&quot;.

Between 1979 and 1982 Cage produced a number of large series of prints: &quot;Changes and Disappearances&quot; (1979–80), &quot;On the Surface&quot; (1980–82), and &quot;Déreau&quot; (1982). These were the last works in which he used engraving. In 1983 he started using various unconventional materials such as cotton batting, foam, etc., and then used stones and fire (&quot;Eninka&quot;, &quot;Variations&quot;, &quot;Ryoanji&quot;, etc.) to create his visual works. In 1988–1990 he produced watercolors at the Mountain Lake Workshop.

The only film Cage produced was one of the Number Pieces, &quot;One11&quot;, commissioned by composer and film director Henning Lohner who worked with Cage to produce and direct the 90-minute monochrome film. It was completed only weeks before his death in 1992. &quot;One11&quot; consists entirely of images of chance-determined play of electric light. It premiered in Cologne, Germany, on September 19, 1992, accompanied by the live performance of the orchestra piece &quot;103&quot;.

Throughout his adult life, Cage was also active as lecturer and writer. Some of his lectures were included in several books he published, the first of which was &quot;Silence: Lectures and Writings&quot; (1961). &quot;Silence&quot; included not only simple lectures, but also texts executed in experimental layouts, and works such as &quot;Lecture on Nothing&quot; (1949), which were composed in rhythmic structures. Subsequent books also featured different types of content, from lectures on music to poetry—Cage&#x27;s mesostics.

Cage was also an avid amateur mycologist. In the fall of 1969, he gave a lecture on the subject of edible mushrooms at the University of California, Davis as part of his &quot;Music in Dialogue&quot; course. He co-founded the New York Mycological Society with four friends, and his mycology collection is presently housed by the Special Collections department of the McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

==Reception and influence==
Cage&#x27;s pre-chance works, particularly pieces from the late 1940s such as &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot;, earned critical acclaim: the &quot;Sonatas&quot; were performed at Carnegie Hall in 1949. Cage&#x27;s adoption of chance operations in 1951 cost him a number of friendships and led to numerous criticisms from fellow composers. Adherents of serialism such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen dismissed indeterminate music; Boulez, who was once on friendly terms with Cage, criticized him for &quot;adoption of a philosophy tinged with Orientalism that masks a basic weakness in compositional technique.&quot; Prominent critics of serialism, such as the Greek composer Iannis Xenakis, were similarly hostile towards Cage: for Xenakis, the adoption of chance in music was &quot;an abuse of language and ... an abrogation of a composer&#x27;s function.&quot;

An article by teacher and critic Michael Steinberg, &quot;Tradition and Responsibility&quot;, criticized avant-garde music in general:

Cage&#x27;s aesthetic position was criticized by, among others, prominent writer and critic Douglas Kahn. In his 1999 book &quot;Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts&quot;, Kahn acknowledged the influence Cage had on culture, but noted that &quot;one of the central effects of Cage&#x27;s battery of silencing techniques was a silencing of the social.&quot;

While much of Cage&#x27;s work remains controversial, his influence on countless composers, artists, and writers is notable. After Cage introduced chance procedures to his works, Boulez, Stockhausen, and Xenakis remained critical, yet all adopted chance procedures in some of their works (although in a much more restricted manner); and Stockhausen&#x27;s piano writing in his later &quot;Klavierstücke&quot; was influenced by Cage&#x27;s &quot;Music of Changes&quot; and David Tudor. Other composers who adopted chance procedures in their works included Witold Lutosławski, Mauricio Kagel, and many others. Music in which some of the composition and/or performance is left to chance was labelled &quot;aleatoric music&quot;—a term popularized by Pierre Boulez. Helmut Lachenmann&#x27;s work was influenced by Cage&#x27;s work with extended techniques.

Cage&#x27;s rhythmic structure experiments and his interest in sound influenced a number of composers, starting at first with his close American associates Earle Brown, Morton Feldman, and Christian Wolff (and other American composers, such as La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass), and then spreading to Europe. For example, many composers of the English experimental school acknowledge his influence: Michael Parsons, Christopher Hobbs, John White, Gavin Bryars, who studied under Cage briefly, and Howard Skempton. The Japanese composer Tōru Takemitsu has also cited Cage&#x27;s influence. In 1986, he received an honorary doctorate from the California Institute of the Arts. Cage is a 1989 Kyoto Prize Laureate; the prize was established by Kazuo Inamori. The John Cage Award was endowed and established in 1992 by Foundation for Contemporary Arts in honor of the late composer, with recipients including Meredith Monk, Robert Ashley, and Toshi Ichiyanagi.

Following Cage&#x27;s death Simon Jeffes, founder of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, composed a piece entitled &quot;CAGE DEAD&quot;, using a melody based on the notes contained in the title, in the order they appear: C, A, G, E, D, E, A and D.

Cage&#x27;s influence was also acknowledged by rock acts such as Sonic Youth (who performed some of the Number Pieces) and Stereolab (who named a song after Cage), composer and rock and jazz guitarist Frank Zappa, and various noise music artists and bands: musicologist Paul Hegarty traced the origin of noise music to &quot;4′33″&quot;. The development of electronic music was also influenced by Cage: in the mid-1970s Brian Eno&#x27;s label Obscure Records released works by Cage. Prepared piano, which Cage popularized, is featured heavily on Aphex Twin&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Drukqs&quot;. Cage&#x27;s work as musicologist helped popularize Erik Satie&#x27;s music, and his friendship with Abstract expressionist artists such as Robert Rauschenberg helped introduce his ideas into visual art. Cage&#x27;s ideas also found their way into sound design: for example, Academy Award-winning sound designer Gary Rydstrom cited Cage&#x27;s work as a major influence. Radiohead undertook a composing and performing collaboration with Cunningham&#x27;s dance troupe in 2003 because the music-group&#x27;s leader Thom Yorke considered Cage one of his &quot;all-time art heroes&quot;. In The Tragically Hip&#x27;s 2000 song Tiger the Lion from their album Music @ Work, lyricist Gord Downie refers to Cage and his theories.

===Centenary commemoration===

In 2012, among a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an eight-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more among the city&#x27;s art museums and universities than performance spaces. Earlier in the centennial year, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas presented Cage&#x27;s &quot;Song Books&quot; with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York. Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses. At the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, Heiner Goebbels staged a production of &quot;Europeras 1 &amp; 2&quot; in a 36,000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of &quot;&quot; created and performed by Robert Wilson. Jacaranda Music had four concerts planned in Santa Monica, California, for the centennial week. John Cage Day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth.

A 2012 project was curated by Juraj Kojs to celebrate the centenary of Cage&#x27;s birth, titled &quot;On Silence: Homage to Cage.&quot; It consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the globe such as Kasia Glowicka, Adrian Knight and Henry Vega, each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of Cage&#x27;s famous 1952 opus, &quot;4′33″&quot;. The program was supported by the Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts, Laura Kuhn and the John Cage Trust.

In a homage to Cage&#x27;s dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 &quot;performed an engrossing piece called &#x27;Story/Time&#x27;. It was modeled on Cage&#x27;s 1958 work &#x27;Indeterminacy&#x27;, in which [Cage and then Jones, respectively,] sat alone onstage, reading aloud ... series of one-minute stories [they]&#x27;d written. Dancers from Jones&#x27;s company performed as [Jones] read.&quot;

<doc id="65955" wikidata="Q652698" url="?curid=65955" title="Denim">
<text>Denim is a sturdy cotton warp-faced textile in which the weft passes under two or more warp threads. This twill weave produces a diagonal ribbing that distinguishes it from cotton duck. Denim, as it is recognized today, was first produced in Nîmes, France.

Denim is available in a range of colors, but the most common denim is indigo denim in which the warp thread is dyed while the weft thread is left white. As a result of the warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the textile is dominated by the blue warp threads, and the other side is dominated by the white weft threads. Jeans fabricated from this cloth are thus predominantly white on the inside. Denim is used to create a wide variety of garments, accessories, and furniture.

==Etymology==
&quot;Denim&quot; originated as a contraction of the French phrase (&#x27;serge from Nîmes&#x27;).

==History==

Denim has been used in the United States since the mid-19th century. Denim initially gained popularity in 1873 when Jacob W. Davis, a tailor from Nevada, manufactured the first pair of rivet-reinforced denim pants. The popularity of denim jeans outstripped the capacity of Davis&#x27;s small shop, so he moved his production to the facilities of dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss &amp; Co., which had been supplying Davis with bolts of denim fabric.

Throughout the 20th century, denim was used for durable uniforms like those issued to staff of the French national railways. In the post-war years, the Royal Air Force issued olive-drab denim coveralls (colloquially known as &quot;denims&quot;) for dirty work.


By the 1970s, denim jeans were such an integral part of youth culture that automobile manufactures, beginning with American Motors Corporation began offering denim-like interior finishes. (Because denim cannot pass fire resistance safety standards, indigo-colored spun nylon or vinyl was used, with contrast-stitching and copper rivets helping to sell the effect.) A Levi&#x27;s-branded trim package debuted with AMC&#x27;s 1973 model year. Similar packages were available from Volkswagen from 1973 to 1975 (the &quot;Jeans Beetle&quot;) and from Jeep from 1975 through 1977.

==Creating denim==
All denim is created through generally the same process:
# Cotton fiber is spun into yarn
# The warp yarn is dyed, while the weft is left white (usually) 
# The yarns are woven on a shuttle loom or projectile loom
# The woven product is sanforized

===Yarn production===
Traditional denim yarn is composed entirely of cotton. Once cotton fibers are cleaned and combed into long, cohesive lengths of similar-length fiber, they are spun into yarn using an industrial machine. Throughout the creation of denim, washes, dyes, or treatments are used to change the appearance of denim products.

Some yarns may substitute an elastic component such as spandex for up to 3% of the cotton, the woven form of which (typically called &#x27;stretch denim&#x27;) may have a elasticity of up to 15%.

===Dyeing===
Denim was originally dyed with indigo dye extracted from plants, often from the genus &quot;Indigofera&quot;. In South Asia, indigo dye was extracted from the dried and fermented leaves of &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot;; this is the plant that is now known as &quot;true indigo&quot; or &quot;natural indigo&quot;. In Europe, the use of &quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot;, or woad, can be traced back to the 8th century BC, although it was eventually replaced by &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot; as the superior dye product. However, most denim today is dyed with synthetic indigo dye. In all cases, the yarn undergoes a repeated sequence of dipping and oxidation—the more dips, the stronger the color of the indigo.

Before 1915, cotton yarns were dyed using a skein dyeing process, in which individual skeins of yarn were dipped into dye baths. Rope dyeing machines were developed in 1915, and slasher or sheet dyeing machines were developed in the 1970s. These methods involve a series of rollers that feed continuous yarns in and out of dye vats. In rope dyeing, continuous yarns are gathered together into long ropes or groups of yarns – after these bundles are dyed, they must be re-beamed for weaving. In sheet dyeing, parallel yarns are laid out as a sheet in the same order in which they will be woven; because of this, uneven dye circulation in the bath can lead to side-to-side color variations in the woven cloth. Rope dyeing eliminates this possibility because color variations can be evenly distributed across the warp during beaming.

Denim fabric dyeing is divided into two categories: indigo dyeing (Indigo dye is a unique shade of blue) and sulfur dyeing (Sulfur dye is a synthetic organic dye and it is formed by sulphurisation of organic intermediates, this contains nitro or amino groups). Indigo dyeing produces the traditional blue color or shades similar to it. Sulfur dyeing produces specialty black and other colors, such as red, pink, purple, grey, rust, mustard, and green.

===Weaving===

Most denim made today is made on a shuttleless loom that produces bolts of fabric or wider, but some denim is still woven on the traditional shuttle loom, which typically produces a bolt wide. Shuttle-loom-woven denim is usually recognizable by its &quot;selvedge&quot; (or &quot;selvage&quot;), the edge of a fabric created as a continuous cross-yarn (the weft) reverses direction at the edge side of the shuttle loom. The selvedge is traditionally accentuated with warp threads of one or more contrasting colors, which can serve as an identifying mark.

Although quality denim can be made on either loom, selvedge denim has come to be associated with premium products since final production that showcases the selvedge requires greater care of assemblage.

The thickness of denim can vary greatly, with a yard of fabric weighing anywhere from , with being typical.

==Uses==
Denim is frequently used for a wide array of consumer products, including:

* Clothing
** Aprons
** Boots and athletic shoes
** Capri pants
** Cloth face mask
** Dresses
** Hats
** Jackets
** Jeans
** Jeggings
** Overalls
** Shirts
** Shorts
** Skirts
** Sneakers
** Suits
* Accessories
** Belts
** Handbags (purses)
** Tote bags
** Wallets
* Furniture
** Bean bag chairs
** Lampshades
** Upholstery
===Art===
Denim has been a medium for many artists. At least one artist, Ian Berry, uses old or recycled denim, exclusively in crafting his portraits and other scenes.

==Worldwide market==
In 2020, the worldwide denim market equaled US$57.3 billion, with demand growing by 5.8% and supply growing by 8% annually. Over 50% of denim is produced in Asia, most of it in China, India, Turkey, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

Globally, the denim industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 4.8% from 2022 to 2026, with the market value expected to increase from $57.3 billion to $76.1 billion.

<text>Rigoletto is a 1993 musical fantasy/drama produced for Feature Films for Families. Parts of the film were shot in Helper, Utah.

==Synopsis==
During the Great Depression, a wealthy, disfigured recluse named Ari Ribaldi moves into the town of Castle Gate. Shortly thereafter, the town experiences a wave of foreclosures, which the locals blame on Ribaldi. In order to prevent Ribaldi from taking her family&#x27;s home, 13-year-old Bonnie Nelson goes to work as his maid. When Ribaldi discovers Bonnie likes to sing, he begins giving her music lessons. Under his tutelage, Bonnie takes first place in a singing competition.

==Characters==
*Ari Ribaldi/Rigoletto (Joseph Paur) – a gifted singer and composer with a scarred face and a limp
*Bonnie Nelson (Ivey Lloyd) – a naive and curious young girl who goes to work for Ribaldi in order to save her home.
*Margie Nelson (Cynthia Jump) – mother of Bonnie and Timmy
*Timmy Nelson – Bonnie&#x27;s younger brother
*Hans (John Huntington) – Ribaldi&#x27;s butler
*Kathleen Hamilton (Natalie Terry) - Bonnie&#x27;s competitor in the talent contests
*James McBride (Scott Wilkinson) – the town&#x27;s banker who supported himself by increasing mortgage payments
*Georgie Baker (Alyson Brienholt) – one of Bonnie&#x27;s friends, who wants to be a singer just like Bonnie. Georgie is mocked by Kathleen and a few others due to her old, filthy clothes and shoes.
*Porter Baker (Ryan Healey) – Georgie&#x27;s brother, who speaks with a stutter and does not get along with his father
*Elaina Papanikolas (Stephanie Paur) – a young girl for whom Ribaldi provides medical care
*Gabriella (Tracey Williams) – a princess who takes singing lessons from Ribaldi and is secretly in love with him
*Dallin Avery (Dalin Christiansen) – a farmer and pig enthusiast who leads an angry mob against Ribaldi
*Emelda Avery (Ruth Margaret Nickerson) – Dallin&#x27;s wife, confined to a wheelchair
*Tommy Avery (Josh Goodwin)
*Gordon Baker (Tom Nibley) – a temperamental drunk
*Mr. and Mrs. Papanikolas (Frank Gerrish and Micaela Nelligan) – Elaina&#x27;s parents

== Reception ==
Joe Leydon called the film &quot;an odd but involving mix of elements from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and the original folk tale that inspired Verdi&#x27;s classic opera. He concluded his &quot;Variety&quot; review with, &quot;Despite an obviously limited budget, &quot;Rigoletto&quot; is a handsome piece of work. T.C. Christensen&#x27;s color lensing and Cathren Warner&#x27;s costumes are the outstanding production values&quot;.
