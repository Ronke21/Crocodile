<text>Winston Rodney OD (born 1 March 1945), better known by the stage name Burning Spear, is a Jamaican roots reggae singer-songwriter, vocalist, and musician. Burning Spear is a Rastafarian and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s.

==Early life==
Winston Rodney was born in Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay, Saint Ann, Jamaica. He is married to Sonia Rodney. As a young man he listened to the R&amp;B, soul and jazz music transmitted by the US radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica. Curtis Mayfield is cited by Rodney as a major US musical influence along with James Brown. Rodney was deeply influenced as a young man by the views of the political activist Marcus Garvey, especially with regard to the exploration of the themes of Pan-Africanism and self-determination. In 1969, Bob Marley, who was also from Saint Ann, advised Rodney to approach Coxsone Dodd&#x27;s Studio One label after Rodney sought his advice during a casual conversation.

==Career==
Burning Spear was originally Rodney&#x27;s group, named after a military award given by Jomo Kenyatta, the first President of an independent Kenya, and included bass singer Rupert Willington. The duo auditioned for Dodd in 1969 which led to the release of their debut single &quot;Door Peep&quot; (the session also included Cedric Brooks on saxophone). They were then joined by tenor Delroy Hinds. The trio recorded several more singles for Dodd, and two albums, before they moved on to work with Jack Ruby in 1975. Their first recording with Ruby, &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot;, was intended as an exclusive track for Ruby&#x27;s Ocho Rios–based Hi-Power sound system, but was released as a single, giving them an immediate hit, and was followed by &quot;Slavery Days&quot;. These recordings featured the backing band The Black Disciples, which included Earl &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith, Valentine Chin, Robbie Shakespeare and Leroy Wallace. The group worked with Ruby on their third album, &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot; (1975), which was immediately successful and led to a deal with Island Records to give the album a wider release. Island remixed and altered the speed of some of the tracks, much to the annoyance of fans and the group, leading Rodney to set up his own Burning Music label for future releases where he would have full control, although further releases followed on Island including &quot;Garvey&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, a dub version of the Marcus Garvey album, and &quot;Man in the Hills&quot;. In late 1976, Rodney split from both Ruby and group members Willington and Hinds, and from that point on used the name Burning Spear for himself alone. &quot;Dry and Heavy&quot; followed in 1977, self-produced but still on Island, and with a sizeable following by now in the United Kingdom, he performed in London that year with members of Aswad acting as his backing band for a sold-out show at the Rainbow Theatre, which was recorded and released as the album &quot;Live!&quot;. Aswad also provided backing on his next studio album, &quot;Social Living&quot; (1978), which also featured Sly Dunbar and Rico Rodriguez. A dub version of the album, &quot;Living Dub&quot; (1979), was mixed by Sylvan Morris. His profile was raised further by an appearance in the film &quot;Rockers&quot;, performing &quot;Jah no Dead&quot;.

In 1980, Rodney left Island Records and set up the Burning Music Production Company, which he signed to EMI, debuting on the label with &quot;Hail H.I.M.&quot;, recorded at Marley&#x27;s Tuff Gong studio and co-produced by Aston Barrett. A Sylvan Morris dub version followed in the form of &quot;Living Dub Volume Two&quot;. In 1982, Rodney signed with Heartbeat Records with a series of well-received albums following, including the 1985 Grammy-nominated &quot;Resistance&quot;. He returned to Island in the early 1990s, releasing two albums before rejoining Heartbeat. This arrangement in which Burning Music Productions delivered completed albums of music to EMI, Island and Heartbeat Records for worldwide distribution lasted for many years. When Heartbeat ceased releasing new material, Burning Music took matters into their own hands and began to release music solely through their own imprint. Albums released by Heartbeat through an agreement with Burning Music include: &quot;The World Should Know&quot; (1993), &quot;Rasta Business&quot; (1995), &quot;Appointment with His Majesty&quot; (1997) and the Grammy award winning &quot;Calling Rastafari&quot; (1999) which was the last completed album to be solely pressed by an outside label.

Burning Spear spent decades touring extensively, and several live albums have been issued including &quot;Burning Spear Live&quot;, &quot;Live in Paris&quot;, &quot;Live in South Africa&quot;, &quot;Live in Vermont&quot;, &quot;Peace and Love Live&quot;, &quot;Live at Montreux Jazz Festival&quot; and &quot;(A)live 1997&quot;. Touring the world time and time again, the band&#x27;s live sound matured and grew more sophisticated. While remaining firmly rooted in reggae, accents of free jazz, funk and psychedelic music were increasingly in evidence.

His 1999 album, &quot;Calling Rastafari&quot; brought his first Grammy Award in 2000, a feat which he repeated with &quot;Jah Is Real&quot; in 2009. In 2000 Home to My Roots Tour he performed in Cape Town, South Africa alongside other reggae icon Joseph Hill with Culture (band). In 2002 he and his wife, Sonia Rodney who has produced a number of his albums, restarted Burning Music Records, giving him a greater degree of artistic control. Since the mid-1990s, he has been based in Queens in New York City. Burning Spear was awarded the Order of Distinction in the rank of Officer on 15 October 2007. Since establishing their own label, Winston and Sonia Rodney have released nearly forty singles, CDs, DVDs and vinyl albums on the Burning Music imprint. Many of these albums have been deluxe editions of albums previously available on other labels and often include bonus tracks and DVD footage.

In 2016 Rodney announced his retirement, but in 2022 it was announced that he would perform at the Rototom Sunsplash festival in Spain, and on the &#x27;Welcome to Jamrock&#x27; cruise in December.

Rodney announced three shows in California in July 2022, in San Francisco on July 22, San Diego on July 23, and Los Angeles on July 24. He also announced a show at the Levitt Pavilion, Denver, Colorado on July 30, 2022. These shows were followed by two dates in the UK, at Forum Birmingham on August 13 and the O2 Academy, Brixton, London on August 14. On August 14, 2023 he performed a highly acclaimed, packed-out show in the Barby Club live music venue in Tel Aviv, Israel and on August 15, 2023 in Megiddo, Israel where he appeared together with Ehud Banai.

<doc id="66592" wikidata="Q156193" url="?curid=66592" title="Pierre Boulez">
<text>Pierre Louis Joseph Boulez (; 26 March 19255 January 2016) was a French composer, conductor and writer, and the founder of several musical institutions. He was one of the dominant figures of post-war contemporary classical music.

Born in Montbrison, in the Loire department of France, the son of an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as music director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. He was a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing an important role in the development of integral serialism in the 1950s, controlled chance music in the 1960s and the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time from the 1970s onwards. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of work was relatively small, but it included pieces considered landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot;, &quot;Pli selon pli&quot; and &quot;Répons&quot;. His uncompromising commitment to modernism and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist.

Boulez was also one of the most prominent conductors of his generation. In a career lasting more than sixty years, he was music director of the New York Philharmonic, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra. He made frequent appearances with many other orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic. He was known for his performances of the music of the first half of the twentieth century—including Debussy and Ravel, Stravinsky and Bartók, and the Second Viennese School—as well as that of his contemporaries, such as Ligeti, Berio and Carter. His work in the opera house included the production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle for the centenary of the Bayreuth Festival, and the world premiere of the three-act version of Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Lulu&quot;. His recorded legacy is extensive. 

He also founded several musical institutions. In Paris he set up the Domaine musical in the 1950s to promote new music; in the 1970s he established the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM), to foster research and innovation in music, and the Ensemble intercontemporain, a chamber orchestra specialising in contemporary music. Later he co-founded the Cité de la musique, a concert hall, museum and library dedicated to music in the Parc de la Villette in Paris and, in Switzerland, the Lucerne Festival Academy, an international orchestra of young musicians, with which he gave first performances of many new works.

==Biography==

===1925–1943: Childhood and school days===
Pierre Boulez was born on 26 March 1925, in Montbrison, a small town
in the Loire department of east-central France, to Léon and Marcelle (&quot;née&quot; Calabre) Boulez. He was the third of four children: an older sister, Jeanne (1922–2018) and younger brother, Roger ( 1936) were preceded by another child called Pierre ( 1920), who died in infancy. Léon (1891–1969), an engineer and technical director of a steel factory, is described by biographers as an authoritarian figure with a strong sense of fairness, and Marcelle (1897–1985) as an outgoing, good-humoured woman, who deferred to her husband&#x27;s strict Catholic beliefs, while not necessarily sharing them. The family prospered, moving in 1929 from the apartment above a pharmacy, where Boulez was born, to a comfortable detached house, where he spent most of his childhood.

From the age of seven Boulez went to school at the Institut Victor de Laprade, a Catholic seminary where the thirteen-hour school day was filled with study and prayer. By the age of eighteen he had repudiated Catholicism; later in life he described himself as an agnostic.

As a child, Boulez took piano lessons, played chamber music with local amateurs and sang in the school choir. After completing the first part of his baccalaureate a year early, he spent the academic year of 1940–41 at the Pensionnat St. Louis, a boarding school in nearby Saint-Étienne. The following year he took classes in advanced mathematics at the Cours Sogno in Lyon (a school established by the Lazaristes) with a view to gaining admission to the École Polytechnique in Paris. His father hoped this would lead to a career in engineering. Wartime conditions in Lyon were already harsh; they became harsher still when the Vichy government fell, the Germans took over and the city became a centre of the resistance.

In Lyon, Boulez first heard an orchestra, saw his first operas (Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;) and met the soprano Ninon Vallin, who asked him to play for her. Impressed by his ability, she persuaded his father to allow him to apply to the Conservatoire de Lyon. He was rejected but was determined to pursue a career in music. The following year, with his sister&#x27;s support in the face of opposition from his father, he studied piano and harmony privately with Lionel de Pachmann (son of the pianist Vladimir de Pachmann). &quot;Our parents were strong, but finally we were stronger than they&quot;, Boulez later said. In the event, when he moved to Paris in the autumn of 1943, hoping to enroll at the Conservatoire de Paris, his father accompanied him, helped him to find a room (in the 7th arrondissement) and subsidised him until he could earn a living.

===1943–1946: Musical education===
In October 1943, Boulez auditioned unsuccessfully for the advanced piano class at the Conservatoire, but he was admitted in January 1944 to the preparatory harmony class of Georges Dandelot. He made rapid progress, and by May 1944 Dandelot was describing him as &quot;the best of the class&quot;.

Around the same time he was introduced to Andrée Vaurabourg, wife of the composer Arthur Honegger. Between April 1944 and May 1946 he studied counterpoint privately with her. In June 1944 he approached Olivier Messiaen and asked to study harmony with him. Messiaen invited him to attend the private seminars he gave to selected students; in January 1945, Boulez joined Messiaen&#x27;s advanced harmony class at the Conservatoire.

Boulez moved to two small attic rooms in the Marais district of Paris, where he lived for the next thirteen years. In February 1945 he attended a private performance of Schoenberg&#x27;s Wind Quintet, conducted by René Leibowitz, the composer and follower of Schoenberg. The strict use of twelve-tone technique in the Quintet was a revelation to Boulez, who organised a group of fellow students to take private lessons with Leibowitz. It was here that he also discovered the music of Webern. He eventually found Leibowitz&#x27;s approach too doctrinaire and broke angrily with him in 1946 when Leibowitz tried to criticise one of his early works.

In June 1945, Boulez was one of four Conservatoire students awarded &quot;premier prix&quot;. He was described in the examiner&#x27;s report as &quot;the most gifted—a composer&quot;. Although registered at the Conservatoire for the academic year 1945–46, he soon boycotted Simone Plé-Caussade&#x27;s counterpoint and fugue class, infuriated by what he described as her &quot;lack of imagination&quot;, and organised a petition that Messiaen be given a full professorship in composition. Over the winter of 1945–46 Boulez immersed himself in Balinese and Japanese music and African drumming at the Musée Guimet and the Musée de l&#x27;Homme in Paris: &quot;I almost chose the career of an ethnomusicologist because I was so fascinated by that music. It gives a different feeling of time.&quot;

===1946–1953: Early career in Paris===

On 12 February 1946, the pianist Yvette Grimaud gave the first public performances of Boulez&#x27;s music (&quot;Douze Notations&quot; and &quot;Trois Psalmodies&quot;) at the Concerts du Triptyque. Boulez earned money by giving maths lessons to his landlord&#x27;s son. He also played the ondes Martenot (an early electronic instrument), improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising in the pit orchestra of the Folies Bergère. In October 1946, the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault engaged him to play the ondes for a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed at the Théâtre Marigny. Boulez was soon appointed music director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers whose music he disliked (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the chance to work with professional musicians, while leaving time to compose during the day.

His involvement with the company also broadened his horizons: in 1947 they toured to Belgium and Switzerland (&quot;absolutely &quot;pays de cocagne&quot;, my first discovery of the big world&quot;); in 1948 they took &quot;Hamlet&quot; to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays in London, at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America. Much of the music he wrote for the company was lost after the occupation by students of the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon during the civil unrest in May 1968.

The period between 1947 and 1950 was one of intense compositional activity for Boulez. New works included the first two piano sonatas and initial versions of two cantatas on poems by René Char, &quot;Le Visage nuptial&quot; and &quot;Le Soleil des eaux&quot;. In October 1951, a substantial work for eighteen solo instruments, &quot;Polyphonie X&quot;, caused a scandal at its premiere at the Donaueschingen Festival, some audience members whistling and hissing during the performance.

Around this time, Boulez met two composers who were to be important influences: John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers (Heugel and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage&#x27;s &quot;Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano&quot;. When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence about the future of music. Their friendship later cooled as Boulez could not accept Cage&#x27;s increasing commitment to compositional procedures based on chance; he later broke off contact with him. In 1952 Stockhausen arrived in Paris to study with Messiaen. Although Boulez knew no German and Stockhausen no French, the rapport between them was instant: &quot;A friend translated [and] we gesticulated wildly ... We talked about music all the time—in a way I&#x27;ve never talked about it with anyone else.&quot;

In July 1952, Boulez attended the International Summer Course for New Music in Darmstadt for the first time. As well as Stockhausen, Boulez was in contact there with other composers who would become significant figures in contemporary music, including Luciano Berio and Luigi Nono. Boulez quickly became one of the leaders of the post-war modernist movement in the arts. As the music critic Alex Ross observed: &quot;at all times he seemed absolutely sure of what he was doing. Amid the confusion of postwar life, with so many truths discredited, his certitude was reassuring.&quot;

===1954–1959: Le Domaine musical===

In 1954, with the financial backing of Barrault and Renaud, Boulez started a series of concerts at the Petit Marigny theatre, which became known as the Domaine musical. The concerts focused initially on three areas: pre-war classics still unfamiliar in Paris (such as Bartók and Webern), works by the new generation (Stockhausen, Nono) and neglected masters from the past (Machaut, Gesualdo)—although the last category fell away in subsequent seasons, in part because of the difficulty of finding musicians with experience of playing early music. Boulez proved an energetic and accomplished administrator and the concerts were an immediate success. They attracted musicians, painters and writers, as well as fashionable society, but they were so expensive that Boulez had to turn to wealthy patrons for support.

Key events in the Domaine&#x27;s history included a Webern festival (1955), the European premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Agon&quot; (1957) and first performances of Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Oiseaux exotiques&quot; (1955) and &quot;Sept haïkaï&quot; (1963). Boulez remained director until 1967, when Gilbert Amy succeeded him.

On 18 June 1955, Hans Rosbaud conducted the first performance of Boulez&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot;, at the ISCM Festival in Baden-Baden. A nine-movement cycle for alto voice and instrumental ensemble based on poems by René Char, it was an immediate, international success. William Glock wrote: &quot;even at a first hearing, though difficult to take in, it was so utterly new in sound, texture and feeling that it seemed to possess a mythical quality like that of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;&quot;. When Boulez conducted the work in Los Angeles in early 1957, Stravinsky attended the performance; he later described the piece as &quot;one of the few significant works of the post-war period of exploration&quot;. Boulez dined several times with the Stravinskys and (according to Robert Craft) &quot;soon captivated the older composer with new musical ideas, and an extraordinary intelligence, quickness and humour&quot;. Relations between the two composers soured the following year over the first Paris performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Threni&quot; for the Domaine musical. Poorly planned by Boulez and nervously conducted by Stravinsky, the performance broke down more than once.

In January 1958, the &quot;Improvisations sur Mallarmé (I et II)&quot; were premiered, forming the kernel of a piece which grew over the next four years into a large-scale, five-movement &quot;portrait of Mallarmé&quot;, &quot;Pli selon pli&quot;. It received its premiere in Donaueschingen in October 1962.

Around this time, Boulez&#x27;s relations with Stockhausen deteriorated as (according to the biographer Joan Peyser) he saw the younger man supplanting him as the leader of the avant-garde.

===1959–1971: International conducting career===
In 1959, Boulez left Paris for Baden-Baden, where he had an arrangement with the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra to work as composer-in-residence and to conduct some smaller concerts. He also had access to an electronic studio where he could work on a new piece (&quot;Poésie pour pouvoir&quot;). He moved into, and eventually bought, a large hillside villa, which was his main home for the rest of his life.

During this period, he turned increasingly to conducting. His first engagement as an orchestral conductor had been in 1956, when he conducted the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra while on tour with Barrault. His breakthrough came in 1959 when he replaced the ailing Hans Rosbaud at short notice in demanding programmes of twentieth-century music at the Aix-en-Provence and Donaueschingen Festivals. This led to debuts with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, Bavarian Radio Symphony and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras. 

In 1963 Boulez conducted his first opera, Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; at the Opéra National de Paris, directed by Barrault. The conditions were exceptional, with thirty orchestral rehearsals instead of the usual three or four; the critical response was favourable and after the first performance the musicians rose to applaud him. He conducted &quot;Wozzeck&quot; again in April 1966 at the Oper Frankfurt in a new production by Wieland Wagner.

Wieland Wagner had already invited Boulez to conduct Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Bayreuth Festival later in the season, and Boulez returned to conduct revivals in 1967, 1968 and 1970. He also conducted performances of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with the Bayreuth company at the Osaka Festival in Japan in 1967, but the lack of adequate rehearsal made it an experience he later said he would rather forget. His conducting of the new production (by Václav Kašlík) of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; at Covent Garden in 1969 was praised for its combination of &quot;delicacy and sumptuousness&quot;.

In 1965, the Edinburgh International Festival staged the first large-scale retrospective of Boulez as composer and conductor. In 1966, he proposed a reorganisation of French musical life to the minister of culture, André Malraux, but Malraux instead appointed the conservative Marcel Landowski as head of music at the Ministry of Culture. Boulez expressed his fury in an article in the &quot;Nouvel Observateur&quot;, announcing that he was &quot;going on strike with regard to any aspect of official music in France&quot;.

In March 1965, Boulez had made his orchestral debut in the United States with the Cleveland Orchestra. In February 1969 he became its principal guest conductor and, on the death of George Szell in July 1970, assumed the role of music advisor for two years. In the 1968–69 season, he also made guest appearances in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.

Apart from &quot;Pli selon pli&quot;, Boulez&#x27;s only substantial new work to emerge in the first half of the 1960s was the final version of Book 2 of his &quot;Structures&quot; for two pianos. Midway through the decade, he produced several new works, including &quot;Éclat&quot; (1965), a short and brilliant piece for small ensemble, which by 1970 had grown into a substantial half-hour work, &quot;Éclat/Multiples&quot;.

===1971–1977: London and New York===
Boulez first conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in February 1964, at Worthing, accompanying Vladimir Ashkenazy in a Chopin piano concerto. Boulez recalled: &quot;It was terrible, I felt like a waiter who keeps dropping the plates.&quot; His appearances with the orchestra over the next five years included his debuts at the Proms and at Carnegie Hall (1965) and tours to Moscow and Leningrad, Berlin and Prague (1967). In January 1969 William Glock, controller of music at the BBC, announced his appointment as chief conductor. Two months later, Boulez conducted the New York Philharmonic for the first time. His performances so impressed both orchestra and management that he was offered the chief conductorship in succession to Leonard Bernstein. Glock was dismayed and tried to persuade him that accepting the New York position would detract both from his work in London and his ability to compose but Boulez could not resist the opportunity (as Glock put it) &quot;to reform the music-making of both these world cities&quot; and in June the New York appointment was confirmed.
His tenure in New York lasted between 1971 and 1977 and was not an unqualified success. The dependence on a subscription audience limited his programming. He introduced more key works from the first half of the twentieth century and, with earlier repertoire, sought out less well-known pieces. In his first season, he conducted Liszt&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Saint Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Via Crucis&quot;. Performances of new music were comparatively rare in the subscription series. The players admired his musicianship but regarded him as dry and unemotional compared to Bernstein, although it was widely accepted that he improved the standard of playing. He returned on only three occasions to the orchestra in later years.

Boulez&#x27;s time with the BBC Symphony Orchestra was happier. With the resources of the BBC behind him, he could be bolder in his choice of repertoire. There were occasional forays into the classical and romantic repertoire, particularly at the Proms (Beethoven&#x27;s Missa solemnis in 1972; the Brahms &quot;German Requiem&quot; in 1973), but for the most part he worked intensively with the orchestra on the music of the twentieth century. He conducted works by the younger generation of British composers—such as Harrison Birtwistle and Peter Maxwell Davies—but Britten and Tippett were absent from his programmes. His relations with the musicians were generally excellent. He was chief conductor between 1971 and 1975, continuing as chief guest conductor until 1977. Thereafter he returned to the orchestra frequently until his last appearance in an all-Janáček programme at a 2008 Prom.

In both cities, Boulez sought out venues where new music could be presented more informally: in New York he began a series of &quot;Rug Concerts&quot;—when the seats in Avery Fisher Hall were taken out and the audience sat on the floor—and a contemporary music series called &quot;Prospective Encounters&quot; in Greenwich Village; in London he gave concerts at the Roundhouse, a former railway turntable shed which Peter Brook had also used for radical theatre productions. His aim was &quot;to create a feeling that we are all, audience, players and myself, taking part in an act of exploration&quot;.

In 1972, Wolfgang Wagner, who had succeeded his brother Wieland as director of the Bayreuth Festival, invited Boulez to conduct the 1976 centenary production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. The director was Patrice Chéreau. Highly controversial in its first year, according to Barry Millington by the end of the run in 1980 &quot;enthusiasm for the production vastly outweighed disapproval&quot;. It was televised around the world.

A few new works emerged during this period, of which perhaps the most important is &quot;Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna&quot;, a large-scale orchestral work, prompted by the death at a relatively young age of Boulez&#x27;s friend and fellow composer.

===1977–1992: IRCAM===
In 1970 Boulez was asked by President Pompidou to return to France and set up an institute specialising in musical research and creation at the arts complex—now known as the Centre Georges Pompidou—which was planned for the Beaubourg district of Paris. The Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM) opened in 1977.

Boulez&#x27;s model was the Bauhaus, which had been a meeting place for artists and scientists of all disciplines. IRCAM&#x27;s aims included research into acoustics, instrumental design and the use of computers in music. The original building was constructed underground, partly to isolate it acoustically (an above-ground extension was added later). The institution was criticised for absorbing too much state subsidy, Boulez for wielding too much power. At the same time he founded the Ensemble intercontemporain, a virtuoso ensemble dedicated to contemporary music.

In 1979, Boulez conducted the world premiere of the three-act version of Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; at the Paris Opera in Friedrich Cerha&#x27;s completion of the work, left unfinished at Berg&#x27;s death. It was directed by Chéreau. Otherwise he scaled back his conducting commitments to concentrate on IRCAM. Most of his appearances during this period were with his own Ensemble intercontemporain—including tours to the United States (1986), Australia (1988), the Soviet Union (1990) and Canada (1991)—although he also renewed his links in the 1980s with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.

Boulez composed significantly more during this period, producing a series of pieces which used the potential, developed at IRCAM, electronically to transform sound in real time. The first of these was &quot;Répons&quot; (1981–1984), a 40-minute work for soloists, ensemble and electronics. He also radically reworked earlier pieces, including &quot;Notations I-IV&quot;, a transcription and expansion for large orchestra of tiny piano pieces (1945–1980), and his cantata on poems by Char, &quot;Le Visage nuptial&quot; (1946–1989).

From 1976 to 1995, he held the Chair in &quot;Invention, technique et langage en musique&quot; at the Collège de France. In 1988 he made a series of six programmes for French television, &quot;Boulez XXe siècle&quot;, each of which focused on a specific aspect of contemporary music (rhythm, timbre, form etc.)

===1992–2006: Return to conducting===
In 1992, Boulez gave up the directorship of IRCAM and was succeeded by Laurent Bayle. He was composer in residence at that year&#x27;s Salzburg Festival.

The previous year he began a series of annual residencies with the Cleveland Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1995 he was named principal guest conductor in Chicago, a post he held until 2005, when he became conductor emeritus. His 70th birthday in 1995 was marked by a six-month retrospective tour with the London Symphony Orchestra, taking in Paris, Vienna, New York and Tokyo. In 2001 he conducted a major Bartók cycle with the Orchestre de Paris.

This period also marked a return to the opera house, including two productions with Peter Stein: Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1992, Welsh National Opera and Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris); and Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; (1995, Dutch National Opera and Salzburg Festival). In 2004 and 2005 he returned to Bayreuth to conduct a controversial new production of &quot;Parsifal&quot; directed by Christoph Schlingensief.

His two most substantial compositions from this period are &quot;...explosante-fixe...&quot; (1993), which had its origins in 1972 as a tribute to Stravinsky and which again used the electronic resources of IRCAM, and &quot;sur Incises&quot; (1998), for which he was awarded the 2001 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition.

Boulez continued to work on institutional organisation. He co-founded the Cité de la musique, which opened in La Villette on the outskirts of Paris in 1995. Consisting of a modular concert hall, museum and mediatheque—with the Conservatoire de Paris on an adjacent site—it became the home to the Ensemble intercontemporain and attracted a diverse audience. In 2004, he co-founded the Lucerne Festival Academy, an orchestral institute for young musicians, dedicated to music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For the next ten years he spent the last three weeks of summer working with young composers and conducting concerts with the Academy&#x27;s orchestra.

===2006–2016: Last years===
Boulez&#x27;s last major work was &quot;Dérive 2&quot; (2006), a 45-minute piece for eleven instruments. He left several compositional projects unfinished, including the remaining &quot;Notations&quot; for orchestra.

He remained active as a conductor over the next six years. In 2007 he was re-united with Chéreau for a production of Janáček&#x27;s &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot; (Theater an der Wien, Amsterdam and Aix). In April that year, as part of the Festtage in Berlin, Boulez and Daniel Barenboim gave a cycle of the Mahler symphonies with the Staatskapelle Berlin, which they repeated two years later at Carnegie Hall. In late 2007 the Orchestre de Paris and the Ensemble intercontemporain presented a retrospective of Boulez&#x27;s music and in 2008 the Louvre mounted the exhibition &quot;Pierre Boulez, Œuvre: fragment&quot;.

His appearances became more infrequent after an eye operation in 2010 left him with severely impaired sight. Other health problems included a shoulder injury resulting from a fall. In late 2011, when he was already quite frail, he led the combined Ensemble intercontemporain and Lucerne Festival Academy, with the soprano Barbara Hannigan, in a tour of six European cities of his own &quot;Pli selon pli&quot;. His final appearance as a conductor was in Salzburg on 28 January 2012 with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Mitsuko Uchida in a programme of Schoenberg (&quot;Begleitungsmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene&quot; and the Piano Concerto), Mozart (Piano Concerto No.19 in F major K459) and Stravinsky (&quot;Pulcinella Suite&quot;). Thereafter he cancelled all conducting engagements.

In mid-2012 Boulez was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, probably a form of Parkinson&#x27;s. Later that year, he worked with the Diotima Quartet, making final revisions to his only string quartet, &quot;Livre pour quatuor&quot;, begun in 1948. In 2013 he oversaw the release on Deutsche Grammophon of &quot;Pierre Boulez: Complete Works&quot;, a 13-CD survey of all his authorised compositions. He made his last public appearance on 30 May 2013 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, discussing Stravinsky with Robert Piencikowski, to mark the centenary of the premiere of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. 

From 2014 he scarcely left his home in Baden-Baden. His health prevented him from taking part in the many celebrations held across the world for his 90th birthday in 2015, which included a multi-media exhibition at the Musée de la Musique in Paris, focusing on the inspiration he had drawn from literature and the visual arts.
Boulez died at home on 5 January 2016. He was buried on 13 January in Baden-Baden&#x27;s main cemetery following a private funeral service at the town&#x27;s Stiftskirche. At a memorial service the next day at the Saint-Sulpice in Paris, eulogists included Barenboim, Renzo Piano, and Laurent Bayle, then president of the Philharmonie de Paris, whose large concert hall had been inaugurated the previous year, thanks in part to Boulez&#x27;s influence.

==Compositions==
===Juvenilia and student works===

Boulez&#x27;s earliest surviving compositions date from his school days in 1942–43, mostly songs on texts by Baudelaire, Gautier and Rilke. Gerald Bennett describes the pieces as &quot;modest, delicate and rather anonymous [employing] a certain number of standard elements of French salon music of the time—whole-tone scales, pentatonic scales and polytonality&quot;.

As a student at the Conservatoire Boulez composed a series of pieces influenced first by Honegger and Jolivet (&quot;Prelude, Toccata and Scherzo&quot; and &quot;Nocturne&quot; for solo piano (1944–45)) and then by Messiaen (&quot;Trois psalmodies&quot; for piano (1945) and a Quartet for four ondes Martenot (1945–46)). The encounter with Schoenberg—through his studies with Leibowitz—was the catalyst for his first piece of serial music, the &quot;Thème et variations&quot; for piano, left hand (1945). Peter O&#x27;Hagan describes it as &quot;his boldest and most ambitious work to date&quot;.
===&quot;Douze notations&quot; and the work in progress===
Boulez completed &quot;Douze notations&quot; in December 1945. It is in these twelve aphoristic pieces for piano, each twelve bars long, that Bennett first detects the influence of Webern. Shortly after the composition of the piano original, Boulez attempted an (unperformed and unpublished) orchestration of eleven of the pieces. Over a decade later he re-used two of them in instrumental interludes in his &quot;Improvisation I sur Mallarmé&quot;. Then in the mid-1970s he embarked on a further, more radical transformation of the &quot;Notations&quot; into extended works for very large orchestra, a project which occupied him to the end of his life.

&quot;Notations&quot; was only the most extreme example of Boulez&#x27;s tendency to revisit earlier works: &quot;as long as my ideas have not exhausted every possibility of proliferation they stay in my mind&quot;. Robert Piencikowski characterises this in part as &quot;an obsessional concern for perfection&quot; and observes that with some pieces &quot;one could speak of successive distinct versions, each one presenting a particular state of the musical material, without the successor invalidating the previous one or vice versa&quot;—although he notes that Boulez almost invariably vetoed the performance of previous versions.

===First published works===
The &quot;Sonatine&quot; for flute and piano (1946–1949) was the first work Boulez allowed to be published. A serial work of great energy, its single-movement form was influenced by Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony No. 1. Bennett finds in the piece a tone new to Boulez&#x27;s writing: &quot;a sharp, brittle violence juxtaposed against an extreme sensitivity and delicacy&quot;. In the Piano Sonata No. 1 (1946–49) the biographer Dominique Jameux highlights the sheer number of different kinds of attack in its two short movements—and the frequent accelerations of tempo in the second movement—which together create a feeling of &quot;instrumental delirium&quot;.

There followed two cantatas based on the poetry of René Char. Of &quot;Le Visage nuptial&quot; Paul Griffiths observes that &quot;Char&#x27;s five poems speak in hard-edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion&quot;, which Boulez reflected in music &quot;on the borders of fevered hysteria&quot;. In its original version (1946–47) the piece was scored for small forces (soprano, contralto, two ondes Martenot, piano and percussion). Forty years later Boulez arrived at the definitive version for soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra (1985–1989). &quot;Le Soleil des eaux&quot; (1948) originated in incidental music for a radio drama by Char. It went through three further versions before reaching its final form in 1965 as a piece for soprano, mixed chorus and orchestra. The first movement (&quot;Complainte du lézard amoureux&quot;) is a love song addressed by a lizard to a goldfinch in the heat of a summer day; the second (&quot;La Sorgue&quot;) is a violent, incantatory protest against the pollution of the river Sorgue.

The Second Piano Sonata (1947–48) is a half-hour work which requires formidable technical prowess from the performer. Its four movements follow the standard pattern of a classical sonata but in each of them Boulez subverts the traditional model. For Griffiths the violent character of much of the music &quot;is not just superficial: it is expressive of … a need to obliterate what had gone before&quot;. Boulez played the work for Aaron Copland, who asked: &quot;But must we start a revolution all over again?&quot;—&quot;Yes, mercilessly&quot;, Boulez replied.

===Total serialism===
That revolution entered its most extreme phase in 1950–1952, when Boulez developed a technique in which not only pitch but other musical parameters—duration, dynamics, timbre and attack—were organised according to serial principles, an approach known as total serialism or punctualism. Messiaen had already made an experiment in this direction in his &quot;Mode de valeurs et d&#x27;intensités&quot; for piano (1949). Boulez&#x27;s first sketches towards total serialism appeared in parts of &quot;Livre pour quatuor&quot; (1948–49, revised 2011–12), a collection of movements for string quartet from which the players may choose at any one performance, foreshadowing Boulez&#x27;s later interest in variable form.

In the early 1950s Boulez began to apply the technique rigorously, ordering each parameter into sets of twelve and prescribing no repetition until all twelve had sounded. According to the music critic Alex Ross the resulting surfeit of ever-changing musical data has the effect of erasing at any given point previous impressions the listener may have formed: &quot;the present moment is all there is&quot;, Ross observed. Boulez linked this development to a desire by his generation to create a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; after the war.

His works in this idiom are &quot;Polyphonie X&quot; (195051; withdrawn) for 18 instruments, the two &quot;musique concrète&quot; &quot;études&quot; (1951–52; withdrawn), and &quot;Structures, Book I&quot; for two pianos (1951–52). Speaking of &quot;Structures, Book I&quot; in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which &quot;the responsibility of the composer is practically absent. Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made the piece that way. But I did it by hand...It was a demonstration through the absurd.&quot; Asked whether it should still be listened to as music, Boulez replied: &quot;I am not terribly eager to listen to it. But for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary.&quot;

===&quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot; and &quot;Pli selon pli&quot;===
&quot;Structures, Book I&quot; was a turning point for Boulez; from here on he loosened the strictness of total serialism into a more supple, gestural music: &quot;I am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos&quot;, he wrote to Cage. The most significant result of this new freedom was &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot; (1953–1955), described by Griffiths and Bill Hopkins as a &quot;keystone of twentieth-century music&quot;. Three short poems by Char are the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (one is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring. The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, xylorimba, vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, to which he had always been attracted.
For the text of his next major work, &quot;Pli selon pli&quot; (1957–1989), Boulez turned to the symbolist poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé, attracted by its extreme density and radical syntax. At seventy minutes, it is his longest composition. Three &quot;Improvisations&quot; on individual sonnets are framed by two orchestral movements, into which fragments of other poems are embedded. Boulez&#x27;s word-setting, which in the first &quot;Improvisation&quot; is straightforwardly syllabic, becomes ever more melismatic, to the point where the words cannot be distinguished. Boulez&#x27;s stated aim was to make the sonnets &quot;become&quot; the music at a deeper, structural level. The piece is scored for soprano and large orchestra, often deployed in chamber groups. Boulez described its sound-world, rich in percussion, as &quot;not so much frozen as extraordinarily &#x27;vitrified. The work had a complex genesis, reaching its definitive form in 1989.

===Controlled chance===
From the 1950s Boulez experimented with what he called &quot;controlled chance&quot;. In his article &quot;Sonate, que me veux-tu?&quot;, he wrote of &quot;the investigation of a relative world, a permanent &#x27;discovering&#x27; rather like the state of &#x27;permanent revolution.

Peyser observes that Boulez&#x27;s use of chance is different from John Cage&#x27;s. In Cage&#x27;s music the performers are often free to create unforeseen sounds, with the aim of removing the composer&#x27;s intention from the music; in Boulez&#x27;s music they choose between possibilities that have been written out by the composer. When applied to the order of sections, this is sometimes described as &quot;mobile form&quot;, a technique devised by Earle Brown, who was inspired by the mobile sculptures of Alexander Calder, whom Boulez met when he was visiting New York in 1952.

Boulez employed variants of the technique in several works over the next two decades: in the Third Piano Sonata (1955–1957, revised 1963) the pianist chooses different routes through the score and in one movement (&quot;Trope&quot;) has the option of omitting certain passages altogether; in &quot;Éclat&quot; (1965), the conductor triggers the order in which each player joins the ensemble; in &quot;Domaines&quot; (1961–1968) it is the soloist who dictates the order in which the sections are played by his movement around the stage. In later works, such as &quot;Cummings ist der Dichter&quot; (1970, revised 1986)—a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by E. E. Cummings—the conductor chooses the order of certain events but there is no freedom for the individual player. In its original version &quot;Pli selon pli&quot; also contained elements of choice for the instrumentalists, but much of this was eliminated in later revisions.

By contrast &quot;Figures—Doubles—Prismes&quot; (1957–1968) is a fixed work with no chance element. Piencikowski describes it as &quot;a great cycle of variations whose components interpenetrate each other instead of remaining isolated in the traditional manner&quot;. It is notable for the unusual layout of the orchestra, in which the various families of instruments (woodwind, brass etc.) are scattered across the stage rather than being grouped together.

===Middle-period works===
Jonathan Goldman identifies a major aesthetic shift in Boulez&#x27;s work from the mid-1970s onwards, characterised variously by the presence of thematic writing, a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form. Boulez himself said: &quot;the &quot;envelope&quot; is simpler. The contents are not ... I think in my recent work it is true that the first approach is more direct, and the gesture is more obvious, let&#x27;s say.&quot;

For Goldman, &quot;Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna&quot; (1974–75) marks the beginning of this development. Boulez wrote this twenty-five minute work as an epitaph for his friend and colleague, the Italian composer and conductor, who died in 1973 aged 53. The piece is divided into fifteen sections, the orchestra into eight groups. The odd-numbered sections are conducted; in the even-numbered sections the conductor merely sets each group in motion and its progress is regulated by a percussionist beating time. In his dedication Boulez described the work as &quot;a ritual of disappearance and survival&quot;; Griffiths refers to the work&#x27;s &quot;awesome grandeur&quot;.

&quot;Notations I–IV&quot; (1980) are the first four transformations of piano miniatures from 1945 into pieces for very large orchestra. In his review of the New York premiere, Andrew Porter wrote that the single idea of each original piece &quot;has, as it were, been passed through a many-faceted bright prism and broken into a thousand linked, lapped, sparkling fragments&quot;, the finale &quot;a terse modern &quot;Rite&quot; ... which sets the pulses racing&quot;.

&quot;Dérive 1&quot; (1984), dedicated to William Glock on his retirement from the Bath Festival, is a short quintet in which the piano takes the lead. The material is derived from six chords and, according to Ivan Hewett, the piece &quot;shuffles and decorates these chords, bursting outwards in spirals and eddies, before returning to its starting point&quot;. At the end the music &quot;shivers into silence&quot;.

===Works with electronics===
Boulez compared the experience of listening to pre-recorded electronic music in the concert hall to a crematorium ceremony. His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of instrumental sounds but the technology was not available until the founding of IRCAM in the 1970s. Before then he had produced &quot;Deux Etudes&quot; (1951) for magnetic tape for Pierre Schaeffer&#x27;s Groupe Recherche de la Radiodiffusion Française, as well as a large-scale piece for live orchestra with tape, &quot;Poésie pour pouvoir&quot; (1958). He was dissatisfied with both pieces and withdrew them.

The first piece completed at IRCAM was &quot;Répons&quot; (1980–1984). In this forty-minute work an instrumental group is placed in the middle of the hall, while six soloists surround the audience: two pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone and glockenspiel/xylophone. It is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through the space. Peter Heyworth described the moment when they enter, some ten minutes into the piece: &quot;it is as though a great window were thrown open, through which a new sound world enters, and with it a new world of the imagination. Even more impressive is the fact that there is no longer a schism between the worlds of natural and electronic sounds, but rather a continuous spectrum.&quot;

&quot;Dialogue de l&#x27;ombre double&quot; (1982–1985) for clarinet and electronics grew out of a fragment of &quot;Domaines&quot; and was a gift for Luciano Berio on his 60th birthday. Lasting around eighteen minutes, it is a dialogue between a solo clarinet (played live, though sometimes reverberated through an offstage piano) and its double (in passages pre-recorded by the same musician and projected around the hall). Boulez approved transcriptions of the piece for bassoon (in 1995) and for recorder (in 2011).

In the early 1970s he had worked on an extended chamber piece called &quot;…explosante-fixe…&quot; for eight solo instruments, electronically transformed by a machine called a halophone, but the technology was primitive and he eventually withdrew it. He re-used some of its material in other works, including a later piece with the same name. This definitive version was composed at IRCAM between 1991 and 1993 for MIDI-flute and two accompanying flutes with ensemble and live electronics. By this time the computer could follow the score and respond to triggers from the players. According to Griffiths, &quot;the principal flute is caught as if in a hall of mirrors, its line imitated in what the other flutes play, and then in the contributions of the larger ensemble&quot;. Hopkins and Griffiths describe it as &quot;music characteristically caught between thrill and desperation&quot;.

&quot;Anthèmes II&quot; for violin and electronics (1997) grew out of a piece for solo violin &quot;Anthèmes I&quot; (1991), which Boulez wrote for the Yehudi Menuhin Violin Competition in Paris and which in turn derived from material in the original &quot;…explosante-fixe…&quot; The virtuoso writing for the instrument is captured by the electronic system, transformed in real time and propelled around the space to create what Jonathan Goldman calls a &quot;hyper-violin&quot;. Although this produces effects of speed and complexity which no violinist could achieve, Boulez restricts the palette of electronic sounds so that their source, the violin, is always recognisable.

===Last works===
In later works Boulez relinquished electronics, although Griffiths suggests that in &quot;sur Incises&quot; (1996–1998) the choice of like but distinct instruments, spread across the platform, enabled Boulez to create effects of harmonic, timbral and spatial echo for which he previously used electronic means. The piece is scored for three pianos, three harps and three percussionists (including steel drums) and grew out of &quot;Incises&quot; (1993–2001), a short piece written for a piano competition. In an interview in 2013 he described it as his most important work—&quot;because it is the freest&quot;.

&quot;Notation VII&quot; (1999), marked &quot;hieratic&quot; in the score, is the longest of the orchestral &quot;Notations&quot;. According to Griffiths: &quot;what was abrupt in 1945 is now languorous; what was crude is now done with a lifetime&#x27;s experience and expertise; what was simple is fantastically embellished, even submerged.&quot;

&quot;Dérive 2&quot; started out in 1988 as a five-minute piece, dedicated to Elliott Carter on his 80th birthday; by 2006 it was a 45-minute work for eleven instruments and Boulez&#x27;s last major composition. According to Claude Samuel, Boulez wanted to explore rhythmic shifts, tempo changes and superimpositions of different speeds, inspired in part by his contact with the music of György Ligeti. Boulez described it as &quot;a sort of narrative mosaic&quot;.

===Unfinished works===
Boulez&#x27;s unfinished works include several that he was actively progressing, and others which he put to one side despite their potential for further development. In the latter category, the archives contain three unpublished movements of the Third Piano Sonata and further sections of &quot;Éclat/Multiples&quot; which, if performed, would practically double its length.

Regarding works Boulez was known to be working on in his later years, the premieres of two more orchestral &quot;Notations&quot; (&quot;V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;) were announced by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for May 2006, but postponed. He was in the process of developing &quot;Anthèmes 2&quot; into a large-scale work for violin and orchestra for Anne-Sophie Mutter, but the project did not come to fruition.
From the mid-1960s, Boulez also spoke of composing an opera. His attempts to find a librettist were unsuccessful: &quot;both times the writer has died on me, so I&#x27;m a bit superstitious about looking for a third candidate&quot;. From the late 1960s he exchanged ideas with the radical French playwright and novelist Jean Genet and a subject—treason—was agreed on. Parts of a draft libretto were found among Genet&#x27;s papers after his death in 1986. Boulez later turned to the German playwright Heiner Müller, who was working on a reduction of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Oresteia&quot; when he died in 1995, again without leaving anything usable. In the 1980s he discussed with Patrice Chéreau an adaptation of Genet&#x27;s 1961 play &quot;Les Paravents&quot; (&quot;The Screens&quot;), which was planned for the 1989 opening of the Opéra Bastille in Paris, but this too came to nothing. In a 1996 interview Boulez said that he was thinking of Edward Bond&#x27;s &quot;The War Plays&quot; or &quot;Lear&quot;, &quot;but only thinking&quot;. When news emerged in 2010 that, at the age of 85, he was working on an opera based on Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, few believed such an ambitious undertaking could be realised so late in the day.

==Conducting==

===Approach to conducting===
Boulez was one of the leading conductors of the second half of the twentieth century. In a career lasting more than sixty years he directed most of the world&#x27;s major orchestras. He was entirely self-taught, although he said that he learnt a great deal from attending Désormière&#x27;s and Hans Rosbaud&#x27;s rehearsals. He also cited George Szell as an influential mentor.
Boulez gave several reasons for conducting as much as he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine musical because its financial resources were limited: &quot;I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself.&quot; He also said that the best possible training for a composer was &quot;to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution&quot;—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose given his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: &quot;Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it.&quot;

Not everyone agreed about the greatness of that gift. According to writer Hans Keller: &quot;Boulez cannot phrase – it is as simple as that...the reason being that he ignores the harmonic implications of any structure he is dealing with, to the extent of utterly disregarding harmonic rhythm and hence all characteristic rhythm in tonal music...&quot; Joan Peyser considered that: &quot;in general Boulez conducts what he loves magnificently, conducts what he likes very well and, with rare exceptions, gives stiff performances of the classic and romantic repertoire&quot;. The conductor Otto Klemperer described him as &quot;without doubt the only man of his generation who is an outstanding conductor &quot;and&quot; musician&quot;.

He worked with many leading soloists and had particularly long-term collaborations with Daniel Barenboim and with the soprano Jessye Norman.

According to Peter Heyworth, Boulez produced a lean, athletic sound which, underpinned by his rhythmic exactitude, could generate an electric sense of excitement. The ability to reveal the structure of a score and to clarify dense orchestral textures were hallmarks of his conducting. He conducted without a baton and, as Heyworth observed: &quot;there is no trace of theatre—not even the rather theatrical sort of economy that was practised by Richard Strauss&quot;. According to Boulez: &quot;outward excitement uses up inner excitement&quot;.

Boulez&#x27;s ear for sound was legendary: &quot;there are countless stories of him detecting, for example, faulty intonation from the third oboe in a complex orchestral texture&quot;, Paul Griffiths wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Oliver Knussen, himself a well-known composer-conductor, observed that &quot;his rehearsals are models of clear-headedness and professional courtesy—he effortlessly commands respect&quot;.

===Work in the opera house===

Boulez also conducted in the opera house. His chosen repertoire was small and included no Italian opera. Apart from Wagner, he conducted only twentieth-century works. Of his work with Wieland Wagner on &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Boulez said: &quot;I would willingly have hitched, if not my entire fate, then at least a part of it, to someone like him, for [our] discussions about music and productions were thrilling.&quot; They planned other productions together, including Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot;, Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. However, by the time rehearsals for their Bayreuth &quot;Parsifal&quot; began Wieland was already gravely ill and he died in October 1966.

When the Frankfurt &quot;Wozzeck&quot; was revived after Wieland&#x27;s death, Boulez was deeply disillusioned by the working conditions: &quot;there was no rehearsal, no care taken over anything. The cynicism of the way an opera house like that was run disgusted me. It still disgusts me.&quot; He later said that it was this experience which prompted his notorious remarks in an interview the following year in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, in which he claimed that &quot;no opera worth mentioning had been composed since 1935&quot;, that &quot;a Beatles record is certainly cleverer (and shorter) than a Henze opera&quot; and that &quot;the most elegant&quot; solution to opera&#x27;s moribund condition would be &quot;to blow the opera houses up&quot;.

In 1967, Boulez, theatre director Jean Vilar and choreographer Maurice Béjart were asked to devise a scheme for the reform of the Paris Opéra, with a view to Boulez becoming its music director. Their plan was derailed by the political fallout from the 1968 student protests. In the mid-1980s, Boulez became vice president of the planned Opéra Bastille in Paris, working with Daniel Barenboim, who was to be its music director. In 1988 Pierre Bergé was appointed president of the Bastille opera. He dismissed Barenboim and Boulez withdrew in solidarity.

Boulez conducted only specific projects—in productions by leading stage directors—when he could be satisfied that conditions were right. Thanks to his years with the Renaud-Barrault company, the theatrical dimension was as important to him as the musical and he always attended staging rehearsals.

For the centenary &quot;Ring&quot; in Bayreuth, Boulez originally asked Ingmar Bergman then Peter Brook to direct, both of whom refused. Peter Stein initially agreed but withdrew in 1974. Patrice Chéreau, who was primarily a theatre director, accepted and went on to create one of the defining opera productions of modern times. According to Allan Kozinn the production &quot;helped open the floodgates of directorial reinterpretation of opera&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Regietheater&quot;). Chéreau treated the story in part as an allegory of capitalism, drawing on ideas that George Bernard Shaw explored in &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot; in 1898, and using imagery from the Industrial Age; he achieved an exceptional degree of naturalism in the singers&#x27; performances. Boulez&#x27;s conducting was no less controversial, emphasising continuity, flexibility and transparency over mythic grandeur and weight. In its first year the production met with hostility from the largely conservative audience, and around thirty orchestral musicians refused to work with Boulez in subsequent seasons. Both production and musical realisation grew in stature over the following four years and after the final performance in 1980 there was a 90-minute ovation.

===Recording===
Boulez&#x27;s first recordings date from his time with the Domaine musical in the late 1950s and early 1960s and were made for the French Vega label. They include the first of his five recordings of &quot;Le Marteau sans maître&quot; (with contralto Marie-Thérèse Cahn), as well as pieces to which he did not return in the studio (such as Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Renard&quot; and Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot;). In 2015 Universal Music brought these recordings together in a 10-CD set.

Between 1966 and 1989 he recorded for Columbia Records (later Sony Classical). Among the first projects were the Paris &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (with Walter Berry) and the Covent Garden &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (with George Shirley and Elisabeth Söderström). He made a highly praised recording of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; with the Cleveland Orchestra and supervised a Webern edition, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. He also produced a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and recorded the orchestral works of Ravel with the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland Orchestra. As for Boulez&#x27;s own music, in 1969 he made the first recording of &quot;Pli selon pli&quot; (with Halina Łukomska as soprano soloist) and recordings of &quot;Rituel&quot; and &quot;Éclat/Multiples&quot;. In 2014 Sony Classical issued &quot;Pierre Boulez—The Complete Columbia Album Collection&quot; on 67 CDs.

Three operatic projects from this period were picked up by other labels: the Bayreuth &quot;Ring&quot; was released on video and LP by Philips; the Bayreuth &quot;Parsifal&quot; and Paris &quot;Lulu&quot; were recorded for Deutsche Grammophon. For EMI in 1984 he recorded several pieces on Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;The Perfect Stranger&quot; with the Ensemble intercontemporain.

In the 1980s, Boulez also recorded for the Erato label, mostly with the Ensemble intercontemporain, with a greater emphasis on the music of his contemporaries such as Berio, Ligeti and Carter, as well as a survey of some of his own music, including &quot;Le Visage nuptial&quot;, &quot;Le Soleil des eaux&quot; and &quot;Figures—Doubles—Prismes&quot;. In 2015 Erato issued &quot;Pierre Boulez—The Complete Erato Recordings&quot; on 14 CDs. 

From 1991 onwards, Boulez recorded under an exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon. It centred on the orchestras of Chicago and Cleveland in the United States and Vienna and Berlin in Europe. He re-recorded much of his core repertoire and oversaw a second Webern edition, including the unpublished works. His own late music featured prominently, including &quot;Répons&quot;, &quot;...explosante-fixe...&quot; and &quot;sur Incises&quot;. The most significant addition to his recorded repertoire was the multi-orchestra cycle of the Mahler symphonies and vocal works with orchestra. An 88-disc set of all Boulez&#x27;s recordings for Deutsche Grammophon, Philips and Decca was issued in 2022.

Many hundreds of concerts conducted by Boulez are held in the archives of radio stations and orchestras. In 2005 the Chicago Symphony Orchestra released a 2-CD set of broadcasts by Boulez, focusing on works which he had not recorded commercially, including Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot; and Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ascension&quot;.

==Writing and teaching==
According to Jean-Jacques Nattiez, Boulez was one of two twentieth-century composers who wrote most prolifically about music, the other being Schoenberg. It was with a 1952 article with the inflammatory title &quot;Schoenberg is Dead&quot;, published in the British journal &quot;The Score&quot; shortly after the older composer&#x27;s death, that Boulez first attracted international attention as a writer. This highly polemical piece, in which he attacked Schoenberg for his conservatism, contrasting it with Webern&#x27;s radicalism, caused widespread controversy.

Jonathan Goldman points out that, over the decades, Boulez&#x27;s writings addressed very different readerships: in the 1950s the cultured Parisian attendees of the Domaine musical; in the 1960s the specialised avant-garde composers and performers of the Darmstadt and Basel courses; and, between 1976 and 1995, the highly literate but non-specialist audience of the lectures he gave as Professor of the Collège de France. Much of Boulez&#x27;s writing was linked to specific occasions, whether a first performance of a new piece, notes for a recording or a eulogy for a lost colleague. Generally he avoided publishing detailed analyses, other than one of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. As Nattiez points out: &quot;as a writer Boulez is a communicator of ideas rather than of technical information. This may sometimes prove disappointing to composition students, but it is no doubt a peculiarity of his writing that explains its popularity with non-musicians.&quot;

Boulez&#x27;s writings have appeared in English as &quot;Stocktakings from an Apprenticeship&quot;, &quot;Boulez on Music Today&quot;, &quot;Orientations: Collected Writings&quot; and &quot;Pierre Boulez, Music Lessons: The Complete Collège de France Lectures&quot;. Throughout his career he also expressed himself through long-form interviews, of which perhaps the most substantial are those with Antoine Goléa (1958), Célestin Deliège (1975) and Jean Vermeil (1989). Two volumes of correspondence have been published: with the composer John Cage (from the period 1949–62); and with the anthropologist and ethnomusicologist André Schaeffner (from 1954 to 1970).

Boulez taught at the Darmstadt Summer School most years between 1954 and 1965. He was professor of composition at the Basel Music Academy in Switzerland (1960–63) and a visiting lecturer at Harvard University in 1963. He also taught privately in the early part of his career. Students included the composers Richard Rodney Bennett, Jean-Claude Éloy and Heinz Holliger.

==Character and personal life==
As a young man Boulez was an explosive, often confrontational figure. Jean-Louis Barrault, who knew him in his twenties, caught the contradictions in his personality: &quot;his powerful aggressiveness was a sign of creative passion, a particular blend of intransigence and humour, the way his moods of affection and insolence succeeded one another, all these had drawn us near to him&quot;. Messiaen said later: &quot;He was in revolt against everything.&quot; At one point Boulez turned against Messiaen, describing his &quot;Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine&quot; as &quot;brothel music&quot; and saying that the &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; made him vomit. It was five years before relations were restored.

In a 2000 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Alex Ross described Boulez as a bully. Boulez did not disagree: &quot;Certainly I was a bully. I&#x27;m not ashamed of it at all. The hostility of the establishment to what you were able to do in the Forties and Fifties was very strong. Sometimes you have to fight against your society.&quot; One of the most notorious instance of this is Boulez&#x27;s declaration in 1952 that &quot;any musician who has not experienced‍—‌I do not say understood, but truly experienced‍—‌the necessity of dodecaphonic music is USELESS. For his whole work is irrelevant to the needs of his epoch.&quot;

Those who knew Boulez well often referred to his loyalty, both to individuals and to organisations. When his mentor, the conductor Roger Désormière, was paralysed by a stroke in 1952 Boulez sent scripts to French Radio in Désormière&#x27;s name so that the older man could collect the fee. The writer Jean Vermeil, who observed Boulez in the 1990s in the company of Jean Batigne (founder of the Percussions de Strasbourg), discovered &quot;a Boulez asking about the health of a musician in the Strasbourg orchestra, about another player&#x27;s children, a Boulez who knew everyone by name and who reacted to each person&#x27;s news with sadness or with joy&quot;. In later life, he was known for his charm and personal warmth. Of his humour, Gerard McBurney wrote that it &quot;depended on his twinkling eyes, his perfect timing, his infectious schoolboy giggle, and his reckless compulsion always to say what the other person would not expect&quot;.

Boulez read widely and identified Proust, Joyce and Kafka as particular influences. He had a lifelong interest in the visual arts. He wrote extensively about the painter Paul Klee and owned works by Joan Miró, Francis Bacon, Nicolas de Staël and Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, all of whom he knew personally. He also had close links with three of the leading philosophers of the time: Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes.

He was a keen walker and, when he was at home in Baden-Baden, spent the late afternoons and much of the weekends walking in the Black Forest. He owned an old farmhouse in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department of France and built another, modern home on the same land in the late 1970s.

In its obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;about his private life he remained tightly guarded&quot;. Boulez acknowledged to Joan Peyser that there was a passionate affair in 1946, described as &quot;intense and tormented&quot; and which Peyser suggested was the trigger for the &quot;wild, courageous works&quot; of that period. After Boulez&#x27;s death, his sister Jeanne told the biographer Christian Merlin that the affair was with the actress María Casares, but Merlin concludes that there is little evidence to support this. Merlin acknowledges the speculation that Boulez was gay. He writes that in 1972 Boulez engaged a young German, Hans Messner, as his personal assistant to look after the practicalities of his life. Messner, who called Boulez &#x27;Monsieur&#x27; and whom Boulez sometimes introduced as his valet, lived in the Baden-Baden house until the end of Boulez&#x27;s life and usually accompanied him when he travelled abroad. Although Merlin observes that in later years it was sometimes difficult to tell whether Messner was looking after Boulez or the other way round, his view is that there is no evidence that they were ever life partners. Towards the end of Boulez&#x27;s life, Messner blocked Boulez&#x27;s sister Jeanne from visiting the house. He was with Boulez when he died. 

In his portrait for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, published shortly after Boulez&#x27;s death under the title &quot;The Magus&quot;, Alex Ross described Boulez as &quot;affable, implacable, unknowable&quot;.

==Legacy==
In an article published for Boulez&#x27;s 80th birthday in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the composer George Benjamin wrote that &quot;Boulez has produced a catalogue of wondrously luminous and scintillating works. Within them a rigorous compositional skill is coupled to an imagination of extraordinary aural refinement&quot;. By contrast, John Adams described Boulez as &quot;a mannerist, a niche composer, a master who worked with a very small hammer&quot;. In a piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to mark Boulez&#x27;s 90th birthday, Nico Muhly emphasised what he called the decadent qualities of Boulez&#x27;s later music: &quot;You can feel the butter swirling in that pan. And when he conducts it, he teases out these luxurious textures.&quot;

In 1986 Boulez entered into an agreement to place his musical and literary manuscripts with the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. When he died in January 2016, he left no will. In 2017, the Bibliothèque nationale de France announced that his estate had made a substantial donation of private papers and possessions not covered by the Sacher contract, including 220 metres of books, 50 metres of archives and correspondence, as well as scores, photographs, recordings and about 100 other objects.
In October 2016, the large concert hall of the Philharmonie de Paris, for which Boulez campaigned for many years, was renamed the Grande salle Pierre Boulez. In March 2017, a new concert hall, the Pierre Boulez Saal, designed by Frank Gehry, was opened in Berlin under the auspices of the Barenboim–Said Academy. It is home to a new Boulez Ensemble, made up of members of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Berlin Staatskapelle and guest musicians from Berlin and around the world.

Boulez&#x27;s music continues to be taken up by interpreters of the next generation. In September 2018 the first edition of the Pierre Boulez Biennial took place in Paris and Berlin, a joint initiative by the Philharmonie de Paris and the Staatskapelle Berlin under Daniel Barenboim, in which performances of Boulez&#x27;s music are set in the context of works which influenced him. The second Biennial was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, but a modified version went ahead (online in 2020, in person in 2021), with a particular focus on the piano music. The third iteration took place in April/May 2023.

The centenary in 2025 of Boulez&#x27;s birth will be marked by concerts, exhibitions and other events. The Philharmonie de Paris is presenting a series of concerts featuring his music; it began with a programme of &quot;Répons&quot; and other works, played by the Ensemble intercontemporain, joined by former members, the cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras and the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard. In its 2024/2025 season, the New York Philharmonic will present two concerts - one of which will be a recreation of a Boulez programme from 1974 - and an exhibition. On 26 March 2025 (the anniversary date), as part of a &#x27;Total Immersion Day&#x27; at the Barbican in London, the BBC Symphony Orchestra will present performances including the complete &quot;Pli selon pli&quot;, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, interspersed with films and talks with people who worked with Boulez. In May, Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in programmes which will include performances of &quot;Rituel&quot;, presented in collaboration with LA Dance Project and choreographer Benjamin Millepied. In August, the Lucerne Summer Festival will feature a rare performance of &quot;Poésie pour pouvoir&quot; for tape and three orchestras (conducted by David Robertson), as well as &quot;Répons&quot;, &quot;Figures-Doubles-Prismes&quot; and other works. Other series and individual concerts will be presented across the year by the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin, the Festspielhaus in Baden-Baden, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic.

<doc id="66599" wikidata="Q92251" url="?curid=66599" title="Noise pollution">
<text>Noise pollution, or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise or sound with potential harmful effects on humans and animals. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and propagation systems. Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial, and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, wind turbines, explosions, and people.

Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome. Research suggests that noise pollution in the United States is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods, and noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations.

High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease. In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss.

==Noise assessment==

===Metrics of noise===

Researchers measure noise in terms of pressure, intensity, and frequency. Sound pressure level (SPL) represents the amount of pressure relative to atmospheric pressure during sound wave propagation that can vary with time; this is also known as the sum of the amplitudes of a wave. Sound intensity, measured in Watts per meters-squared, represents the flow of sound over a particular area. Although sound pressure and intensity differ, both can describe the level of loudness by comparing the current state to the threshold of hearing; this results in decibel units on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale accommodates the vast range of sound heard by the human ear. 

Frequency, or pitch, is measured in Hertz (Hz) and reflects the number of sound waves propagated through the air per second. The range of frequencies heard by the human ear range from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz; however, sensitivity to hearing higher frequencies decreases with age. Some organisms, such as elephants, can register frequencies between 0 and 20 Hz (infrasound), and others, such as bats, can recognize frequencies above 20,000 Hz (ultrasound) to echolocate.

Researchers use different weights to account for noise frequency with intensity, as humans do not perceive sound at the same loudness level. The most commonly used weighted levels are A-weighting, C-weighting, and Z-weighting. A-weighting mirrors the range of hearing, with frequencies of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This gives more weight to higher frequencies and less weight to lower frequencies. C-weighting has been used to measure peak sound pressure or impulse noise, similar to loud short-lived noises from machinery in occupational settings. Z-weighting, also known as zero-weighting, represents noise levels without any frequency weights.

Understanding sound pressure levels is key to assessing measurements of noise pollution. Several metrics describing noise exposure include:

* Energy average equivalent level of the A-weighted sound, LAeq: This measures the average sound energy over a given period for constant or continuous noise, such as road traffic. LAeq can be further broken up into different types of noise based on time of day; however, cutoffs for evening and nighttime hours may differ between countries, with the United States, Belgium, and New Zealand noting evening hours from 19:00–22:00 or 7:00 p.m.–10:00 p.m. and nighttime hours from 22:00–7:00 or 10:00 p.m.–7:00 a.m. and most European countries noting evening hours from 19:00–23:00 or 7:00 p.m.–11:00 p.m. and nighttime hours from 23:00–7:00 or 11:00 p.m.–7:00 a.m.). LAeq terms include:
** Day-night average level, DNL or LDN: This measurement assesses the cumulative exposure to sound for a 24-hour period (Leq over 24 hrs) of the year, with a 10 dB(A) penalty or weight added to nighttime noise measurements given the increased sensitivity to noise at night. This is calculated from the following equation (United States, Belgium, New Zealand): formula_1
**Day-evening-night average level, DENL or Lden: This measurement, commonly used in European countries, assesses the 24-hour average in a year (similar to DNL); however, this measurement separates evening (4 hours, 19:00–23:00 or 7:00pm–11:00pm) from night hours (8 hours, 23:00–7:00 or 11:00 p.m.–7:00 a.m.) and adds a 5 dB penalty to evening and 10 dB penalty to nighttime hours. This is calculated from the following equation (most of Europe): formula_2
**Daytime level, LAeqD, or Lday: This measurement assesses daytime noise, usually from 7:00–19:00 (7 a.m.–7 p.m.), yet may vary by country.
**Nighttime level, LAeqN, or Lnight: This measurement assesses nighttime noise, depending on country cutoff hours discussed above.
*Maximum level, LAmax: This measurement represents the maximal noise level when examining point sources or single events of noise; however, this value does not factor in duration of the event.
* Sound exposure level of A-weighted sound, SEL: This measurement represents the total energy for a particular event. SEL is used to describe discrete events in terms of A-weighted sound. The difference between SEL and LAmax is that SEL is derived using multiple time points of a particular event in calculating sound levels rather than the peak value.
*Percentile-derived measurements (L10, L50, L90, etc.): Noise may be described in terms of its statistical distribution over a set time, in which investigators may obtain values, or cut-points, at any percentile level. The L90 is the sound level that exceeds 90% of the time period; this is commonly referred to as background noise.
Researchers with the US National Park Service found that human activity doubles the background-noise levels in 63 percent of protected spaces like national parks, and increases them tenfold in 21 percent. In the latter places, &quot;if you could have heard something 100 feet away, now you can only hear it 10 feet away&quot;.

===Instrumentation===
====Sound level meters====
Sound can be measured in the air using a sound level meter, a device consisting of a microphone, an amplifier, and a time meter. Sound level meters can measure noise at different frequencies (usually A- and C-weighted levels). There are two settings for response time constants, fast (time constant = 0.125 seconds, similar to human hearing) or slow (1 second, used for calculating averages over widely varying sound levels). Sound level meters meet the required standards set by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and in the United States, the American National Standards Institute as type 0, 1, or 2 instruments.

Type 0 devices are not required to meet the same criteria expected of types 1 and 2 since scientists use these as laboratory reference standards. Type 1 (precision) instruments are to study the precision of capturing sound measurements, while type 2 instruments are for general field use. Type 1 devices acceptable by the standards have a margin of error of ±1.5 dB, while type 2 instruments meet a margin of error of ±2.3 dB.

====Dosimeters====
Sound can also be measured using a noise dosimeter, a device similar to a sound level meter. Individuals have used dosimeters to measure personal exposure levels in occupational settings given their smaller, more portable size. Unlike many sound level meters, a dosimeter microphone attaches to the worker and monitors levels throughout a work shift. Additionally, dosimeters can calculate the percent dose or time-weighted average (TWA).

====Smartphone applications====
In recent years, scientists and audio engineers have been developing smartphone apps to conduct sound measurements, similar to the standalone sound level meters and dosimeters. In 2014, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study examining the efficacy of 192 sound measurement apps on Apple and Android smartphones.

The authors found that only 10 apps, all of which were on the App Store, met all acceptability criteria. Of these 10 apps, only 4 apps met accuracy criteria within 2 dB(A) from the reference standard. As a result of this study, they created the NIOSH Sound Level Meter App to increase accessibility and decrease costs of monitoring noise using crowdsourcing data with a tested and highly accurate application. The app is compliant with ANSI S1.4 and IEC 61672 requirements.

The app calculates the following measures: total run time, instantaneous sound level, A-weighted equivalent sound level (LAeq), maximum level (LAmax), C-weighted peak sound level, time-weighted average (TWA), dose, and projected dose. Dose and projected dose are based on sound level and duration of noise exposure in relation to the NIOSH recommended exposure limit of 85 dB(A) for an eight-hour work shift.

Using the phone&#x27;s internal microphone (or an attached external microphone), the NIOSH Sound Level Meter measures instantaneous sound levels in real time and converts sound into electrical energy to calculate measurements in A-, C-, or Z-weighted decibels. App users are able to generate, save, and e-mail measurement reports. The NIOSH Sound Level Meter is currently only available on Apple iOS devices.

==Impacts==
===Human health===
Noise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can damage physiological health and mental health. Noise pollution is associated with several health conditions, including cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects. According to a research article, the exposure of sound level more than 81 dB inreased the chances of prehypertension and hypertension in local population of Pakistan. According to a 2019 review of the existing literature, noise pollution was associated with faster cognitive decline.

Across Europe, according to the European Environment Agency, it estimated 113 million people are affected by road traffic noise levels above 55 decibels, the threshold at which noise becomes harmful to human health by the WHO&#x27;s definition.

Sound becomes unwanted when it either interferes with normal activities such as sleep or conversation, or disrupts or diminishes one&#x27;s quality of life. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by prolonged exposure to noise levels above 85 A-weighted decibels. A comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.

Noise exposure in the workplace can also contribute to noise-induced hearing loss and other health issues. Occupational hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses in the U.S. and worldwide.

It is less clear how humans adapt to noise subjectively. Tolerance for noise is frequently independent of decibel levels. Murray Schafer&#x27;s soundscape research was groundbreaking in this regard. In his work, he makes compelling arguments about how humans relate to noise on a subjective level, and how such subjectivity is conditioned by culture. Schafer notes that sound is an expression of power in material culture. As such, fast cars or Harley Davidson motorcycles with aftermarket pipes tend to have louder engines not only for safety reasons, but for expressions of power by dominating the soundscape with a particular sound.

Other key research in this area can be seen in Fong&#x27;s comparative analysis of soundscape differences between Bangkok, Thailand, and Los Angeles, California, US. Based on Schafer&#x27;s research, Fong&#x27;s study showed how soundscapes differ based on the level of urban development in the area. He found that cities in the periphery have different soundscapes than inner city areas. Fong&#x27;s findings tie not only soundscape appreciation to subjective views of sound, but also demonstrates how different sounds of the soundscape are indicative of class differences in urban environments.

Noise pollution can have negative affects on adults and children on the autistic spectrum. Those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can have hyperacusis, which is an abnormal sensitivity to sound. People with ASD who experience hyperacusis may have unpleasant emotions, such as fear and anxiety, and uncomfortable physical sensations in noisy environments with loud sounds. This can cause individuals with ASD to avoid environments with noise pollution, which in turn can result in isolation and negatively affect their quality of life. Sudden explosive noises typical of high-performance car exhausts and car alarms are types of noise pollution that can affect people with ASD.

While the elderly may have cardiac problems due to noise, according to the World Health Organization, children are especially vulnerable to noise, and the effects that noise has on children may be permanent. Noise poses a serious threat to a child&#x27;s physical and psychological health, and may negatively interfere with a child&#x27;s learning and behavior. Exposure to persistent noise pollution shows how important maintaining environmental health is in keeping children and elderly healthy.

===Wildlife===
Noise generated by traffic, ships, vehicles, and aircraft can affect the survivability of wildlife species and can reach undisturbed habitats. Although sounds are commonly present in the environment, anthropogenic noises are distinguishable due to differences in frequency and amplitude. Many animals use sounds to communicate with others of their species, whether that is for reproduction purposes, navigation, or to notify others of prey or predators. However, anthropogenic noises inhibit species from detecting these sounds, affecting overall communication within the population. Species such as birds, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, mammals, and invertebrates are examples of biological groups that are impacted by noise pollution. If animals cannot communicate with one another, this would result in reproduction to decline (not able to find mates), and higher mortality (lack of communication for predator detection). The study of these relationships between acoustic organisms, the acoustic environment, and resulting impacts is known as soundscape ecology or acoustic ecology. 

European robins living in urban environments are more likely to sing at night in places with high levels of noise pollution during the day, suggesting that they sing at night because it is quieter, and their message can propagate through the environment more clearly. The same study showed that daytime noise was a stronger predictor of nocturnal singing than night-time light pollution, to which the phenomenon often is attributed. Anthropogenic noise reduced the species richness of birds found in Neotropical urban parks.

Zebra finches become less faithful to their partners when exposed to traffic noise. This could alter a population&#x27;s evolutionary trajectory by selecting traits, sapping resources normally devoted to other activities and thus leading to profound genetic and evolutionary consequences.

====Why invertebrates are affected====
Several reasons have been identified relating to hypersensitivity in invertebrates when exposed to anthropogenic noise. Invertebrates have evolved to pick up sound, and a large portion of their physiology is adapted for the purpose of detecting environmental vibrations. Antennae or hairs on the organism pick up particle motion. Anthropogenic noise created in the marine environment, such as pile driving and shipping, are picked up through particle motion; these activities exemplify near-field stimuli.

The ability to detect vibration through mechanosensory structures is most important in invertebrates and fish. Mammals, also, depend on pressure detector ears to perceive the noise around them. Therefore, it is suggested that marine invertebrates are likely perceiving the effects of noise differently than marine mammals. It is reported that invertebrates can detect a large range of sounds, but noise sensitivity varies substantially between each species. Generally, however, invertebrates depend on frequencies under 10 kHz. This is the frequency at which a great deal of ocean noise occurs.

Therefore, not only does anthropogenic noise often mask invertebrate communication, but it also negatively impacts other biological system functions through noise-induced stress.
Another one of the leading causes of noise effects in invertebrates is because sound is used in multiple behavioral contexts by many groups. This includes regularly sound produced or perceived in the context of aggression or predator avoidance. Invertebrates also utilize sound to attract or locate mates, and often employ sound in the courtship process.

====Stress recorded in physiological and behavioral responses====

Many of the studies that were conducted on invertebrate exposure to noise found that a physiological or behavioral response was triggered. Most of the time, this related to stress, and provided concrete evidence that marine invertebrates detect and respond to noise. Some of the most informative studies in this category focus on hermit crabs. In one study, it was found that the behavior of the hermit crab &quot;Pagurus bernhardus&quot;, when attempting to choose a shell, was modified when subjected to noise.

Proper selection of hermit crab shells strongly contributes to their ability to survive. Shells offer protection against predators, high salinity and desiccation. However, researchers determined that approach to shell, investigation of shell, and habitation of shell, occurred over a shorter time duration with anthropogenic noise as a factor. This indicated that assessment and decision-making processes of the hermit crab were both altered, even though hermit crabs are not known to evaluate shells using any auditory or mechanoreception mechanisms.

In another study that focused on &quot;Pagurus bernhardus&quot; and the blue mussel (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;), physical behaviors exhibited a stress response to noise. When the hermit crab and mussel were exposed to different types of noise, significant variation in the valve gape occurred in the blue mussel. The hermit crab responded to the noise by lifting the shell off of the ground multiple times, then vacating the shell to examine it before returning inside. The results from the hermit crab trials were ambiguous with respect to causation; more studies must be conducted in order to determine whether the behavior of the hermit crab can be attributed to the noise produced.

Another study that demonstrates a stress response in invertebrates was conducted on the longfin inshore squid (&quot;Doryteuthis pealeii&quot;). The squid was exposed to sounds of construction known as pile driving, which impacts the sea bed directly and produces intense substrate-borne and water-borne vibrations. The squid reacted by jetting, inking, pattern change and other startle responses. Since the responses recorded are similar to those identified when faced with a predator, it is implied that the squid initially viewed the sounds as a threat. However, it was also noted that the alarm responses decreased over a period of time, signifying that the squid had likely acclimated to the noise. Regardless, it is apparent that stress occurred in the squid, and although further investigation has not been pursued, researchers suspect that other implications exist that may alter the squid&#x27;s survival habits.

An additional study examined the impact noise exposure had on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (&quot;Sousa chinensis&quot;). The dolphins were exposed to elevated noise levels due to construction in the Pearl River Estuary in China, specifically caused by the world&#x27;s largest vibration hammer—the OCTA-KONG. The study suggested that while the dolphin&#x27;s clicks were not affected, their whistles were because of susceptibility to auditory masking. The noise from the OCTA-KONG was found to have been detectable by the dolphins up to 3.5 km away from the original source, and while the noise was not found to be life-threatening it was indicated that prolonged exposure to this noise could be responsible for auditory damage.

=== Marine life ===
Noise pollution is common in marine ecosystems, affecting at least 55 marine species. For many marine populations, sound is their primary sense used for their survival; able to detect sound hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from a source, while vision is limited to tens of meters underwater. As anthropogenic noises continue to increase, doubling every decade, this compromises the survivability of marine species. One study discovered that as seismic noises and naval sonar increases in marine ecosystems, cetacean, such as whales and dolphins, diversity decreases. Noise pollution has also impaired fish hearing, killed and isolated whale populations, intensified stress response in marine species, and changed species&#x27; physiology. Because marine species are sensitive to noise, most marine wildlife are located in undisturbed habitats or areas not exposed to significant anthropogenic noise, limiting suitable habitats to forage and mate. Whales have changed their migration route to avoid anthropogenic noise, as well as altering their calls.

For many marine organisms, sound is the primary means of learning about their environments. For example, many species of marine mammals and fish use sound as their primary means of navigating, communicating, and foraging. Anthropogenic noise can have a detrimental effect on animals, increasing the risk of death by changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and interfering with the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to reproduction, and in navigation and echolocation. These effects then may alter more interactions within a community through indirect (&quot;domino&quot;) effects. Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.

Noise pollution may have caused the death of certain species of whales that beached themselves after being exposed to the loud sound of military sonar. (see also Marine mammals and sonar) Up until recently, most research on noise impacts has been focused on marine mammals, and to a lesser degree, fish. In the past few years, scientists have shifted to conducting studies on invertebrates and their responses to anthropogenic sounds in the marine environment. This research is essential, especially considering that invertebrates make up 75% of marine species, and thus compose a large percentage of ocean food webs. Of the studies that have been conducted, a sizable variety in families of invertebrates have been represented in the research. A variation in the complexity of their sensory systems exists, which allows scientists to study a range of characteristics and develop a better understanding of anthropogenic noise impacts on living organisms.

Even marine invertebrates, such as crabs (&quot;Carcinus maenas&quot;), have been shown to be negatively affected by ship noise. Larger crabs were noted to be negatively affected more by the sounds than smaller crabs. Repeated exposure to the sounds did lead to acclimatization.

Underwater noise pollution due to human activities is also prevalent in the sea, and given that sound travels faster through water than through air, is a major source of disruption of marine ecosystems and does significant harm to sea life, including marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates. The once-calm sea environment is now noisy and chaotic due to ships, oil drilling, sonar equipment, and seismic testing. The principal anthropogenic noise sources come from merchant ships, naval sonar operations, underwater explosions (nuclear), and seismic exploration by oil and gas industries.

Cargo ships generate high levels of noise due to propellers and diesel engines. This noise pollution significantly raises the low-frequency ambient noise levels above those caused by wind. Animals such as whales that depend on sound for communication can be affected by this noise in various ways. Higher ambient noise levels also cause animals to vocalize more loudly, which is called the Lombard effect. Researchers have found that humpback whales&#x27; song lengths were longer when low-frequency sonar was active nearby.

Underwater noise pollution is not only limited to oceans, and can occur in freshwater environments as well. Noise pollution has been detected in the Yangtze River, and has resulted in the endangerment of Yangtze finless porpoises. A study conducted on noise pollution in the Yangtze River suggested that the elevated levels of noise pollution altered the temporal hearing threshold of the finless porpoises and posed a significant threat to their survival.

==== Coral Reefs ====
Noise pollution has emerged as a prominent stressor on coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs are among the most important ecosystems of the earth, as well as they are of great importance to several communities and cultures around the world, that depend on the reefs for the services they provide, such as fishing and tourism. The reefs contribute substantially to global biodiversity and productivity, and is a critical part of the support systems of the earth. Anthropogenic noise, originating from human activities, has increased underwater noise in the natural sound environment of the reefs. The preeminent sources of noise pollution on coral reefs are boat and ship activities. The sound created by the crossing of boats and ships overlaps with the natural sounds of the coral reef organisms. This pollution impacts the various organisms inhabiting the coral reefs in different ways, and ultimately damages the capabilities of the reef and may cause permanent deterioration.

Healthy coral reefs are naturally noisy, consisting of the sounds of breaking waves and tumbling rocks, as well as the sounds produced by fish and other organisms. Marine organisms use sound for purposes such as navigating, foraging, communicating, and reproductive activities. The sensitivity and range of hearing varies across different organisms within the coral reef ecosystem. Among coral reef fish, sound detection and generation can span from 1 Hz to 200 kHz, while their hearing abilities encompasses frequencies within the range of 100 Hz to 1 kHz. Several different types of anthropogenic noise are at the same frequencies as marine organisms in coral reefs use for navigation, communication, and other purposes, which disturbs the natural sound environment of the coral reefs.

Anthropogenic sources of noise are generated by a range of different human activities, such as shipping, oil and gas exploration and fishing. The principal cause of noise pollution on coral reefs is boat and ship activities. The use of smaller motorboats, for purposes as fishing or tourism within coral reef areas, and larger vessels, such as cargo ships transporting goods, significantly amplifies disturbances to the natural marine soundscape. Noise from shipping and small boats is at the same frequency as sounds generated by marine organisms, and therefore acts as a disruptive element in the sound environment of coral reefs. Both longer-term and acute effects have been documented on coral reefs organisms after exposure to noise pollution.

Anthropogenic noise is essentially a persistent stressor on coral reefs and its inhabitants. Both temporary and permanent noise pollution has been found to induce changes in the distributional, physiological, and behavioral patterns of coral reef organisms. Some of the observed changes has been compromised hearing, increased heart rate in coral fish and a reduction in the number of larvae reaching their settlement areas. Ultimately, the outcome of such changes results in reduced survival rates and altered patterns which potentially alters the entirety of the reef ecosystem.

The white damselfish, a coral reef fish, has been found to have a compromised anti-predator behavior as a result to ship noise. The distraction of anthropogenic noise is possibly distracting the fish, and thereby affecting the escape response and routine swimming of the coral fish. A study conducted on species of coral larvae, which are crucial for the expansion of coral reefs, discovered that the larvae oriented towards the sound of healthy reefs. The noise created by anthropogenic activities could mask this soundscape, hindering the larvae from swimming towards the reef. Noise pollution ultimately poses a threat to the behavioral patterns of several coral organisms.

=== Impacts on communication ===
Terrestrial anthropogenic noise affects the acoustic communications in grasshoppers while producing sound to attract a mate. The fitness and reproductive success of a grasshopper is dependent on its ability to attract a mating partner. Male &quot;Corthippus biguttulus&quot; grasshoppers attract females by using stridulation to produce courtship songs. The females produce acoustic signals that are shorter and primarily low frequency and amplitude, in response to the male&#x27;s song. Research has found that this species of grasshopper changes its mating call in response to loud traffic noise. Lampe and Schmoll (2012) found that male grasshoppers from quiet habitats have a local frequency maximum of about 7319 Hz.

In contrast, male grasshoppers exposed to loud traffic noise can create signals with a higher local frequency maximum of 7622 Hz. The higher frequencies are produced by the grasshoppers to prevent background noise from drowning out their signals. This information reveals that anthropogenic noise disturbs the acoustic signals produced by insects for communication. Similar processes of behavior perturbation, behavioral plasticity, and population level shifts in response to noise likely occur in sound-producing marine invertebrates, but more experimental research is needed.

===Impacts on development===
Boat-noise has been shown to affect the embryonic development and fitness of the sea hare &quot;Stylocheilus striatus&quot;. Anthropogenic noise can alter conditions in the environment that have a negative effect on invertebrate survival. Although embryos can adapt to normal changes in their environment, evidence suggests they are not well adapted to endure the negative effects of noise pollution. Studies have been conducted on the sea hare to determine the effects of boat noise on the early stages of life and the development of embryos. Researchers have studied sea hares from the lagoon of Moorea Island, French Polynesia. In the study, recordings of boat noise were made by using a hydrophone. In addition, recordings of ambient noise were made that did not contain boat noise. In contrast to ambient noise playbacks, mollusks exposed to boat noise playbacks had a 21% reduction in embryonic development. Additionally, newly hatched larvae experienced an increased mortality rate of 22% when exposed to boat noise playbacks.

===Impacts on ecosystem===
Anthropogenic noise can have negative effects on invertebrates that aid in controlling environmental processes that are crucial to the ecosystem. There are a variety of natural underwater sounds produced by waves in coastal and shelf habitats, and biotic communication signals that do not negatively impact the ecosystem. The changes in behavior of invertebrates vary depending on the type of anthropogenic noise and is similar to natural noisescapes.

Experiments have examined the behavior and physiology of the clam (&quot;Ruditapes philippinarum&quot;), the decapod (&quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;), and the brittlestar (&quot;Amphiura filiformis&quot;) that are affected by sounds resembling shipping and building noises. The three invertebrates in the experiment were exposed to continuous broadband noise and impulsive broadband noise. The anthropogenic noise impeded the bioirrigation and burying behavior of &quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;. In addition, the decapod exhibited a reduction in movement. &quot;Ruditapes philippinarum&quot; experienced stress which caused a reduction in surface relocation. The anthropogenic noise caused the clams to close their valves and relocate to an area above the interface of the sediment-water. This response inhibits the clam from mixing the top layer of the sediment profile and hinders suspension feeding. Sound causes &quot;Amphiura filiformis&quot; to experience changes in physiological processes which results in irregularity of bioturbation behavior.

These invertebrates play an important role in transporting substances for benthic nutrient cycling. As a result, ecosystems are negatively impacted when species cannot perform natural behaviors in their environment. Locations with shipping lanes, dredging, or commercial harbors are known as continuous broadband sound. Pile-driving, and construction are sources that exhibit impulsive broadband noise. The different types of broadband noise have different effects on the varying species of invertebrates and how they behave in their environment.

Another study found that the valve closures in the Pacific oyster &quot;Magallana gigas&quot; was a behavioral response to varying degrees of acoustic amplitude levels and noise frequencies. Oysters perceive near-field sound vibrations by utilizing statocysts. In addition, they have superficial receptors that detect variations in water pressure. Sound pressure waves from shipping can be produced below 200 Hz. Pile driving generates noise between 20 and 1000 Hz. In addition, large explosions can create frequencies ranging from 10 to 200 Hz. &quot;M. gigas&quot; can detect these noise sources because their sensory system can detect sound in the 10 to &lt; 1000 Hz range.

The anthropogenic noise produced by human activity has been shown to negatively impact oysters. Studies have revealed that wide and relaxed valves are indicative of healthy oysters. The oysters are stressed when they do not open their valves as frequently in response to environmental noise. This provides support that the oysters detect noise at low acoustic energy levels. While we generally understand that marine noise pollution influences charismatic megafauna like whales and dolphins, understanding  how invertebrates like oysters perceive and respond to human generated sound can provide further insight about the effects of anthropogenic noise on the larger ecosystem. The aquatic ecosystems are known to use sound to navigate, find food, and protect themselves. In 2020, one of the worst mass stranding of whales occurred in Australia. Experts suggest that noise pollution plays a major role in the mass stranding of whales.

Noise pollution has also altered avian communities and diversity. Anthropogenic noises have a similar effect on bird population as seen in marine ecosystems, where noises reduce reproductive success; cannot detect predators due to interferences of anthropogenic noises, minimize nesting areas, increase stress response, and species abundances and richness declining. Certain avian species are more sensitive to noises compared to others, resulting in highly-sensitive birds migrating to less disturbed habitats. There has also been evidence of indirect positive effects of anthropogenic noises on avian populations. It was found that nesting bird predators, such as the western scrub-jay (&quot;Aphelocoma californica&quot;), were uncommon in noisy environments (western scrub-jay are sensitive to noise). Therefore, reproductive success for nesting prey communities was higher due to the lack of predators. Noise pollution can alter the distribution and abundance of prey species, which can then impact predator populations.

==Noise control==


The Hierarchy of Controls concept is often used to reduce noise in the environment or the workplace. Engineering noise controls can be used to reduce noise propagation and protect individuals from overexposure. When noise controls are not feasible or adequate, individuals can also take steps to protect themselves from the harmful effects of noise pollution. If people must be around loud sounds, they can protect their ears with hearing protection (e.g., ear plugs or ear muffs).

Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.

Noise from roadways and other urban factors can be mitigated by urban planning and better design of roads. Roadway noise can be reduced by the use of noise barriers, limitation of vehicle speeds, alteration of roadway surface texture, limitation of heavy vehicles, use of traffic controls that smooth vehicle flow to reduce braking and acceleration, and tyre design.

An important factor in applying these strategies is a computer model for roadway noise, that is capable of addressing local topography, meteorology, traffic operations, and hypothetical mitigation. Costs of building-in mitigation can be modest, provided these solutions are sought in the planning stage of a roadway project.

Aircraft noise can be reduced by using quieter jet engines. Altering flight paths and time of day runway has benefited residents near airports.

==Legal status and regulation==
===Country-specific regulations===
Up until the 1970s governments tended to view noise as a &quot;nuisance&quot; rather than an environmental problem.

Many conflicts over noise pollution are handled by negotiation between the emitter and the receiver. Escalation procedures vary by country, and may include action in conjunction with local authorities, in particular the police.

====Egypt====
In 2007, the Egyptian National Research Center found that the average noise level in central Cairo was 90 decibels and that the noise never fell below 70 decibels. Noise limits set by law in 1994 are not enforced. In 2018, the World Hearing Index declared Cairo to be the world&#x27;s second-noisiest city.

====India====
Noise pollution is a major problem in India. The government of India has rules and regulations against firecrackers and loudspeakers, but enforcement is extremely lax. Awaaz Foundation is a non-governmental organization in India working to control noise pollution from various sources through advocacy, public interest litigation, awareness, and educational campaigns since 2003. Despite increased enforcement and stringency of laws now being practiced in urban areas, rural areas are still affected.

The Supreme Court of India had banned playing of music on loudspeakers after 10 p.m. In 2015, The National Green Tribunal directed authorities in Delhi to ensure strict adherence to guidelines on noise pollution, saying noise is more than just a nuisance as it can produce serious psychological stress. However, implementation of the law remains poor.

====Sweden====
How noise emissions should be reduced, without the industry being hit too hard, is a major problem in environmental care in Sweden today. The Swedish Work Environment Authority has set an input value of 80 dB for maximum sound exposure for eight hours. In workplaces where there is a need to be able to converse comfortably the background noise level should not exceed 40 dB. The government of Sweden has taken soundproofing and acoustic absorbing actions, such as noise barriers and active noise control.

====United Kingdom====
Figures compiled by rockwool, the mineral wool insulation manufacturer, based on responses from local authorities to a Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request reveal in the period April 2008 – 2009 UK councils received 315,838 complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 noise abatement notices or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behavior (Scotland) Act. In the last 12 months, 524 confiscations of equipment have been authorized involving the removal of powerful speakers, stereos and televisions. Westminster City Council has received more complaints per head of population than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10 councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in London.

====United States====
The Noise Control Act of 1972 established a U.S. national policy to promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health and welfare. In the past, Environmental Protection Agency coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The EPA phased out the office&#x27;s funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researches noise exposure in occupational settings and recommends a Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) for an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) or work shift of 85 dB(A) and for impulse noise (instant events such as bangs or crashes) of 140 dB(A). The agency published this recommendation along with its origin, noise measurement devices, hearing loss prevention programs, and research needs in 1972 (later revised June 1998) as an approach in preventing occupational noise-related hearing loss.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within the Department of Labor issues enforceable standards to protect workers from occupational noise hazards. The permissible exposure limit (PEL) for noise is a TWA of 90 dB(A) for an eight-hour work day. However, in manufacturing and service industries, if the TWA is greater than 85 dB(A), employers must implement a Hearing Conservation Program.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates aircraft noise by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by &quot;stage&quot; designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The FAA also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community. The FAA has set up a process to report for anyone who may be impacted by aircraft noise.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control highway noise as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) noise standards as described in 24 CFR part 51, Subpart B provides minimum national standards applicable to HUD programs to protect citizen against excessive noise in their communities and places of residence. For instance, all sites whose environmental or community noise exposure exceeds the day night average sound level (DNL) of 65 (dB) are considered noise-impacted areas, it defines &quot;Normally Unacceptable&quot; noise zones where community noise levels are between 65 and 75 dB, for such locations, noise abatement and noise attenuation features must be implemented. Locations where the DNL is above 75 dB are considered &quot;Unacceptable&quot; and require approval by the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.

The Department of Transportation&#x27;s Bureau of Transportation Statistics has created a to provide access to comprehensive aircraft and road noise data on national and county levels. The map aims to assist city planners, elected officials, scholars, and residents to gain access to up-to-date aviation and Interstate highway noise information.

States and local governments typically have very specific statutes on building codes, urban planning, and roadway development. Noise laws and ordinances vary widely among municipalities and indeed do not even exist in some cities. An ordinance may contain a general prohibition against making noise that is a nuisance, or it may set out specific guidelines for the level of noise allowable at certain times of the day and for certain activities. Noise laws classify sound into three categories. First is ambient noise, which refers to sound pressure of all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment. The second is continuous noise, which could be steady or fluctuating, but continues for more than an hour. The third is cyclically varying noise, which could be steady or fluctuating, but occurs repetitively at reasonably uniform intervals of time.

New York City instituted the first comprehensive noise code in 1985. The Portland Noise Code includes potential fines of up to $5000 per infraction and is the basis for other major U.S. and Canadian city noise ordinances.

===World Health Organization===

====European Region====
In 1995, the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region released guidelines on regulating community noise. The WHO European Region subsequently released other versions of the guidelines, with the most recent version circulated in 2018. The guidelines provide the most up-to-date evidence from research conducted in Europe and other parts of the world on non-occupational noise exposure and its relationship to physical and mental health outcomes. The guidelines provide recommendations for limits and preventive measures regarding various noise sources (road traffic, railway, aircraft, wind turbine) for day-evening-night average and nighttime average levels. Recommendations for leisure noise in 2018 were conditional and based on the equivalent sound pressure level during an average 24-hour period in a year without weights for nighttime noise (LAeq, 24 hrs); WHO set the recommended limit to 70 dB(A).

<text>Year 330 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Crassus and Venno (or, less frequently, year 424 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 330 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* January 20 – Alexander the Great defeats the Persians, led by satrap Ariobarzanes, at the Persian Gates. In this battle, Ariobarzan, supported by only 700 Persian Immortals, holds the vast Macedonian army of 17,000 men at bay for 30 days. At the end, his troops are surrounded by Alexander&#x27;s army, because of a Persian shepherd, who leads it around the Persian defenses. However, instead of surrendering, Ariobarzan and his 700 Immortals fight to the last man. Some historians consider him to be the Leonidas of Persia.
* January 30 – After gaining the Pass of the Persian Gates, Alexander enters Persepolis. There he ceremonially burns down the palace of Xerxes I, as a symbol that the Panhellenic war of revenge is at an end.
* Before continuing his pursuit of Darius III, who has retreated into Bactria, Alexander assembles all the Persian treasure and entrusts it to Harpalus, who is to hold it at Ecbatana as chief treasurer. Parmenion is also left behind in Media to manage communications between Alexander and the rest of his rapidly growing lands.
* Alexander appoints Atropates as the satrap of Media while Mithrenes is appointed by Alexander as satrap of Armenia.
* Crossing the Elburz Mountains to the Caspian Sea, Alexander seizes Zadracarta in Hyrcania and receives the submission of a group of satraps and Persian notables, some of whom he confirms in their offices. He then travels westward and defeats the Mardi, a mountain people who inhabit the Elburz Mountains. He also accepts the surrender of Darius&#x27; Greek mercenaries.
* In Aria, Alexander&#x27;s army defeats the satrap Satibarzanes, who initially offers to submit, only to later revolt. Alexander then founds the town of Alexandria of the Arians (modern Herat).
* At Phrada, in Drangiana, Philotas, Parmenion&#x27;s son and commander of the elite Macedonian companion cavalry, is implicated in an alleged plot against Alexander&#x27;s life. He is condemned by the army, and executed. A secret message is sent by Alexander to Cleander, Parmenion&#x27;s second in command, who obediently kills Parmenion at Ecbatana in Media for fear that he will rise up in revolt at the news of his son&#x27;s death. All of Parmenion&#x27;s adherents are now eliminated and men close to Alexander are promoted.

==== Persian Empire ====
* July 17 – King Darius III is deposed and killed by Bessus, the satrap of Bactria. Bessus assumes the kingship as Artaxerxes V.

==== Macedonia ====
* Alexander&#x27;s regent in Macedonia, Antipater, makes peace with the Thracians (with whom he has been warring) and then marches south with a large force of over 40,000 men. He wins a hard-fought Battle of Megalopolis in Arcadia against Agis III of Sparta and his Greek mercenaries. Agis III is killed, and Spartan resistance is broken.
* Aeschines continues to try to prevent Demosthenes from being awarded a golden crown for his services to Athens. The case, which has begun in 336 BC, finally concludes with the overwhelming defeat of Aeschines, largely because of Demosthenes&#x27; brilliant speech for Ctesiphon (&quot;On the Crown&quot;).
* Following his defeat in the courts by Demosthenes, Aeschines leaves Athens for Rhodes, to teach rhetoric.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Italian cities of Fondi and Privernum, led by Vitruvius Vaccus, launch a failed revolt against Rome.

=== By topic ===

==== Art ====
* Lysippos makes a bronze statue called &quot;The scraper&quot; (Apoxyomenos) (approximate date). A Roman copy after the original statue is today kept at Musei Vaticani in Rome.

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Agis III, Eurypontid king of Sparta (killed in battle)
* Darius III, king of Persia, was killed in Bactria (b. c. 380 BC)
* Kidinnu, Chaldean astronomer and mathematician
* Parmenion (also Parmenio), Macedonian general (murdered) (b. c. 400 BC)
* Philotas, Macedonian officer and son of Parmenio (executed)
* Theopompus of Chios, Greek historian and rhetorician (b. c. 380 BC)

<text>Willis Harold O&#x27;Brien (March 2, 1886 – November 8, 1962), known as Obie O&#x27;Brien, was an American motion picture special effects and stop-motion animation pioneer, who according to ASIFA-Hollywood &quot;was responsible for some of the best-known images in cinema history,&quot; and is best remembered for his work on &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925), &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1935) and &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949), for which he won the 1950 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

==Biography==

O&#x27;Brien was born in Oakland, California. He first left home at the age of eleven to work on cattle ranches, and again at the age of thirteen when he took on a variety of jobs including farmhand, factory worker, fur trapper, cowboy, and bartender. During this time he also competed in rodeos and developed an interest in dinosaurs while working as a guide to palaeontologists in Crater Lake region.

He spent his spare time sculpting and illustrating and his natural talent led to him being employed first as draftsman in an architect&#x27;s office and then as a sports cartoonist for the &quot;San Francisco Daily News&quot;. During this time he also became a professional boxer, winning his first nine bouts but retiring after an unsuccessful tenth. He subsequently worked for the railroad, first as a brakeman and later a surveyor, as a professional marble sculptor, and was assistant to the head architect of the 1915 San Francisco World&#x27;s Fair, where some of his work was displayed. 

During this time he made models, including a dinosaur and a caveman, which he animated with the assistance of a local newsreel cameraman. San Francisco exhibitor Herman Wobber saw this 90-second test footage and commissioned O&#x27;Brien to make his first film, &quot;The Dinosaur and the Missing Link: A Prehistoric Tragedy&quot; (1915) for a budget of $5,000.

Thomas Edison was impressed by the film and O&#x27;Brien was hired by the Edison Company to animate a series of short films with a prehistoric theme, these included &quot;R.F.D. 10,000 B.C.&quot; and &quot;Prehistoric Poultry&quot; (both 1917) released as part of Conquest Pictures film packages for youth audiences. During this time he also worked on other Edison Company productions including Sam Loyd&#x27;s &quot;The Puzzling Billboard&quot; and &quot;Nippy&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; (both 1917), which were the first stop-motion films to combine live actors with stop motion models.

These films led to a commission from Herbert M. Dawley to write, direct, co-star and produce the effects for another dinosaur film, &quot;The Ghost of Slumber Mountain&quot; (1918), for a budget of $3,000. The collaboration was not a happy one and Dawley cut the 45-minute film down to 11 minutes and claimed credit for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s pioneering effects work, which combined realistic stop-motion animated prehistoric models with live action. The film grossed over $100,000 and Dawley used the cut effects footage in a sequel &quot;Along the Moonbeam Trail&quot; (1920) and the documentary &quot;Evolution&quot; (1923), but O&#x27;Brien received little financial reimbursement from this success.

The film however did help to secure his position on Harry O. Hoyt&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;. For his early, short films O&#x27;Brien created his own characters out of clay, although for much of his feature career he would employ Richard and Marcel Delgado to create much more detailed stop-motion models (based on O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s designs) with rubber skin built up over complex, articulated metal armatures. The models contained a bladder inside the skeleton model that could be inflated and deflated to give the illusion of breathing. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who appeared in the prologue to the film based on his novel of the same name, reportedly showed a reel of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s animation from the film to his friends, claiming it was real footage of living dinosaurs, to try to convince them that his story was based on fact.

O&#x27;Brien married Hazel Ruth Collette in 1925; they had two sons together, William and Willis, Jr., but the marriage was an unhappy one. O&#x27;Brien was reportedly forced into it, and rebelled with drinking, gambling, and extra-marital affairs. The couple had divorced by 1930 and the two boys remained with their mother, who had begun to show unbalanced behaviour. By 1931, Hazel had been diagnosed with cancer and tuberculosis, while William also contracted tuberculosis resulting in blindness in one eye and then the other.

Throughout this time O&#x27;Brien worked with Hoyt on a series of cancelled projects included &quot;Atlantis&quot; for First National studio, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and &quot;Creation&quot; for RKO Pictures, which was finally cancelled in 1931 with only 20 minutes of effects footage to show for an estimated $120,000 development cost. The studio&#x27;s head of production, Merian C. Cooper, had recommended the cancellation of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s project as he thought the story was boring but he was impressed by the effects work and saw how it could be used to facilitate the development of his own pet project about a giant gorilla battling Komodo dragons. O&#x27;Brien and the dinosaur models he had created for the cancelled project were put to work on what was to become his best remembered film, the iconic &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933).

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) proposed giving O&#x27;Brien an Oscar for his technical effects on &quot;King Kong&quot; but Willis insisted that each of his crew receive an Oscar statue also, which the AMPAS refused to do, so O&#x27;Brien refused to accept the Oscar award for himself. This act of refusing his Oscar hurt O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s reputation as a player in the Hollywood establishment, forever making him a semi-outsider in the industry, and thus whose own film proposals were seldom taken seriously. One of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s crew was Linwood G. Dunn, who did all of the optical composites for &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Son of Kong&quot; (also 1933), and who was a future Treasurer and President of the AMPAS and who revealed this story in private conversations with various visual effects associates years later, long after O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s death.

The success of &quot;King Kong&quot; led to the studio commissioning the hurried sequel, which O&#x27;Brien described as cheesy. With a limited budget and a short production schedule, O&#x27;Brien chose to leave the animation work to his animation assistant, Buzz Gibson, and asked the studio not to credit him on the project. While making one of his daily visits to the set, O&#x27;Brien, who had remained close to his two sons after his separation from his estranged wife, invited Willis Jr. and the now completely blind William with him to handle the Kong and dinosaur models. A few weeks after this visit O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ex-wife, Hazel Ruth Collette, shot and killed William and Willis Jr. before turning the gun on herself. The suicide attempt failed and by draining her tubercular lung actually extended her life by another year. A publicity photo of O&#x27;Brien taken around this time shows the anguish on his face. 

Hazel Ruth Collette remained in the Los Angeles General Hospital prison ward until her death in 1934. On November 17 that same year O&#x27;Brien married his second wife, Darlyne Prenett, with whom he remained until his death.

O&#x27;Brien continued to work with Merian C. Cooper at RKO on a number of projects including the epic &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1935) and &quot;Dancing Pirate&quot; (1936), which was O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s first Technicolor production. The two also developed &quot;War Eagles&quot; about a race of Vikings riding on prehistoric eagles fighting with dinosaurs, but the project was cancelled when Cooper re-enlisted as a colonel in the U.S. Army Air Forces at the outset of World War II. O&#x27;Brien went on to do some special effects work, re-using one of the mattes from &quot;Son of Kong&quot;, on Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and George Pal&#x27;s Oscar-nominated animated short &quot;Tulips Shall Grow&quot; (1942), as well as developing his own project, &quot;Gwangi&quot;, about cowboys who encounter a prehistoric animal in a &quot;lost&quot; valley, which he failed to sell to the studio.

&quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949), on which O&#x27;Brien is credited as Technical Creator, won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1950. Credit for the award went to the film&#x27;s producers, RKO Productions, but O&#x27;Brien was also awarded a statue, this time proudly accepted by him. O&#x27;Brien was assisted by his protege (and successor) Ray Harryhausen and Pete Peterson on this film, and by some accounts left the majority of the animation to them.

O&#x27;Brien and his wife developed &quot;Emilio and Guloso&quot; (aka, &quot;Valley of the Mist&quot;), about a Mexican boy and his pet bull who save their town from a dinosaur called &quot;Lagarto Grande&quot;, which was optioned by producer Jesse L. Lasky Sr., with O&#x27;Brien and Harryhausen on board to do special effects, before falling through. O&#x27;Brien subsequently worked for Cooper at the new Cinerama corporation with plans to do a remake of &quot;King Kong&quot; using the new wide-screen techniques but ended up contributing a matte for the travelogue &quot;This Is Cinerama&quot; (1952) when this project also fell through. O&#x27;Brien worked with Harryhausen one last time on the dinosaur sequence for Irwin Allen&#x27;s nature documentary &quot;The Animal World&quot; (1956). O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s story ideas for &quot;Gwangi&quot; and &quot;Valley of the Mist&quot; were developed into Edward Nassour and Ismael Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;The Beast of Hollow Mountain&quot; (also 1956) but he did not work on the film&#x27;s effects, which were the first to combine stop-motion and live-action in a color film. O&#x27;Brien also worked with Peterson again on &quot;The Black Scorpion&quot; (1957) and &quot;Behemoth, the Sea Monster&quot; (aka &quot;The Giant Behemoth&quot;) (1959), but the two animators subsequently struggled to find other work.

Allen hired O&#x27;Brien as the effects technician on his remake of &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960), but he was given little to do as the producer opted for live lizards instead of stop-motion animation for the dinosaurs. One of his story ideas &quot;King Kong vs. Frankenstein&quot; was developed into Ishirō Honda&#x27;s &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962) but O&#x27;Brien was once again not involved in the production. Shortly before his death, he animated a brief scene for Linwood G. Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Film Effects of Hollywood&quot; company in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), featuring the male leads and secondary characters dangling from a fire escape and ladder, but he died before the film was released.

O&#x27;Brien died in Los Angeles on November 8, 1962. He was survived by his second wife, Darlyne. In 1997, he was posthumously awarded the Winsor McCay Award by ASIFA-Hollywood, the United States chapter of the International Animated Film Society ASIFA (Association internationale du film d&#x27;animation). The award is in recognition of lifetime or career contributions to the art of animation. His interment was located at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.

The film &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; (1969), completed for Warner Brothers by Harryhausen seven years after O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s death, was based on an idea the latter had spent years trying to bring to the screen. O&#x27;Brien wrote the script for an earlier version of the story which was released as &quot;The Beast of Hollow Mountain&quot; (US 1956), but O&#x27;Brien did not handle the effects for that movie.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s work was celebrated in March 1983 with the appearance of his wife, Darlene, at a 50th anniversary event commemorating the day of the first screening of the film at Graumann&#x27;s (later Mann&#x27;s) Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, complete with a screening of a new print of &quot;King Kong&quot; and a new recreation of the full-scale bust of Kong that appeared 50 years apart at both events in the outdoor lobby of the theater. Three articles in the August, 1983, issue of &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; magazine detailed the 1983 anniversary event.

In March 1984, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s work was the subject of a special exhibit at the Kaiser Center in Oakland, California. This exhibit included many sketches, artifacts, and photographs from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s personal collection, some of which had never been seen in public.

In 2005, Peter Jackson produced and directed &quot;King Kong&quot;. It was filmed in New Zealand and featured visual effects by Weta Digital. It was dedicated to O&#x27;Brien and the other key contributors to the original film.

=== Unrealized projects===

* Atlantis (1927): Developed by O&#x27;Brien and Harry Hoyt after the success of 1925&#x27;s The Lost World.

* Frankenstein (1928): Originally considered in 1928, and the would be announced by Willis O&#x27;Brien himself in 1934, this would&#x27;ve bene an adaptation of the Marry Shelly novel of the same name. The idea of Frankenstein would later be re-used for King Kong vs. Frankenstein after not much went through after that.

* Creation (1930): A ship and a submarine crashes on an unknown island roaming with dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. Much of the idea&#x27;s for this project would be used for King Kong (1933).

* The New Adventures of King Kong (1933): Set during the events of the first King Kong (1933) when Kong was being transported to New York City on the Venture. But due to the underperformance of Son of Kong (1933), the project was dropped.

* The Food of the Gods (1934): Based on the 1904 novel by H. G. Wells, Willis O&#x27;Brien planned on adapting the book into film form, but failed to gain interest. Ray Harryhausen would later try his hand in making it into a film in 1961, but the project was dropped again.

* War Eagles (1939): A young WWII pilot crashes in a hidden valley in the Arctic inhabited by dinosaurs and the descendants of a Viking tribe who ride on giant eagles called Erns. He becomes a part of the tribe and helps them defeat a rampaging Allosaurus heard. When he hears that New York City is under attack by Nazis, he convinces them to aid him in his fight against them. A battle between giant eagles, planes, and zeppelins occurs over the city. Would later be adapted into two novels made by Carl Macek and David Conover in 2008 and 2011 respectively. 

* Valley of the Mist (1950): Originally titled Emilio and Guloso, then El Toro Estrella (The Star Bull), the story tells of a boy and his pet bull who save their town from a Allosaurus called Lagarto Grande (the Great Lizard). In later drafts the story would have involved men vs. dinosaurs. This would later be reworked into The Valley of Gwangi (1969).

* The Last of the Oso Si-Papu (1950): An earthquake opens a fissure to the legendary Third World of the Hopi Indians, Kuskurza. A world populated by prehistoric monsters. When the Oso Si Papu, a 20-foot monster bear with Gile Monster-like skin threatens a small town, a group of movie makers, some archaeologists, and the local police must find a way to stop the ravaging monster. Special effects artist and author of &quot;Willis O&#x27;Brien: Special Effects Genius&quot; Steve Archer has attempted to make this film made in the 1990&#x27;s, but to no avail. 

* The 8th Wonder (1952): A proposed remake of the original King Kong. After the original King Kong was successful re-released in America in 1952, Merian C. Cooper began thinking about the viability of bringing Kong to the Cinerama process in some form. He brought in Willis O&#x27;Brien to help develop the project, and Cinerama employee Cunningham to create a new camera system that could capture stop-motion in the widescreen format. However, the project was dropped.

* Umbah (1950s): Treatment by O&#x27;Brien about the Lovelock Cave. A second cave system is found behind the Lovelock Cave. When explored a hidden valley is found with lsrge animals, and two giants, Umbah and Tavotz.

* The Last of the Labyrinthodons (1954): Modern-day sea monsters from prehistoric times attack ships.

* King Kong vs. Frankenstein (1958–61): The descendants of Carl Denham and Victor Frankenstein cross paths with Kong and Frankenstein. The two battle each other in San Francisco and fall from the Golden Gate Bridge. Eventually turned into King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) by Toho Co.LTD, who purchased the rights to the film from John Beck, to which Willis O&#x27;Brien did not find out until production was already released in theaters.

* Elephant Rustlers (1960): About a hunt for elephant thieves in Burma, where the heroes are threatened by giant ferocious lizards.[4]

* The Bubbles (1960–1962): Giant tentacled jellyfish-like creatures appear in Baja, California and start eating up anything in their path.

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* From Phrada, Alexander the Great presses on up the valley of the Helmand River, through Arachosia, and over the mountains past the site of modern Kabul into the country of the Paropamisade, where he founds Alexandria by the Caucasus.
* In Bactria, Bessus raises a national revolt in the eastern satrapies using the title of King Artaxerxes V of Persia.
* Crossing the Hindu Kush northward, probably over the Khawak Pass, Alexander brings his army, despite food shortages, to Drapsaka. Outflanked, Bessus flees beyond the Oxus river.
* Marching west to Bactra (Zariaspa), Alexander appoints Artabazus of Phrygia as the satrap of Bactria.
* Crossing the Oxus, Alexander sends his general Ptolemy in pursuit of Bessus. In the meantime, Bessus is overthrown by the Sogdian Spitamenes. Bessus is captured, flogged, and sent to Ptolemy in Bactria with the hope of appeasing Alexander. In due course, Bessus is publicly executed at Ecbatana. With the death of Bessus (Artaxerxes V), Persian resistance to Alexander the Great ceases.
* From Maracanda, Alexander advances through Cyropolis to the Jaxartes river, the boundary of the Persian Empire. There he breaks the opposition of the Scythian nomads by his use of catapults and, after defeating them in a battle on the north bank of the river, pursues them into the interior. On the site of modern Khujand on the Jaxartes, he founds a city, Alexandria Eschate, &quot;the farthest.&quot;

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* At Maracanda, Alexander murders Cleitus, one of his most trusted commanders, friend and foster-brother, in a drunken quarrel; but his excessive display of remorse leads the army to pass a decree convicting Cleitus posthumously of treason.
* Spitamenes raises all Sogdiana in revolt behind him, bringing in the Massagetae, a people of the Scythian confederacy. He besieges the Macedonian garrison in Maracanda. Alexander the Great sends an army under the command of Pharnuches of Lycia which is promptly annihilated with a loss of more than 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry.
* Understanding now the danger represented by his enemy, Alexander moves personally to relieve Maracanda, only to learn that Spitamenes has left Sogdiana. Spitamenes then attacks Bactra, from where he is repulsed with great difficulty by the satrap of Bactria, Artabazus of Phrygia.
* Alexander attacks Oxyartes and the remaining Bactrian barons who are holding out in the hills of Paraetacene (modern Tajikistan). The Macedonians seize the crag on which Oxyartes has his stronghold (the Sogdian Rock), and among the captives is his daughter, Roxana. In the reconciliation that follows the battle, Alexander marries Roxana. The rest of Oxyartes&#x27; opponents are either won over or crushed.
* December – Spitamenes is badly defeated by Alexander&#x27;s general Coenus. At this point Spitamenes&#x27; allies, feeling the situation desperate, kill their leader and send his head as a gift to Alexander.

<text>A vine is any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems, lianas, or runners. The word &quot;vine&quot; can also refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance, when used in wicker work.

In parts of the world, including the British Isles, the term &quot;vine&quot; usually applies exclusively to grapevines, while the term &quot;climber&quot; is used for all climbing plants.

== Growth forms ==

Certain plants always grow as vines, while a few grow as vines only part of the time. For instance, poison ivy and bittersweet can grow as low shrubs when support is not available, but will become vines when support is available.

A vine displays a growth form based on very long stems. This has two purposes. A vine may use rock exposures, other plants, or other supports for growth rather than investing energy in a lot of supportive tissue, enabling the plant to reach sunlight with a minimum investment of energy. This has been a highly successful growth form for plants such as kudzu and Japanese honeysuckle, both of which are invasive exotics in parts of North America. There are some tropical vines that develop skototropism, and grow away from the light, a type of negative phototropism. Growth away from light allows the vine to reach a tree trunk, which it can then climb to brighter regions.

The vine growth form may also enable plants to colonize large areas quickly, even without climbing high. This is the case with periwinkle and ground ivy. It is also an adaptation to life in areas where small patches of fertile soil are adjacent to exposed areas with more sunlight but little or no soil. A vine can root in the soil but have most of its leaves in the brighter, exposed area, getting the best of both environments.

The evolution of a climbing habit has been implicated as a key innovation associated with the evolutionary success and diversification of a number of taxonomic groups of plants. It has evolved independently in several plant families, using many different climbing methods, such as:
* twining the stem around a support (e.g., morning glories, &quot;Ipomoea&quot; species)
* by way of adventitious, clinging roots (e.g., ivy, &quot;Hedera&quot; species)
* with twining petioles (e.g., &quot;Clematis&quot; species)
* using tendrils, which can be specialized shoots (Vitaceae), leaves (Bignoniaceae), or even inflorescences (&quot;Passiflora&quot;)
* using tendrils which also produce adhesive pads at the end that attach themselves quite strongly to the support (&quot;Parthenocissus&quot;)
* using thorns (e.g. climbing rose) or other hooked structures, such as hooked branches (e.g. &quot;Artabotrys hexapetalus&quot;)

The climbing fetterbush (&quot;Pieris phillyreifolia&quot;) is a woody shrub-vine which climbs without clinging roots, tendrils, or thorns. It directs its stem into a crevice in the bark of fibrous barked trees (such as bald cypress) where the stem adopts a flattened profile and grows up the tree underneath the host tree&#x27;s outer bark. The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge near the top of the tree.

Most vines are flowering plants. These may be divided into woody vines or lianas, such as akebia wisteria, kiwifruit, and common ivy, and herbaceous (nonwoody) vines, such as morning glory.

One odd group of vining plants is the fern genus &quot;Lygodium&quot;, called climbing ferns. The stem does not climb, but rather the fronds (leaves) do. The fronds unroll from the tip, and theoretically never stop growing; they can form thickets as they unroll over other plants, rockfaces, and fences.

===Twining vines===

A twining vine, also known as a bine, is one that climbs by its shoots growing in a helix, in contrast to vines that climb using tendrils or suckers. Many bines have rough stems or downward-pointing bristles to aid their grip. Hops (used in flavoring beer) are a commercially important example of a bine.

The direction of rotation of the shoot tip during climbing is autonomous and does not (as sometimes imagined) derive from the shoot&#x27;s following the sun around the sky – the direction of twist does not therefore depend upon which side of the equator the plant is growing on. This is shown by the fact that some bines always twine clockwise, including runner bean (&quot;Phaseolus coccineus&quot;) and bindweed (&quot;Convolvulus&quot; species), while others twine anticlockwise, including black bryony (&quot;Dioscorea communis&quot;) and climbing honeysuckles (&quot;Lonicera&quot; species). The contrasting rotations of bindweed and honeysuckle was the theme of the satirical song &quot;Misalliance&quot;, written and sung by Michael Flanders and Donald Swann (but the lyrics confuse the direction of twining, describing honeysuckle as right-handed and bindweed as left-handed).

== Horticultural climbing plants ==
The term &quot;vine&quot; also applies to Cucurbitaceae like cucumbers where botanists refer to creeping vines; in commercial agriculture the natural tendency of coiling tendrils to attach themselves to pre-existing structures or espaliers is optimized by the installation of trellis netting.

Gardeners can use the tendency of climbing plants to grow quickly. If a plant display is wanted quickly, a climber can achieve this. Climbers can be trained over walls, pergolas, fences, etc. Climbers can be grown over other plants to provide additional attraction. Artificial support can also be provided. Some climbers climb by themselves; others need work, such as tying them in and training them.

==Scientific description==

Vines widely differ in size, form and evolutionary origin. Darwin classified climbing groups based on their climbing method. He classified five classes of vines – twining plants, leaf climbers, tendril bearers, root climbers and hook climbers.

Vines are remarkable in that they have multiple evolutionary origins. They usually reside in tropical locations and have the unique ability to climb. Vines are able to grow in both deep shade and full sun due to their uniquely wide range of phenotypic plasticity. This climbing action prevents shading by neighbors and allows the vine to grow out of reach of herbivores. The environment where a vine can grow successfully is determined by the climbing mechanism of a vine and how far it can spread across supports. There are many theories supporting the idea that photosynthetic responses are closely related to climbing mechanisms.

Temperate twining vines, which twist tightly around supports, are typically poorly adapted for climbing beneath closed canopies due to their smaller support diameter and shade intolerance. In contrast, tendril vines usually grow on the forest floor and onto trees until they reach the surface of the canopy, suggesting that they have greater physiological plasticity. It has also been suggested that twining vines&#x27; revolving growth is mediated by changes in turgor pressure mediated by volume changes in the epidermal cells of the bending zone.

Climbing vines can take on many unique characteristics in response to changes in their environments. Climbing vines can induce chemical defenses and modify their biomass allocation in response to herbivores. In particular, the twisting vine &quot;Convolvulus arvensis&quot; increases its twining in response to herbivore-associated leaf damage, which may lead to reduced future herbivory. Additionally, the tendrils of perennial vine &quot;Cayratia japonica&quot; are more likely to coil around nearby plants of another species than nearby plants of the same species in natural and experimental settings. This ability, which has only been previously documented in roots, demonstrates the vine&#x27;s ability to distinguish whether another plant is of the same species as itself or a different one.

In tendrilled vines, the tendrils are highly sensitive to touch and the coiling action is mediated by the hormones octadecanoids, jasmonates and indole-3-acetic acid. The touch stimulus and hormones may interact via volatile compounds or internal oscillation patterns. Research has found the presence of ion translocating ATPases in the &quot;Bryonia dioica&quot; species of plants, which has implications for a possible ion mediation tendril curling mechanism. In response to a touch stimulus, vanadate-sensitive K+, Mg2+ ATPase and Ca2+-translocating ATPases rapidly increase their activity. This increases transmembrane ion fluxes that appear to be involved in the early stages of tendril coiling.

<text>Year 327 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lentulus and Philo (or, less frequently, year 427 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 327 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Alexander the Great invades northern India. Recrossing the Hindu Kush, Alexander divides his forces. Half the army with the baggage under Hephaestion and Perdiccas, both cavalry commanders, are sent through the Khyber Pass, while Alexander leads the rest, together with his siege train, through the hills to the north. His advance through Swat and Gandhara is marked by the storming of the almost impregnable pinnacle of Aornos, a few miles west of the Indus.
* The relations between Alexander and Aristotle are embittered by the execution of Aristotle&#x27;s nephew, the historian Callisthenes of Olynthus, who is charged with treason. Callisthenes has been accompanying Alexander to write a chronicle of the campaign.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Samnite army captures Neapolis (present-day Naples). The Romans, who are meanwhile moving south while the Samnites are occupied with Tarentum, take the opportunity to recover Neapolis and, after a long siege, evict the Samnite garrison from the city and make it an ally of Rome.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Heracles, illegitimate son of Alexander the Great by his mistress Barsine, daughter of Satrap Artabazus of Phrygia and later claimant to the throne of Macedon (d. 309 BC)
* Moggaliputta-Tissa, Indian Buddhist monk, scholar and philosopher (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Callisthenes of Olynthus, Greek historian, great nephew and pupil of Aristotle (b. c. 360 BC)

<text>Year 326 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

=== By place ===

==== Macedonian Empire ====

* Spring – Alexander the Great crosses the Indus near Attock and enters ancient Taxila, whose ruler, Taxiles (or Ambhi), furnishes 130 war elephants and troops in return for aid against his rival Porus, who rules the lands between the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum River) and the Acesines (modern Chenab River).

* On the left bank of the Hydaspes, Alexander fights his last great battle, the Battle of the Hydaspes River. He and his general Craterus defeat the Indian King Porus. Alexander founds two cities there, Alexandria on the Indus or Alexandria Nicaea (to celebrate his victory) and Alexandria Bucephalous or Bucephala (named after his horse Bucephalus, which dies there); and Porus becomes his friend and ally.
* Philip, an officer in the service of Alexander the Great, is appointed satrap of India, including the provinces to the west of the Hydaspes, as far south as the junction of the Indus with the Acesines. Philip is put in charge by Alexander of building the city of Alexandria on the Indus.
* Alexander continues on to conquer all the headwaters of the Indus River. East of Porus&#x27; kingdom, near the Ganges River, Alexander faces the powerful empire of Magadha ruled by the Nanda dynasty. Fearing the prospects of facing another powerful Indian army and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinies at the Hyphasis River (the modern Beas River) and refuses to march further east, thus making this river mark the easternmost extent of Alexander&#x27;s conquests.
* Following the mutiny of his army at the Hyphasis River, Alexander is persuaded by his army leaders to abandon his plans for invading the Ganges Valley. Alexander appoints Nearchus, a Cretan with naval experience, as admiral and places under his command all in the ranks of his army with any knowledge of seafaring. Nearchus has Indian shipwrights build 800 vessels, some as large as 300 tons, to take the army through Persian Gulf waters to Babylon. Alexander the Great begins the return march down the Indus to the sea.
* After the departure of Alexander from India, Philip is assassinated by some of the mercenary troops under his command. Alexander names Eudamus and Taxilas as replacement rulers of Philip&#x27;s territories.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Following their defeat by the Roman forces in Naples, the Samnites declare war on Rome starting the Second Samnite War. To help defeat the Samnites, the Romans make alliances with the peoples of Central Italy to the north of Samnium and with the Apulians to the southeast.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
*Pharnavaz I of Iberia, later King of Iberia

== Deaths ==
* Coenus, son of Polemocrates and son-in-law of Parmenion and one of Alexander the Great&#x27;s generals in his Persian and Indian expeditions

==== Europe ====
* &quot;(around this year)&quot; – Pytheas made a voyage of naval exploration to northwestern Europe, reaching Britain and the Baltic Sea, and mentioning Thule as the farthest island to the north in the Atlantic.

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Alexander the Great leaves India and nominates his officer Peithon, son of Agenor, as the satrap of the region around the Indus.
* Alexander the Great orders his admiral, Nearchus, to sail from the Hydaspes River in western India to the Persian Gulf and up the Euphrates River to Babylon while Alexander&#x27;s army starts marching through Gedrosia (Baluchistan).
* While returning to Persia, Alexander&#x27;s army runs into the Malli clans (in modern day Multan). The ensuing battle severely weakens his army. Alexander sends much of his remaining army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with his general Craterus, while he leads the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through the Gedrosian Desert (now part of southern Iran and Makran in southern Pakistan).
* By the end of the year, Alexander&#x27;s army reaches Persepolis, while his navy, under Nearchus, reaches Susa at around the same time.
* The first known reference to sugar cane appears in writings by Alexander the Great&#x27;s admiral Nearchus, who writes of Indian reeds &quot;that produce honey, although there are no bees&quot;.

==== Sicily ====
* Agathocles, a rich and ambitious citizen of Syracuse, is exiled for attempting to overthrow the oligarchic party in the city.

<text>Year 324 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Dictatorship of Cursor (or, less frequently, year 430 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 324 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* On returning to Susa, Persia, Alexander the Great punishes those who he considers to have failed in their duties in his absence in India, particularly those who have plundered tombs and temples. Alexander continues his policy of replacing senior officials and executing defaulting governors. Over a third of his satraps are replaced and six are put to death. Three generals in Media, including Cleander, the brother of Coenus (who died in 326 BC), are accused of extortion and are arrested, tried and executed.
* While at Susa, Alexander holds a feast to celebrate his capture of the Persian Empire.
* To further his policy of integrating the Macedonians and Persians, Alexander and 80 of his officers take Persian wives. He and Hephaestion marry Darius III&#x27;s daughters Barsine (also called Stateira) and Drypteis, respectively, and 10,000 of his soldiers with native wives are given generous dowries. His determination to incorporate Persians on equal terms into his army and into the administration of the provinces is bitterly resented by the Macedonians.
* Alexander the Great spends the summer and autumn at the Median capital, Ecbatana, where his best friend, Hephaistion, dies during the autumn. Alexander indulges in extravagant mourning for his closest friend.
* Winter – Alexander carries out a savage punitive expedition against the Cossaeans in the hills of Luristan.

==== Greece ====
* Alexander the Great&#x27;s treasurer, Harpalus, fearing arrest, flees from Susa to Athens. On arriving in Athens, he is imprisoned by the Athenians after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite Hypereides&#x27; opposition, who wanted an immediate uprising against Alexander. Harpalus brings with him considerable wealth collected from the spoils of Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Asia. This money is entrusted to a committee led by Demosthenes.
* Dinarchus, a professional speech writer in Athens, comes to prominence in the scandal that follows the flight to Athens of Alexander the Great&#x27;s treasurer, Harpalus. When Harpalus escapes and flees to Crete, Dinarchus writes the prosecution speeches against Demosthenes, Demades, Aristogiton, Philocles and other well-known politicians accused of misappropriating some of this money.
* Demosthenes is convicted and imprisoned after being found guilty of misappropriating some of the funds that Alexander&#x27;s treasurer, Harpalus, has brought with him. He escapes into exile, although his sentence is soon repealed. Although Hypereides has supported Demosthenes in his struggle against the Macedonians, that support is withdrawn after the Harpalus affair. After Demosthenes&#x27; exile, Hypereides becomes the head of the patriotic party in Athens.
* Greek colonists found the city of Akra Leuka (modern Alicante, Spain) on the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Antiochus I Soter, King of the Seleucid dynasty (d. 261 BC)

== Deaths ==
* October – Hephaestion, son of Amyntor, a Macedonian general, soldier, aristocrat, and possibly lover of Alexander the Great (b. c. 356 BC).

<doc id="66612" wikidata="Q154959" url="?curid=66612" title="Hugo Grotius">
<text>Hugo Grotius ( ; 10 April 1583 – 28 August 1645), also known as Hugo de Groot () or Huig de Groot (), was a Dutch humanist, diplomat, lawyer, theologian, jurist, statesman, poet and playwright. A teenage prodigy, he was born in Delft and studied at Leiden University. He was imprisoned in Loevestein Castle for his involvement in the controversies over religious policy of the Dutch Republic, but escaped hidden in a chest of books that was regularly brought to him and was transported to Gorinchem. Grotius wrote most of his major works in exile in France.

Grotius was a major figure in the fields of philosophy, political theory and law during the 16th and 17th centuries. Along with the earlier works of Francisco de Vitoria and Alberico Gentili, his writings laid the foundations for international law, based on natural law in its Protestant side. Two of his books have had a lasting impact in the field of international law: &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; (&quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot;) dedicated to Louis XIII of France and the &quot;Mare Liberum&quot; (&quot;The Free Seas&quot;) for which Grotius has been called the &quot;father of international law.&quot; Grotius has also contributed significantly to the evolution of the notion of &quot;rights&quot;. Before him, rights were, above all, perceived as attached to objects; after him, they are seen as belonging to persons, as the expression of an ability to act, or as a means of realizing something.

Peter Borschberg suggests that Grotius was significantly influenced by Francisco de Vitoria and the School of Salamanca in Spain, who supported the idea that the sovereignty of a nation does not lie simply in a ruler through God&#x27;s will, but originates in its people, who agree to confer such authority upon a ruler. It is also thought that Grotius was not the first to formulate the international society doctrine, but he was one of the first to define expressly the idea of one society of states, governed not by force or warfare but by actual laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As Hedley Bull declared in 1990: &quot;The idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the Peace of Westphalia, and Grotius may be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times.&quot; Additionally, his contributions to Arminian theology helped provide the seeds for later Arminian-based movements, such as Methodism and Pentecostalism; Grotius is acknowledged as a significant figure in the Arminian–Calvinist debate. Because of his theological underpinning of free trade, he is also considered an &quot;economic theologist&quot;.

After fading over time, the influence of Grotius&#x27;s ideas revived in the 20th century following the First World War.

==Early life==
Born in Delft during the Dutch Revolt, Grotius was the first child of Jan Cornets de Groot and Alida van Overschie. His father was a man of learning, once having studied with the eminent Justus Lipsius at Leiden University, as well as of political distinction. His family was considered Delft patrician as his ancestors played an important role in local government since the 13th century.

Jan de Groot was also the translator of Archimedes and a friend of Ludolph van Ceulen. He groomed his son from an early age in a traditional humanist and Aristotelian education. A prodigious learner, Grotius entered Leiden University when he was just eleven years old. There he studied with some of the most acclaimed intellectuals in northern Europe, including Franciscus Junius, Joseph Justus Scaliger, and Rudolph Snellius. At age 16 (1599), he published his first book: a scholarly edition of the late antique author Martianus Capella&#x27;s work on the seven liberal arts, &quot;Martiani Minei Felicis Capellæ Carthaginiensis viri proconsularis Satyricon.&quot; It remained a reference for several centuries.

In 1598, at the age of 15 years, he accompanied Johan van Oldenbarnevelt to a diplomatic mission in Paris. On this occasion, the King Henri IV of France would have presented Grotius to his court as &quot;the miracle of Holland&quot;. During his stay in France, he passed or bought a law degree from the University of Orleans. In Holland, Grotius earned an appointment as advocate to The Hague in 1599 and then as official historiographer for the States of Holland in 1601. It was on this date that the States of Holland requested from Grotius an account of the United Provinces’ revolt against Spain; Grotius is indeed contemporary with the Eighty Years&#x27; War between Spain and the Netherlands. The resulting work, entitled &quot;Annales et Historiae de rebus Belgicis,&quot; describing the period from 1559 to 1609, was written in the style of the Roman historian Tacitus and was first finished in 1612. The States, however, did not publish it, possibly because of the way the work resonated with the politico-religious tensions within the Dutch Republic (see below).

His first occasion to write systematically on issues of international justice came in 1604 when he became involved in the legal proceedings following the seizure by Dutch merchants of a Portuguese carrack and its cargo in the Singapore Strait. Throughout his life Grotius wrote a variety of philological, theological and politico-theological works.

In 1608, he married Maria van Reigersberch; they had three daughters and four sons.

==Jurist career==
The Dutch were at war with Spain; although Portugal was closely allied with Spain, it was not yet at war with the Dutch. Near the start of the war, Grotius&#x27;s cousin captain Jacob van Heemskerk captured a loaded Portuguese carrack merchant ship, &quot;Santa Catarina&quot;, off present-day Singapore in 1603. Heemskerk was employed with the United Amsterdam Company (part of the Dutch East India Company), and though he did not have authorization from the company or the government to initiate the use of force, many shareholders were eager to accept the riches that he brought back to them.

Not only was the legality of keeping the prize questionable under Dutch statute, but a faction of shareholders (mostly Mennonite) in the Company also objected to the forceful seizure on moral grounds, and of course, the Portuguese demanded the return of their cargo. The scandal led to a public judicial hearing and a wider campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. It was in this wider context that representatives of the Company called upon Grotius to draft a polemical defence of the seizure.

The result of Grotius&#x27; efforts in 1604/05 was a long, theory-laden treatise that he provisionally entitled &quot;De Indis&quot; (&quot;On the Indies&quot;). Grotius sought to ground his defense of the seizure in terms of the natural principles of justice. In this, he had cast a net much wider than the case at hand; his interest was in the source and ground of war&#x27;s lawfulness in general. The treatise was never published in full during Grotius&#x27; lifetime, perhaps because the court ruling in favor of the Company preempted the need to garner public support.

 In &quot;The Free Sea&quot; (&quot;Mare Liberum&quot;, published 1609), Grotius formulated the new principle that the sea was international territory and all nations were free to use it for seafaring trade. Grotius, by claiming &#x27;free seas&#x27; (freedom of the seas), provided suitable ideological justification for the Dutch breaking up of various trade monopolies through its formidable naval power. England, competing fiercely with the Dutch for domination of world trade, opposed this idea and claimed in John Selden&#x27;s &quot;Mare clausum&quot; &quot;(The Closed Sea)&quot;, &quot;That the Dominion of the British Sea, or That Which Incompasseth the Isle of Great Britain, is, and Ever Hath Been, a Part or Appendant of the Empire of that Island.&quot;&quot;&quot;

It is generally assumed that Grotius first propounded the principle of freedom of the seas, although all countries in the Indian Ocean and other Asian seas accepted the right of unobstructed navigation long before Grotius wrote his &quot;De Jure Praedae&quot; (&quot;On the Law of Spoils&quot;) in the year of 1604. Additionally, 16th-century Spanish theologian Francisco de Vitoria had postulated the idea of freedom of the seas in a more rudimentary fashion under the principles of &quot;jus gentium&quot;. Grotius&#x27;s notion of the freedom of the seas would persist until the mid-20th century, and it continues to be applied even to this day for much of the high seas, though the application of the concept and the scope of its reach is changing.

==Arminian controversy, arrest and exile==

Aided by his continued association with Van Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius made considerable advances in his political career, being retained as Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s resident advisor in 1605, Advocate General of the Fisc of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland in 1607, and then as Pensionary of Rotterdam (the equivalent of a mayoral office) in 1613. Also in 1613, following the capture of two Dutch ships by the British, he was sent on a mission to London, a mission tailored to a man who wrote &quot;Mare liberum&quot; [&quot;The Free Seas&quot;] in 1609. However, it was opposed by the English by reason of force and he didn&#x27;t obtain the return of the boats.

In these years a great theological controversy broke out between the chair of theology at Leiden Jacobus Arminius and his followers (who are called Arminians or Remonstrants) and the strongly Calvinist theologian, Franciscus Gomarus, whose supporters are termed Gomarists or Counter-Remonstrants.

Leiden University &quot;was under the authority of the States of Holland – they were responsible, among other things, for the policy concerning appointments at this institution, which was governed in their name by a board of Curators – and, in the final instance, the States were responsible for dealing with any cases of heterodoxy among the professors.&quot; The domestic dissension resulting over Arminius&#x27; professorship was overshadowed by the continuing war with Spain, and the professor died in 1609 on the eve of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce. The new peace would move the people&#x27;s focus to the controversy and Arminius&#x27; followers. Grotius played a decisive part in this politico-religious conflict between the Remonstrants, supporters of religious tolerance, and the orthodox Calvinists or Counter-Remonstrants.

===Controversy within Dutch Protestantism===
The controversy expanded when the Remonstrant theologian Conrad Vorstius was appointed to replace Jacobus Arminius as the theology chair at Leiden. Vorstius was soon seen by Counter-Remonstrants as moving beyond the teachings of Arminius into Socinianism and he was accused of teaching irreligion. Leading the call for Vorstius&#x27; removal was theology professor Sibrandus Lubbertus. On the other side, Johannes Wtenbogaert (a Remonstrant leader) and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, Grand Pensionary of Holland, had strongly promoted the appointment of Vorstius and began to defend their actions. Gomarus resigned his professorship at Leyden, in protest that Vorstius was not removed. The Counter-Remonstrants were also supported in their opposition by King James I of England &quot;who thundered loudly against the Leyden nomination and gaudily depicted Vorstius as a horrid heretic. He ordered his books to be publicly burnt in London, Cambridge, and Oxford, and he exerted continual pressure through his ambassador in the Hague, Ralph Winwood, to get the appointment canceled.&quot; James began to shift his confidence from Oldenbarnevelt towards Maurice.

Grotius joined the controversy by defending the civil authorities&#x27; power to appoint (independently of the wishes of religious authorities) whomever they wished to a university&#x27;s faculty. He did this by writing &quot;Ordinum Pietas&quot;, &quot;a pamphlet...directed against an opponent, the Calvinist Franeker professor Lubbertus; it was ordered by Grotius&#x27; masters the States of Holland, and thus written for the occasion – though Grotius may already have had plans for such a book.&quot;

The work is twenty-seven pages long, is &quot;polemical and acrimonious&quot; and only two-thirds of it speaks directly about ecclesiastical politics (mainly of synods and offices). The work met with a violent reaction from the Counter-Remonstrants, and &quot;It might be said that all Grotius&#x27; next works until his arrest in 1618 form a vain attempt to repair the damage done by this book.&quot; Grotius would later write &quot;De Satisfactione&quot; aiming &quot;at proving that the Arminians are far from being Socinians&quot;.

===Edict of toleration===
Led by Oldenbarnevelt, the States of Holland took an official position of religious toleration towards Remonstrants and Counter-Remonstrants. Grotius (who acted during the controversy first as Attorney General of Holland and later as a member of the Committee of Counsellors) was eventually asked to draft an edict to express the policy of toleration. This edict, &quot;Decretum pro pace ecclesiarum&quot; was completed in late 1613 or early 1614. The edict put into practice a view that Grotius had been developing in his writings on church and state (see Erastianism): that only the basic tenets necessary for undergirding civil order (e.g., the existence of God and His providence) ought to be enforced while differences on obscure theological doctrines should be left to private conscience.

The edict &quot;imposing moderation and toleration on the ministry&quot; was backed up by Grotius with &quot;thirty-one pages of quotations, mainly dealing with the Five Remonstrant Articles.&quot; In response to Grotius&#x27; &quot;Ordinum Pietas&quot;, Professor Lubbertus published &quot;Responsio Ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii&quot; in 1614. Later that year, Grotius anonymously published &quot;Bona Fides Sibrandi Lubberti&quot; in response to Lubbertus.

Jacobus Trigland joined Lubberdus in expressing the view that tolerance in matters of doctrine was inadmissible, and in his 1615 works &quot;Den Recht-gematigden Christen: Ofte vande waere Moderatie&quot; and &quot;Advys Over een Concept van moderatie&quot; Trigland denounced Grotius&#x27; stance.

In late 1615, when Middelburg professor Antonius Walaeus published &quot;Het Ampt der Kerckendienaren&quot; (a response to Johannes Wtenbogaert&#x27;s 1610 &quot;Tractaet van &#x27;t Ampt ende authoriteit eener hoogher Christelijcke overheid in kerckelijkcke zaken&quot;) he sent Grotius a copy out of friendship. This was a work &quot;on the relationship between ecclesiastical and secular government&quot; from the moderate counter-remonstrant viewpoint. In early 1616, Grotius also received the 36-page letter championing a remonstrant view &quot;Dissertatio epistolica de Iure magistratus in rebus ecclesiasticis&quot; from his friend Gerardus Vossius.

The letter was &quot;a general introduction on (in)tolerance, mainly on the subject of predestination and the sacrament...[and] an extensive, detailed and generally unfavourable review of Walaeus&#x27; &quot;Ampt&quot;, stuffed with references to ancient and modern authorities.&quot; When Grotius wrote asking for some notes &quot;he received a treasure-house of ecclesiastical history. ...offering ammunition to Grotius, who gratefully accepted it&quot;. Around this time (April 1616) Grotius went to Amsterdam as part of his official duties, trying to persuade the civil authorities there to join Holland&#x27;s majority view about church politics.

In early 1617 Grotius debated the question of giving counter-remonstrants the chance to preach in the Kloosterkerk in The Hague which had been closed. During this time lawsuits were brought against the States of Holland by counter-remonstrant ministers and riots over the controversy broke out in Amsterdam.

===Arrest and exile===
As the conflict between civil and religious authorities escalated, in order to maintain civil order Oldenbarnevelt eventually proposed that local authorities be given the power to raise troops (the Sharp Resolution of August 4, 1617). Such a measure undermined the unity of the Republic&#x27;s military force, the very same reason Spain had managed to retake so much lost territory in the 1580s, something the Captain-General of the republic, Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange could not allow with the treaty nearing its end. Maurice seized the opportunity to solidify the preeminence of the Gomarists, whom he had supported, and to eliminate the nuisance he perceived in Oldenbarnevelt (the latter had previously brokered the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce with Spain in 1609 against Maurice&#x27;s wishes). During this time Grotius made another attempt to address ecclesiastical politics by completing &quot;De Imperio Summarum Potestatum circa Sacra&quot;, on &quot;the relations between the religious and secular authorities...Grotius had even cherished hopes that publication of this book would turn the tide and bring back peace to church and state&quot;.

The conflict between Maurice and the States of Holland, led by Oldenbarnevelt and Grotius, about the Sharp Resolution and Holland&#x27;s refusal to allow a National Synod, came to a head in July 1619 when a majority in the States General authorized Maurice to disband the auxiliary troops in Utrecht. Grotius went on a mission to the States of Utrecht to stiffen their resistance against this move, but Maurice prevailed. The States General then authorized him to arrest Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Rombout Hogerbeets on 29 August 1618. They were tried by a court of delegated judges from the States General. Van Oldenbarnevelt was sentenced to death and was beheaded in 1619. Grotius was sentenced to life imprisonment and transferred to Loevestein Castle.

From his imprisonment in Loevestein, Grotius made a written justification of his position &quot;as to my views on the power of the Christian [civil] authorities in ecclesiastical matters, I refer to my...booklet &quot;De Pietate Ordinum Hollandiae&quot; and especially to an unpublished book &quot;De Imperio summarum potestatum circa sacra&quot;, where I have treated the matter in more detail...I may summarize my feelings thus: that the [civil] authorities should scrutinize God&#x27;s Word so thoroughly as to be certain to impose nothing which is against it; if they act in this way, they shall in good conscience have control of the public churches and public worship – but without persecuting those who err from the right way.&quot; Because this stripped Church officials of any power some of their members (such as Johannes Althusius in a letter to Lubbertus) declared Grotius&#x27; ideas diabolical.

In 1621, with the help of his wife and his maidservant, Elsje van Houwening, Grotius managed to escape the castle in a book chest and fled to Paris. In the Netherlands today, he is mainly famous for this daring escape. Both the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the museum Het Prinsenhof in Delft claim to have the original book chest in their collection.

==Life in Paris==
Grotius then fled to Paris, where the authorities granted him an annual royal pension. Grotius lived in France almost continuously from 1621 to 1644. His stay coincides with the period (1624-1642) during which the Cardinal Richelieu led France under the authority of Louis XIII. In France in 1625 Grotius published his most famous book, &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; [&quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot;] dedicated to Louis XIII of France.

While in Paris, Grotius set about rendering into Latin prose a work which he had originally written as Dutch verse in prison, providing rudimentary yet systematic arguments for the truth of Christianity. The Dutch poem, &quot;Bewijs van den waren Godsdienst&quot;, was published in 1622, the Latin treatise in 1627, under the title &quot;De veritate religionis Christianae&quot;.

In 1631, he tried to return to Holland, but the authorities remained hostile to him. He moved to Hamburg in 1632. But as early as 1634, the Swedes - a European superpower - sent him to Paris as ambassador. He remained in this position for ten years, where he had the mission to negotiate for Sweden at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. During this period, he had been interested in the unity of Christians and published many texts that would posthumously (1679) be published under the title of &quot;Opera Omnia Theologica&quot;.

===Governmental theory of atonement===
Grotius also developed a particular view of the atonement of Christ known as the &quot;Governmental theory of atonement&quot;. He theorized that Jesus&#x27; sacrificial death occurred in order for the Father to forgive while still maintaining his just rule over the universe. This idea, further developed by theologians such as John Miley, became one of the prominent views of the atonement in Methodist Arminianism.

==&quot;De Jure Belli ac Pacis&quot;==

Living in the times of the Eighty Years&#x27; War between Spain and the Netherlands and the Thirty Years&#x27; War between Catholic and Protestant European nations (Catholic France being in the otherwise Protestant camp), it is not surprising that Grotius was deeply concerned with matters of conflicts between nations and religions. His most lasting work, begun in prison and published during his exile in Paris, was a monumental effort to restrain such conflicts on the basis of a broad moral consensus. Grotius wrote:
Fully convinced...that there is a common law among nations, which is valid alike for war and in war, I have had many and weighty reasons for undertaking to write upon the subject. Throughout the Christian world, I observed a lack of restraint in relation to war, such as even barbarous races should be ashamed of; I observed that men rush to arms for slight causes or no cause at all and that when arms have once been taken up, there is no longer any respect for the law, divine or human; it is as if, in accordance with a general decree, frenzy had openly been let loose for the committing of all crimes.
&quot;De jure belli ac pacis libri tres&quot; (&quot;On the Law of War and Peace: Three books&quot;) was first published in 1625, dedicated to Grotius&#x27; current patron, Louis XIII. The treatise advances a system of principles of natural law, which are held to be binding on all people and nations regardless of local custom. The work is divided into three books:
* Book I advances his conception of war and of natural justice, arguing that there are some circumstances in which war is justifiable.
* Book II identifies three &#x27;just causes&#x27; for war: self-defense, reparation of injury, and punishment; Grotius considers a wide variety of circumstances under which these rights of war attach and when they do not.
* Book III takes up the question of what rules govern the conduct of war once it has begun; influentially, Grotius argued that all parties to war are bound by such rules, whether their cause is just or not.

* Further information: &quot;Temperamenta belli&quot;

==Natural law==
Grotius&#x27; concept of natural law had a strong impact on the philosophical and theological debates and political developments of the 17th and 18th centuries. Among those he influenced were Samuel Pufendorf and John Locke, and by way of these philosophers, his thinking became part of the cultural background of the Glorious Revolution in England and the American Revolution. In Grotius&#x27; understanding, nature was not an entity in itself but God&#x27;s creation. Therefore, his concept of natural law had a theological foundation. The Old Testament contained moral precepts (e.g. the Decalogue), which Christ confirmed and therefore were still valid. They were useful in interpreting the content of natural law. Both Biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could, therefore, not contradict each other.

==Later years==
Many exiled Remonstrants began to return to the Netherlands after the death of Prince Maurice in 1625 when toleration was granted to them. In 1630, they were allowed complete freedom to build and run churches and schools and to live anywhere in Holland. The Remonstrants guided by Johannes Wtenbogaert set up a presbyterial organization. They established a theological seminary at Amsterdam where Grotius came to teach alongside Episcopius, van Limborch, de Courcelles, and Leclerc.

In 1634, Grotius was given the opportunity to serve as Sweden&#x27;s ambassador to France. Axel Oxenstierna, regent of the successor of the recently deceased Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus, was keen to have Grotius in his employ. Grotius accepted the offer and took up diplomatic residence in Paris, which remained his home until he was released from his post in 1645.

In 1644, the queen Christine of Sweden, who had become an adult, began to perform her duties and brought him back to Stockholm. During the winter of 1644–1645, he went to Sweden in difficult conditions, which he decided to leave in the summer of 1645.

While departing from his last visit to Sweden, Grotius was shipwrecked on the voyage. He washed up on the shore of Rostock, ill and weather-beaten, and on August 28, 1645, he died; his body at last returned to the country of his youth, being laid to rest in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft.

==Personal life==
Grotius&#x27; personal motto was &quot;Ruit hora&quot; (&quot;Time is running away&quot;); his last words were purportedly, &quot;By understanding many things, I have accomplished nothing&quot; (&quot;Door veel te begrijpen, heb ik niets bereikt&quot;). Significant friends and acquaintances of his included the theologian Franciscus Junius, the poet Daniel Heinsius, the philologist Gerhard Johann Vossius, the historian Johannes Meursius, the engineer Simon Stevin, the historian Jacques Auguste de Thou, the Orientalist and Arabic scholar Erpinius, and the French ambassador in the Dutch Republic, Benjamin Aubery du Maurier, who allowed him to use the French diplomatic mail in the first years of his exile. He was also friends with the Brabantian Jesuit Andreas Schottus.

Grotius was the father of regent and diplomat Pieter de Groot.

==Influence of Grotius==
Grotius designed his theory to apply not only to states but also to rulers and subjects of law in general. Grotius&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;De Jure Belli ac Pacis&quot; thus proved useful in the later development of theories of both private and criminal law.

=== From his time to the end of the 17th century ===
The king of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, was said to have always carried a copy of &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; in his saddle when leading his troops. In contrast, King James VI and I of Great Britain reacted very negatively to Grotius&#x27; presentation of the book during a diplomatic mission.

Some philosophers, notably Protestants such as Pierre Bayle, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and the main representatives of the Scottish Enlightenment Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, David Hume, Thomas Reid held him in high esteem. The French Enlightenment, on the other hand, was much more critical. Voltaire called it boring and Rousseau developed an alternative conception of human nature. Pufendorf, another theoretician of the natural law concept, was also skeptical.

===Commentaries of the 18th century===
Andrew Dickson White wrote:
Into the very midst of all this welter of evil, at a point in time to all appearance hopeless, at a point in space apparently defenseless, in a nation of which every man, woman, and child was under sentence of death from its sovereign, was born a man who wrought as no other has ever done for the redemption of civilization from the main cause of all that misery; who thought out for Europe the precepts of right reason in international law; who made them heard; who gave a noble change to the course of human affairs; whose thoughts, reasonings, suggestions, and appeals produced an environment in which came an evolution of humanity that still continues.
In contrast, Robert A. Heinlein satirized the Grotian governmental approach to theology in &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;: &quot;There is an old, old story about a theologian who was asked to reconcile the doctrine of Divine Mercy with the doctrine of infant damnation. &#x27;The Almighty,&#x27; he explained, &#x27;finds it necessary to do things in His official and public capacity which in His private and personal capacity He deplores.&#x27;&quot;

=== Revival of interest in the 20th century ===
The influence of Grotius declined following the rise of positivism in the field of international law and the decline of natural law in philosophy. The Carnegie Foundation has nevertheless re-issued and re-translated &quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot; after the World War I. At the end of the 20th century, his work aroused renewed interest as a controversy over the originality of his ethical work developed. For Irwing, Grotius would only repeat the contributions of Thomas Aquinas and Francisco Suárez. On the contrary, Schneewind argues that Grotius introduced the idea that &quot;the conflict can not be eradicated and could not be dismissed, even in principle, by the most comprehensive metaphysical knowledge possible of how the world is made up&quot;.

As far as politics is concerned, Grotius is most often considered not so much as having brought new ideas but rather as one who has introduced a new way of approaching political problems. For Kingsbury and Roberts, &quot;the most important direct contribution of [&quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot;] lies in the way it systematically brings together practices and authorities on the traditional but fundamental subject of &quot;jus belli&quot;, which he organizes for the first time from a body of principles rooted in the law of nature.&quot;

<text>The denomination 322 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

In the pre-Julian Roman calendar, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Rullianus and Curvus.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Spring/summer – The Macedonian admiral Cleitus the White defeats the Athenian navy at the Battle of the Echinades and the Battle of Amorgos, ending Athenian thalassocracy in the Aegean.
* The Athenians and their allies&#x27; siege of the Macedonian ruler, Antipater, in Lamia is relieved by Leonnatus with an army of 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry. Leonnatus is killed in the action.
* September 5 – Craterus arrives to defeat the Athenians in the Battle of Crannon. This battle marks a complete victory for Antipater in the Lamian War.
* The Athenian orator and diplomat, Demades, regains his citizenship so that he and Phocion can negotiate a peace with Antipater, thus concluding the Lamian War. Before setting out he persuades the citizens of Athens to pass the death sentence upon Demosthenes and his followers (including Hypereides, leader of the Athenian patriotic party). Demades&#x27; embassy results in a peace disadvantageous to the Athenians, with the Athenians forced to accept the occupation of Athens&#x27; port, Piraeus, by the Macedonians.
* Demosthenes flees from the Macedonians who demand his surrender. Upon being arrested, he takes poison and dies.
* Hypereides flees to Aegina only to be captured by the Macedonians at the temple of Poseidon and put to death.
* The League of Corinth is dissolved.

==== Egypt ====
* By custom, kings in Macedonia assert their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. To pre-empt Perdiccas, the imperial regent, Ptolemy has Alexander the Great&#x27;s body brought to Memphis, Egypt and buried there in a gold sarcophagus. Ptolemy then marries Alexander&#x27;s mistress, Thaïs and commences to reign as king of Egypt and the adjacent Libyan and Arabian regions.
* Ptolemy, taking advantage of internal disturbances, acquires the African Hellenic towns of Cyrenaica without the authority of Perdiccas.
* Ptolemy executes his deputy, Cleomenes of Naucratis, on the suspicion that Cleomenes favours Perdiccas. This action removes the chief check on his authority, and allows Ptolemy to obtain the sizable funds that Cleomenes has accumulated.

==== India ====
* Chandragupta Maurya captures Magadha: Chandragupta, with the help of Chanakya (Kautilya), who is also known as the Indian Machiavelli, destroys the Nanda rulers of Magadha and establishes the Maurya Empire. It is said that Chanakya met Chandragupta in the Vindhya forest, after being insulted by the Nanda king.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* October 12 – Demosthenes, Athenian statesman, recognized as the greatest of ancient Greek orators (b. 384 BC)
* Ariarathes I of Cappadocia, Achaemenid satrap, founder of the Iranian Ariarathid dynasty
* Aristotle, Greek philosopher and scientist (b. 384 BC)
* Cleomenes of Naucratis, Greek deputy to the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, Ptolemy
* Hypereides, Athenian orator (b. 390 BC)
* Leonnatus, Macedonian officer under Alexander the Great and one of the diadochi (b. 356 BC)

<doc id="66614" wikidata="Q739589" url="?curid=66614" title="Ornament (music)">
<text>In music, ornaments or embellishments are musical flourishes—typically, added notes—that are not essential to carry the overall line of the melody (or harmony), but serve instead to decorate or &quot;ornament&quot; that line (or harmony), provide added interest and variety, and give the performer the opportunity to add expressiveness to a song or piece. Many ornaments are performed as &quot;fast notes&quot; around a central, main note.

There are many types of ornaments, ranging from the addition of a single, short grace note before a main note to the performance of a virtuosic and flamboyant trill. The amount of ornamentation in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive (it was often extensive in the Baroque period, from 1600 to 1750) to relatively little or even none. The word &quot;agrément&quot; is used specifically to indicate the French Baroque style of ornamentation.

== Improvised vs. written ==

In the Baroque period, it was common for performers to improvise ornamentation on a given melodic line. A singer performing a da capo aria, for instance, would sing the melody relatively unornamented the first time and decorate it with additional flourishes and trills the second time. Similarly, a harpsichord player performing a simple melodic line was expected to be able to improvise harmonically and stylistically appropriate trills, mordents (upper or lower) and appoggiaturas.

Ornamentation may also be indicated by the composer. A number of standard ornaments (described below) are indicated with standard symbols in music notation, while other ornamentations may be appended to the score in small notes, or simply written out normally as fully sized notes. Frequently, a composer will have his or her own vocabulary of ornaments, which will be explained in a preface, much like a code. A grace note is a note written in smaller type, with or without a slash through it, to indicate that its note value does not count as part of the total time value of the bar. Alternatively, the term may refer more generally to any of the small notes used to mark some other ornament (see below), or in association with some other ornament&#x27;s indication (see below), regardless of the timing used in the execution.

In Spain, melodies ornamented upon repetition (&quot;divisions&quot;) were called &quot;diferencias&quot;, and can be traced back to 1538, when Luis de Narváez published the first collection of such music for the vihuela.

== Types ==

===Trill===
A trill, also known as a &quot;shake&quot;, is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above it. In simple music, trills may be diatonic, using just the notes of the scale; in other cases, the trill may be chromatic. The trill is usually indicated by either a or a , with the ~ representing the length of the trill, above the staff.

At a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:

In Baroque music, the trill is sometimes indicated with a + (plus) sign above or below the note.

In the late 18th century, when performers played a trill, it always started from the upper note. However, &quot;[Heinrich Christoph] Koch expressed no preference and observed that it was scarcely a matter of much importance whether the trill began one way or the other, since there was no audible difference after the initial note had been sounded.&quot; Clive Brown writes that &quot;Despite three different ways of showing the trills, it seems likely that a trill beginning with the upper note and ending with a turn was envisaged in each case.&quot;

Sometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few grace notes following the note that bears the trill indication.

There is also a single tone trill variously called &quot;trillo&quot; or &quot;tremolo&quot; in late Renaissance and early Baroque. Trilling on a single note is particularly idiomatic for the bowed strings.

===Mordent===

A mordent is a rapid alternation between an indicated note, the note above (called the &quot;upper mordent&quot;, &quot;pralltriller&quot;, or simply &quot;mordent&quot;) or below (called the &quot;inverted mordent&quot; or &quot;lower mordent&quot;), and the indicated note again. The upper mordent is indicated by a short thick tilde (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it.

As with the trill, the exact speed with which a mordent is performed will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but, at a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:

Confusion over the meaning of the unadorned word &quot;mordent&quot; has led to the modern terms &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; mordent being used, rather than &quot;mordent&quot; and &quot;inverted mordent&quot;. Practice, notation, and nomenclature vary widely for all of these ornaments; that is to say, whether, by including the symbol for a mordent in a musical score, a composer intended the direction of the additional note (or notes) to be played above or below the principal note written on the sheet music varies according to when the piece was written, and in which country.

In the Baroque period, a &quot;mordant&quot; (the German or Scottish equivalent of &quot;mordent&quot;) was what later came to be called an &quot;inverted mordent&quot; and what is now often called a &quot;lower mordent&quot;. In the 19th century, however, the name &quot;mordent&quot; was generally applied to what is now called the &quot;upper&quot; mordent. Although mordents are now thought of as a single alternation between notes, in the Baroque period a &quot;mordant&quot; may have sometimes been executed with more than one alternation between the indicated note and the note below, making it a sort of inverted trill. Mordents of all sorts might typically, in some periods, begin with an extra &quot;inessential note&quot; (the lesser, added note), rather than with the &quot;principal note&quot; as shown in the examples here. The same applies to trills, which in the Baroque and Classical periods would begin with the added, upper note. A &quot;lower&quot; inessential note may or may not be chromatically raised (that is, with a natural, a sharp, or even a double sharp) to make it one semitone lower than the principal note.

=== Turn ===

A turn is a short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a backwards S-shape lying on its side, sometimes known as an &quot;inverted lazy S&quot;, above the staff. The details of its execution depend partly on the exact placement of the turn mark. For instance, the turns below

may be executed as

The exact speed with which a turn is executed can vary, as can its rhythm. The question of how a turn is best executed is largely one of context, convention, and taste. The lower and upper added notes may or may not be chromatically raised.

An inverted turn (the note below the one indicated, the note itself, the note above it, and the note itself again) is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.

=== Appoggiatura ===


An appoggiatura ( , ) is an added note that is important melodically (unlike an acciaccatura) and suspends the principal note by a portion of its time-value, often about half, but this may be considerably more or less depending on the context. The added note (the auxiliary note) is one degree higher or lower than the principal note, and may or may not be chromatically altered. Appoggiaturas are also usually on the strong or strongest beat of the resolution, are themselves emphasised, and are approached by a leap and left by a step in the opposite direction of the leap.

An appoggiatura is often written as a grace note prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character, without the oblique stroke:

This may be executed as follows:

=== Acciaccatura ===
The word &quot;acciaccatura&quot; (, ; ) comes from the Italian verb &quot;&quot;, &quot;to crush&quot;. In the 18th century, it was an ornament applied to any of the main notes of arpeggiated chords, either a tone or semitone below the chord tone, struck simultaneously with it and then immediately released. Hence the German translation &quot;Zusammenschlag&quot; (together-stroke).

In the 19th century, the acciaccatura (sometimes called &quot;short appoggiatura&quot;) came to be a shorter variant of the &quot;long appoggiatura&quot;, where the delay of the principal note is quick. It is written using a grace note (often a quaver, or eighth note), with an oblique stroke through the stem. In the Classical period, an acciaccatura is usually performed before the beat and the emphasis is on the main note, not the grace note. The &quot;appoggiatura&quot; long or short has the emphasis on the grace note.

The exact interpretation of this will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but the following is possible:

Whether the note should be played before or on the beat is largely a question of taste and performance practice. Exceptionally, the acciaccatura may be notated in the bar preceding the note to which it is attached, showing that it is to be played before the beat. The implication also varies with the composer and the period. For example, Mozart&#x27;s and Haydn&#x27;s long appoggiaturas are – to the eye – indistinguishable from Mussorgsky&#x27;s and Prokofiev&#x27;s before-the-beat acciaccaturas.

===Glissando===
A glissando is a slide from one note to another, signified by a wavy line connecting the two notes.

All of the intervening diatonic or chromatic notes (depending on instrument and context) are heard, albeit very briefly. In this way, the glissando differs from portamento. In contemporary classical music (especially in avant garde pieces), a glissando tends to assume the whole value of the initial note.

===Slide===
A slide (or &quot;Schleifer&quot; in German) instructs the performer to begin one or two diatonic steps below the marked note and slide upward. The schleifer usually includes a prall trill or mordent trill at the end. Willard A. Palmer writes that &quot;[t]he schleifer is a &#x27;sliding&#x27; ornament, usually used to fill in the gap between a note and the previous one.&quot;

===&quot;Nachschlag&quot;===

The word &quot;Nachschlag&quot; () translates, literally, to &quot;after-beat&quot;, and refers to &quot;the two notes that sometimes terminate a trill, and which, when taken in combination with the last two notes of the shake, may form a turn&quot;. The term &quot;Nachschlag&quot; may also refer to &quot;an ornament that took the form of a supplementary note that, when placed after a main note, &#x27;steals&#x27; time from it&quot;.

The first definition of &quot;Nachschlag&quot; refers to the &quot;shaken&quot; or trilled version of the ornament, while the second definition refers to the &quot;smooth&quot; version. This ornament has also been referred to as a &quot;cadent&quot; or a &quot;springer&quot; in English Baroque performance practice. Instruction books from the Baroque period, such as Christopher Simpson&#x27;s &quot;The Division Violist&quot;, refer to the &quot;cadent&quot; as an ornament in which &quot;a Note is sometimes graced by joyning part of its sound to the note following... whose following Quaver is Placed with the ensuing Note, but played with the same Bow.&quot;

==In Western classical music==
===Renaissance and early Baroque music===

From Silvestro Ganassi&#x27;s treatise in 1535 we have instructions and examples of how musicians of the Renaissance and early Baroque periods decorated their music with improvised ornaments. Michael Praetorius spoke warmly of musicians&#x27; &quot;sundry good and merry pranks with little runs/leaps&quot;.

Until the last decade of the 16th century the emphasis is on &quot;divisions&quot;, also known as &quot;diminutions&quot;, &quot;passaggi&quot; (in Italian), &quot;gorgia&quot; (&quot;throat&quot;, first used as a term for vocal ornamentation by Nicola Vicentino in 1555), or &quot;glosas&quot; (by Ortiz, in both Spanish and Italian) – a way to decorate a simple cadence or interval with extra shorter notes. These start as simple passing notes, progress to step-wise additions and in the most complicated cases are rapid passages of equal valued notes – virtuosic flourishes. There are rules for designing them, to make sure that the original structure of the music is left intact. Towards the end of this period the divisions detailed in the treatises contain more dotted and other uneven rhythms and leaps of more than one step at a time.

Starting with (1589), the treatises bring in a new set of expressive devices called &quot;graces&quot; alongside the divisions. These have a lot more rhythmic interest and are filled with affect as composers took much more interest in text portrayal. It starts with the &quot;trillo&quot; and &quot;cascate&quot;, and by the time we reach Francesco Rognoni (1620) we are also told about fashionable ornaments: , , , , and .

=== Baroque music ===

Ornaments in Baroque music take on a different meaning. Most ornaments occur on the beat, and use diatonic intervals more exclusively than ornaments in later periods do. While any table of ornaments must give a strict presentation, consideration has to be given to the tempo and note length, since at rapid tempos it would be difficult or impossible to play all of the notes that are usually required. One realisation of some common Baroque ornaments is set in the following table from the &quot;Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach&quot; by J.S. Bach:

Another realisation can be seen in the table in Pièces de clavecin (1689) by &quot;Jean-Henri d&#x27;Anglebert&quot;:
=== Classical period ===
In the late 18th and early 19th century, there were no standard ways of performing ornaments and sometimes several distinct ornaments might be performed in a same way.

In the 19th century, performers were adding or improvising ornaments on compositions. As C.P.E Bach observed, &quot;pieces in which all ornaments are indicated need give no trouble; on the other hand, pieces in which little or nothing is marked must be supplied with ornaments in the usual way.&quot; Clive Brown explains that &quot;For many connoisseurs of that period the individuality of a performer&#x27;s embellishment of the divine notation was a vital part of the musical experience.&quot;

In Beethoven&#x27;s work, however, there should not be any additional ornament added from a performer. Even in Mozart&#x27;s compositions, ornaments not included in the score are not allowed, as Brown explains: &quot;Most of the chamber music from Mozart onwards that still remains in the repertoire belongs to the kind in which every note is thought out and which tolerates virtually no ornamental additions of the type under consideration here...&quot; Recent scholarship has however brought this statement in question.

==In other music==
===Jazz===
Jazz music incorporates a wide variety of ornaments including many of the classical ones mentioned above as well as a number of their own. Most of these ornaments are added either by performers during their solo extemporizations or as written ornaments. While these ornaments have universal names, their realizations and effects vary depending on the instrument. Jazz music incorporates most of the standard &quot;classical&quot; ornaments, such as trills, grace notes, mordents, glissandi and turns but adds a variety of additional ornaments such as &quot;dead&quot; or ghost notes (a percussive sound, notated by an &quot;X&quot;), &quot;doit&quot; notes and &quot;fall&quot; notes (annotated by curved lines above the note, indicating by direction of curve that the note should either rapidly rise or fall on the scale), squeezes (notated by a curved line from an &quot;X&quot; to a specific pitch, that denotes an un-pitched glissando), and shakes (notated by a squiggly line over a note, which indicates a fast lip trill for brass players and a minor third trill for winds).

=== Indian classical music ===
In Carnatic music, the Sanskrit term &quot;gamaka&quot; (which means &quot;to move&quot;) is used to denote ornamentation. One of the most unusual forms of ornamentation in world music is the Carnatic &quot;kampitam&quot; which is about oscillating a note in diverse ways by varying amplitude, speed or number of times the note is oscillated. This is a highly subtle, yet scientific ornamentation as the same note can be oscillated in different ways based on the raga or context within a raga. For instance, the fourth note (Ma) in Shankarabharanam or Begada allows at least three to five types of oscillation based on the phrasings within the raga.

Another important gamaka in Carnatic is the &quot;Sphuritam&quot; which is about rendering a note twice but forcefully from a grace note immediately below it the second time. For instance, the third note (Ga) would be rendered plain first time and with a force from the second (Ri) the next time.

===Celtic music===
Ornamentation is a major distinguishing characteristic of Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and Cape Breton music. A singer, fiddler, flautist, harpist, tin whistler, piper or a player of another instrument may add grace notes (known as &#x27;cuts&#x27; / &#x27;strikes&#x27; in Irish fiddling), slides, rolls, cranns, doubling, mordents, drones, trebles (or birls in Scottish fiddling), or a variety of other ornaments to a given melody.

<text>Year 321 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Calvinus and Caudinus (or, less frequently, year 433 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 321 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Antipater appoints Antigonus commander in chief of his army in Asia Minor and sends him with Craterus to fight against Eumenes, the satrap of Cappadocia and a supporter of Perdiccas.
* Leaving Eumenes to hold Asia Minor against Craterus and Antigonus, Perdiccas marches against Ptolemy, but when he fails to cross the Nile he is murdered by mutinous officers. Prominent among the mutineers is Seleucus. A truce is arranged, leaving Ptolemy in power in Egypt and Seleucus in power in Babylon.
* The key remaining generals (diadochi) of the late Alexander the Great agree to the Partition of Triparadisus (a town in northern Syria). This is a power-sharing agreement providing for a new regent to replace Perdiccas and it repartitions the satrapies of the empire that has been created by Alexander the Great. It follows but modifies the Partition of Babylon made two years earlier following the death of Alexander the Great. Under the agreement, Antipater becomes the regent of the Macedonian Empire on behalf of the two kings: the intellectually retarded Philip III Arrhidaeus and the infant Alexander IV of Macedon while Ptolemy is confirmed in possession of Egypt and Cyrene.
* Ptolemy further strengthens his position amongst the diadochi by marrying Eurydice, the third daughter of Antipater.
* Antigonus and Craterus defeat Eumenes in battle but Eumenes escapes. Antigonus and Craterus then besiege him unsuccessfully in the mountain fortress of Nora on the border between Cappadocia and Lycaonia. Craterus is killed during the fighting against Eumenes when his charging horse (Diodorus) falls over him.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Continuing successes by Rome&#x27;s armies against the Samnites forces the Samnites to sue for peace. However, the terms offered by Rome are so stringent that they are rejected by the Samnites and the war goes on.
* Two Roman consuls, Spurius Postumius Albinus and Titus Veturius Calvinus, leading an invading force into Samnium, are trapped in a mountain pass known as the Caudine Forks (Caudium) near Beneventum, where they can neither advance nor retire, and after a desperate struggle, they are forced to submit to the humiliating terms imposed by the Samnite victor, Gaius Pontius. The captured consuls pledge themselves to a five-year treaty on terms most favourable for the Samnites.

==== India ====
* Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan empire, establishes himself as the king of Magadha.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Craterus, Macedonian general (b. c. 370 BC)
* Perdiccas, Macedonian general and regent after the death of Alexander the Great (b. c. 365 BC)
* Zhou Xian Wang, King of the Zhou Dynasty of China

<doc id="66618" wikidata="Q277111" url="?curid=66618" title="The Limits to Growth">
<text>The Limits to Growth (LTG) is a 1972 report that discussed the possibility of exponential economic and population growth with finite supply of resources, studied by computer simulation. The study used the World3 computer model to simulate the consequence of interactions between the Earth and human systems. The model was based on the work of Jay Forrester of MIT, as described in his book &quot;World Dynamics&quot;.

Commissioned by the Club of Rome, the study saw its findings first presented at international gatherings in Moscow and Rio de Janeiro in the summer of 1971. The report&#x27;s authors are Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, Jørgen Randers, and William W. Behrens III, representing a team of 17 researchers.

The report&#x27;s findings suggest that, in the absence of significant alterations in resource utilization and environmental destruction, it is highly likely that there will be an abrupt and unmanageable decrease in both population and industrial capacity. Although it faced severe criticism and scrutiny upon its release, the report influenced environmental reforms for decades. Subsequent analysis notes that global use of natural resources has been inadequately reformed to alter its expected outcome. Yet price predictions based on resource scarcity failed to materialize in the years since publication. 

Since its publication, some 30 million copies of the book in 30 languages have been purchased. It continues to generate debate and has been the subject of several subsequent publications.

&quot;Beyond the Limits&quot; and &quot;The Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update&quot; were published in 1992 and 2004 respectively; in 2012, a 40-year forecast from Jørgen Randers, one of the book&#x27;s original authors, was published as &quot;2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years&quot;; and in 2022 two of the original &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; authors, Dennis Meadows and Jørgen Randers, joined 19 other contributors to produce &quot;Limits and Beyond&quot;.
==Purpose==
In commissioning the MIT team to undertake the project that resulted in &quot;LTG&quot;, the Club of Rome had three objectives:
# Gain insights into the limits of our world system and the constraints it puts on human numbers and activity.
# Identify and study the dominant elements, and their interactions, that influence the long-term behavior of world systems.
# To warn of the likely outcome of contemporary economic and industrial policies, with a view to influencing changes to a sustainable lifestyle.

==Method==
The World3 model is based on five variables: &quot;population, food production, industrialization, pollution, and consumption of nonrenewable natural resources&quot;. At the time of the study, all these variables were increasing and were assumed to continue to grow exponentially, while the ability of technology to increase resources grew only linearly. The authors intended to explore the possibility of a sustainable feedback pattern that would be achieved by altering growth trends among the five variables under three scenarios. They noted that their projections for the values of the variables in each scenario were predictions &quot;only in the most limited sense of the word&quot;, and were only indications of the system&#x27;s behavioral tendencies. Two of the scenarios saw &quot;overshoot and collapse&quot; of the global system by the mid- to latter-part of the 21st century, while a third scenario resulted in a &quot;stabilized world&quot;.

===Exponential reserve index===
A key idea in &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; is the notion that if the rate of resource use is increasing, the number of reserves cannot be calculated by simply taking the current known reserves and dividing them by the current yearly usage, as is typically done to obtain a static index. For example, in 1972, the amount of chromium reserves was 775 million metric tons, of which 1.85 million metric tons were mined annually. The static index is 775/1.85=418 years, but the rate of chromium consumption was growing at 2.6 percent annually, or exponentially. If instead of assuming a constant rate of usage, the assumption of a constant rate of growth of 2.6 percent annually is made, the resource will instead last
:formula_1

In general, the formula for calculating the amount of time left for a resource with constant consumption growth is:
:formula_2
where:
:&quot;y&quot; = years left;
:&quot;r&quot; = the continuous compounding growth rate;
:&quot;s&quot; = R/C or static reserve;
:&quot;R&quot; = reserve;
:&quot;C&quot; = (annual) consumption.

==== Commodity reserve extrapolation ====
The chapter contains a large table that spans five pages in total, based on actual geological reserves data for a total of 19 non-renewable resources, and analyzes their reserves at 1972 modeling time of their exhaustion under three scenarios: static (constant growth), exponential, and exponential with reserves multiplied by 5 to account for possible discoveries. A short excerpt from the table is presented below:

The chapter also contains a detailed computer model of chromium availability with current (as of 1972) and double the known reserves as well as numerous statements on the current increasing price trends for discussed metals:

==== Interpretations of the exhaustion model ====
Due to the detailed nature and use of actual resources and their real-world price trends, the indexes have been interpreted as a prediction of the number of years until the world would &quot;run out&quot; of them, both by environmentalist groups calling for greater conservation and restrictions on use and by skeptics criticizing the accuracy of the predictions. This interpretation has been widely propagated by media and environmental organizations, and authors who, apart from a note about the possibility of the future flows being &quot;more complicated&quot;, did not clearly constrain or deny this interpretation.

While environmental organizations used it to support their arguments, a number of economists used it to criticize &quot;LTG&quot; as a whole shortly after publication in the 1970s (Peter Passel, Marc Roberts, and Leonard Ross), with similar criticism reoccurring from Ronald Baily, George Goodman and others in the 1990s. In 2011 Ugo Bardi in &quot;The Limits to Growth Revisited&quot; argued that &quot;nowhere in the book was it stated that the numbers were supposed to be read as predictions&quot;, nonetheless as they were the only tangible numbers referring to actual resources, they were promptly picked as such by both supporters as well as opponents. 

While Chapter 2 serves as an introduction to the concept of exponential growth modeling, the actual World3 model uses an abstract &quot;non-renewable resources&quot; component based on static coefficients rather than the actual physical commodities described above.

==Conclusions==
After reviewing their computer simulations, the research team came to the following conclusions:
The introduction goes on to say:
==Criticism==

&quot;LTG&quot; provoked a wide range of responses, including immediate criticisms almost as soon as it was published.

Peter Passell and two co-authors published a 2 April 1972 article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; describing &quot;LTG&quot; as &quot;an empty and misleading work ... best summarized ... as a rediscovery of the oldest maxim of computer science: Garbage In, Garbage Out&quot;. Passell found the study&#x27;s simulation to be simplistic while assigning little value to the role of technological progress in solving the problems of resource depletion, pollution, and food production. They charged that all &quot;LTG&quot; simulations ended in collapse, predicting the imminent end of irreplaceable resources. Passell also charged that the entire endeavour was motivated by a hidden agenda: to halt growth in its tracks.

In 1973, a group of researchers at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex concluded that simulations in &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; were very sensitive to a few key assumptions and suggest that the MIT assumptions were unduly pessimistic, and the MIT methodology, data, and projections were faulty. However, the &quot;LTG&quot; team, in a paper entitled &quot;A Response to Sussex&quot;, described and analyzed five major areas of disagreement between themselves and the Sussex authors. The team asserted that the Sussex critics applied &quot;micro reasoning to macro problems&quot;, and suggested that their own arguments had been either misunderstood or wilfully misrepresented. They pointed out that the critics had failed to suggest any alternative model for the interaction of growth processes and resource availability, and &quot;nor had they described in precise terms the sort of social change and technological advances that they believe would accommodate current growth processes.&quot;

During that period, the very idea of any worldwide constraint, as indicated in the study, was met with scepticism and opposition by both businesses and the majority of economists. Critics declared that history proved the projections to be incorrect, such as the predicted resource depletion and associated economic collapse by the end of the 20th century. The methodology, the computer, the conclusions, the rhetoric and the people behind the project were criticised. Yale economist Henry C. Wallich agreed that growth could not continue indefinitely, but that a natural end to growth was preferable to intervention. Wallich stated that technology could solve all the problems the report was concerned about, but only if growth continued apace. According to Wallich&#x27;s cautionary statement, prematurely halting progress would result in the perpetual impoverishment of billions.

Julian Simon, a professor at the Universities of Illinois and, later, Maryland, argued that the fundamental underlying concepts of the LTG scenarios were faulty because the very idea of what constitutes a &quot;resource&quot; varies over time. For instance, wood was the primary shipbuilding resource until the 1800s, and there were concerns about prospective wood shortages from the 1500s on. But then boats began to be made of iron, later steel, and the shortage issue disappeared. Simon argued in his book &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot; that human ingenuity creates new resources as required from the raw materials of the universe. For instance, copper will never &quot;run out&quot;. History demonstrates that as it becomes scarcer its price will rise and more will be found, more will be recycled, new techniques will use less of it, and at some point a better substitute will be found for it altogether. His book was revised and reissued in 1996 as &quot;The Ultimate Resource 2&quot;.

To the US Congress in 1973, Allen V. Kneese and Ronald Riker of Resources for the Future (RFF) testified that in their view, &quot;The authors load their case by letting some things grow exponentially and others not. Population, capital and pollution grow exponentially in all models, but technologies for expanding resources and controlling pollution are permitted to grow, if at all, only in discrete increments.&quot; However, their testimony also noted the possibility of &quot;relatively firm long-term limits&quot; associated with carbon dioxide emissions, that humanity might &quot;loose upon itself, or the ecosystem services on which it depends, a disastrously virulent substance&quot;, and (implying that population growth in &quot;developing countries&quot; is problematic) that &quot;we don&#x27;t know what to do about it&quot;.

In 1997, the Italian economist Giorgio Nebbia observed that the negative reaction to the &quot;LTG&quot; study came from at least four sources: those who saw the book as a threat to their business or industry; professional economists, who saw &quot;LTG&quot; as an uncredentialed encroachment on their professional ; the Catholic church, which bridled at the suggestion that overpopulation was one of mankind&#x27;s major problems; finally, the political left, which saw the &quot;LTG&quot; study as a scam by the elites designed to trick workers into believing that a proletarian paradise was a . A UK government report found that &quot;In the 1990s, criticism tended to focus on the misconception that &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; predicted global resource depletion and social collapse by the end of the year 2000&quot;.

Peter Taylor and Frederick Buttle’s interpretation of the &quot;LTG&quot; study and the associated system dynamics (SD) models found that the original SD was created for firms and set the pattern for urban, global, and other SD models. These firm-based SDs relied on superintending managers to prevent undesirable cycling and feedback loops caused by separate common-sense decisions made by individual sectors. However, the later global model lacked superintending managers that enforce interrelated world-level changes, making undesirable cycles and exponential growth and collapse happen in nearly all models no matter the parameter settings. There was no way for a few individuals in the model to override the structure of the system even if they understood the system as a whole. This meant there were only two solutions: convincing everyone in the system to change the basic structure of population growth and collapse (moral response) and/or having a superintending agency analyzing the system as a whole and directing changes (technocratic response). The &quot;LTG&quot; report combined these two approaches multiple times. System dynamists constructed interventions into the world model to demonstrate how their proposed interventions improved the system to prevent collapse. The SD model also aggregated the world’s population and resources which meant that it did not demonstrate how crises emerge at different times and in different ways without any strictly global logic or form because of the unequal distributions of populations and resources. These issues indicate that the local, national, and regional differentiation in politics and economics surrounding socioenvironmental change was excluded from the SD used by &quot;LTG&quot;, making it unable to accurately demonstrate real-world dynamics.

==Positive reviews==
In 1980, the Global 2000 Report to the President arrived at similar conclusions regarding expected global resource scarcity, and the need for multilateral coordination to prepare for this situation.

In a 2008 blog post, Ugo Bardi commented that &quot;Although, by the 1990s &quot;LTG&quot; had become everyone&#x27;s laughing stock, among some the &quot;LTG&quot; ideas are becoming again popular&quot;. Reading &quot;LTG&quot; for the first time in 2000, Matthew Simmons concluded his views on the report by saying, &quot;In hindsight, The Club of Rome turned out to be right. We simply wasted 30 important years ignoring this work.&quot;

Robert Solow, who had been a vocal critic of LTG, said in 2009 that &quot;thirty years later, the situation may have changed... it will probably be more important in the future to deal intellectually, quantitatively, as well as practically, with the mutual interdependence of economic growth, natural resource availability, and environmental constraints&quot;.

In a study conducted in 2008, Graham Turner from CSIRO discovered a significant correlation between the observed historical data spanning from 1970 to 2000 and the simulated outcomes derived from the &quot;standard run&quot; limits of the growth model. This correlation was apparent across nearly all the reported outputs. The comparison falls comfortably within the range of uncertainty for almost all the available data, both in terms of magnitude and the patterns observed over time. Turner conducted an analysis of many studies, with a special focus on those authored by economists, that have consistently aimed to discredit the limits-to-growth concept over the course of several years. According to Turner, the aforementioned studies exhibit flaws and demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding the model.

Turner reprised these observations in another opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 2 September 2014. Turner used data from the UN to claim that the graphs almost exactly matched the &#x27;Standard Run&#x27; from 1972 (i.e. the worst-case scenario, assuming that a &#x27;business as usual&#x27; attitude was adopted, and there were no modifications of human behaviour in response to the warnings in the report). Birth rates and death rates were both slightly lower than projected, but these two effects cancelled each other out, leaving the growth in world population almost exactly as forecast.

In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a &quot;pioneering report&quot;, and said that it &quot;has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant.&quot;

In 2012, Christian Parenti drew comparisons between the reception of &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; and the ongoing global warming controversy. Parenti further remarked that despite its scientific rigour and credibility, the intellectual guardians of influential economic interests actively dismissed LTG as a warning. A parallel narrative is currently unfolding within the realm of climate research.

In 2012, John Scales Avery, a member of the Nobel Prize (1995) winning group associated with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, supported the basic thesis of &quot;LTG&quot; by stating, Although the specific predictions of resource availability in &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; lacked accuracy, its basic thesis – that unlimited economic growth on a finite planet is impossible – was indisputably correct.
==Legacy==
===Updates and symposia===

The Club of Rome has persisted after &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; and has generally provided comprehensive updates to the book every five years.

An independent retrospective on the public debate over &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; concluded in 1978 that optimistic attitudes had won out, causing a general loss of momentum in the environmental movement. While summarizing a large number of opposing arguments, the article concluded that &quot;scientific arguments for and against each position ... have, it would seem, played only a small part in the general acceptance of alternative perspectives.&quot;

In 1989, a symposium was held in Hanover, entitled &quot;Beyond the Limits to Growth: Global Industrial Society, Vision or Nightmare?&quot; and in 1992, &quot;Beyond the Limits&quot; (BTL) was published as a 20-year update on the original material. It &quot;concluded that two decades of history mainly supported the conclusions we had advanced 20 years earlier. But the 1992 book did offer one major new finding. We suggested in BTL that humanity had already overshot the limits of Earth&#x27;s support capacity.&quot;

&quot;Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update&quot; was published in 2004. The authors observed that &quot;It is a sad fact that humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years in futile debates and well-intentioned, but halfhearted, responses to the global ecological challenge. We do not have another 30 years to dither. Much will have to change if the ongoing overshoot is not to be followed by collapse during the twenty-first century.&quot;

In 2012, the Smithsonian Institution held a symposium entitled &quot;Perspectives on &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;&quot;. Another symposium was held in the same year by the Volkswagen Foundation, entitled &quot;Already Beyond?&quot;

&quot;Limits to Growth&quot; did not receive an official update in 2012, but one of its coauthors, Jørgen Randers, published a book, &quot;2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years&quot;.

===Comparisons and updated models ===
In 2008, physicist Graham Turner at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia published a paper called &quot;A Comparison of &#x27;The Limits to Growth&#x27; with Thirty Years of Reality&quot;. It compared the past thirty years of data with the eleven scenarios laid out in the 1972 book and found that changes in industrial production, food production, and pollution are all congruent with one of the book&#x27;s eleven scenarios—that of &quot;business as usual&quot;. This scenario in &quot;Limits&quot; points to economic and societal collapse in the 21st century. In 2010, Nørgård, Peet, and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a &quot;pioneering report&quot;. They said that, &quot;its approach remains useful and that its conclusions are still surprisingly valid ... unfortunately the report has been largely dismissed by critics as a doomsday prophecy that has not held up to scrutiny.&quot;

Also in 2008, researcher Peter A. Victor wrote that even though the &quot;Limits&quot; team probably underestimated price mechanism&#x27;s role in adjusting outcomes, their critics have overestimated it. He states that &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; has had a significant impact on the conception of environmental issues and notes that (in his view) the models in the book were meant to be taken as predictions &quot;only in the most limited sense of the word&quot;.

In a 2009 article published in &quot;American Scientist&quot; entitled &quot;Revisiting the Limits to Growth After Peak Oil,&quot; Hall and Day noted that &quot;the values predicted by the limits-to-growth model and actual data for 2008 are very close.&quot; These findings are consistent with the 2008 CSIRO study which concluded: &quot;The analysis shows that 30 years of historical data compares favorably with key features ... [of the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;] &quot;standard run&quot; scenario, which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st Century.&quot;

In 2011, Ugo Bardi published a book-length academic study of &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, its methods, and historical reception and concluded that &quot;The warnings that we received in 1972 ... are becoming increasingly more worrisome as reality seems to be following closely the curves that the ... scenario had generated.&quot; A popular analysis of the accuracy of the report by science writer Richard Heinberg was also published.

In 2012, writing in &quot;American Scientist&quot;, Brian Hayes stated that the model is &quot;more a polemical tool than a scientific instrument&quot;. He went on to say that the graphs generated by the computer program should not, as the authors note, be used as predictions.

In 2014, Turner concluded that &quot;preparing for a collapsing global system could be even more important than trying to avoid collapse.&quot; Another 2014 study from the University of Melbourne confirmed that data closely tracked the World3 BAU model.

In 2015, a calibration of the updated World3-03 model using historical data from 1995 to 2012 to better understand the dynamics of today&#x27;s economic and resource system was undertaken. The results showed that human society has invested more to abate persistent pollution, increase food productivity and have a more productive service sector however the broad trends within &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; still held true.

In 2016, a group of MPs in the UK established an All-party parliamentary group on Limits to Growth. Its initial report concluded that &quot;there is unsettling evidence that society is still following the &#x27;standard run&#x27; of the original study – in which overshoot leads to an eventual collapse of production and living standards&quot;. The report also points out that some issues not fully addressed in the original 1972 report, such as climate change, present additional challenges for human development.

In 2020, an analysis by Gaya Herrington, then Director of Sustainability Services of KPMG US, was published in Yale University&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Industrial Ecology&quot;. The study assessed whether, given key data known in 2020 about factors important for the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; report, the original report&#x27;s conclusions are supported. In particular, the 2020 study examined updated quantitative information about ten factors, namely population, fertility rates, mortality rates, industrial output, food production, services, non-renewable resources, persistent pollution, human welfare, and ecological footprint, and concluded that the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; prediction is essentially correct in that continued economic growth is unsustainable under a &quot;business as usual&quot; model. The study found that current empirical data is broadly consistent with the 1972 projections and that if major changes to the consumption of resources are not undertaken, economic growth will peak and then rapidly decline by around 2040.

In 2023, the parameters of the World3 model were recalibrated using empirical data up to 2022. This improved parameter set results in a World3 simulation that shows the same overshoot and collapse mode in the coming decade as the original business-as-usual scenario of the Limits to Growth standard run. The main effect of the recalibration update is to raise the peaks of most variables and move them a few years into the future.

<text>Year 348 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Corvus and Laenas (or, less frequently, year 406 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 348 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* After being besieged by the Persian forces of King Artaxerxes III, Sidon is taken and its population is punished with great cruelty.

==== Greece ====
* The Athenian help to its cities in Macedonia is diverted by a revolt in Euboea which Philip II of Macedon has fomented. He conquers the city of Olynthus in the Chalcidice and he annexes Chalcidice to Macedonia.
* The city of Eretria on the island of Euboea successfully rebels against the rule of Athens and Euboea is declared independent. The Athenian and general, Phocion&#x27;s tactical skills save an Athenian force sent to fight the supporters of Philip II on Euboea.
* Aristotle leaves Athens and Plato&#x27;s Academy, after which he resided in Assus in northwestern Anatolia.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Rome and Carthage make a trade agreement under which Carthage will not attack those Latin states which are faithful to Rome. This agreement demonstrates that Rome is now the dominant power in the Latin League.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Plato, Greek philosopher and author

<text>Year 350 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Laenas and Scipio (or, less frequently, year 404 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 350 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* Sidon, the centre of the revolt against Persia, seeks help from its sister city of Tyre and from Egypt but gets very little.
* Idrieus, the second son of Hecatomnus, succeeds to the throne of Caria on the death of Artemisia II, the widow of his elder brother Mausolus. Shortly after his accession, at the request of the Persian king, Artaxerxes III, Idrieus equips a fleet of 40 triremes and assembles an army of 8,000 mercenary troops and despatches them against Cyprus, under the command of the Athenian general Phocion.

==== Greece ====
* Alexander I becomes king of Epirus after his brother-in-law, Philip II of Macedon, aids him in ousting the previous king, Arymbas.
* Philip II has Abdera in Thrace sacked.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Gauls, once more threatening Rome, are decisively beaten by an army comprising Rome and its allies.

=== By topic ===

==== Science ====
* Aristotle argues for a spherical Earth using lunar eclipses and other observations. Also he discusses logical reasoning in &quot;Organon.&quot;
* Plato proposes a geocentric model of the universe with the stars rotating on a fixed celestial sphere.

==== Art ====
* Praxiteles makes the &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot; (approximate date). A composite of two similar Roman copies after the original marble is now kept at Musei Vaticani, Museo Pio Clementino, Gabinetto delle Maschere in Rome.
* The building of the Mausoleum in Halikarnassos (modern Bodrum in Turkey) is completed (approximate date). It is the grave of the Persian satrap and Carian ruler Mausolos and is built under the direction of his wife Artemisia. The mausoleum, which is considered to be one of the &quot;Seven Wonders of the Ancient World&quot;, is today partly preserved at the British Museum in London.
* The &quot;Corinthian capital&quot; is made in the tholos at Epidaurus. It is now preserved at the Archaeological Museum in Epidaurus, Greece (approximate date).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Dicaearchus, Greek philosopher, cartographer, geographer, mathematician and polymath (d. c. 285 BC)
* Megasthenes, Greek historian, diplomat and Indian ethnographer (approximate date) 
* Shen Dao, Chinese philosopher known for his blend of Legalism and Taoism (approximate date) (d. c. 275 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Archytas, Greek philosopher, mathematician and statesman (or 347 BC) (b. 428 BC)
* Artemisia II, queen of Caria and sister and wife of king Mausolus of Caria
* Tollund Man, human sacrifice victim on the Jutland peninsula in Denmark, possibly the earliest known evidence for worship of the Norse god Odin (approximate date)

<text>Adolphe Léon Willette (30 July 1857 – 4 February 1926) was a French painter, illustrator, caricaturist, and lithographer, as well as an architect of the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret. Willette ran as an &quot;anti-semitic&quot; candidate in the 9th arrondissement of Paris for the September 1889 legislative elections.

==Biography==
Willette studied for four years at the École des Beaux-Arts under Alexandre Cabanel. His graphical work ranged from dainty triviality or political satire: he made Pierrot an imaginary hero of France, and established Mimi Pinson as frail, lovable, and essentially good-hearted. He could also be bitter and fierce, a partisan of political ideas. The guillotine and the figure of Death appear in his caricatures. At the time of the Dreyfus affair he was an &quot;anti-dreyfusard&quot;; with Jean-Louis Forain, he moved to the political right.

==Works==
The artist was a prolific contributor to the French illustrated press under the pseudonyms &quot;Cémoi&quot;, &quot;Pierrot&quot;, &quot;Louison&quot;, &quot;Bébé&quot;, and &quot;Nox&quot;, but more often under his own name. He illustrated Melandri&#x27;s &quot;Les Pierrots&quot; and &quot;Les Giboulles d&#x27;avril&quot;, &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;, and published his own &quot;Pauvre Pierrot&quot; and other works, in which he tells his stories in scenes in the manner of Busch. He decorated several &quot;brasseries artistiques&quot; with wall-paintings, stained glass, and so on notably Le Chat noir and La Palette d&#x27;or, and he painted the ceiling for La Cigale music hall. Willette contributed to the Salon des Cent and six of his posters were published in &quot;Les Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche&quot;. A collection of his works was exhibited in 1888. His &quot;V&#x27;almy&quot; is in the Luxembourg, Paris.

Willette&#x27;s characteristically fantastic &quot;Parce Domine&quot; was commissioned by Rodolphe Salis for Le Chat Noir in Montmartre. It was shown in the Franco-British Exhibition in 1908.

<doc id="66627" wikidata="Q5552630" url="?curid=66627" title="The Little Foxes">
<text>The Little Foxes is a 1939 play by Lillian Hellman, considered a classic of 20th century drama. Its title comes from Chapter 2, Verse 15, of the Song of Solomon in the King James version of the Bible, which reads, &quot;Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.&quot; Set in a small town in Alabama in 1900, it focuses on the struggle for control of a family business. Tallulah Bankhead starred in the original production as Regina Hubbard Giddens.

==Plot==
The play&#x27;s focus is Southerner Regina Hubbard Giddens, who struggles for wealth and freedom within the confines of an early 20th-century society where fathers considered only sons as their legal heirs. As a result of this practice, while her two avaricious brothers Benjamin and Oscar have wielded the family inheritance into two independently substantial fortunes, she has had to rely upon her manipulation of her cautious, timid, browbeaten husband, Horace. He is no businessman, just her financial support; although he is pliable enough for her ambition, that ambition has driven him into becoming merely the tool of her insatiable greed. He uses a wheelchair.

Her brother Oscar married Birdie, his much-maligned alcoholic wife, solely to acquire her family&#x27;s plantation and cotton fields. Oscar now wants to join forces with his brother, Benjamin, to construct a cotton mill. They need an additional $75,000 and approach Regina, asking her to invest in the project. Oscar initially proposes marriage between his son Leo and Regina&#x27;s daughter Alexandra—first cousins—as a means of getting Horace&#x27;s money, but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion, as is Birdie. Horace refuses when Regina asks him outright for the money, so Leo, a bank teller, is pressured into stealing Horace&#x27;s railroad bonds from the bank&#x27;s safe deposit box.

Horace, after discovering this, tells Regina he is going to change his will in favor of their daughter, and also claim he gave Leo the bonds as a loan, thereby cutting Regina out of the deal completely. When he has a heart attack during this chat, she makes no effort to help him. He dies within hours, without anyone knowing his plan and before changing his will. This leaves Regina free to blackmail her brothers by threatening to report Leo&#x27;s theft unless they give her 75% ownership in the cotton mill (it is, in Regina&#x27;s mind, a fair exchange for the stolen bonds). The price Regina ultimately pays for her evil deeds is the loss of her daughter Alexandra&#x27;s love and respect. Regina&#x27;s actions cause Alexandra to finally understand the importance of not idly watching people do evil. She tells Regina she will not watch her be &quot;one who eats the earth,&quot; and abandons her. Having let her husband die, alienated her brothers, and driven away her only child, Regina is left wealthy but completely alone.

==Background==

The fictional Hubbards in the play are reputedly drawn from Lillian Hellman&#x27;s Marx relatives. Hellman&#x27;s mother was Julia Newhouse of Demopolis, Alabama. Julia Newhouse&#x27;s parents were Leonard Newhouse, a Demopolis wholesale liquor dealer, and Sophie Marx, of a successful Demopolis banking family. According to Hellman, Sophie Marx Newhouse never missed an opportunity to belittle and mock her father for his poor business sense in front of her and her mother. The discord between the Marx and Hellman families was to later serve as the inspiration for the play.

The title &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; was suggested by Dorothy Parker.

In 1946, Hellman wrote &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot;, a prequel chronicling the roots of the Hubbard family.

==Production==
Produced and directed by Herman Shumlin, the original Broadway production of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; opened February 15, 1939, at the National Theatre. It closed February 3, 1940, running for 410 performances before its two-season tour of the United States.

===Cast===
* Tallulah Bankhead as Regina Hubbard Giddens
* Patricia Collinge as Birdie Hubbard
* Frank Conroy as Horace Giddens
* Lee Baker as William Marshall
* Charles Dingle as Benjamin Hubbard
* Dan Duryea as Leo Hubbard
* John Marriott as Cal
* Abbie Mitchell as Addie
* Carl Benton Reid as Oscar Hubbard
* Florence Williams as Alexandra Giddens

On October 30, 1939, Eugenia Rawls replaced Florence Williams in the role of Alexandra Giddens. Rawls had made her Broadway debut as one of the students in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s 1934 play, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, which was also produced and directed by Herman Shumlin. Rawls played Alexandra for the rest of the play&#x27;s Broadway run and the national tour that followed.

The 104-city tour of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; began February 5, 1940, in Washington, D.C., and ended April 15, 1941, in Philadelphia.

===Accolades===

Tallulah Bankhead won &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s citation as best actress of the 1938–39 Broadway season.

==Adaptations==

Lillian Hellman wrote the screenplay for a 1941 film version, a Samuel Goldwyn production directed by William Wyler. Other contributors to the screenplay included Arthur Kober, Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell. The touring production of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; went on hiatus for three months during filming, and Patricia Collinge, Charles Dingle, Dan Duryea, John Marriott and Carl Benton Reid all reprised their stage roles in their motion picture debuts. Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall and Teresa Wright star as Regina, Horace and Alexandra Giddens.

&quot;The Little Foxes&quot; was presented on &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; October 10, 1941. The radio adaptation starred Tallulah Bankhead.

In 1949, the play was adapted for an opera entitled &quot;Regina&quot; by Marc Blitzstein.

George Schaefer produced and directed Robert Hartung&#x27;s television adaptation of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, broadcast December 16, 1956, on NBC. The cast included Greer Garson (Regina), Franchot Tone (Horace), Sidney Blackmer (Ben), E. G. Marshall (Oscar) and Eileen Heckart (Birdie).

==Revivals==
Mike Nichols directed a production that opened October 26, 1967, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center, then transferred to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. It ran a total of 100 performances. The cast included Anne Bancroft as Regina, Richard A. Dysart as Horace, Margaret Leighton as Birdie, E.G. Marshall as Oscar, George C. Scott as Benjamin, and Austin Pendleton as Leo. Costume design was by Patricia Zipprodt. In reviewing the production, &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;An admirable revival of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s 1939 play in Lincoln Center demonstrates how securely bricks of character can be sealed together with the mortar of plot. Anne Bancroft, George C. Scott, Richard Dysart, and Margaret Leighton are expertly guided by Director Mike Nichols through gilt-edged performances.&quot; The production was profiled in the William Goldman book &quot;The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway&quot;.

Geraldine Page played Regina in a production in which she starred opposite her husband Rip Torn (in the role of Benjamin Hubbard) directed by Philip Minor. It was staged for the Academy Festival Theater at Barat College in Lake Forest, Illinois and received a rave review from William Leonard of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;Geraldine Page is giving one of the greatest performances of her glorious career in Lake Forest and she is surrounded by a cast so superb that the Academy Festival Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; becomes a powerful, searing, unforgettable show... it is a harrowing and ennobling evening in the theater-the kind that comes along all too seldom. We have seen other stars in the role of the malevolently, ruthlessly scheming Regina Giddens—Tallulah Bankhead years ago in her greatest triumph, Eileen Herlie five seasons back at the Ivanhoe. Geraldine Page is a whole new story—I have seen Geraldine Page in innumerable roles, ever since she was playing in &quot;East Lynne&quot; with the Lake Zurich Players back in the &#x27;40s. I&#x27;ve never seen her more thrillingly convincing than in this production.&quot;
The legendary Kim Stanley once said of Page&#x27;s Regina that it &quot;was possibly the finest performance&quot; she had ever seen.

Austin Pendleton directed a production at the Parker Playhouse in Fort Lauderdale for three weeks that transferred to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., for six weeks before opening on Broadway. The production opened on May 7, 1981, at the Martin Beck Theatre for 123 performances and eight previews. The cast included Elizabeth Taylor as Regina, Tom Aldredge as Horace, Dennis Christopher as Leo, Maureen Stapleton as Birdie, and Anthony Zerbe as Benjamin. Florence Klotz was the costume designer. In a &quot;Time&quot; article prior to the Broadway opening, Gerald Clarke reported nearly $1 million worth of ticket sales during the week after advertisements announcing Taylor&#x27;s appearance appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Taylor received nominations for both the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play. Tony nominations also went to Pendleton for Best Direction of a Play, Aldredge for Best Featured Actor in a Play, Stapleton for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and the play itself for Best Revival.

A 1997 revival, again at the Vivian Beaumont, ran for 27 previews and 57 performances from April 3 to June 15. Directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien, the cast included Stockard Channing as Regina, Kenneth Welsh as Horace, Brian Kerwin as Oscar, Brian Murray as Benjamin, and Frances Conroy as Birdie. Murray was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play, and John Lee Beatty was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design.

The production was revived at The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, from June 3 to 28, 2009, with Venida Evans, Ron Brice, Deanne Lorette, Brian Dykstra, Fisher Neal, Kathryn Meisle, Einar Gunn, Philip Goodwin, Lindsey Wochley, Bradford Cover, and directed by Matthew Arbour.

Another revival was produced by Cleveland Play House in the 75th anniversary year of the original Broadway production, September 12–October 5, 2014, in the Allen Theatre (Playhouse Square) in Cleveland, Ohio. The production was directed by Artistic Director Laura Kepley.

Kyle Donnelly directed a revival at Washington, DC&#x27;s Arena Stage from September 23 to October 30, 2016. The cast included Marg Helgenberger, Edward Gero, Isabel Keating, and Jack Willis.

Manhattan Theatre Club produced a Broadway revival that began previews on March 29, 2017, and opened officially on April 19 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. It starred Laura Linney (who was nominated for a Tony Award—Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play) and Cynthia Nixon who alternated the roles of Regina Giddens and Birdie, with direction by Daniel J. Sullivan. Cynthia Nixon won the Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Play for her turn as Birdie. The production team included Scott Pask, Justin Townsend, Jane Greenwood, Fotz Patton, and Tom Watson. It played its final performance on July 2, 2017.

The Gate Theatre, Dublin, was going to show a revival in 2020, directed by Blanche McIntyre, but this was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Young Vic in London produced a 3-month revival that opened December 2, 2024 starring Anne-Marie Duff as Regina.

<text>Poe (born Anne Decatur Danielewski; ; March 23, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Poe&#x27;s musical style is a blend of rock, jazz, electronica, folk, and hip hop elements combined with intimate lyrical compositions. Many of Poe&#x27;s songs have been featured in films and on television. Poe first hit the modern rock charts in 1995.

Some of her early charting singles included &quot;Angry Johnny&quot;, &quot;Trigger Happy Jack&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, and &quot;Hey Pretty&quot;. Videos for these singles had heavy rotation on MTV. Poe spent six years with Atlantic Records and is currently on her own label, &quot;Repoezessed Music Records.&quot;

Noteworthy was Poe&#x27;s early involvement with her online community of fans. Her web site, and the fan sites that supported her early in her career, predated modern social networking platforms and were among the first of their kind. Atlantic Records&#x27; Senior Vice President of New Media, Nikki Sleight, referred to Poe&#x27;s online power and one-on-one communication with thousands attending her concerts as &quot;unheard of and pretty phenomenal&quot; in Sleight&#x27;s 1997 interview with &quot;Web Magazine.&quot;

In 2004, she co-founded the digital innovations agency Signature Creative Inc with John Gheur.

In September 2014, Poe received the title of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador due to her invitation by Yoko Ono to participate in a UNICEF campaign and her donated performance. The campaign launched a world version of John Lennon&#x27;s classic song &quot;Imagine&quot; featuring dozens of musical artists from around the world. Poe joined others singing in the music video that included a video clip of John Lennon that spearheads a global campaign by UNICEF to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

==Early life==
Born in New York City and daughter of Polish film director Tad Z. Danielewski and his wife Priscilla Decatur Machold, Poe and her brother, novelist Mark Z. Danielewski, lived in six different countries before she turned eight. Her father&#x27;s film directing took the family to Africa, India, Spain, Switzerland, England, and the United States. When Poe was 12, her father moved his family to Provo, Utah to join the Arts faculty at Brigham Young University. Poe attended junior high school and some of high school in Provo. When Poe&#x27;s parents divorced, Poe, then 16, left home and moved to New York City where she lived in a squat on the lower east side of Manhattan while attempting to connect with her estranged mother. Poe continued submitting schoolwork to her high school in Utah and eventually graduated. She pursued her undergraduate studies at Princeton University, where she organized her first band.

==Early career==
Poe began experimenting with musical samplers and sequencers as a teenager. Noteworthy are her early collaborations with J Dilla of Slum Village. Poe&#x27;s musical influences ranged &quot;from Black Flag to Bob Dylan -- from Billie Holiday to Tribe Called Quest&quot; according to music writer Stephen Grecco.

Poe was signed to Modern/Atlantic Records in 1994 on the strength of the demos she made with J Dilla and RJ Rice in RJ&#x27;s living room in Detroit.

On January 28, 1996, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named Poe, along with Alanis Morissette, among the defining voices of the current &quot;movement in music&quot; which featured &quot;angry&quot; female artists who were &quot;...articulate, sexually explicit, both lover and fighter...(women who) reject self-pity and refuse to define themselves purely in terms of their connection to men.&quot; In September 1996, &quot;Glamour&quot; published a picture of Poe, with a snarl on her face and wearing a tee-shirt on which she had written the words, &quot;Happy-Well-Adjusted Female.&quot; In the accompanying interview, Poe says &quot;I don&#x27;t think &#x27;Angry&#x27; really sums it up at all!&quot; In the November 14, 1996, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Poe&#x27;s album, &quot;Hello,&quot; attained a position on the Reader&#x27;s Top Ten Chart. and in August 1997, &quot;Esquire&quot; named Poe, along with Gwen Stefani, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Sarah McLachlan among the top five &quot;Women Who Rock Our World&quot;.

Poe began her first major tour in January 1996, as the opening act for Lenny Kravitz. She and her touring band (Daris Adkins on Guitar, Dan Marfisi &quot;Jones&quot; on Drums, Toby Skard on bass/ and Cameron Stone on cello) then continued touring extensively as headliners and at festivals until 1999, when she stopped to begin pre-production on her second album for Atlantic. Pollstar Magazine reported in 1998 that Poe had performed for approximately 600 shows in a two-year time period.

===&quot;Hello&quot;===
Poe&#x27;s first album, &quot;Hello&quot;, was released in 1995. Musically, the album was described as a sample-rich amalgam of hip-hop, rock, and jazz. Lyrically, the album was filled with literary allusions, film nods, comic book references, and psychological irony. The CD was critically acclaimed. &quot;Hits Magazine&quot; called &quot;Hello&quot; an &quot;over-the-top PoMo masterpiece.&quot; In an interview on Spotify&#x27;s Landmark series discussing the making of Alanis Morissette&#x27;s Jagged Little Pill, Glen Ballard quoted &quot;Hello was probably the biggest influence I had at that time, honestly, because it was a brilliant record that had jazz influence, hip hop, electronic, rock. It was a hybrid of the first degree.&quot;

Not long after the album&#x27;s release, Poe&#x27;s single, &quot;Trigger Happy Jack (Drive By a Go-Go)&quot; broke into the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative and Modern Rock chart. &quot;Trigger Happy Jack&quot; was produced by Dave Jerden (Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Alice in Chains) and Jeffrey Connor and featured Matt Sorum (of Guns N&#x27; Roses) on drums and Dean Pleasants (of Suicidal Tendencies) on guitar.

Poe met Jeffrey Connor towards the completion of the record as a session bassist she hired for additional overdubs on &quot;Hello&quot;. Connor had given Poe a track he started writing after working with her. Poe heard the demo and passed it to Jerden who immediately gave the track the green light and had Connor come in to produce. Connor brought in Sorum and Pleasants for what was to become &quot;Trigger Happy Jack&quot;. It featured the lyric &quot;You can&#x27;t talk to a psycho like a normal human being&quot;. The song&#x27;s video went into high rotation on MTV and introduced Poe to the mainstream. Also in 1997, Atlantic released a maxi CD and 12-inch vinyl single of &quot;Trigger Happy Jack&quot; which included &quot;The Drive By Remix&quot; and &quot;The Psycho Demolition Mix&quot; by Steve Lyon, an instrumental version of the song, and a &quot;Poe Only&quot; Mix. Another single, &quot;Angry Johnny&quot;, broke into the top 10 of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock chart, and also enjoyed heavy rotation on radio. The song&#x27;s video received high rotation on MTV. The song featured the line,&quot; &quot;I wanna blow you...(pause) away.&quot;&quot; A promotional maxi-single of the song was released to radio but was never available commercially. This single included a &quot;Band Mix&quot; produced by Poe and Matt Sorum that received heavy rotation on radio.

In August 1997, Atlantic released a maxi-single of the song &quot;Hello&quot; that included six remixes of the song (&quot;Hello: E-Smoove Funk Mix&quot; by E-Smoove/ &quot;Hello: Modern Mix&quot; by Edge Factor/ &quot;Hello: Nevins Electronica Mix&quot; by Jason Nevins/ &quot;Hello: The Generator Mix by E-Smoove/ &quot;Hello: The Edge Factor Mix&quot; by, Edge Factor, and &quot;Hello: Trial Dub Mix&quot; by Edge Factor.)

On September 13, 1997, &quot;Hello&quot; hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance chart. The video for this song also enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV.

On November 20, 1997, the RIAA awarded &quot;Hello&quot; gold certification.

===&quot;Haunted&quot;===
Poe&#x27;s second album, &quot;Haunted,&quot; was released in October 2000. The album, produced by Poe and Olle Romo was inspired by Poe&#x27;s discovery of a box of audio tapes that contained recordings of her late father&#x27;s voice. Listening to those tapes for the first time proved so difficult for Poe that she was hesitant to use them in her music. She was quoted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;I took these tapes home, and I couldn&#x27;t listen to them. It was too hard, so I kept finding ways to avoid it. They were sitting on my coffee table next to a boombox for quite some time.&quot; Poe was quoted in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; about when she finally listened to the tapes, &quot;It was clear how the next few years of my life would be spent.&quot;

&quot;Haunted&quot; was embraced by the press. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The wait for Poe&#x27;s follow up to her debut album has paid off with rich, sophisticated, songs of depth and emotional intensity.&quot; They instructed audiences to &quot;Think of &quot;Haunted&quot; as the equivalent of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;.&quot; They added that &quot;Poe&#x27;s version is more succinct, darker in parts, but just as accessible.&quot; The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote, &quot;Samples of Poe&#x27;s late father&#x27;s voice and heartfelt musings weave in and out of the songs on &quot;Haunted&quot;, providing a narrative structure inside which Poe attempts to put her father&#x27;s ghost to rest.&quot; AllMusic wrote that &quot;(Poe&#x27;s) original compositions have the makings for a new music revolution alongside the likes of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;&quot;. &quot;Elle&quot; magazine credited Poe with &quot;...defining the future of pop&quot;. &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine called &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;The best mindf**k you&#x27;ll get all year.&quot; The publication &quot;Indiana Statesman&quot; described &quot;Haunted&quot; as &quot;one of the most influential and innovative albums of this decade,&quot; further claiming that &quot;...this digitally produced album far outshines any studio album produced thus far.&quot;

The first single from &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Hey Pretty&quot;, hit the top 20 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart at a time when female musicians and singers in the format rarely got airtime. At the end of 2000, the only two women in the Billboard top 100 year-end Modern Rock Chart were Gwen Stefani and Poe. MTV put the &quot;Hey Pretty&quot; video into heavy rotation, and in July 2001, Poe was invited to be the opening act for Depeche Mode&#x27;s Exciter Tour.

Haunted was also referred to in the 2002 film &quot;Panic Room&quot;. In a conversation between Jodie Foster&#x27;s character, Meg Altman, and the agent selling the home containing the Panic Room, Sarah Altman (Meg&#x27;s daughter, played by Kristen Stewart) asks &quot;Ever read any Poe?&quot;, to which the response given is &quot;No, but I loved her last album!&quot;

Also in 2000, Atlantic released a promotional CD single of the song, &quot;Haunted&quot;, which included a remix by Grammy-winning producer/musician Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson).

===With Mark Danielewski===

Poe&#x27;s brother, Mark Z. Danielewski, is a best-selling novelist, and as young children Mark and Poe formed a creative relationship wherein Poe would read and edit the pages her brother wrote. In 1997, Poe sent a manuscript of her brother&#x27;s first novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot; to Warren Frazier, who was a college friend of hers and who had become an agent at John Hawkins Literary Agency in New York. Warren agreed to represent Mark and eventually secured a publishing deal for Mark at Pantheon Books. In 2000, Pantheon published &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, releasing it to coincide with the release of Poe&#x27;s second album &quot;Haunted&quot;. Poe invited Mark to do a spoken word passage in her &quot;Drive By 2001&quot; remix of the song &quot;Hey Pretty&quot; and also invited him to perform this passage in both her video and live show opening for Depeche Mode. Of his sister&#x27;s support, Mark recounts how he once in a moment of rage tore the handwritten manuscript of a story called &quot;Redwood&quot; into tiny pieces and threw it into a dumpster. Poe rescued the pieces from the dumpster and taped the entire manuscript back together. It took her two weeks.

In November 2000, Poe performed a tour of Borders with her brother. Their set included Mark reading passages from &quot;House of Leaves&quot; and Poe singing songs that share themes with the book. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; made the New York Times Best Seller list in April 2000.

===Effect of AOL–Time Warner merger===
With &quot;Haunted&quot; climbing the charts, Atlantic Records announced that it had renewed Poe&#x27;s contract for three more albums. It renewed its agreement with the boutique label, Modern/FEI Records (Fishkin Entertainment, Inc.) through which Poe was signed to Atlantic. Atlantic also committed to releasing and distributing &quot;Haunted&quot; internationally and serviced the album globally. Shortly thereafter, it printed promo copies of &quot;Wild&quot;, the second single from &quot;Haunted&quot;, which included a remix by Static Revenger. Copies of that single were never sent to radio.

A merger of Time Warner, the parent company of Atlantic, and AOL was approved by the FCC in January 2001. AOL Time Warner was under close scrutiny to show positive results almost immediately after the merger. With a softening of the economy after the FCC approval, it began close review of all relationships with third-party production houses, such as Modern Records

In November 2001, six weeks after renewing Poe&#x27;s contract, &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; announced that Atlantic was severing ties with Modern/FEI records.

The result was that Poe was dropped from Atlantic&#x27;s roster of artists. Poe&#x27;s manager and Modern/FEI label head Paul Fishkin stated that &quot;Poe was stunned to be let go as Atlantic had just picked up its option on her next three albums and had already printed promo CDs of her next single &#x27;Wild&#x27; and sent them to radio.&quot; Val Azzoli, then President of Atlantic, said to &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; of dropping Poe, &quot;Poe must be feeling pretty bruised right about now,&quot; adding that Atlantic had simply made a business decision. The article points out that it was a strange decision in light of the fact that, &quot;according to SoundScan, &quot;Haunted&quot; had sold 250,000 copies and the album&#x27;s first single, &#x27;Hey Pretty&#x27;, had only come out two months prior.&quot; Spinner reflected ten years later on the business decision and its impact stating, &quot;With a gold record under her belt, a acclaimed second album, a new hit single, strong sales, and an arena tour opening for Depeche Mode, Poe was well-established as an important influence. And then, poof—she disappeared.&quot;

==Hiatus and later career (2001–present)==
In 2002, a story in the August issue of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; shed some light on the action of Atlantic to drop their rapidly rising artist with commitments and creative work underway. Poe had been signed to Atlantic in 1995 through Stevie Nicks&#x27; record label Modern Records. Amid the complex merger of Time Warner with AOL in 2000, it came to light that, in spite of the fact that Atlantic was responsible for providing all funding, marketing, publicity, radio promotion, tour support and distribution for the Poe project, Modern/FEI (not Atlantic) in its 1982 distribution deal with Atlantic, was awarded ownership of the masters of all Poe recordings. What this meant for Atlantic was that, by renewing Poe&#x27;s contract, Atlantic had committed sizable resources to a project in which it would have a financial participation, but not an equity stake in Poe&#x27;s past, present or future catalogue.

In November 2000, Atlantic/AOL Time Warner first chose to drop Modern/FEI, and as a result were contractually obligated to pay Modern/FEI an undisclosed amount of money, and effectively release themselves from any further fiduciary responsibilities to Modern/ FEI and/or Poe. This resulted in a pay-off for Modern/FEI and prematurely ended all printing, distribution, marketing, and promotion of Poe&#x27;s second album &quot;Haunted&quot;. In exchange for these monies, Modern/FEI&#x27;s agreed to give Atlantic a two-year grace period during which Modern/FEI agreed not to do anything commercially with any of Poe&#x27;s master recordings, enabling Atlantic to sell off their stock of already produced copies of &quot;Haunted&quot;. As a result, &quot;Haunted&quot; received no further promotional support and the album faded from the market place.

In 2004, Modern/ FEI sold the Poe Masters for &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Haunted&quot; to Sheridan Square Music who merged in 2005 with V2 Records, which cataloged the Poe masters under a sub-label called IndieBlu. IndieBlu and Sheridan Square Music were acquired by Entertainment One in 2009.

In 2001, as &quot;Haunted&quot; was climbing the charts, Poe turned to a friend of her fiancé&#x27;s father, Robert M. Edsel for legal advice. He advised her to retain the services of his firm&#x27;s legal counsel, David Helfant on a professional basis. Edsel and Helfant told Poe that she could expect a settlement from FEI or Atlantic within a few months, and advised her to sever her relationship with her management firm and her accounting firm in order to avoid sharing a portion of her settlement. Poe understood that Edsel took over her business management, who over a year lent Poe $200,000 for living costs, professional expenses and repayment of debts, with a signed promissory note which indicated that if there was a default her current and future works would be eligible to be used for repayment. A settlement with Atlantic was never obtained, Poe&#x27;s new management through Edsel and colleagues did not secure paying work, and the loan was defaulted upon. Consequently, Poe sued on the grounds that she had been represented by an unlicensed agency and therefore the agreement was void. Edsel kept Poe tied up in court, unable to release new music or perform professionally for a few years. What music Poe did release during that time was generally done under the pseudonym &quot;Jane.&quot; Ultimately, the case was found in Poe&#x27;s favour, voiding the contract but obliging her to repay the portion of the loan that was not used to pay for Edsel and colleagues’ services.

Poe was able to perform for charitable events during this period, and she collaborated on film soundtracks and continued to compose and write. Her previously released songs were also licensed for use in films and commercials.

=== &quot;Alan Wake II&quot; soundtrack, &quot;This Road&quot; ===
On September 12, 2012, Poe posted a one-minute song and video on a new mobile platform called PTCH; however, no announcement was made about an official release date. The video features a split narrative told across different frames on a single screen. The song, which repeats the line &quot;And some say that it loops forever this road that I lose you on every time&quot;, was titled &quot;September 30, 1955&quot;. The video later appeared on her YouTube channel.

Poe returned to the stage in 2014 for five shows at The Sayers Club in Los Angeles, during which she previewed a new song, &quot;Not Jane&quot;.

Fashion designer Tom Ford showcased his 2015 Autumn/Winter women&#x27;s wear collection to the beat of Poe&#x27;s &quot;Hey Pretty&quot;.

On October 1, 2018, Poe posted several cryptic teasers to her Instagram, suggesting new music was in the works. Among these posts was a short video of her gazing to the side and repeating the line &quot;Once upon a time, there was a little boy who lived in a remote region of the earth, and from the day that he was born, until he turned twelve, he&#x27;d only ever heard one story, about a little boy, who lived in a remote region of the earth.&quot;

Five years later on October 17, 2023, Poe would post a one-minute long video to her YouTube channel, titled &quot;This Window&quot;, and also opened her online store, linked from her official website. On October 19, she announced through another video titled &quot;In the Dark Place&quot;, that she would be releasing a new song with Sam Lake, titled &quot;This Road (AW)&quot;, on October 27, 2023, for the &quot;Alan Wake II&quot; video game. The song appeared on the game&#x27;s official soundtrack, although separated into four tracks: &quot;This Mirror is a Trap&quot;, &quot;The Dark Chamber&quot;, &quot;Falling Apart&quot;, and &quot;The Beginning&quot;.

In a press release the week after the release of &quot;Alan Wake II&quot; and &quot;This Road&quot;, Sam Lake reflected on the creative journey together with Poe, saying, &quot;At some points we were so closely in sync that it got a bit scary. She was amazing to work with, a musical genius. A brilliant, brilliant artist. I feel the song perfectly captures all aspects of the world of the Dark Place where Alan Wake is trapped. In the disturbing dream-reality taking the shape of New York City, the song has in part the hazy, smoky, feel of a Film Noir nightclub, the aching longing the novelist Alan Wake feels toward Alice, his wife, as he tries to escape the nightmare and get back to her, the paranoid feel of being lost and having forgotten something vital. It’s all of this and more. It’s beautiful.&quot;

On October 1, 2024, Poe once again posted a cryptic teaser video to her YouTube channel, titled &quot;I&quot;, in which she appears saying, &quot;I went missing in 2001. I barely noticed, but you knew. You could feel it. My symptoms were abstract, most notable among them was my ability to utilize the word&quot;. On October 17, a limited edition 12&quot; single of &quot;This Road&quot; became available for pre-order on Poe&#x27;s online store. The single includes a new song, &quot;6 Deep Breaths&quot; as the B-side.

==Charitable work==
Poe is a supporter of the David Lynch Foundation, a charity which teaches Transcendental Meditation to children in underprivileged school districts. Poe has played at numerous fundraisers for the foundation, including a show with Donovan at the El Rey Theatre. She performed again for the foundation, along with Ellen DeGeneres and Russell Brand, at their Gala Fundraiser at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on December 3, 2011.

To benefit UNICEF, Poe joined with a group of other notable music artists and celebrities recording their versions of John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Imagine&quot; in 2014. This was at the invitation of Yoko Ono who gave permission for the use of Lennon&#x27;s song for a musical collage, which became the launch of UNICEF&#x27;s global campaign to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Poe received the title of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for her participation. She was joined by 56 performers in the &quot;Imagine&quot; video including will.i.am, Katy Perry, Nicole Scherzinger, David Guetta, Hugh Jackman, Yoko Ono, Angélique Kidjo, Craig David, Danny O&#x27;Donoghue, Mari Malek, Australian singer Cody Simpson and actors David Arquette, Eric Christian Olsen, Seth Green, Dianna Agron, Courteney Cox and Idris Elba, among others. Each artist&#x27;s version forms part of a new remix by David Guetta that released on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2014 with an app to enable individuals to record and add themselves to the video. Poe is at the time mark 2:46 on &quot;Imagine&quot; (UNICEF: World Version) published online by Universal Music India. The music video spotlights the 28 million children globally who have been driven from their homes due to conflict. World leaders received a preview of the video in September 2014 at the United Nations Summit on Migrants and Refugees in the UN General Hall. The World Version officially launched by UNICEF on September 23, 2016, with people from more than 140 countries.

<text>An impossible trident, also known as an impossible fork, blivet, poiuyt, or devil&#x27;s tuning fork, is a drawing of an impossible object (undecipherable figure), a kind of an optical illusion. It appears to have three cylindrical prongs at one end which then mysteriously transform into two rectangular prongs at the other end.

In 1964, D.H. Schuster reported that he noticed an ambiguous figure of a new kind in the advertising section of an aviation journal. He dubbed it a &quot;three-stick clevis&quot;. He described the novelty as follows: &quot;Unlike other ambiguous drawings, an actual shift in visual fixation is involved in its perception and resolution.&quot;
The word &quot;poiuyt&quot; appeared on the March 1965 cover of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine bearing the four-eyed Alfred E. Neuman balancing the impossible fork on his finger with caption &quot;Introducing &#x27;The Mad Poiuyt&#x27; &quot; (the last six letters on the top row of QWERTY typewriters, right to left). An anonymously contributed version described as a &quot;hole location gauge&quot; was printed in the June 1964 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, with the comment that &quot;this outrageous piece of draftsmanship evidently escaped from the Finagle &amp; Diddle Engineering Works&quot;. Subsequently, a correspondent revealed that he had encountered the type of figure about twenty years previously, and had used it as a business logo since 1952.

The term &quot;blivet&quot; for the impossible fork was popularized by &quot;Worm Runner&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine. In 1967 Harold Baldwin published there an article, &quot;Building better blivets&quot;, in which he described the rules for the construction of drawings based on the impossible fork.
In December 1968 American optical designer and artist Roger Hayward wrote a humorous submission &quot;Blivets: Research and Development&quot; for &quot;The Worm Runner&#x27;s Digest&quot; in which he presented various drawings based on the blivet. He &quot;explained&quot; the term as follows: &quot;The blivet was first discovered in 1892 in Pfulingen, Germany, by a cross-eyed dwarf named Erasmus Wolfgang Blivet.&quot; He also published there a sequel, &quot; Blivets — the Makings&quot;.

<doc id="66633" wikidata="Q1725788" url="?curid=66633" title="Moth">
<text>Moths are a group of insects that includes all members of the order Lepidoptera that are not butterflies. They were previously classified as suborder Heterocera, but the group is paraphyletic with respect to butterflies (suborder Rhopalocera) and neither subordinate taxon is used in modern classifications. Moths make up the vast majority of the order. There are approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which have yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, although there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.

== Differences between butterflies and moths ==

While the butterflies form a monophyletic group, the moths, comprising the rest of the Lepidoptera, do not. Many attempts have been made to group the superfamilies of the Lepidoptera into natural groups, most of which fail because one of the two groups is not monophyletic: Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Heterocera and Rhopalocera, Jugatae and Frenatae, Monotrysia, and Ditrysia.

Although the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and (with the exception of the family Hedylidae) have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae are usually feathery with no ball on the end. The divisions are named by this principle: &quot;club-antennae&quot; (Rhopalocera) or &quot;varied-antennae&quot; (Heterocera). Lepidoptera first evolved during the Carboniferous period, but only evolved their characteristic proboscis alongside the rise of angiosperms in the Cretaceous period.

== Etymology ==
The modern English word &quot;moth&quot; comes from Old English (cf. Northumbrian ) from Common Germanic (compare Old Norse , Dutch , and German all meaning &#x27;moth&#x27;). Its origins are possibly related to the Old English meaning &#x27;maggot&#x27; or from the root of &quot;midge&quot; which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the larva, usually in reference to devouring clothes.

== Caterpillar ==

Moth larvae, or caterpillars, make cocoons from which they emerge as fully grown moths with wings. Some moth caterpillars dig holes in the ground, where they live until they are ready to turn into adult moths.

==History==
Moths evolved long before butterflies; moth fossils have been found that may be 190 million years old. Both types of Lepidoptera are thought to have co-evolved with flowering plants, mainly because most modern species, both as adults and larvae, feed on flowering plants. One of the earliest known species that is thought to be an ancestor of moths is &quot;Archaeolepis mane&quot;. Its fossil fragments show scaled wings that are similar to caddisflies in their veining.

== Economics ==

=== Significance to humans ===

Some moths, particularly their caterpillars, can be major agricultural pests in many parts of the world. Examples include corn borers and bollworms. The caterpillar of the spongy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;) causes severe damage to forests in the northeastern United States, where it is an invasive species. In temperate climates, the codling moth causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the diamondback moth (&quot;Plutella xylostella&quot;) is perhaps the most serious pest of brassicaceous crops. Also in sub-Saharan Africa, the African sugarcane borer is a major pest of sugarcane, maize, and sorghum.

Several moths in the family Tineidae are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural proteinaceous fibers such as wool or silk. They are less likely to eat mixed materials containing some artificial fibers. There are some reports that they may be repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar, by lavender, or by other natural oils; however, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation. Naphthalene (the chemical used in mothballs) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health.

Despite being commonly thought to be undertaken by all moths, only the larvae of several moth species eat animal fibres, creating holes in articles of clothing, in particular those made of wool. Most species do not eat fabrics, and some moth adults do not even eat at all. Some, like the Luna, Polyphemus, Atlas, Promethea, cecropia, and other large moths do not have mouth parts. This is possible because they live off the food stores from when they were a caterpillar, and only live a short time as an adult (roughly a week for some species). Many species of adult moths do however eat: for instance, many will drink nectar.

Items of fabric infested by clothes moth larvae may be treated by freezing them for several days at a temperature below .

Some moths are farmed for their economic value. The most notable of these is the silkworm, the larva of the domesticated moth &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;. It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its cocoon. , the silk industry produces more than 130 million kilograms of raw silk, worth about 250 million U.S. dollars, each year.

Not all silk is produced by &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;. There are several species of Saturniidae that also are farmed for their silk, such as the ailanthus moth (&quot;Samia cynthia&quot; group of species), the Chinese oak silkmoth (&quot;Antheraea pernyi&quot;), the Assam silkmoth (&quot;Antheraea assamensis&quot;), and the Japanese silk moth (&quot;Antheraea yamamai&quot;).

The larvae of many species are used as food, particularly in Africa, where they are an important source of nutrition. The mopane worm, the caterpillar of &quot;Gonimbrasia belina&quot;, from the family Saturniidae, is a significant food resource in southern Africa. Another saturniid used as food is the cavorting emperor (&quot;Usta terpsichore&quot;). In one country alone, Congo, more than 30 species of moth larvae are harvested. Some are sold not only in the local village markets, but are shipped by the ton from one country to another.

=== Predators and parasites ===

Nocturnal insectivores often feed on moths; these include some bats, some species of owls and other species of birds. Moths also are eaten by some species of lizards, amphibians, cats, dogs, rodents, and some bears. Moth larvae are vulnerable to being parasitized by Ichneumonidae.

Baculoviruses are parasite double-stranded DNA insect viruses that are used mostly as biological control agents. They are members of the Baculoviridae, a family that is restricted to insects. Most baculovirus isolates have been obtained from insects, in particular from Lepidoptera.

There is evidence that ultrasound in the range emitted by bats causes flying moths to make evasive maneuvers. Ultrasonic frequencies trigger a reflex action in the noctuid moth that causes it to drop a few centimeters or inches in its flight to evade attack, and tiger moths can emit clicks to foil bats&#x27; echolocation.

The fungus &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; infects the larvae of many different species of moths.

== Ecological importance ==
Moths, like butterflies, bees and other more popularly recognized pollinating insects, serve an essential role as pollinators for many flowering plants, including species that bees do not visit. Nocturnal moths fly from flower to flower to feed on nectar during the night much as their diurnal relatives do during the day. A study conducted in the UK found moths dusted with pollen from 47 different plant species, including seven species largely ignored by bees. Some studies indicate that certain species of moths, such as those belonging to the families Erebidae and Sphingidae, may be the key pollinators for some flowering plants in the Himalayan ecosystem. The roles of moths as pollinators have been studied less frequently than those of diurnal pollinators, but recent studies have established that moths are important, but often overlooked, nocturnal pollinators of a wide range of plants. Some researchers say it is likely that many plants thought to be dependent on bees for pollination also rely on moths, which have historically been less observed because they pollinate mainly at night.

==Attraction to light==

Moths frequently appear to circle artificial lights. The reason for this behavior (positive phototaxis) is currently unknown.

One hypothesis is called celestial or transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source.

Studies have found that light pollution caused by increasing use of artificial lights has either led to a severe decline in moth population in some parts of the world or has severely disrupted nocturnal pollination.

<doc id="66640" wikidata="Q185381" url="?curid=66640" title="Arnold J. Toynbee">
<text>Arnold Joseph Toynbee (; 14 April 1889 – 22 October 1975) was an English historian, a philosopher of history, an author of numerous books and a research professor of international history at the London School of Economics and King&#x27;s College London. From 1918 to 1950, Toynbee was considered a leading specialist on international affairs; from 1929 to 1956 he was the Director of Studies at Chatham House, in which position he also produced 34 volumes of the &quot;Survey of International Affairs,&quot; a &quot;bible&quot; for international specialists in Britain.

He is best known for his 12-volume &quot;A Study of History&quot; (1934–1961). With his prodigious output of papers, articles, speeches and presentations, and numerous books translated into many languages, Toynbee was widely read and discussed in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Toynbee was born on 14 April 1889 in London, England, to Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861–1941), secretary of the Charity Organization Society, and his wife Sarah Edith Marshall (1859–1939). His mother took the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in English history at Cambridge University, when higher education for women was unusual and before women were allowed to graduate from the university, and his sister Jocelyn Toynbee was an archaeologist and art historian. Arnold Toynbee was a grandson of Joseph Toynbee, a nephew of the 19th-century economist Arnold Toynbee (1852–1883), and a descendant of prominent British intellectuals for several generations.

Having won a scholarship, he was educated at Winchester College, an all-boys independent boarding school in Winchester, Hampshire. From 1907 to 1911, having won a scholarship to Oxford University, he read &quot;literae humaniores&quot; (i.e. classics) at Balliol College, Oxford. Early in Toynbee&#x27;s degree, his father suffered a nervous collapse and was institutionalised, causing financial difficulties for the family. Regardless, Toynbee achieved first class honours in &quot;mods&quot; and in &quot;greats&quot; and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. From 1911 to 1912, he toured Italy and Greece to study the classical landscape and remains that &quot;he had thitherto known only through books&quot;.

===Career===
In 1912, having returned from his travels, Toynbee was elected a fellow of his &quot;alma mater&quot; Balliol College, Oxford, and appointed a tutor in ancient history. Unusually for a British classical scholar of that time, his interests crossed Greek and Roman civilisation, and ranged from Bronze Age Greece to the Byzantine Empire. He also combined traditional classical literary scholarship with the emerging discipline of classical archaeology.

===The First World War===
At the start of the First World War, Toynbee was found, because of a bout of dysentery after his return from Greece, to be unfit for military service. In 1915, he began working for the intelligence department of the British Foreign Office. He worked under Viscount Bryce to investigate the Ottoman atrocities against the Armenians and wrote a number of pro-Allied propaganda leaflets. 

===The Paris Peace Conference===
He served as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, where he helped shape the Treaty of Sèvres. He was present at the meeting at the Hotel Majestic when Lionel Curtis proposed the formation of an Institute of International Affairs, resulting in the formation of Chatham House in London and The Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

===Historian and Director of Studies===
Following the end of the First World War, he returned to the University of London, specialising in the Byzantine Empire and Modern Greek studies and being appointed to the Koraes Professor of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature at King&#x27;s College London in 1919. He would ultimately resign from the chair in 1924, following an academic dispute (see subsection on Greece below). In 1921 and 1922 he was the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; correspondent during the Greco-Turkish War, an experience that resulted in the publication of &quot;The Western Question in Greece and Turkey&quot;. In 1925 he became Research Professor of International History at the London School of Economics. In 1929 he became Director of Studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), a post he held until 1956.

He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1937. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1941 and an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949.

===Personal life===
His first marriage was to Rosalind Murray (1890–1967), daughter of Gilbert Murray, in 1913; they had three sons, of whom Philip Toynbee was the second. Their son Lawrence (born 1922) was a painter and married Jean Constance Asquith, granddaughter of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. Arnold and Rosalind divorced in 1946; Toynbee then married his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter (1893-1980), in the same year. He died on 22 October 1975, age 86.

==Views on the post-World War I peace settlement and geopolitical situation==
In his 1915 book &quot;Nationality &amp; the War&quot;, Toynbee argued that any eventual postwar peace settlement should be guided by the principle of nationality. In Chapter IV of his 1916 book &quot;The New Europe: Essays in Reconstruction&quot;, Toynbee argued against the competing principle of &quot;natural borders.&quot; Toynbee encouraged the use of plebiscites for the allocation of disputed territories, an idea brought to fruition by the postwar use of plebiscites. 

In his 1915 book &quot;Nationality &amp; the War&quot;, Toynbee offered various elaborate proposals and predictions for the future of various countries, both European and non-European. For example, he advocated an autonomous Poland in a federal arrangement with Russia, the retention of Austro-Hungarian dominion over Czech and Slovak lands, Austro-Hungarian relinquishment of Galicia, Transylvania, and Bukovina, independence for Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia, the division of Bessarabia between Russia and Romania and joint use by those two countries of the port of Odessa, Russian acquisition of Outer Mongolia and the Tarim Basin in central Asia and of Pontus and the Armenian Vilayets in the Ottoman Empire, a strong, independent, central government in Persia. and a Russo-British partitioning of Afghanistan.

==Academic and cultural influence==
Michael Lang says that for much of the twentieth century, 
In his best-known work, &quot;A Study of History&quot;, published 1934–1961, Toynbee

examined the rise and fall of 26 civilisations in the course of human history, and he concluded that they rose by responding successfully to challenges under the leadership of creative minorities composed of elite leaders.
&quot;A Study of History&quot; was both a commercial and an academic success. In the US alone, more than 7,000 sets of the ten-volume edition were sold by 1955. A 1947 one-volume 1947 abridgement by David Churchill Somervell of the first six volumes sold over 300,000 copies in the US. Toynbee appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1947, with an article describing his work as &quot;the most provocative work of historical theory written in England since Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;&quot;. He became a regular commentator for the BBC on the then-current hostility between east and west and on non-western views of the western world.

Toynbee&#x27;s overall theory was taken up by some scholars, such as Ernst Robert Curtius, as a sort of paradigm in the post-war period. In the opening pages of his own study of medieval Latin literature. Curtius wrote:
:How do cultures, and the historical entities which are their media, arise, grow and decay? Only a comparative morphology with exact procedures can hope to answer these questions. It was Arnold J. Toynbee who undertook the task.

After 1960, Toynbee&#x27;s ideas faded in both academia and in popular culture. His work is seldom cited today. In general, historians pointed to his preference for myths, allegories, and religion over factual data. His critics argued that his conclusions are more those of a Christian moralist than of a historian. In his 2011 article for the &quot;Journal of History&quot; titled &quot;Globalization and Global History in Toynbee,&quot; historian Michael Lang wrote:
:To many world historians today, Arnold J. Toynbee is regarded like an embarrassing uncle at a house party. He gets a requisite introduction by virtue of his place on the family tree, but he is quickly passed over for other friends and relatives.

Toynbee&#x27;s work, however, continues to be referenced by some classical historians, because &quot;his training and surest touch is in the world of classical antiquity.&quot; His roots in classical literature are also manifested by similarities between his approach and that of classical historians such as Herodotus and Thucydides. Comparative history, in which his work is often categorised, has been in the doldrums.

Toynbee is thanked in the acknowledgment section of Mark Lane&#x27;s &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; (1966), which critiques the official explanation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, for having been &quot;kind enough to read the manuscript and make suggestions&quot; to the book.

==Political influence in foreign policy==
While the writing of the Study was underway, Toynbee produced numerous smaller works and served as Director of Studies of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, (from 1929 to 1956). He also retained his position at the London School of Economics until his retirement in 1956.

===Foreign Office and Paris Peace Conference 1919===
Toynbee worked for the Political Intelligence Department of the British Foreign Office during World War I and served as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. 

===Chatham House===
He was Director of Studies at Chatham House from 1929 to 1956.

Toynbee was co-editor with his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter, of the RIIA&#x27;s annual &quot;Survey of International Affairs,&quot; from 1922 to 1956. It became the &quot;bible&quot; for international specialists in Britain.

===Chatham House&#x27;s WWII Foreign Press and Research Service===

At the outbreak of the Second World War the institute was decentralised for security reasons, with many of the staff moving to Balliol College, Oxford from Chatham House&#x27;s main buildings in St James&#x27;s Square. There, the Foreign Press and Research Service of the Institute worked closely with the Foreign Office to provide intelligence for and to work closely with the Foreign Office dedicating their research to the war effort under the Chairmanship of Waldorf Astor. 

The formal remit of Chatham House for the FPRS at Balliol was:
1. To review the press overseas.
2. To “produce at the request of the Foreign Office, and the Service and other Departments, memoranda giving the historical and political background on any given situation on which information is desired”.
3. “To provide information on special points desired&quot; (in regards to each country). It provided various reports on foreign press, historical and political background of the enemy and various other topics.

Many eminent historians served on the FPRS under Arnold J. Toynbee as its Director and with Lionel Curtis (represented the Chairman) at Oxford until 1941 when Ivison Macadam took over the role from Curtis. There were four deputy directors. The four Deputy Directors were Alfred Zimmern, George N. Clark, Herbert J. Patton and Charles K. Webster and a number of experts in its nineteen divisions.

It was moved to the Foreign Office 1943–46.

===Meeting Hitler===
While on a visit in Berlin in 1936 to address the Law Society, Toynbee was invited to a private interview with Adolf Hitler at Hitler&#x27;s request. During the interview, which was held a day before Toynbee delivered his lecture, Hitler emphasized his limited expansionist aim of building a greater German nation, and his desire for British understanding and co-operation with Nazi Germany. Hitler also suggested Germany could be an ally to Britain in the Asia-Pacific region if Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonial empire were restored. Toynbee believed that Hitler was sincere and endorsed Hitler&#x27;s message in a confidential memorandum for the British prime minister and foreign secretary.

Toynbee presented his lecture in English, but copies of it were circulated in German by Nazi officials, and it was warmly received by his Berlin audience who appreciated its conciliatory tone. Tracy Philipps, a British &#x27;diplomat&#x27; stationed in Berlin at the time, later informed Toynbee that it &#x27;was an eager topic of discussion everywhere&#x27;. Back home, some of Toynbee&#x27;s colleagues were dismayed by his attempts at managing Anglo-German relations.

===Russia===
Toynbee was troubled by the Russian Revolution since he saw Russia as a non-Western society and the revolution as a threat to Western society. However, in 1952, he argued that the Soviet Union had been a victim of Western aggression. He portrayed the Cold War as a religious competition that pitted a Marxist materialist heresy against the West&#x27;s spiritual Christian heritage, which had already been foolishly rejected by a secularised West. A heated debate ensued, and an editorial in &quot;The Times&quot; promptly attacked Toynbee for treating communism as a &quot;spiritual force&quot;.

===Greece===
Toynbee was a leading analyst of developments in the Middle East. His support for Greece and hostility to the Turks during World War I had gained him an appointment to the Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History at King&#x27;s College, University of London.

===The Middle East===
His stance during World War I reflected less sympathy for the Arab cause and took a pro-Zionist outlook. Toynbee investigated Zionism in 1915 at the Information Department of the Foreign Office, and in 1917 he published a memorandum with his colleague Lewis Namier which supported exclusive Jewish political rights in Ottoman Palestine. He expressed support for Jewish immigration to Palestine, which he believed had &quot;begun to recover its ancient prosperity&quot; as a result. Historian Isaiah Friedman felt Toynbee had been influenced by the Palestine Arab delegation which was visiting London in 1922. His subsequent writings reveal his changing outlook on the subject, and by the late 1940s he had moved away from the Zionist concept taking into account the Palestine Arabs&#x27; tenure. Toynbee maintained that the Jewish people had neither historic nor legal claims to Palestine, stating that the Arab &quot;population&#x27;s human rights to their homes and property over-ride all other rights in cases where claims conflict.&quot; Toynbee did concede that Jews, &quot;being the only surviving representatives of any of the pre-Arab inhabitants of Palestine, had a further claim to a national home in Palestine,&quot; but even so Toynbee felt the Balfour Declaration had guaranteed that such a claim was valid &quot;only in so far as it can be implemented without injury to the rights and to the legitimate interests of the native Arab population of Palestine.&quot;

Although not the official view of Chatham House which discussed numerous opinions on the then evolving situation, Toynbee came to be known, by his own admission, as &quot;the Western spokesman for the Arab cause.&quot;

The views Toynbee expressed in the 1950s continued to oppose the formation of a Jewish state, partly out of his concern that it would increase the risk of Middle East conflict with the Jews and Arabs and could lead to a nuclear confrontation.Toynbee in his article &quot;Jewish Rights in Palestine&quot;, challenged the views of the editor of the Jewish Quarterly Review, historian and talmudic scholar Solomon Zeitlin, who published his rebuke, &quot;Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)&quot; in the same issue. 
However, as a result of Toynbee&#x27;s debate in January 1961 with Yaakov Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to Canada, Toynbee softened his view and called on Israel, by then established, to fulfil its special &quot;mission to make contributions to worldwide efforts to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war.&quot; 

===Zionism and antisemitism===
Though Toynbee co-authoured papers with and commissioned articles from Jewish scholars, and included Jewish friends among those whom he praised in his book &quot;Acquaintances&quot;,
Toynbee&#x27;s views on Judaism and Middle East politics prompted allegations of antisemitism. Abba Eban&#x27;s 1955 speech &quot;The Toynbee Heresy&quot;, for example, bases the accusation of antisemitism on, among other things, the allegedly negative portrayal of Judaism in &quot;A Study of History&quot;, Toynbee&#x27;s frequent use of the adjective &quot;Judaic&quot; to describe episodes of &quot;extreme brutality&quot; even where Jews were not involved, as in the Gothic persecution of Christians, Toynbee&#x27;s reference to the Jewish presence in Palestine at the time of the publication of &quot;A Study of History&quot; as merely a &quot;fossil remnant&quot;, his portrayal of Judaism as fanatical and provincial and as having advanced the cause of civilization only as a seedbed for Christianity, his view that Zionism offends Jewish piety by attempting to effect a return to the Mideast through secular means rather than entrusting it to a divinely promised Messiah, and certain troubling passages in Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;oeuvres&quot;, such as a passage in Vol.8 of &quot;A Study of History&quot; in which Toynbee wrote that, &quot;On the Day of Judgement, the gravest crime standing to the German National Socialists&#x27; account might be, not that they had exterminated a majority of the Western Jews, but that they had caused the surviving remnant of Jewry to stumble.&quot;

===Dialogue with Daisaku Ikeda===
In 1971 and &#x27;73, Toynbee met and corresponded with Daisaku Ikeda, president of the Soka Gakkai International. Their dialogue was later edited and presented in the form of a book, &quot;Choose Life&quot;.

His reputation was growing in Japan long before Ikeda made his approach. Toynbee took Japanese culture and history seriously. He was pessimistic about the fate of western civilization. He was genuinely interested in religions such as Shinto and, particularly, Buddhism ... and the late 1960s was an era of &#x27;New Age&#x27; gurus such as Buckminster Fuller and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Toynbee was starting to play such a role for Japan, whether Ikeda had approached him or not, writes historian Louis Turner. In 1984 his granddaughter Polly Toynbee wrote an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; attributing her late grandfather&#x27;s association with Ikeda as a consequence of his old age, frailty and trusting nature. 

==Challenge and response==
With the civilisations as units identified, he presented the history of each in terms of challenge-and-response, a process he proposed as a scientific law of history. Civilizations arose in response to some set of extreme challenges, when &quot;creative minorities&quot; devised new solutions that reoriented their entire society. Challenges and responses were physical, as when the Sumerians exploited the intractable swamps of southern Iraq by organising the Neolithic inhabitants into a society capable of carrying out large-scale irrigation projects; or social, as when the Catholic Church resolved the chaos of post-Roman Europe by enrolling the new Germanic kingdoms in a single religious community. When civilisations responded to challenges, they grew; but they disintegrated when their leaders stopped responding creatively, sinking into nationalism, militarism, and the tyranny of a despotic minority. According to an Editor&#x27;s Note in an edition of Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;A Study of History,&quot; Toynbee believed that societies always die from suicide or murder rather than natural causes; and nearly always the former. He sees the growth and decline of civilizations as a spiritual process, writing that &quot;Man achieves civilization, not as a result of superior biological endowment or geographical environment, but as a response to a challenge in a situation of special difficulty which rouses him to make a hitherto unprecedented effort.&quot;

==Toynbee Prize Foundation==

Named after Arnold J. Toynbee, the [Toynbee Prize] Foundation was chartered in 1987 &#x27;to contribute to the development of the social sciences, as defined from a broad historical view of human society and of human and social problems.&#x27; In addition to awarding the Toynbee Prize, the foundation sponsors scholarly engagement with global history through sponsorship of sessions at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association, of international conferences, of the journal &quot;New Global Studies&quot; and of the Global History Forum.

The Toynbee Prize is an honorary award, recognising social scientists for significant academic and public contributions to humanity. Currently, it is awarded every other year for work that makes a significant contribution to the study of global history. The recipients have been Raymond Aron, Lord Kenneth Clark, Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, Natalie Zemon Davis, Albert Hirschman, George Kennan, Bruce Mazlish, J. R. McNeill, William McNeill, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Barbara Ward, Lady Jackson, Sir Brian Urquhart, Michael Adas, Christopher Bayly, and Jürgen Osterhammel.

*&quot;The Survey of International Affairs&quot; was published by Oxford University Press under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs between 1925 and 1977 and covered the years 1920–1963. Toynbee wrote, with assistants, the Pre-War Series (covering the years 1920–1938) and the War-Time Series (1938–1946), and contributed introductions to the first two volumes of the Post-War Series (1947–1948 and 1949–1950). His actual contributions varied in extent from year to year.
*A complementary series, &quot;Documents on International Affairs&quot;, covering the years 1928–1963, was published by Oxford University Press between 1929 and 1973. Toynbee supervised the compilation of the first of the 1939–1946 volumes, and wrote a preface for both that and the 1947–1948 volume.

<text>Populous is a video game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts, released originally for the Amiga in 1989, and is regarded by many as the first god game. With over four million copies sold, &quot;Populous&quot; is one of the best-selling PC games of all time.

The player assumes the role of a deity, who must lead followers through direction, manipulation, and divine intervention, with the goal of eliminating the followers led by the opposite deity. Played from an isometric perspective, the game consists of more than 500 levels, with each level being a piece of land which contains the player&#x27;s followers and the enemy&#x27;s followers. The player is tasked with defeating the enemy followers and increasing their own followers&#x27; population using a series of divine powers before moving on to the next level. The game was designed by Peter Molyneux, and Bullfrog developed a gameplay prototype via a board game they invented using Lego.

The game received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the game&#x27;s graphics, design, sounds and replay value. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades, including Game of the Year from several gaming publications. Retrospectively, it has been considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The game was ported to many other computer systems and was later supported with multiple expansion packs. It is the first game in the &quot;Populous&quot; series, preceding &quot;Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The main action window in &quot;Populous&quot; is viewed from an isometric perspective, and it is set in a &quot;tabletop&quot; on which are set the command icons, the world map (depicted as an open book) and a slider bar that measures the level of the player&#x27;s divine power or &quot;mana&quot;.

The game consists of 500 levels, and each level represents an area of land on which live the player&#x27;s followers and the enemy followers. In order to progress to the next level the player must increase the number of their followers such that they can wipe out the enemy followers. This is done by using a series of divine powers. There are a number of different landscapes the world (depicted on the page in the book) can be, such as desert, rock and lava, snow and ice, etc. and the type of landscape is not merely aesthetic: it affects the development of the player&#x27;s and enemy&#x27;s followers.

The most basic power is raising and lowering land. This is primarily done in order to provide flat land for the player&#x27;s followers to build on (though it is also possible to remove land from around the enemy&#x27;s followers). As the player&#x27;s followers build more houses they create more followers, and this increases the player&#x27;s mana level.

Increasing the mana level unlocks additional divine powers that allow the player to interact further with the landscape and the population. The powers include the ability to cause earthquakes and floods, create swamps and volcanoes, and turn ordinary followers into more powerful knights.

==Plot==
In this game the player adopts the role of a deity and assumes the responsibility of shepherding people by direction, manipulation, and divine intervention. The player has the ability to shape the landscape and grow their civilization – and their divine power – with the overall aim of having their followers conquer an enemy force, which is led by an opposing deity.

==Development==

Peter Molyneux led development, inspired by Bullfrog&#x27;s artist Glenn Corpes having drawn isometric blocks after playing David Braben&#x27;s Virus. The game&#x27;s budget was £20,000.

Initially Molyneux developed an isometric landscape, then populated it with little people that he called &quot;peeps&quot;, but there was no game; all that happened was that the peeps wandered around the landscape until they reached a barrier such as water. He developed the raise/lower terrain gameplay mechanic simply as a way of helping the peeps to move around. Then, as a way of reducing the number of peeps on the screen, he decided that if a peep encountered a piece of blank, flat land, it would build a house, and that a larger area of land would enable a peep to build a larger house. Thus the core mechanics – god-like intervention and the desire for peeps to expand – were created.

The endgame – of creating a final battle to force the two sides to enter a final conflict – developed as a result of the developmental games going on for hours and having no firm end.

Bullfrog attempted to prototype the gameplay via a board game they invented using Lego, and Molyneux admits that whilst it didn&#x27;t help the developers to balance the game at all, it provided a useful media angle to help publicise the game. One curious incident related in media coverage involved an attempt by Molyneux to investigate the displacement of water when adding blocks to the world model, this being frustrated by Lego not being watertight and thus causing a &quot;flood&quot; that &quot;dissuaded further experimentation&quot;.

During the test phase the testers requested a cheat code to skip to the end of the game, as there was insufficient time to play through all 500 levels, and it was only at this point that Bullfrog realised that they had not included any kind of ending to the game. The team quickly repurposed an interstitial page from between levels and used it as the final screen.

After demoing the game to over a dozen publishers, Bullfrog eventually gained the interest of Electronic Arts, who had a gap in their spring release schedule and was willing to take a chance on the game. Bullfrog accepted their offer, although Molyneux later described the contract as &quot;pretty atrocious:&quot; 10% royalties on units sold, rising to 12% after one million units sold, with only a small up-front payment.

Peter Molyneux presented a post-mortem of the game&#x27;s development and work in progress on a related personal project at Game Developers Conference in 2011.

After the 1990 Amiga release, the game was released to Sega Genesis in 1990-1991.

==Expansion packs==
Bullfrog produced Populous World Editor, which gave users the ability to modify the appearance of characters, cities, and terrain. An expansion pack called Populous: The Promised Lands added five new types of landscape (the geometric Silly Land, Wild West, Lego style Block Land, Revolution Française, and computer themed Bit Plains). In addition, another expansion disk called Populous: The Final Frontier added a single new landscape-type and was released as a cover disk for &quot;The One&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Populous&quot; was released in 1989 to almost universal critical acclaim. The game received a 5 out of 5 stars in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #150 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. Biff Kritzen of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the game a positive review, noting, &quot;as heavy-handed as the premise sounds, it really is a rather light-hearted game.&quot; The simple design and layout were praised, as were the game&#x27;s colourful graphics. In a 1993 survey of pre 20th-century strategy games the magazine gave the game three stars out of five, calling it a &quot;quasi-arcade game, but with sustained play value&quot;. &quot;MegaTech&quot; magazine stated that the game has &quot;super graphics and 500 levels. &quot;Populous&quot; is both highly original and amazingly addictive, with a constant challenge on offer&quot;. They gave the Mega Drive version of &quot;Populous&quot; an overall score of 91%.

In the September–October 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue #9), John Harrington differed from other reviewers, only giving the game a rating of 2 out of 5, calling it &quot;repetitive&quot; and saying, &quot;Although you take on the role of a god, somehow there is a lack of mystique about this game, and despite the cute graphics, the colourful worlds and the commendably elegant icon-driven game system, this game left me with a less than &#x27;god like&#x27; feeling.&quot;

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the Amiga version, giving it an overall score of 96%. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the SNES version 31 out of 40. &quot;Raze&quot; gave the Mega Drive version of &quot;Populous&quot; an overall score of 89%. &quot;Zero&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Populous&quot; an overall score of 92%. &quot;Your Amiga&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Populous&quot; an overall score of 93%. &quot;ST/Amiga Format&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Populous&quot; an overall score of 92%.

Maxwell Eden reviewed &quot;Populous World Editor&quot; for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and stated that &quot;Now all &quot;Populous&quot; fans wanting to be apprentice wizards can share in the magic of that gift. &quot;Populous&quot; is a great game and &quot;PWE&quot; is an ideal enhancement that breathes new life into weary bytes. Absolute power was never as incorruptible, nor this creative.&quot;

&quot;Compute!&quot; named the game to its list of &quot;nine great games for 1989&quot;, stating that with &quot;great graphics, a simple-to-learn interface, and almost unlimited variety, &quot;Populous&quot; is a must buy for 1989&quot;. Peter Molyneux estimated that the game accounted for nearly a third of all the revenue of Electronic Arts in that year.

Orson Scott Card in &quot;Compute!&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s user interface, but praised the graphics and the ability to &quot;create your own worlds ... you control the world of the game, instead of the other way around&quot;. &quot;STart&quot; in 1990 gave &quot;kudos especially to Peter Molyneux, the creative force behind &quot;Populous&quot;&quot;. The magazine called the Atari ST version &quot;a fascinating, fun and challenging game. It&#x27;s unlike any other computer game I&#x27;ve ever seen, ever. Don&#x27;t miss it, unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool arcade gamer who has no time for strategy&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; picked the game as the No. 16 greatest game available in 1991, saying: &quot;Talk about big-time role-playing. Most video games posit you as a mere sword-wielding, perilously mortal human; in &quot;Populous&quot; you&#x27;re a deity. Slow-paced, intricate, and difficult to learn: You literally have to create entire worlds while all the time battling those pesky forces of evil.&quot;

The game was released in the same month that &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; controversy gained publicity in the United States following the publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; in the United States. Shortly after release, Bullfrog was contacted by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and was warned that the &quot;good vs evil&quot; nature of the game could lead to them receiving similar fatwā, although this did not materialize.

By October 1997, global sales of &quot;Populous&quot; had surpassed 3 million units, a commercial performance that &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; described as &quot;an enormous hit&quot;. By 2001, &quot;Populous&quot; had sold four million copies, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time.

===Awards===
In 1990 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;Populous&quot; as Strategy Game of the Year. In 1996, the magazine named it the 30th best game ever, with the editors calling it &quot;the father of real-time strategy games&quot;. In 1991 it won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1990&quot;, the &quot;1990 Computer Game of the Year&quot; in issue 25 of American video game magazine &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot;, and was voted the sixth best game of all time in &quot;Amiga Power&quot;. In 1992 &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at No. 25 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Populous&quot; as the third best computer game ever. The editors hailed it as &quot;unbelievably addictive fun, and one of the most appealing and playable strategy games of all time.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Populous&quot; as number 44 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;A perfect blend of realtime strategy, resource management, and more than a little humor, it remains unsurpassed in the genre it created.&quot; In 2018, Complex placed the game 98th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. IGN ranked Populous 70th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1990 Bullfrog used the &quot;Populous&quot; engine to develop &quot;Powermonger&quot;, a strategic combat-oriented game with similar mechanics to &quot;Populous&quot;, but with a 3-dimensional graphical interface. In 1991 they developed and released a true sequel, &quot;Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods&quot;, and in 1998 a further direct sequel, &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Populous&quot; was also released on the SNES, developed by Imagineer as one of the original titles for the console in Japan, and features the addition of a race based on the Three Little Pigs.

&quot;Populous DS&quot;, a new version of the game (published by Xseed Games in America and Rising Star Games in Europe), was developed by Genki for the Nintendo DS and released 11 November 2008. The game allows the user to shape the in-game landscape using the DS&#x27;s stylus. It also features a multiplayer mode allowing four players to play over a wireless connection.

&quot;Populous&quot; has been re-released through GOG.com and on Origin through the Humble Origin Bundle sale. It runs under DOSBox.

The browser-based game &quot;Reprisal&quot; was created in 2012 by Electrolyte and Last17 as a homage to &quot;Populous&quot;.

&quot;Godus&quot; (formerly &quot;Project GODUS&quot;) was revealed as a URL on the face of &quot;Curiosity – What&#x27;s Inside the Cube?&quot;, and &quot;is aimed to reimagine&quot; &quot;Populous&quot;.

<doc id="66655" wikidata="Q125057" url="?curid=66655" title="Richard Francis Burton">
<text>Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, KCMG, FRGS, (19 March 1821 – 20 October 1890) was a British explorer, army officer, orientalist writer and scholar. He was famed for his travels and explorations in Asia, Africa and South America, as well as his extensive knowledge of languages and cultures, speaking up to 29 different languages.

Born in Torquay, Devon, Burton joined the Bombay Army as an officer in 1842, beginning an eighteen-year military career which included a brief stint in the Crimean War. He was subsequently engaged by the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) to explore the East African coast, where Burton along with John Hanning Speke led an expedition to discover the source of the Nile and became the first European known to have seen Lake Tanganyika. He later served as the British consul in Fernando Pó, Santos, Damascus and Trieste. Burton was also a Fellow of the RGS and was awarded a knighthood in 1886.

His best-known achievements include undertaking the Hajj to Mecca in disguise, translating &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; and &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;, and publishing the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; in English. Although he abandoned his university studies, Burton became a prolific and erudite author and wrote numerous books and academic articles on subjects such as human behaviour, travel, falconry, fencing, sexual practices and ethnography.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Richard Burton was born in Torquay, Devon, on 19 March 1821; in his autobiography, he incorrectly claimed to have been born in the family home of Barham House in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Burton was baptised on 2 September 1821 at Elstree Church in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. His father, Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Netterville Burton, was an Anglo-Irish officer in the British Army&#x27;s 36th (Herefordshire) Regiment of Foot. Joseph, through his mother&#x27;s family, the Campbells of Tuam, was a first cousin of Henry Pearce Driscoll and Eliza Graves. Burton&#x27;s mother, Martha Baker, was the daughter and co-heiress of Richard Baker, a wealthy Hertfordshire squire whom Burton was named after. He had two siblings, Maria Katherine Elizabeth Burton (who married Lieutenant-General Sir Henry William Stisted) and Edward Joseph Netterville Burton.

Burton&#x27;s family travelled extensively during his childhood and employed various tutors to educate him. In 1825, they moved to Tours in France. In 1829, Burton began a formal education at a preparatory school in Richmond Green, Surrey, run by Reverend Charles Delafosse. His family travelled between England, France and Italy. Burton showed a talent for learning languages and quickly learned French, Italian, Neapolitan and Latin, as well as several dialects. During his youth, he allegedly had a sexual relationship with a Roma girl and learned the rudiments of the Romani language. The peregrinations of Burton&#x27;s youth may have encouraged him to regard himself as an outsider for much of his life. As he later wrote, &quot;Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause&quot;.

On 19 November 1840, he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford. Before getting a room at the college, Burton lived for a short time in the house of William Alexander Greenhill, a doctor at the Radcliffe Infirmary. There, he met John Henry Newman, whose churchwarden was Greenhill. Despite his intelligence and ability, Burton was antagonised by his teachers and peers. During his first term, he allegedly challenged another student to a duel after the latter mocked Burton&#x27;s moustache. Burton continued to gratify his love of languages by studying Arabic; he also spent his time learning falconry and fencing. In April 1842, Burton attended a steeplechase in a deliberate violation of college rules and subsequently told the college&#x27;s authorities that students should be allowed to attend such events. Hoping to be merely rusticated, the punishment received by some less provocative students who had also visited the steeplechase, he was instead permanently expelled from the college.

According to Ed Rice, speaking on Burton&#x27;s university days, &quot;He stirred the bile of the dons by speaking real—that is, Roman—Latin instead of the artificial type peculiar to England, and he spoke Greek Romaically, with the accent of Athens, as he had learned it from a Greek merchant at Marseille, as well as the classical forms. Such a linguistic feat was a tribute to Burton&#x27;s remarkable ear and memory, for he was only a teenager when he was in Italy and southern France.&quot;

===Bombay Army career===
In his own words, &quot;fit for nothing but to be shot at for six pence a day&quot;, Burton was commissioned into the Bombay Army at the behest of his former classmates in college who were already serving as officers there. He had hoped to fight in the First Anglo-Afghan War, but the conflict was over by the time Burton arrived in India. He was posted to the 18th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, which was stationed in Gujarat and under the command of General Charles James Napier. While in India, he became a proficient speaker of Hindustani, Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi, Saraiki, Marathi, Persian and Arabic. His studies of Hindu culture had progressed to such an extent that &quot;my Hindu teacher officially allowed me to wear the &quot;janeo&quot;&quot;. Him Chand, his &quot;gotra&quot; teacher and a Nagar Brahmin, was possibly an apostate. Burton had a documented interest and actively participated in the cultures and religions of India. This was one of the many peculiar habits that set him apart from other British officers in India. While in the Bombay Army, he kept a large menagerie of tame monkeys in the hopes of learning their language, accumulating sixty &quot;words&quot;. He also earned the nickname &quot;Ruffian Dick&quot; for his &quot;demonic ferocity as a fighter and because he had fought in single combat more enemies than perhaps any other man of his time&quot;.

According to Rice, &quot;Burton now regarded the seven years in India as time wasted.&quot; Yet he had &quot;already passed the official examinations in six languages and was studying two more and was eminently qualified.&quot; His religious experiences were varied, including attending Catholic services, becoming a Naga Brahmin, converting to Sikhism and Islam, and undergoing &quot;chilla&quot; for Qadiriyya Sufism. Regarding Burton&#x27;s Muslim beliefs, Rice stated that &quot;he was circumcised, and made a Muslim, and lived like a Muslim and prayed and practiced like one.&quot; Furthermore, Burton, &quot;was entitled to call himself a &quot;hāfiz&quot;, one who can recite the Qur&#x27;ān from memory.&quot;

===First explorations and journey to Mecca===
Motivated by his love for adventure, Burton gained the approval of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) for an exploration of the Middle East, and, now at the rank of captain, received permission from the directors of the East India Company (EIC) to take leave from the Bombay Army. The seven years he spent in India gave Burton a familiarity with the customs and behaviour of Muslims and prepared him to attempt a Hajj to Mecca and Medina. He planned it whilst travelling disguised among Muslims in Sindh, and had laboriously prepared it by studying and practising Muslim culture, including undergoing circumcision to further lower the risk of being discovered. 

Burton&#x27;s undertaking of the Hajj in 1853 was his realisation of &quot;the plans and hopes of many and many a year... to study thoroughly the inner life of the Moslem.&quot; He donned the guise of a Persian mirza, and then a Sunni sheikh, doctor, magician and dervish, accompanied by an enslaved Indian boy named Nūr. In April, he travelled through Alexandria before reaching Cairo by May, where Burton stayed during Ramadan in June. He further equipped himself with a case for carrying the Quran, but which instead had three compartments for his watch, compass, money, penknife, pencils and numbered pieces of paper for taking notes. 

Burton travelled onwards with a group of nomads to Suez before sailing to Yambu and joining a caravan to Medina, where he arrived on 27 July. Departing Medina with a caravan on 31 August, Burton entered Mecca on 11 September, where he participated in the Tawaf. He travelled to Mount Arafat and participated in the stoning of the Devil, all the while taking notes on the Kaaba, its Black Stone and the Zamzam Well. Departing Mecca, he journeyed to Jeddah and then back to Cairo, returning to Army duty in Bombay. In India, Burton wrote his &quot;Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah&quot;, writing that &quot;at Mecca there is nothing theatrical, nothing that suggests the opera, but all is simple and impressive... tending, I believe, after its fashion, to good.&quot;

Although Burton was not the first non-Muslim European to undertake the Hajj, with Ludovico di Varthema doing it in 1503 and Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1815, his attempt is the most famous and the best documented of the period. He adopted various disguises, including that of a Pashtun, to account for any oddities in speech, but he still had to demonstrate an understanding of intricate Islamic traditions and a familiarity with the minutiae of Eastern manners and etiquette. Burton&#x27;s trek to Mecca was dangerous, and his caravan was attacked by bandits (a common experience at the time). As he put it, although &quot;... neither Koran or Sultan enjoin the death of Jew or Christian intruding within the columns that note the sanctuary limits, nothing could save a European detected by the populace, or one who after pilgrimage declared himself an unbeliever&quot;. The pilgrimage entitled him to the title of Hajji and to wear the green turban.

While back in India, Burton sat for the examination as an Arab linguist for the EIC. The examiner was Robert Lambert Playfair, who mistrusted Burton. As academic George Percy Badger knew Arabic well, Playfair asked Badger to oversee the exam. Having been told that Burton could be vindictive, and wishing to avoid any animosity should he fail, Badger declined. Eventually, Playfair conducted the tests; despite Burton&#x27;s success in living like an Arab, Playfair recommended to the committee that Burton be failed. Badger later told Burton that &quot;After looking [Burton&#x27;s test] over, I sent them back to [Playfair] with a note eulogising your attainments and... remarking on the absurdity of the Bombay Committee being made to judge your proficiency inasmuch as I did not believe that any of them possessed a tithe of the knowledge of Arabic you did.&quot;

===Early explorations===
In May 1854, Burton travelled to Aden in preparation for an RGS-backed expedition, which included John Hanning Speke, to Somaliland. The expedition lasted from 29October 1854 to 9February 1855, with much of its time spent in Zeila, where Burton was a guest of the town&#x27;s governor Sharmarke Ali Saleh. Burton, assuming the disguise of an Arab merchant &quot;Hajji Mirza Abdullah&quot;, awaited word that the road to Harar was safe. On 29 December, Burton met with Gerard Adan in the village of Sagharrah and openly proclaimed himself as a British officer with a letter for the Emir of Harar. On 3 January 1855, Burton made it to Harar and was graciously met by the Emir. He stayed in the city for ten days, officially a guest of the Emir but in reality his prisoner. Burton also investigated local landmarks in Harar; according to him, &quot;A tradition exists that with the entrance of the first [white] Christian, Harar will fall.&quot; With Burton&#x27;s entry, the tradition was broken. The journey back was plagued by lack of supplies, and Burton wrote that he would have died of thirst had he not seen desert birds and realized they would be near water. He made it back to Berbera on 31 January 1855.

Following this expedition, Burton prepared to set out in search of the source of the Nile, accompanied by Speke and a number of African porters and expedition guides. The Indian Navy schooner transported them to Berbera on 7 April 1855. While the expedition was camped near Berbera, they were attacked by a group of Somali warriors from the Isaaq clan. The British estimated the number of attackers at 200. In the ensuing fight, Speke was wounded in eleven places before he managed to escape, while Burton was impaled with a javelin, the point entering one cheek and exiting the other, leaving a permanent scar; he was forced to escape with the weapon still transfixing his head. Burton subsequently wrote that the Somalis were a &quot;fierce and turbulent race&quot;. However, the failure of this expedition (which also resulted in the second blockade of Berbera) was viewed harshly by the British authorities, and a two-year investigation was set up to determine to what extent Burton was culpable for this disaster. While he was largely cleared of any blame, his career prospects were damaged. He described the attack in &quot;First Footsteps in East Africa&quot; (1856).

After recovering from his wounds in London, Burton travelled to Constantinople during the Crimean War, seeking an officer&#x27;s commission. He received one from Major-General William Ferguson Beatson as the chief of staff for Beatson&#x27;s Horse, an irregular Ottoman cavalry unit stationed in Gallipoli. Burton returned to England after an incident which implicated him as the instigator of a mutiny among the unit, damaging his reputation and disgracing Beatson.

===Exploring the African Great Lakes===

In 1856, the Royal Geographical Society funded another expedition for Burton and Speke, &quot;and exploration of the then utterly unknown Lake regions of Central Africa.&quot; They would travel from Zanzibar to Ujiji along a caravan route established in 1825 by an Arab ivory and slave merchant. The Great Journey commenced on 5 June 1857 with their departure from Zanzibar, where they had stayed at the residence of Atkins Hamerton, the British consul, their caravan consisting of Baluchi mercenaries led by Ramji, 36 porters, eventually a total of 132 persons, all led by the caravan leader Said bin Salim. From the beginning, Burton and Speke were hindered by disease, malaria, fevers and other maladies, at times both having to be carried in a hammock. Pack animals died, and natives deserted, taking supplies with them. Yet, on 7 November 1857, they made it to Kazeh, and departed for Ujiji on 14 December. Speke wanted to head north, sure they would find the source of the Nile at what he later named Victoria Nyanza, but Burton persisted in heading west.
The expedition arrived at Lake Tanganyika on 13 February 1858. Burton was awestruck by the sight of the magnificent lake, but Speke, who had been temporarily blinded, was unable to see the body of water. By this point much of their surveying equipment was lost, ruined or stolen, and they were unable to complete surveys of the area as well as they wished. Burton was again taken ill on the return journey; Speke continued exploring without him, making a journey to the north and eventually locating the great Lake Victoria, or Victoria Nyanza, on 3 August. Lacking supplies and proper instruments, Speke was unable to survey the area properly but was privately convinced that it was the long-sought source of the Nile. Burton&#x27;s description of the journey is given in &quot;Lake Regions of Equatorial Africa&quot; (1860). Speke gave his own account in &quot;The Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile&quot; (1863).

Burton and Speke made it back to Zanzibar on 4 March 1859, and left on 22 March for Aden. Speke immediately boarded the for London, where he gave lectures, and was awarded a second expedition by the Society. Burton arrived in London on 21 May, discovering &quot;My companion now stood forth in his new colours, an angry rival.&quot; Speke additionally published &quot;What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile&quot; (1863), while Burton&#x27;s &quot;Zanzibar; City, Island, and Coast&quot; was eventually published in 1872.

Burton then departed on a trip to the United States in April 1860, eventually making it to Salt Lake City on 25 August. There he studied Mormonism and met Brigham Young. Burton departed San Francisco on 15 November for the voyage back to England, where he published &quot;The City of the Saints and Across the Rocky Mountains to California&quot;.

====Burton and Speke====

A prolonged public quarrel followed, damaging the reputations of both Burton and Speke. Some biographers have suggested that friends of Speke (particularly Laurence Oliphant) had initially stirred up trouble between the two. Burton&#x27;s sympathizers contend that Speke resented Burton&#x27;s leadership role. Tim Jeal, who has accessed Speke&#x27;s personal papers, suggests that it was more likely the other way around, Burton being jealous and resentful of Speke&#x27;s determination and success. &quot;As the years went by, [Burton] would neglect no opportunity to deride and undermine Speke&#x27;s geographical theories and achievements&quot;.

Speke had earlier proven his mettle by trekking through the mountains of Tibet, but Burton regarded him as inferior as he did not speak any Arabic or African languages. Despite his fascination with non-European cultures, some have portrayed Burton as an unabashed imperialist convinced of the historical and intellectual superiority of the white race, citing his involvement in the Anthropological Society of London, an organisation which supported scientific racism. Speke appears to have been kinder and less intrusive to the Africans they encountered and reportedly fell in love with an African woman on a later expedition.

The two men travelled home separately. Speke returned to London first and presented a lecture at the Royal Geographical Society, claiming Lake Victoria as the source of the Nile. According to Burton, Speke broke an agreement they had made to give their first public speech together. Apart from Burton&#x27;s word, there is no proof that such an agreement existed, and most modern researchers doubt that it did. Tim Jeal, evaluating the written evidence, says the odds are &quot;heavily against Speke having made a pledge to his former leader&quot;. Speke undertook a second expedition, along with Captain James Grant and Sidi Mubarak Bombay, to prove that Lake Victoria was the true source of the Nile. Speke, in light of the issues he was having with Burton, had Grant sign a statement saying, among other things, &quot;I renounce all my rights to publishing ... my own account [of the expedition] until approved of by Captain Speke or [the Royal Geographical Society]&quot;.

On 16 September 1864, Burton and Speke were scheduled to debate the source of the Nile at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. On the day before the debate, Burton and Speke sat near each other in the lecture hall. According to Burton&#x27;s wife, Speke stood up, said &quot;I can&#x27;t stand this any longer,&quot; and abruptly left the hall. That afternoon Speke went hunting on the nearby estate of a relative. He was discovered lying near a stone wall, felled by a fatal gunshot wound from his hunting shotgun. Burton learned of Speke&#x27;s death the following day while waiting for their debate to begin. A jury ruled Speke&#x27;s death an accident. An obituary surmised that Speke, while climbing over the wall, had carelessly pulled the gun after himself with the muzzle pointing at his chest and shot himself. Alexander Maitland, Speke&#x27;s only biographer, concurs.

===Diplomatic service and scholarship (1861–1890)===
On 22 January 1861, Burton and Isabel Arundel married in a quiet Catholic ceremony, although he did not adopt the Catholic faith at this time. Shortly after this, the couple were forced to spend some time apart when he formally entered the Diplomatic Service as consul on the island of Fernando Po, now Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. This was not a prestigious appointment; because the climate was considered extremely unhealthy for Europeans, Isabel could not accompany him. Burton spent much of this time exploring the coast of West Africa, documenting his findings in &quot;Abeokuta and The Cameroons Mountains: An Exploration&quot; (1863), and &quot;A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome&quot; (1864). He described some of his experiences, including a trip up the Congo River to the Yellala Falls and beyond, in his 1876 book &quot;Two trips to gorilla land and the cataracts of the Congo&quot;.

The couple were reunited in 1865 when Burton was transferred to Santos in Brazil. Once there, Burton travelled through Brazil&#x27;s central highlands, canoeing down the São Francisco River from its source to the falls of Paulo Afonso. He documented his experiences in &quot;The Highlands of Brazil&quot; (1869). In 1868 and 1869, he made two visits to the war zone of the Paraguayan War, which he described in his &quot;Letters from the Battlefields of Paraguay&quot; (1870). In 1868, he was appointed as the British consul in Damascus, an ideal post for someone with Burton&#x27;s knowledge of the region and customs. According to Ed Rice, &quot;England wanted to know what was going on in the Levant,&quot; another chapter in The Great Game. Yet, the Turkish governor Mohammed Rashid &#x27;Ali Pasha feared anti-Turkish activities, and was opposed to Burton&#x27;s assignment.

In Damascus, Burton made friends with Abdelkader al-Jazairi, while Isabel befriended Jane Digby, calling her &quot;my most intimate friend.&quot; Burton also met Charles F. Tyrwhitt-Drake and Edward Henry Palmer, collaborating with Drake in writing &quot;Unexplored Syria&quot; (1872). However, the area was in some turmoil at the time, with considerable tensions between the Christian, Jewish and Muslim populations. Burton did his best to keep the peace and resolve the situation, but this sometimes led him into trouble. On one occasion, he claims to have escaped an attack by hundreds of armed horsemen and camel riders sent by Mohammed Rashid Pasha, the Governor of Syria. He wrote, &quot;I have never been so flattered in my life than to think it would take three hundred men to kill me.&quot; Burton eventually suffered the enmity of the Greek Christian and Jewish communities. Then, his involvement with the Sházlis, a Sufi Muslim order among whom was a group that Burton called &quot;Secret Christians longing for baptism&quot;, which Isabel called &quot;his ruin.&quot; He was recalled in August 1871, prompting him to send a telegram to Isabel: &quot;I am recalled. Pay, pack, and follow at convenience.&quot;

Burton was reassigned in 1872 to the port city of Trieste in Austria-Hungary. A &quot;broken man&quot;, Burton was never particularly content with this post, but it required little work, was far less dangerous than Damascus (as well as less exciting), and allowed him the freedom to write and travel. In 1863, Burton co-founded the Anthropological Society of London with Dr. James Hunt. In Burton&#x27;s own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical &quot;Anthropologia&quot;) was &quot;to supply travellers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters&quot;. On 13 February 1886, Burton was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) by Queen Victoria.

He wrote a number of travel books in this period that were not particularly well received. His best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqué or even pornographic at the time, which were published under the auspices of the Kama Shastra society. These books include &quot;The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana&quot; (1883) (popularly known as the Kama Sutra), &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot; (1885) (popularly known as The Arabian Nights), &quot;The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi&quot; (1886) and &quot;The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot; (seventeen volumes 1886–98). Published in this period but composed on his return journey from Mecca, &quot;The Kasidah&quot; has been cited as evidence of Burton&#x27;s status as a Bektashi Sufi. Deliberately presented by Burton as a translation, the poem and his notes and commentary on it contain layers of Sufic meaning that seem to have been designed to project Sufi teaching in the West. &quot;Do what thy manhood bids thee do/ from none but self expect applause;/ He noblest lives and noblest dies/ who makes and keeps his self-made laws&quot; is &quot;The Kasidah&quot;&#x27;s most-quoted passage. As well as references to many themes from Classical Western myths, the poem contains many laments that are accented with fleeting imagery such as repeated comparisons to &quot;the tinkling of the Camel bell&quot; that becomes inaudible as the animal vanishes in the darkness of the desert.

Other works of note include a collection of Hindu tales, &quot;Vikram and the Vampire&quot; (1870); and his uncompleted history of swordsmanship, &quot;The Book of the Sword&quot; (1884). He also translated &quot;The Lusiads&quot;, the Portuguese national epic by Luís de Camões, in 1880 and, the next year, wrote a sympathetic biography of the poet and adventurer. The book &quot;The Jew, the Gipsy and el Islam&quot; was published posthumously in 1898 and was controversial for its criticism of Jews and for its assertion of the existence of Jewish human sacrifices. Burton&#x27;s investigations into this had provoked hostility from the Jews of Damascus. The manuscript of the book included an appendix discussing the topic in more detail, but by the decision of his widow, it was not included in the book when published.

===Death===

Burton died in Trieste early on the morning of 20 October 1890 of a heart attack. His wife Isabel persuaded a priest to perform the last rites, although Burton was not a Catholic, and this action later caused a rift between Isabel and some of Burton&#x27;s friends. It has been suggested that the death occurred very late on 19October and that Burton was already dead by the time the last rites were administered. On his religious views, Burton called himself an atheist, stating he was raised in the Church of England, which he said was &quot;officially [his] church&quot;.

Isabel never recovered from the loss. After his death, she burned many of her husband&#x27;s papers, including journals and a planned new translation of &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; to be called &quot;The Scented Garden&quot;, for which she had been offered six thousand guineas and which she regarded as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. She believed she was acting to protect her husband&#x27;s reputation, and that she had been instructed to burn the manuscript of &quot;The Scented Garden&quot; by his spirit, but her actions were controversial. However, a substantial quantity of his written materials have survived, and are held by the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, including 21 boxes of his manuscripts, 24 boxes of correspondence, and other material.

Isabel wrote a biography in praise of her husband.

The couple are buried in a tomb in the shape of a Bedouin tent, designed by Isabel, in the cemetery of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake in southwest London. The coffins of Sir Richard and Lady Burton can be seen through a window at the rear of the tent, which can be accessed via a short fixed ladder. Next to the lady chapel in the church, there is a memorial stained-glass window to Burton, also erected by Isabel; it depicts Burton as a medieval knight. Burton&#x27;s personal effects and a collection of paintings, photographs and objects relating to him are in the Burton Collection at Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham. Among these is a small quartz stone from Mesopotamia, inscribed in supposed Kufic script, which has thus far resisted decipherment by experts.

==Kama Shastra Society==
Burton had long had an interest in sexuality and some erotic literature. However, the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 had resulted in many jail sentences for publishers, with prosecutions being brought by the Society for the Suppression of Vice. Burton referred to the society and those who shared its views as &quot;Mrs Grundy&quot;. A way around this was the private circulation of books among the members of a society. For this reason Burton, together with Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot, created the Kama Shastra Society to print and circulate books that would be illegal to publish in public.

One of the most celebrated of all his books is his translation of &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot; (commonly called &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; in English after early translations of Antoine Galland&#x27;s French version) in ten volumes (1885), with seven further volumes being added later. The volumes were printed by the Kama Shastra Society in a subscribers-only edition of one thousand with a guarantee that there would never be a larger printing of the books in this form. The stories collected were often sexual in content and were considered pornography at the time of publication. In particular, the &quot;Terminal Essay&quot; in volume 10 of the &quot;Nights&quot; contained a 14,000-word essay entitled &quot;Pederasty&quot; (Volume 10, section IV, D), at the time a synonym for homosexuality (as it still is, in modern French). This was and remained for many years the longest and most explicit discussion of homosexuality in any language. Burton speculated that male homosexuality was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by him the &quot;Sotadic zone&quot;.

Perhaps Burton&#x27;s best-known book is his translation of &quot;The Kama Sutra&quot;. It is untrue that he was the translator since the original manuscript was in ancient Sanskrit, which he could not read. However, he collaborated with Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot on the work and provided translations from other manuscripts of later translations. The Kama Shastra Society first printed the book in 1883 and numerous editions of the Burton translation are in print to this day.

His English translation from a French edition of the Arabic erotic guide &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; was printed as &quot;The Perfumed Garden of the Cheikh Nefzaoui: A Manual of Arabian Erotology&quot; (1886). After Burton&#x27;s death, Isabel burnt many of his papers, including a manuscript of a subsequent translation, &quot;The Scented Garden&quot;, containing the final chapter of the work, on pederasty. Burton all along intended for this translation to be published after his death, to provide an income for his widow.

==Scandals==
Burton&#x27;s writings are unusually open and frank about his interest in sex and sexuality. His travel writing is often full of details about the sexual lives of the inhabitants of areas he travelled through. Burton&#x27;s interest in sexuality led him to make measurements of the lengths of the penises of male inhabitants of various regions, which he includes in his travel books. He also describes sexual techniques common in the regions he visited, often hinting that he had participated, hence breaking both sexual and racial taboos of his day. Many people at the time considered the Kama Shastra Society and the books it published scandalous.

Biographers disagree on whether or not Burton ever experienced homosexual sex (he never directly acknowledges it in his writing). Rumours began in his army days when Charles James Napier requested that Burton go undercover to investigate a male brothel reputed to be frequented by British soldiers. It has been suggested that Burton&#x27;s detailed report on the workings of the brothel led some to believe he had been a customer. There is no documentary evidence that such a report was written or submitted, nor that Napier ordered such research by Burton, and it has been argued that this is one of Burton&#x27;s embellishments.

A story that haunted Burton up to his death (recounted in some of his obituaries) was that, during his journey to Mecca disguised as a Muslim, he came close to being discovered one night when he lifted his robe to urinate rather than squatting as an Arab would. It was said that he was seen by an Arab and, to avoid exposure, killed him. Burton denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an impostor. Burton became so tired of denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers, although he was said to enjoy the notoriety and even once laughingly claimed to have done it. A doctor once asked him: &quot;How do you feel when you have killed a man?&quot;, Burton retorted: &quot;Quite jolly, what about you?&quot;. When asked by a priest about the same incident Burton is said to have replied: &quot;Sir, I&#x27;m proud to say I have committed every sin in the Decalogue.&quot; Stanley Lane-Poole, a Burton detractor, reported that Burton &quot;confessed rather shamefacedly that he had never killed anybody at any time.&quot;

These allegations coupled with Burton&#x27;s often irascible nature were said to have harmed his career and may explain why he was not promoted further, either in army life or in the diplomatic service. As an obituary described: &quot;...he was ill fitted to run in official harness, and he had a Byronic love of shocking people, of telling tales against himself that had no foundation in fact.&quot; Ouida reported: &quot;Men at the FO [Foreign Office] ... used to hint dark horrors about Burton, and certainly justly or unjustly he was disliked, feared and suspected ... not for what he had done, but for what he was believed capable of doing.&quot;

==Sotadic Zone==
Burton theorized about the existence of a Sotadic Zone in the closing essay of his English translation of &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; (1885–1886). He asserted that there exists a geographic-climatic zone in which sodomy and pederasty (sexual intimacy between older men and young pubescent/adolescent boys) are endemic, prevalent, and celebrated among the indigenous inhabitants and within their cultures. The name derives from Sotades, a 3rd-century BC Ancient Greek poet who was the chief representative of a group of Ancient Greek writers of obscene, and sometimes pederastic, satirical poetry; these homoerotic verses are preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, a collection of poems spanning the Classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature.

Burton first advanced his Sotadic Zone concept in the &quot;Terminal Essay&quot;, contained in Volume 10 of his English translation of &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;, which he called &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot;, published in England in 1886.

<text>The Battle of Stamford Bridge () took place at the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England, on 25 September 1066, between an English army under King Harold Godwinson and an invading Norwegian force led by King Harald Hardrada and the English king&#x27;s brother Tostig Godwinson. After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig, along with most of the Norwegians, were killed. Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his army was defeated by the Normans at Hastings less than three weeks later. The battle has traditionally been presented as symbolising the end of the Viking Age, although major Scandinavian campaigns in Britain and Ireland occurred in the following decades, such as those of King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069–1070 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102–1103.

==Background==
The death of King Edward the Confessor of England in January 1066 had triggered a succession struggle in which a variety of contenders from across north-western Europe fought for the English throne. These claimants included the King of Norway, Harald Hardrada. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; Manuscript D (p. 197), the Norwegians assembled a fleet of 300 ships to invade England. The authors, however, did not seem to differentiate between warships and supply ships. In &quot;King Harald&#x27;s Saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson states, &quot;it is said that King Harald had over two hundred ships, apart from supply ships and smaller craft&quot;. Combined with reinforcements picked up in Orkney, the Norwegian army most likely numbered between 7,000 and 9,000 men. Arriving off the English coast in September, Hardrada was joined by further forces recruited in Flanders and Scotland by Tostig Godwinson. Tostig was at odds with his elder brother Harold (who had been elected king by the Witenagemot on the death of Edward). Having been ousted from his position as Earl of Northumbria and exiled in 1065, Tostig had mounted a series of abortive attacks on England in the spring of 1066.

In the late summer of 1066, the invaders sailed up the Ouse before advancing on York. On 20 September they defeated a northern English army led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and his brother Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, at the Battle of Fulford, outside York. Following this victory they received the surrender of York. Having briefly occupied the city and taken hostages and supplies from the city they returned towards their ships at Riccall. They offered peace to the Northumbrians in exchange for their support for Hardrada&#x27;s bid for the throne, and demanded further hostages from the whole of Yorkshire.

At this time King Harold was in Southern England, anticipating an invasion from France by William, Duke of Normandy, another contender for the English throne. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he headed north at great speed with his housecarls and as many thegns as he could gather, travelling day and night. He made the journey from London to Yorkshire, a distance of about , in only four days, enabling him to take the Norwegians completely by surprise. Having learned that the Northumbrians had been ordered to send the additional hostages and supplies to the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge, Harold hurried on through York to attack them at this rendezvous on 25 September. Until the English army came into view, the invaders remained unaware of the presence of a hostile army anywhere in the vicinity.

==Location==

Manuscripts C, D and E of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; all mention Stamford Bridge by name. Manuscript C contains a passage which states, &quot;Then Harold, king of the English, came upon them beyond the bridge by surprise; and there they joined battle and were fighting very hard long in the day&quot;. Though often interpreted to mean the main battle took place east of the Derwent River after the English army had crossed the bridge, Charles Plummer explains that the phrase “beyond the bridge” must be viewed “from the point of view of the enemy. To the English coming from York, they [the Norwegians] would be on the hither [near] side of the bridge”. According to Henry of Huntington, after many &quot;fearful assaults on both sides,&quot; the English superiority in numbers forced the Norwegians &quot;to give way but not to flee. Driven back beyond the river, the living crossing over the dead, they resisted stoutheartedly&quot;. Like the &quot;Chronicle&quot; account, Henry&#x27;s description suggests the main battle may have been fought west of the bridge.

The exact location of the battle site is not known for certain. Sources indicate that it took place along the Derwent River, where a wooden bridge crossed the water. There are indications of a meadow on the west side of the river and higher ground on the eastern side. The original bridge no longer exists, and no archaeological traces of it remain. The traditional locating of part of the battle at Battle Flats is based on no contemporary references. Statements that in the 18th century skeletons and weapons were found there have not been corroborated by modern finds.

==Battle==

According to Snorri Sturluson’s Heimskringla, before the battle a single man rode up alone to Harald Hardrada and Tostig. He gave no name, but spoke to Tostig, offering the return of his earldom if he would turn against Hardrada. Tostig asked what his brother Harold would be willing to give Hardrada for his trouble. The rider replied &quot;Seven feet of English ground, as he is taller than other men&quot; (implying that both Hardrada and his army would be killed and buried on English soil). Then he rode back to the Saxon host. Hardrada was impressed by the rider&#x27;s boldness, and asked Tostig who he was. Tostig replied that the rider was Harold Godwinson himself. According to Henry of Huntingdon, Harold said &quot;Six feet of ground or as much more as he needs, as he is taller than most men.&quot;

The sudden appearance of the English army caught the Norwegians by surprise. The English advance was then delayed by the need to pass through the choke-point presented by the bridge itself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon has it that one of the Norwegians (possibly armed with a Dane Axe) blocked the narrow crossing and single-handedly held up the entire English army. The story is that this Viking alone cut down up to 40 Englishmen and was defeated only when an English soldier floated under the bridge and thrust his spear through the planks in the bridge, mortally wounding the warrior. His name was not preserved in the aftermath of this battle.

This delay had allowed the bulk of the Norse army to form a shieldwall to face the English attack. Harold&#x27;s army poured across the bridge, forming a line just short of the Norse army, locked shields and charged. The battle went far beyond the bridge itself, and although it raged for hours, the Norse army&#x27;s decision to leave their armour behind left them at a distinct disadvantage. Eventually, the Norse army began to fragment and fracture, allowing the English troops to force their way in and break up the Scandinavians&#x27; shield wall. Completely outflanked, and with Hardrada killed with an arrow to his windpipe and Tostig slain, the Norwegian army disintegrated and was virtually annihilated.

In the later stages of the battle, the Norwegians were reinforced by troops who had been guarding the ships at Riccall some 25 km away, led by Eystein Orre, Hardrada&#x27;s prospective son-in-law. Some of his men were said to have collapsed and died of exhaustion upon reaching the battlefield. The remainder were fully armed for battle. Their counter-attack, described in the Norwegian tradition as &quot;Orre&#x27;s Storm&quot;, briefly checked the English advance, but was soon overwhelmed and Orre was slain. The Norwegian army were routed. As given in the Chronicles, pursued by the English army, some of the fleeing Norsemen drowned whilst crossing rivers.

So many died in an area so small that the field was said to have been still whitened with bleached bones 50 years after the battle.

==Aftermath==
King Harold accepted a truce with the surviving Norwegians, including Harald&#x27;s son Olaf and Paul Thorfinnsson, Earl of Orkney. They were allowed to leave after giving pledges not to attack England again. The losses the Norwegians had suffered were so severe that only 24 ships from the fleet of over 300 were needed to carry the survivors away. They withdrew to Orkney, where they spent the winter, and in the spring Olaf returned to Norway. The kingdom was then divided and shared between him and his brother Magnus, whom Harald had left behind to govern in his absence. The casualties are referred as so high in both sides in many sources, an English-born Norman historian Orderic Vitalis reports half a century later that the battle ground was still &quot;easily recognizable by the piles of bones that still bear witness to the heavy losses on both sides&quot;.

Harold&#x27;s victory was short-lived. Three days after the battle, on 28 September, a Norman invasion army led by William the Conqueror landed in Pevensey, Sussex, on the south coast of England. Harold had to immediately turn his troops around and force-march them southwards to intercept the Norman army. On 14 October, Harold, leading an army of between 5,000 and 13,000 troops, confronted the Norman army at the Battle of Hastings. There, he was decisively defeated and killed in action, allowing for William to march on London and take control over all of England as part of the Norman Conquest.

==Monuments==
Two monuments to the battle have been erected in and around the village of Stamford Bridge.

===Village monument===
The first memorial is located in the village on Main Street (A116) to the east of Church Road. The monument&#x27;s inscription reads (in both English and Norwegian):

<doc id="66663" wikidata="Q854181" url="?curid=66663" title="Franc Rozman">
<text>Franc Rozman, nom de guerre Stane (Slovene convention: &quot;Franc Rozman – Stane&quot;) or Stane Mlinar (27 March 1911 – 7 November 1944), was a Slovene Partisan commander in World War II.

==Early life==

Franc Rozman was born in the Carniolan village of Spodnje Pirniče near Ljubljana, part of Austria-Hungary at the time, to a Slovene working-class family. His father Franc Rozman was a railway track-worker, while his mother Marjana (née Stare) was a housewife. He was the third of four children, with two elder sisters, Marjeta and Terezija, and a younger brother, Martin.

At the age of three, Rozman&#x27;s father died on the Eastern Front, where he fought as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Rozman had a poor and hard childhood. His sisters Marjeta and Terezija were sent to an orphanage, while Franc and his brother Martin remained in Pirniče. At the age of 15, he worked in a tavern and then trained as an apprentice baker.

As a young boy he had great enthusiasm for a military career, but his application to the military school was rejected. In spring 1932, he did his military service in the Royal Yugoslav army.

==Military experience prior to World War II==
In 1935, after the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, Rozman tried unsuccessfully to join the Ethiopian forces fighting the Italian invaders. Soon after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he decided to travel to Spain. Rozman was among the first Yugoslav volunteers in Spain, where he, on 1 October 1936 joined the International Brigades. In November 1936 he became a member of the Spanish Communist Party.

In Jarama he completed non commissioned officers&#x27; school, became a lieutenant and a commander of a company, then captain and commander of a battalion. His comrades in arms remembered him as an energetic and earnest person. After the Spanish Civil War, he was imprisoned in France. He became a member of the Yugoslav Communist Party in 1939. In April 1941 he was imprisoned and sentenced to forced labor in Germany. In July the same year he fled Germany and returned to Yugoslavia.

==World War II==
For a while, Rozman lived with an activist of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. In early December 1941, he visited his younger brother, Martin, after which he joined the Slovene partisan resistance. Soon he became a military instructor with the High Command of the Slovene partisan forces. He was given the task of setting up the Styrian Battalion (&quot;Štajerski bataljon&quot;), which would consist of the partisan troops, the Revirje and the Savinja companies (&quot;Revirske in Savinjske čete&quot;), which were active in Styria in the autumn of 1941. He participated in the attack on Šoštanj and later in the Battle of Čreta. The Germans repeatedly tried to liquidate Rozman, setting many ambushes.

In the April 1942 Rozman became the commander of a Slovene partisan brigade, established on 5 April 1942 at Kremenik in Lower Carniola, and numbering more than 300 fighters. Measured by composition, organization, training, and fighting power, this was the most powerful Slovene partisan unit at that time. On 13 July 1943, he became a commander of the High Command of the Slovene partisan army with the rank of lieutenant general (&quot;generallajtnant&quot;), which he held up to his death.

Rozman died on 7 November 1944, aged 33, in White Carniola as a consequence of a serious wound received while testing newly arrived PIAT weapons sent to the partisans by their British Allies. There were some rumors that he was killed by sabotage by the Chetnik military authorities or at the behest of Partisan commander Arso Jovanović, but they have never been proven. He was proclaimed a People&#x27;s Hero of Yugoslavia four days later, on 11 November 1944.

==Legacy==
&quot;Commander Stane&quot;, as he was nicknamed by the partisan fighters, was one of the most prominent figures of the Yugoslav front of the Second World War. His legacy is controversial and questions have been raised about his involvement in wartime liquidations of civilians.

His legacy includes the following:
* There is a plaque on the house in Spodnje Pirniče where he was born, which has also been turned into a small museum. A bust of Rozman also stands in front of the house.
* There is a monument in downtown Ljubljana, at the corner of Slovene Street () and Šubic Street (), dedicated to Rozman.
* The well-known partisan song &quot;Komandant Stane&quot; (&#x27;Commander Stane&#x27;) is dedicated to him.
* Many Slovene schools bear his name; for example, the Franc &quot;Stane&quot; Rozman primary schools in Ljubljana and Maribor.
* On 21 March 2011, Slovenia issued a two-euro commemorative coin to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Franc Rozman.
* The former Franc &quot;Stane&quot; Rozman Barracks (&quot;Vojašnica Franca Rozmana–Staneta&quot;) at Ljubljana-Polje were named for Rozman until July 2012, when they were renamed in honor of Edvard Peperko (1966–1991), one of the first to fall in the Slovenian Ten-Day War. The renaming was opposed by the Partisan veteran organization, opposition parties, and one of the coalition parties.

<text>Artur Schnabel (17 April 1882 – 15 August 1951) was an Austrian-born classical pianist, composer and pedagogue. Schnabel was known for his intellectual seriousness as a musician, avoiding pure technical bravura. Among the 20th century&#x27;s most respected and important pianists, his playing displayed marked vitality, profundity and spirituality in the Austro-German classics, particularly the works of Beethoven and Schubert.

Music critic Harold C. Schonberg described Schnabel as &quot;the man who invented Beethoven&quot;. Between 1932 and 1935, he produced the first recording of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas. In 2018, the Library of Congress selected this recording to be placed in the National Recording Registry for its historical significance.

==Life and work==

===Early years===
Born Aaron Schnabel in Lipnik (Kunzendorf) near Bielsko-Biała, Austro-Hungarian Empire (today a part of Poland), he was the youngest of three children born to Isidor Schnabel, a textile merchant, and his wife, Ernestine Taube (née Labin). He had two sisters, Clara and Frieda. His family was Jewish.

When the boy was two, Schnabel&#x27;s parents moved the family to Vienna in 1884 for the benefit of young Schnabel whom his mother recalls as showing a natural gift for music. Schnabel began learning the piano at the age of four, when he took a spontaneous interest in his eldest sister Clara&#x27;s piano lessons. At the age of six, he began piano lessons under Professor Hans Schmitt of the Vienna Conservatorium (today the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna). Three years later he began studying under Theodor Leschetizky. The teacher once said to him, &quot;You will never be a pianist; you are a musician.&quot; He allowed Schnabel to leave Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot; and concentrate instead on Schubert&#x27;s sonatas, which had been widely neglected up to that point.

===Leschetizky years===
Schnabel studied under Leschetizky&#x27;s tutelage for seven years, between 1891 and 1897. Co-students of Leschetizky during that period included Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Mark Hambourg, and Ignaz Friedman.

Initially, for his first year under Leschetizky, Schnabel was given rigorous preparatory technical tuition from Anna Yesipova (Leschetizky&#x27;s second wife and a famous pianist in her own right) and also from Malwine Bree, who was Leschetizky&#x27;s assistant. From age ten, he participated in all of Leschetizky&#x27;s classes.

Following a failed initial approach to Anton Bruckner, Schnabel studied music theory and composition under Eusebius Mandyczewski. Mandyczewski was an assistant to Johannes Brahms, and through him Schnabel was introduced to Brahms&#x27; circle. He often was in the great composer&#x27;s presence. The young Schnabel once heard Brahms play in a performance of his first piano quartet; for all the missed notes, said Schnabel, it &quot;was in the true grand manner.&quot;

Schnabel made his official concert debut in 1897, at the Bösendorfer-Saal in Vienna. Later that same year, he gave a series of concerts in Budapest, Prague and Brno.

===Berlin years===

Schnabel moved to Berlin in 1898, making his debut there with a concert at the Bechstein-Saal. Following World War I, Schnabel also toured widely, visiting the United States, Russia and England.

He gained initial fame thanks to orchestral concerts he gave under the conductor Arthur Nikisch as well as playing in chamber music and accompanying his future wife, the contralto Therese Behr, in Lieder.

In chamber music, he founded the Schnabel Trio with the violinist Alfred Wittenberg and the cellist Anton Hekking; they played together between 1902 and 1904. In 1905, he formed a second Schnabel Trio with Carl Flesch (with whom he also played violin sonatas) and the cellist Jean Gérardy. In 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, Gérardy (a Belgian) left the trio as he could no longer remain in Germany. He was replaced by Hugo Becker and this became the third Schnabel Trio.

Later, Schnabel also played in a quartet with violinist Bronisław Huberman, composer/violist Paul Hindemith and the cellist Gregor Piatigorsky (with whom he also played and recorded cello sonatas). Schnabel also played with a number of other famous musicians including the violinist Joseph Szigeti and the cellists Pablo Casals and Pierre Fournier.

He was friends of, and played with, the most distinguished conductors of the day, including Wilhelm Furtwängler, Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, George Szell, Willem Mengelberg, and Adrian Boult.

From 1925 Schnabel taught at the Berlin State Academy, where his masterclasses brought him great renown. For his piano students, 

===Later years===
Schnabel, who was Jewish, left Berlin in 1933 after the Nazi Party took control. He lived in England for a time while giving masterclasses at Tremezzo on Lake Como in Italy, before moving to the United States in 1939. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. There he took a teaching post at the University of Michigan. Among his pupils in Michigan was composer Sam Raphling. At the end of World War II he returned to Europe, settling in Switzerland.

His mother Ernestine Taube remained in Vienna after the Anschluss, and at the age of 83, in August 1942, was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she died two months later. Artur Schnabel never returned to Germany or Austria after the war. He continued to give concerts on both sides of the Atlantic until the end of his life, as well as composing and continuing to make records, although he was never very fond of the whole studio process. He died in Axenstein, Switzerland, and was buried in Schwyz, Switzerland. Schnabel was awarded the Order of Prince Danilo I.

===Family===

In 1899, when Schnabel was 17, his daughter Elizabeth Rostra was born in the Czech city of Brno. The offspring from a youthful love affair, Elizabeth became a pianist and piano pedagogue, was married to a psychoanalyst and died in Switzerland in 1995. 

In 1905, Artur Schnabel married the contralto and Lieder singer Therese Behr (1876–1959). They had two sons, Karl Ulrich Schnabel (1909–2001) who also became a classical pianist and renowned piano teacher, and Stefan Schnabel (1912–1999), who became a well regarded actor. The Schnabel family kept a lifelong, close relationship with Artur Schnabel&#x27;s daughter from his teenage relationship, Elizabeth Rostra.

His wife, son Karl Ulrich and his wife Helen, née Fogel (1911–1974), a pianist from the US, and their grandson Claude Alain Mottier (1972–2002), who was a pianist as well and died as the innocent victim of a traffic accident, were buried in Artur&#x27;s grave as well. In 2006, the municipality of the town of Schwyz declared the tomb a monument. This exempts the grave site from the regulations that stipulate the removal of the remains after a certain period.

==Repertoire==

Schnabel was best known for his devotion to the core German composers, especially the Viennese classics of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. He was also renowned for his playing of works by Brahms and Schumann, and he played and recorded works by Bach.

However, his repertoire was wider than that. During his young virtuosic years in Berlin, he played works by other composers including Liszt, Chopin and Weber. On his early American tours, he programmed works such as the Chopin Preludes and Schumann&#x27;s Fantasie in C. Among other works that he played, as recalled by those such as Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz, who had heard Schnabel in the 1920s, were Chopin&#x27;s E minor Piano Concerto and the Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, and Weber&#x27;s &quot;Konzertstück in F minor&quot;, Piano Sonata No. 2, and &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;. Schnabel himself mentioned that he had played the Liszt Sonata in B minor &quot;very often&quot;, as well as the Liszt E-flat Piano Concerto.

It is not clear why Schnabel dropped those from his performing repertoire in the 1930s, after his final departure from Germany. He claimed that it was because he decided that he wanted to play only &quot;music which is better than it could be performed&quot;. However, it has been suggested by some that &quot;Schnabel, uprooted from his native heritage, may have been clinging to the great German composers in an attempt to keep his cultural origins alive&quot;.

Schnabel was known for championing the then-neglected sonatas of Schubert and, even more so, Beethoven, including his more challenging late works. While on a tour of Spain, Schnabel wrote to his wife saying that during a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot; he had begun to feel sorry for the audience. &quot;I am the only person here who is enjoying this, and I get the money; they pay and have to suffer,&quot; he wrote. Schnabel did much to popularize Beethoven&#x27;s piano music, making the first complete recording of the sonatas, completing the set for the British label HMV in 1935. In March 2018, it was one of 25 recordings that the Library of Congress selected to be placed in the National Recording Registry, for its cultural and historical significance. This set of recordings has never been out of print and is considered by many to be the touchstone of Beethoven sonata interpretations, though shortcomings in finger technique mar many performances of fast movements (Sergei Rachmaninoff is supposed to have referred to him as &quot;the great adagio pianist&quot;). It has been said that he suffered greatly from nerves when recording; in a more private setting, his technique was impeccable. Claudio Arrau has said that Schnabel&#x27;s live performances during the 1920s were technically &quot;flawless.&quot; He also recorded all the Beethoven piano concertos.

==Performance style==
Schnabel was a pragmatic performer. As an example, Schnabel never played encores, believing they would cheapen the performance. He is quoted saying, &quot;I have always considered applause to be a receipt, not a bill.&quot; American composer Milton Babbitt said of Schnabel, &quot;He was the thinking man&#x27;s pianist, and in spite of that was very popular.&quot;

==Compositional style==
Despite his performing repertoire being concentrated largely on the works of Beethoven, Schubert, Mozart and Brahms, almost all of his own compositions (none of which are in the active repertoire) are atonal. (It is interesting, in this regard, to note that Schnabel was a close friend of Arnold Schoenberg, his Austrian-American compatriot, who was famous as a pioneering composer of atonal and twelve-tone music.)

They are &quot;difficult&quot; yet fascinating and complex works, and are marked by genuine originality of style. Composers Ernst Krenek and Roger Sessions have commented that they show signs of undoubted genius (see biography of Schnabel by Cesar Saerchinger). Schnabel&#x27;s list of compositions eventually included three symphonies, a piano concerto, a rhapsody for orchestra, a piano sonata (premiered by Eduard Erdmann at the 1925 Venice ISCM Festival) and five string quartets, amongst various smaller works.

In recent years, a number of his compositions (notably championed by the violinist Paul Zukofsky) have been recorded and made available on CD, including three of his string quartets, the three symphonies, a rhapsody for orchestra, and four solo piano works: his Sonata, Dance Suite, Piece in Seven Movements (1935–37) and Seven Pieces (1947). Pianist Jenny Lin released a recording of Schnabel&#x27;s complete keyboard music for the Steinway and Sons label in 2019.

Artur Schnabel compositions are published by Peermusic Classical and distributed by Hal Leonard Artur Schnabel scores.

==2016 revival and 2018 documentary film==
On September 11, 2016, a major international revival of Schnabel&#x27;s compositions began with a concert at the Großer Sendesaal des rbb im Haus des Rundfunks, presented as part of the Musikfest Berlin. The program featured pianist Markus Pawlik (who also curated), the Szymanowski String Quartet, baritone Dietrich Henschel, and film projections by Matthew Mishory. German actor Udo Samel read a selection of Artur Schnabel&#x27;s letters to Mary Virginia Foreman. The program was repeated Wednesday, 14 September 2016, at the RadioKulturhaus in Vienna and again on Thursday, 30 August 2018, at the Salle des congrès in Megève, France, with further performances planned. The 2016 Berlin concert was broadcast in its entirety on Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg radio and filmed for the Arte documentary &quot;Artur Schnabel: No Place of Exile,&quot; directed by Matthew Mishory. The film premiered on Arte on 4 February 2018. The film was shot in Switzerland, Italy, Vienna, and Berlin, utilizing unexpected textures (super8, drone footage, back-projection) and the actor Udo Samel to chart Schnabel&#x27;s course through the emotional and physical landscapes of the European 20th century. It also features the performances from the 2016 Haus des Rundfunks concert.

In May 2019, Steinway &amp; Sons label released the first complete piano works with pianist Jenny Lin. In November 2019, an LA premiere of the film was held at the Villa Aurora in Pacific Palisades. The Villa had served as an important venue for German-Jewish intellectuals and artists during and after WWII.

<doc id="66666" wikidata="Q296256" url="?curid=66666" title="Philip José Farmer">
<text>Philip José Farmer (January 26, 1918 – February 25, 2009) was an American author known for his science fiction and fantasy novels and short stories.

Farmer is best known for two sequences of novels, the &quot;World of Tiers&quot; (1965–93) and &quot;Riverworld&quot; (1971–83) series. He is noted for the pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in his work, his fascination for, and reworking of, the lore of celebrated pulp heroes, and occasional tongue-in-cheek pseudonymous works written as if by fictional characters. Farmer often mixed real and classic fictional characters and worlds and real and fake authors as epitomized by his Wold Newton family books, which tie classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy. Such works as &quot;The Other Log of Phileas Fogg&quot; (1973) and &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot; (1973) are early examples of literary mashup novels.

Literary critic Leslie Fiedler compared Farmer to Ray Bradbury, describing both as &quot;provincial American eccentrics&quot; who &quot;strain at the classic limits of the [science fiction] form,&quot; but found Farmer distinctive for his capacity &quot;to be at once naive and sophisticated in his odd blending of theology, pornography, and adventure.&quot;

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Farmer was born in North Terre Haute, Indiana. His parents gave him the middle name &quot;Josie&quot;, from his paternal grandmother Josephine, but Farmer later changed it himself to “José” as he resented having a traditionally female middle name and wanted to lend color to what he felt was an otherwise rather drab name. Farmer grew up in Peoria, Illinois, where he attended Peoria High School. His father was a civil engineer and a supervisor for the local power company. A voracious reader as a boy, Farmer said he resolved to become a writer in the fourth grade. He underwent basic religious training in the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science) as a child, which he later characterized as a &quot;peculiar background&quot; for a science fiction writer. He became an agnostic at the age of 14, and ultimately an atheist, though not, he said, indifferent to religion. At age 23, in 1941, he married Bette V. Andre and eventually fathered a son and a daughter. After washing out of flight training in World War II, he went to work in a local steel mill. He later continued his education, however, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Bradley University in 1950 at the age of 32.

===Early career===
Farmer had his first literary success when his novella &quot;The Lovers&quot; was published by Samuel Mines in &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, August 1952. It features a sexual relationship between a human and an extraterrestrial. He won a Hugo Award for Best New SF Author or Artist in 1953, the first of three Hugo awards he won in his career. Thus encouraged, he quit his job to become a full-time writer, entered a publisher&#x27;s contest, and promptly won first prize for a novel, &quot;Owe for the Flesh&quot;, that contained the germ of his later &quot;Riverworld&quot; series. But the book was not published and Farmer did not get the $4,000 prize money that was supposed to go to the winner. Literary success did not translate into financial security, so he left Peoria in 1956 to launch a career as a technical writer. He spent the next 14 years working in that capacity for various defense contractors, from Syracuse, New York to Los Angeles, while writing science fiction in his spare time.

Farmer won a second Hugo award in 1968, in the category Best Novella, for &quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot;, a pastiche of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as well as a satire on a futuristic, cradle-to-grave welfare state. Reinvigorated, Farmer became a full-time writer again in 1969. Upon moving back to Peoria in 1970, he entered his most prolific period, publishing 25 books in 10 years. His novel &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; (a reworking of the unpublished prize-winning first novel of 20 years before) won him a third Hugo in 1972, for Best Novel.

A 1975 novel, &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot;, created a stir in the larger literary community and media. It purported to be written in the first person by one &quot;Kilgore Trout,&quot; a fictional character appearing as an underappreciated science fiction writer in several of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novels. The escapade did not please Vonnegut when some reviewers not only concluded that it had been written by Vonnegut himself, but that it was a worthy addition to his works. Farmer did have permission from Vonnegut to write the book, although Vonnegut later said he regretted giving permission.

===Later years===
Farmer had both critical champions and detractors. Leslie Fiedler proclaimed him &quot;the greatest science fiction writer ever&quot; and lauded his approach to storytelling as a &quot;gargantuan lust to swallow down the whole cosmos, past, present and to come, and to spew it out again.&quot; Isaac Asimov praised Farmer as an &quot;excellent science fiction writer; in fact, a far more skillful writer than I am...&quot; But Christopher Lehmann-Haupt dismissed him in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1972 as &quot;a humdrum toiler in the fields of science fiction.&quot;

In 2001 Farmer won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the Science Fiction Writers of America made him its 19th SFWA Grand Master in the same year.

Farmer&#x27;s output slowed, but he continued to be active, publishing one novel and co-authoring three others (as well as producing about 20 short stories) in his last decade. He died on February 25, 2009. He was survived by his wife Bette, two children, five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

The &quot;Riverworld&quot; series follows the adventures of such diverse characters as Richard Francis Burton, Hermann Göring, and Samuel Clemens through a bizarre afterlife in which every human ever to have lived is simultaneously resurrected along a single river valley that stretches over an entire planet. The series consists of &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; (1971), &quot;The Fabulous Riverboat&quot; (1971), &quot;The Dark Design&quot; (1977), &quot;The Magic Labyrinth&quot; (1980) and &quot;Gods of Riverworld&quot; (1983). Although &quot;Riverworld and Other Stories&quot; (1979) is not part of the series as such, it does include the second-published Riverworld story, which is free-standing rather than integrated into one of the novels.

The first two Riverworld books were originally published as novellas, &quot;The Day of the Great Shout&quot; and &quot;The Suicide Express,&quot; and as a two-part serial, &quot;The Felled Star,&quot; in the science fiction magazines &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;If&quot; between 1965 and 1967. The separate novelette &quot;Riverworld&quot; ran in &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot; in January 1966. A final pair of linked novelettes appeared in the 1990s: &quot;Crossing the Dark River&quot; (in &quot;Tales of Riverworld&quot;, 1992) and &quot;Up the Bright River&quot; (in &quot;Quest to Riverworld&quot;, 1993). Farmer introduced himself into the series as Peter Jairus Frigate (PJF).

The Riverworld series originated in a novel, &quot;Owe for the Flesh&quot;, written in one month in 1952 as a contest entry. It won the contest, but the book was left unpublished and orphaned when the prize money was misappropriated, and Farmer nearly gave up writing altogether. The original manuscript of the novel was lost, but years later Farmer reworked the material into the Riverworld magazine stories mentioned above. Eventually, a copy of a revised version of the original novel surfaced in a box in a garage and was published as &quot;River of Eternity&quot; by Phantasia Press in 1983. Farmer&#x27;s introduction to this edition gives the details of how it all happened.

===&quot;World of Tiers&quot; series===
The series is set within a number of artificially constructed parallel universes (of which Earth is one), created tens of thousands of years ago by a race of human beings not from Earth who had achieved an advanced level of technology which gave them almost godlike power and immortality. The principal universe in which these stories take place, and from which the series derives its name, consists of an enormous tiered planet, shaped like a stack of disks or squat cylinders, of diminishing radius, one atop the other. The series follows the adventures of several of these godlike humans and several &quot;ordinary&quot; humans from Earth who accidentally travel to these artificial universes. (One of those &quot;ordinary&quot; humans was Paul Janus Finnegan [PJF], who becomes the main character in the series.) The series consists of &quot;The Maker of Universes&quot; (1965), &quot;The Gates of Creation&quot; (1966), &quot;A Private Cosmos&quot; (1968), &quot;Behind the Walls of Terra&quot; (1970), &quot;The Lavalite World&quot; (1977) and &quot;More Than Fire&quot; (1993). Roger Zelazny has mentioned that &quot;The World of Tiers&quot; was something he had in his mind when he created his Amber series. A related novel is &quot;Red Orc&#x27;s Rage&quot; (1991), which does not involve the principal characters of the other books directly, but does provide background information to certain events and characters portrayed in the other novels. This is the most &quot;psychological&quot; of Farmer&#x27;s novels.

==Literary themes==

===Sexuality===
Farmer&#x27;s work often handles sexual themes; some early works were notable for their ground-breaking introduction of such material to popular science fiction literature. His first published science fiction story (with one minor exception), the novella &quot;The Lovers&quot;, earned him the Hugo Award for Best New SF Author or Artist in 1953, and is critically recognized as the story that broke the taboo on sex in science fiction. (Farmer&#x27;s talk at the award ceremony was entitled “Science Fiction and the Kinsey Report”.) It instantly put Farmer on the literary map.

The short story collection &quot;Strange Relations&quot; (1960) was a notable event in the genre. He was one of three persons to whom Robert A. Heinlein dedicated &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961), a novel which explored sexual freedom as one of its primary themes. Moreover, &quot;Fire and the Night&quot; (1962) is a mainstream novel about an interracial romance; it features sociological and psychosexual twists. In &quot;Night of Light&quot; (1966), he devised an alien race where aliens have only one mother but several fathers, perhaps because of an unusual or untenable physical position that cannot be reached or continued by two individuals acting alone. Both &quot;Image of the Beast&quot; and the sequel &quot;Blown&quot; from 1968 to 1969 explore group sex, interplanetary travel, and interplay between fictional figures like Herald Childe and real people like Forry Ackerman. In the &quot;World of Tiers&quot; series he explores Oedipal themes. In 1982, Farmer acknowledged that most of literary critic Leslie Fiedler&#x27;s &quot;Freudian&quot; analysis of his work is valid, but insisted that &quot;there is also much that is Jungian and Reichian in my works&quot;.

===Religion===
Farmer&#x27;s fiction frequently included religious themes; he once went so far as to muse that &quot;religion is the earliest form of science fiction&quot;. Raised in the Christian Science church, he lost his religious faith in early youth. Nevertheless, he eventually found that he was not truly indifferent to religion, but was &quot;powerfully attracted by the Roman Catholic faith&quot;. Immortality, the afterlife and soteriology were particular theological concerns for him. &quot;The brain, knowing that a person can&#x27;t live forever in this world, rationalizes a future, or other-dimensional, world in which immortality is possible... For me, only those stories concerned with this one vital issue are serious stories. All others, no matter how moving or profound, are mere entertainments. They do not deal with that which is our gravest concern. Without a belief in eternal life for us, the terrestrial existence is something to be gotten through with as little pain and as much pleasure as possible. If this conclusion is the triumph of irrationality over logic, so be it.&quot;

In his groundbreaking novella &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1952) he invented a fictional religion based on J. W. Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Serialism&quot;. The novel &quot;Night of Light&quot; (1957, expanded 1966) takes the rather unholy Father John Carmody on an odyssey on an alien world where spiritual forces are made manifest in the material world. In &quot;Flesh&quot; (1960) astronauts return to an Earth 800 years in their future dominated by a pagan goddess-worshiping religion. Jesus of Nazareth shows up as a character in both the &quot;Riverworld&quot; series (in the 1966 novelette &quot;Riverworld&quot; — but not in the novels, except for the brief mention of his death early in &quot;The Magic Labyrinth&quot;) and in the 1979 novel &quot;Jesus on Mars&quot;. Other examples of religious themes include the short stories &quot;J.C. on the Dude Ranch&quot;, &quot;The God Business&quot;, &quot;The Making of Revelation, Part I&quot;, and the novels &quot;Inside, Outside&quot; (1964) — which may or may not be set in Hell — and &quot;Traitor to the Living&quot; (1973), among many others.

===Pulp heroes===
Many of Farmer&#x27;s works rework existing characters from fiction and history,
as in &quot;The Wind Whales of Ishmael&quot; (1971), a far-future sequel to Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;; &quot;The Other Log of Phileas Fogg&quot; (1973), which fills in the missing time periods from Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;; and &quot;A Barnstormer in Oz&quot; (1982), in which Dorothy&#x27;s adult son, a pilot, flies to the Land of Oz by accident.

He has often written about the pulp heroes Tarzan and Doc Savage, or pastiches thereof: In his novel &quot;The Adventure of the Peerless Peer&quot;, Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes team up. Farmer&#x27;s Lord Grandrith and Doc Caliban series portray analogues of Tarzan and Doc Savage. It consists of &quot;A Feast Unknown&quot; (1969), &quot;Lord of the Trees&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Mad Goblin&quot; (1970). Farmer has also written two mock biographies of both characters, &quot;Tarzan Alive&quot; (1972) and &quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot; (1973), which adopt the premise that the two were based on real people fictionalized by their original chroniclers, and connect them genealogically with a large number of other well-known fictional characters in a schema now known as the &quot;Wold Newton family.&quot; Further, Farmer wrote both an authorized Doc Savage novel, &quot;Escape from Loki&quot; (1991) and an authorized Tarzan novel, &quot;The Dark Heart of Time&quot; (1999). In his 1972 novel &quot;Time&#x27;s Last Gift,&quot; Farmer also explored the Tarzan theme combined with time travel, using the transparently reverse-syllabled name of &quot;Sahhindar&quot; for his hero (and the book&#x27;s initials, TLG, as code for &quot;Tarzan, Lord Greystoke&quot;). A short story on this theme is &quot;The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod&quot; (1968): &quot;if William S. rather than Edgar Rice [Burroughs] had written Tarzan,&quot; Farmer also wrote &quot;Lord Tyger&quot; (1970) about a ruthless millionaire who tries to create a real Tarzan by having a child kidnapped and then brought up subject to the same tragic events which shaped Tarzan in the original books.

In his incomplete historical Khokarsa cycle — &quot;Hadon of Ancient Opar&quot; (1974) and &quot;Flight to Opar&quot; (1976) — Farmer portrayed the &quot;lost city&quot; of Opar, which plays an important part in the Tarzan saga, in the time of its glory as a colony city of the empire of Khokarsa. One of the books mentions a mysterious grey-eyed traveller, clearly &quot;Sahhindar&quot;/Tarzan.

===Pseudonyms=== 
Farmer wrote &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot; (1975) under the name Kilgore Trout, a fictional author who appears in the works of Kurt Vonnegut. He had planned to write more of Trout&#x27;s fictional books (notably &quot;Son of Jimmy Valentine&quot;), but Vonnegut put an end to those plans. Farmer&#x27;s use of the pseudonym had caused confusion among many readers, who for some time assumed that Vonnegut was behind it; when the truth of &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot;&#x27;s authorship came out, Vonnegut was reported as being &quot;not amused.&quot; In an issue of the semi-prozine The Alien Critic/Science Fiction Review, published by Richard E. Geis, Farmer claimed to have received an angry, obscenity-laden telephone call from Vonnegut about it. Thereafter Farmer wrote a number of pseudonymous &quot;fictional author&quot; stories, mostly for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. These were stories whose &quot;authors&quot; are characters in other stories. The first such story was &quot;by&quot; Jonathan Swift Somers III (invented by Farmer himself in &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot; but inspired by one of the dead voices of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;). Later Farmer used the &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot; byline, a pseudonym invented by Harlan Ellison for film and television projects from which he wished to disassociate himself, and perhaps related to the name Cordwainer Smith, a pseudonym used by Paul Linebarger.

<doc id="66668" wikidata="Q44511" url="?curid=66668" title="Bullhead shark">
<text>The bullhead sharks are members of the genus Heterodontus, the only members of the family Heterodontidae and only living members of the order Heterodontiformes. All are relatively small, with the largest species reaching just in maximum length. They are bottom feeders in tropical and subtropical waters.

The Heterodontiforms appear in the fossil record in the Early Jurassic. The oldest fossils of the modern genus date to the Late Jurassic. Despite the very ancient origins of this genus and its abundance in the fossil record, phylogenetic evidence indicates that all extant species in the genus arose from a single common ancestor that survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, with diversification into modern species only starting around the mid-Eocene.

==Description==
Bullhead sharks have tapered bodies, with most species reaching around in length. Their bodies vary in colour, including shades of grey, brown, and red and pale colours, and are covered in a variety of patterns, including spots and stripes. They have blunt, proportionally large heads with relatively small mouths and large nostrils, with pronounced ridges above their eyes. They have two dorsal fins, both substantial in size, the first larger than the second, each of which has a rigid fin spine at the front, along with an anal fin. The tail fin is also large, with upper and lower lobes separated by a notch. Bullhead sharks have differentiated teeth, with cusped grasping teeth at the front of the mouth, and flattened teeth at the back of the mouth. Their egg cases have a spiral colarettes running along their length.

== Ecology ==
Bullhead sharks live in coastal littoral environments, generally shallower than , and are usually primarily active at night. Bullhead sharks ingest prey via suction feeding. They feed on invertebrate prey, including both hard prey such as crustaceans and sea urchins, and soft bodied prey such as octopuses, as well as predating on fish. They use their flattened teeth at the back of the mouth to crush hard-shelled prey and fish. Juveniles generally take softer prey than adults. The sharp fin spines provide a deterrent to being consumed by predators.

Bullhead shark egg cases are shaped like an auger, with two spiral flanges. This allows the egg cases to become wedged in the crevices of rocky sea floors, where the eggs are protected from predators; however, some bullhead sharks deposit their eggs on sponges or seaweed. Hatchlings are considered large for sharks, reaching over 14 cm in length by the time they leave the egg case. Bullhead shark eggs typically hatch after 7 to 12 months, depending on the species. The female Japanese bullhead shark has been known to deposit their eggs in one location along with other females, called a &quot;nest&quot;. The egg case of the Mexican hornshark features a tendril and more rigid flanges, suggesting that egg case design of this species primarily involves anchoring with tendrils rather than wedging into crevices.

==Species==
Ten living species of bullhead shark have been described:
* &quot;Heterodontus francisci&quot; (horn shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus galeatus&quot; (crested bullhead shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus japonicus&quot; (Japanese bullhead shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus marshallae&quot; (painted hornshark)
* &quot;Heterodontus mexicanus&quot; (Mexican hornshark)
* &quot;Heterodontus omanensis&quot; (Oman bullhead shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus portusjacksoni&quot; (Port Jackson shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus quoyi&quot; (Galapagos bullhead shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus ramalheira&quot; (whitespotted bullhead shark)
* &quot;Heterodontus zebra&quot; (zebra bullhead shark)

<text>Eusko Gudariak (originally spelt Euzko Gudariak, &quot;Basque Soldiers&quot;) was the republican anthem of the Eusko Gudarostea, the army of the Basque Autonomous Government during the Spanish Civil War. The song used to refer to the defense of the Basque country within the Republic of Spain against the nationalist Spain army.

It is also used as an anthem by ETA and the organizations orbiting the Basque National Liberation Movement.

The music is a traditional Basque tune from Araba, named . The lyrics were composed in 1932 by José María de Gárate, an officer of the EAJ-PNV. During the war, Captain Alejandro Lizaso Eizmendi added some verses.

<doc id="66675" wikidata="Q675076" url="?curid=66675" title="Light curve">
<text>In astronomy, a light curve is a graph of the light intensity of a celestial object or region as a function of time, typically with the magnitude of light received on the &quot;y&quot;-axis and with time on the &quot;x&quot;-axis. The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or band.

Light curves can be periodic, as in the case of eclipsing binaries, Cepheid variables, other periodic variables, and transiting extrasolar planets; or aperiodic, like the light curve of a nova, cataclysmic variable star, supernova, microlensing event, or binary as observed during occultation events. The study of the light curve, together with other observations, can yield considerable information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it.

== Variable stars ==

Graphs of the apparent magnitude of a variable star over time are commonly used to visualise and analyse their behaviour. Although the categorisation of variable star types is increasingly done from their spectral properties, the amplitudes, periods, and regularity of their brightness changes are still important factors. Some types such as Cepheids have extremely regular light curves with exactly the same period, amplitude, and shape in each cycle. Others such as Mira variables have somewhat less regular light curves with large amplitudes of several magnitudes, while the semiregular variables are less regular still and have smaller amplitudes.

The shapes of variable star light curves give valuable information about the underlying physical processes producing the brightness changes. For eclipsing variables, the shape of the light curve indicates the degree of totality, the relative sizes of the stars, and their relative surface brightnesses. It may also show the eccentricity of the orbit and distortions in the shape of the two stars. For pulsating stars, the amplitude or period of the pulsations can be related to the luminosity of the star, and the light curve shape can be an indicator of the pulsation mode.

=== Supernovae ===

Light curves from supernovae can be indicative of the type of supernova. Although supernova types are defined on the basis of their spectra, each has typical light curve shapes. Type I supernovae have light curves with a sharp maximum and gradually decline, while Type II supernovae have less sharp maxima. Light curves are helpful for classification of faint supernovae and for the determination of sub-types. For example, the type II-P (for plateau) have similar spectra to the type II-L (linear) but are distinguished by a light curve where the decline flattens out for several weeks or months before resuming its fade.

== Planetary astronomy ==
In planetary science, a light curve can be used to derive the rotation period of a minor planet, moon, or comet nucleus. From the Earth there is often no way to resolve a small object in the Solar System, even in the most powerful of telescopes, since the apparent angular size of the object is smaller than one pixel in the detector. Thus, astronomers measure the amount of light produced by an object as a function of time (the light curve). The time separation of peaks in the light curve gives an estimate of the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightnesses (the amplitude of the light curve) can be due to the shape of the object, or to bright and dark areas on its surface. For example, an asymmetrical asteroid&#x27;s light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical object&#x27;s light curve will be flatter. This allows astronomers to infer information about the shape and spin (but not size) of asteroids.

=== Asteroid lightcurve database ===

==== Light curve quality code ====

The &quot;Asteroid Lightcurve Database&quot; (LCDB) of the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) uses a numeric code to assess the quality of a period solution for minor planet light curves (it does not necessarily assess the actual underlying data). Its quality code parameter &quot;U&quot; ranges from 0 (incorrect) to 3 (well-defined):
* &quot;U&quot; = 0 → Result later proven incorrect
* &quot;U&quot; = 1 → Result based on fragmentary light curve(s), may be completely wrong.
* &quot;U&quot; = 2 → Result based on less than full coverage. Period may be wrong by 30 percent or ambiguous. 
* &quot;U&quot; = 3 → Secure result within the precision given. No ambiguity.
* &quot;U&quot; = n.a. → Not available. Incomplete or inconclusive result.

A trailing plus sign (+) or minus sign (−) is also used to indicate a slightly better or worse quality than the unsigned value.

=== Occultation light curves ===

The occultation light curve is often characterised as binary, where the light from the star is terminated instantaneously, remains constant for the duration, and is reinstated instantaneously. The duration is equivalent to the length of a chord across the occulting body.

Circumstances where the transitions are not instantaneous are;
* when either the occulting or occulted body are double, e.g. a double star or double asteroid, then a step light curve is observed.
* when the occulted body is large, e.g. a star like Antares, then the transitions are gradual.
* when the occulting body has an atmosphere, e.g. the moon Titan

The observations are typically recorded using video equipment and the disappearance and reappearance timed using a GPS disciplined Video Time Inserter (VTI).

Occultation light curves are archived at the VizieR service.

==Exoplanet discovery==

Periodic dips in a star&#x27;s light curve graph could be due to an exoplanet passing in front of the star that it is orbiting. When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, light from that star is temporarily blocked, resulting in a dip in the star&#x27;s light curve. These dips are periodic, as planets periodically orbit a star. Many exoplanets have been discovered via this method, which is known as the astronomical transit method. 

== Light curve inversion ==
Light curve inversion is a mathematical technique used to model the surfaces of rotating objects from their brightness variations. This can be used to effectively image starspots or asteroid surface albedos.

== Microlensing ==
Microlensing is a process where relatively small and low-mass astronomical objects cause a brief small increase in the brightness of a more distant object. This is caused by the small relativistic effect as larger gravitational lenses, but allows the detection and analysis of otherwise-invisible stellar and planetary mass objects. The properties of these objects can be inferred from the shape of the lensing light curve. For example, PA-99-N2 is a microlensing event that may have been due to a star in the Andromeda Galaxy that has an exoplanet.

<text>The Tropic of Cancer, also known as the Northern Tropic, is the Earth&#x27;s northernmost circle of latitude where the Sun can be seen directly overhead. This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent. It also reaches 90 degrees below the horizon at solar midnight on the December Solstice. Using a continuously updated formula, the circle is currently north of the Equator.

Its Southern Hemisphere counterpart, marking the most southerly position at which the Sun can be seen directly overhead, is the Tropic of Capricorn. These tropics are two of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of Earth, the others being the Arctic and Antarctic circles and the Equator. The positions of these two circles of latitude (relative to the Equator) are dictated by the tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit, and since the tilt changes, the location of these two circles also changes.

In geopolitics, it is known for being the southern limitation on the mutual defence obligation of NATO, as member states of NATO are not obligated to come to the defence of territory south of the Tropic of Cancer.

==Name==

When this line of latitude was named in the last centuries BCE, the Sun was in the constellation Cancer (Latin: &quot;Crab&quot;) at the June solstice (90° ecliptic longitude). Due to the precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case; today the Sun is in constellation Taurus at the June solstice. The word &quot;tropic&quot; itself comes from the Greek &quot;trope (τροπή)&quot;, meaning turn (change of direction or circumstance), inclination, referring to the fact that the Sun appears to &quot;turn back&quot; at the solstices.

==Drift==
The Tropic of Cancer&#x27;s position is not fixed, but constantly changes because of a slight wobble in the Earth&#x27;s longitudinal alignment relative to the ecliptic, the plane in which the Earth orbits around the Sun. Earth&#x27;s axial tilt varies over a 41,000-year period from about 22.1 to 24.5 degrees, and is about 23.4 degrees, which will continue to remain valid for about a millennium. This wobble means that the Tropic of Cancer is currently drifting southward at a rate of almost half an arcsecond (0.468″) of latitude, or , per year. The circle&#x27;s position was at exactly 23° 27′N in 1917 and will be at 23° 26&#x27;N in 2045.

The distance between the Antarctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer is essentially constant as they move in tandem. This is based on an assumption of a constant equator, but the precise location of the equator is not truly fixed. See: equator, axial tilt and circles of latitude for additional details.

==Geography==

North of the tropic are the subtropics and the North Temperate Zone. The equivalent line of latitude south of the Equator is called the Tropic of Capricorn, and the region between the two, centered on the Equator, is the tropics.

In the year 2000, more than half of the world&#x27;s population lived north of the Tropic of Cancer.

On the Tropic of Cancer there are approximately 13 hours, 35 minutes of daylight during the summer solstice. During the winter solstice, there are 10 hours, 41 minutes of daylight.

Using 23°26&#x27;N for the Tropic of Cancer, the tropic passes through the following 17 countries (including two disputed territories) and 8 water bodies, starting at the prime meridian and heading eastward:

==Climate==
The climate at the Tropic of Cancer is generally hot and dry, except for cooler highland regions in China, marine environments such as Hawaii, and easterly coastal areas, where orographic rainfall can be very heavy, in some places reaching annually. Most regions on the Tropic of Cancer experience two distinct seasons: an extremely hot summer with temperatures often reaching and a warm winter with maxima around . Much land on or near the Tropic of Cancer is part of the Sahara Desert, while to the east, the climate is torrid monsoonal with a short wet season from June to September, and very little rainfall for the rest of the year.

The highest mountain on or adjacent to the Tropic of Cancer is Yu Shan in Taiwan. It had glaciers descending as low as during the Last Glacial Maximum. At present glaciers still exist around the Tropic. The nearest currently surviving are the Minyong and Baishui in the Himalayas to the north and on Pico de Orizaba in Mexico to the south.

==Circumnavigation==
According to the rules of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, for a flight to compete for a round-the-world speed record, it must cover a distance no less than the length of the Tropic of Cancer, cross all meridians, and end on the same airfield where it started.

The length of the Tropic of Cancer is :

:formula_1

:where &quot;φ&quot; is the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer

For an ordinary circumnavigation the rules are somewhat relaxed and the distance is set to a rounded value of at least .

<text>The Tropic of Capricorn (or the Southern Tropic) is the circle of latitude that contains the subsolar point at the December (or southern) solstice. It is thus the southernmost latitude where the Sun can be seen directly overhead. It also reaches 90 degrees below the horizon at solar midnight on the June Solstice. Its northern equivalent is the Tropic of Cancer.

The Tropic of Capricorn is one of the five major circles of latitude marked on maps of Earth. Its latitude is currently south of the Equator, but it is very gradually moving northward, currently at the rate of 0.47 arcseconds, or 15 metres, per year.

== Name ==
When this line of latitude was named, the Sun was in the constellation Capricornus at the December solstice. This is the date each year when the Sun reaches zenith at this latitude, the southernmost declination it reaches for the year. (Due to the precession of the equinoxes the Sun currently appears in Sagittarius at this solstice.)

== Geography and environment ==
The Tropic of Capricorn is the dividing line between the Southern Temperate Zone to the south and the Tropics to the north. The Northern Hemisphere equivalent of the Tropic of Capricorn is the Tropic of Cancer.

The Tropic of Capricorn&#x27;s position is not fixed, but constantly changes because of a slight wobble in the Earth&#x27;s longitudinal alignment relative to its orbit around the Sun. Earth&#x27;s axial tilt varies over a 41,000 year period from about 22.1 to 24.5 degrees and currently resides at about 23.4 degrees. This wobble means that the Tropic of Capricorn is currently drifting northward at a rate of almost half an arcsecond (0.468″) of latitude, or 15 metres, per year (it was at exactly 23° 27′S in 1917 and will be at 23° 26&#x27;S in 2045). Therefore, the distance between Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Capricorn is essentially constant moving in tandem. See under circles of latitude for information.

There are approximately 10 hours, 41 minutes of daylight during the June solstice (Southern Hemisphere winter). During the December solstice (Southern Hemisphere summer), there are 13 hours, 35 minutes of daylight. The length of the Tropic of Capricorn at 23°26′11.7″S is 36,788 km (22,859 mi).

=== Africa ===
In most of this belt of southern Africa, a minimum of seasonal rainfall is reliable and farming is possible, though yields struggle to compete with for example the Mississippi basin, even against like-to-like soil fertilisers. Rivers have been successfully dammed particularly flowing from relief precipitation areas (high eminences) and those from the edge of the Great Rift Valley, such as the Zambezi, well within the Tropics. This, with alluvial or enriched soil, enables substantial yield grain farming in areas with good soil. Across this large region pasture farming is widespread, where intensive, brief and rotational it helps to fertilise and stabilise the soil, preventing run-off and desertification. This approach is traditional to many tribes and promoted by government advisors such as Allan Savory, a Zimbabwean-born biologist, farmer, game rancher, politician and international consultant and co-founder of the Savory Institute. According to the United Nations University Our World dissemination he is credited with developing &quot;holistic management&quot; in the 1960s and has led anti-desertification efforts in Africa for decades using a counterintuitive approach to most developed economies of increasing the number of livestock on grasslands rather than fencing them off for conservation. Such practices in this area have seen success and won generous awards; he gave the keynote speech at UNCCD&#x27;s Land Day in 2018, and later that year a TED (conference) address, widely re-broadcast.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, areas around the Tropic have some of the world&#x27;s most variable rainfall. In the east advanced plants such as flowering shrubs and eucalyptus and in most bioregions grasses have adapted to cope with means such as deep roots and little transpiration. Wetter areas, seasonally watered, are widely pasture farmed. As to animals, birds and marsupials are well-adapted. Naturally difficult arable agriculture specialises in dry fruits, nuts and modest water consumption produce. Other types are possible given reliable irrigation sources and, ideally, water-retentive enriched or alluvial soils, especially wheat; shallow irrigation sources very widely dry up in and after drought years. The multi-ridge Great Dividing Range brings relief precipitation enough to make hundreds of kilometres either side cultivable, and its rivers are widely dammed to store necessary water; this benefits the settled areas of New South Wales and Queensland.

Behind the end of the green hills, away from the Pacific, which is subject to warm, negative phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (colloquially this is an &quot;El Niño year/season&quot;) is a white, red and yellow landscape of 2,800 to 3,300 kilometres of rain shadow heading west in turn feature normally arid cattle lands of the Channel Country, the white Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park, the mainly red Mamungari Conservation Park, then the Gibson Desert, after others the dry landscape settlement of Kalbarri on the west coast and its rest, northward. The Channel Country features an arid landscape with a series of ancient flood plains from rivers which only flow intermittently. The principal rivers are Georgina River, Cooper Creek and the Diamantina River. In most years, their waters are absorbed into the earth or evaporate, but when there is sufficient rainfall in their catchment area, these rivers flow into Lake Eyre, South Australia. One of the most significant rainfall events occurred in 2010 when a monsoonal low from ex-Cyclone Olga created a period of exceptional rainfall.

El Niño adverse phases cause a shift in atmospheric circulation; rainfall becomes reduced over Indonesia and Australia, rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical Pacific. The low-level surface trade winds, which normally blow from east to west along the equator, either weaken or start blowing from the other direction.

=== South America ===
In South America, whilst in the continental cratons soils are almost as old as in Australia and Southern Africa, the presence of the geologically young and evolving Andes means that this region is on the western side of the subtropical anticyclones and thus receives warm and humid air from the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, areas in Brazil adjacent to the Tropic are impressively productive agricultural regions, producing large quantities of crops such as sugarcane, and the natural rainforest vegetation has been almost entirely cleared, except for a few remaining patches of Atlantic Forest. Further south in Argentina, the temperate grasslands of the Pampas region is equally influential in wheat, soybeans, maize, and beef, making the country one of the largest worldwide agricultural exporters, similar to the role played by the Prairies region in Canada.

West of the Andes, which creates a rain shadow, the air is further cooled and dried by the cold Humboldt Current which makes it very arid, creating the Atacama Desert, one of the driest in the world, so that no glaciers exist between Volcán Sajama at 18˚30&#x27;S and Cerro Tres Cruces at 27˚S. Vegetation here is almost non-existent, though on the eastern slopes of the Andes rainfall is adequate for rainfed agriculture.

<doc id="66681" wikidata="Q1141182" url="?curid=66681" title="Frontier League">
<text>The Frontier League (FL; French: &quot;Ligue Frontière&quot;, LF) is a professional baseball league in North America composed of 18 teams – 15 in the United States and 3 in Canada. The FL is one of the eight independent baseball leagues in North America and is considered the oldest current running independent baseball league in the world. The Frontier Cup, the independent baseball trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. The league is an official MLB Partner League since 2020, and the level of play is comparable to Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Single-A level. The FL is headquartered in Sauget, Illinois.

The Frontier League was organized by several men who got together in the winter of 1992–1993 and decided to start an independent professional baseball league to serve the West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeast Ohio areas. They believed they could bring professional baseball to areas that would never have a chance of affiliated professional baseball coming to their communities. The seed was planted and they named their project &quot;The Frontier League&quot;.

25 distinct franchises had competed in the league. Its largest period of growth followed in 2020–21, when six teams from the ceased Can-Am and New York–Penn leagues joined alongside an expansion franchise. The Evansville Otters, the only one of the original eight franchises still playing today, is the longest tenured team in the league.

The FL is the fifth-highest grossing professional minor sports league in the United States by revenue, after the American Hockey League (AHL), International League (IL), the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB). The league&#x27;s headquarters have been in Sauget, Illinois since 2001, when the Gateway Grizzlies were formed. As of the 2024 season, the FL had players from 17 different countries.

The FL&#x27;s regular season is typically held from May to September, with each team playing 96 games. Following the conclusion of the regular season, 8 teams advance to the Frontier League playoffs, a three-round tournament that runs into late-September to determine the league champion. Since the league&#x27;s founding in 1993, the Schaumburg Boomers have won the most combined FL titles with four, and the reigning league champions are the Québec Capitales, who defeated the Washington Wild Things in the 2024 Frontier League Championship Series.

==History==
The Frontier League was founded in 1993. It initially struggled to retain franchises, with four of its eight founding teams folding within three seasons, though steadily grew to twelve teams within a decade. The first league champions were the Zanesville Greys. Eight teams have won more than one championship: Springfield in 1996 and 1998; Johnstown in 1995 (as the Steal) and in 2000 (as the Johnnies), Richmond Roosters in 2001 and 2002, Windy City in 2007 and 2008, the Joliet Slammers in 2011 and 2018, and the Evansville Otters in 2006 and 2016. With four titles, the Schaumburg Boomers have won the most league championships.

On June 20, 2000, Brian Tollberg debuted with the San Diego Padres, becoming the first player from the Frontier League to make it to the Majors. A week later, Morgan Burkhart made his debut with the Boston Red Sox.

Although the league does not have any teams located in the same city as Major League teams, it does nonetheless have teams located within the markets of Major League teams. The Chicago area has three teams (Joliet Slammers, Schaumburg Boomers and Windy City ThunderBolts), as does the New York area (New Jersey Jackals, Sussex County Miners, and New York Boulders), and St. Louis (Gateway Grizzlies), Cleveland (Lake Erie Crushers), Cincinnati (Florence Y&#x27;alls) and Pittsburgh (Washington Wild Things) each have one. The Wild Things, in particular, have been able to market themselves as a successful alternative to the Pittsburgh Pirates due to the latter franchise&#x27;s long stretch of losing seasons, which lasted from the Frontier League&#x27;s founding in 1993 until 2013 when the Pirates finished with a record of 94–68.

On October 16, 2019, it was announced that the Frontier League would be merging with the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, absorbing five of its teams to form the largest independent professional baseball league. This added the New Jersey Jackals, New York Boulders, Quebec Capitales, Sussex County Miners, and Trois-Rivieres Aigles to the league; the Ottawa Champions, the last remaining Can-Am League team, was not invited to participate. The divisions were renamed, with the easternmost teams playing in the Can-Am Division and the westernmost in the Midwestern Division. The league had a partnership agreement with the California Winter League for player development.

On September 24, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that it named the Frontier League an MLB Partner League. This enables collaboration with MLB to jointly discuss marketing and promotional initiatives to grow, expand, and enhance the game of baseball.

For the 2021 season, the Frontier League announced it would be adding two new teams. The first announcement came around the same time as the announcement of the partnership with Major League Baseball, as Ottawa was granted an expansion franchise in the league. The team, as chosen by fans in a contest, was named the Titans and started playing at Ottawa Stadium. Then, on January 8, 2021, after the reorganization of Minor League Baseball, the league added the Tri-City ValleyCats, which were one of several teams that were orphaned or disbanded when the New York-Penn League was folded. The Titans and ValleyCats joined the five former Can-Am League teams and Washington in the Can-Am Conference; to even the divisions at three to four teams, Lake Erie was moved to the Midwest Conference.

In April 2021, the league announced that the Québec Capitales, the Trois-Rivières Aigles, and the Ottawa Titans would not compete in the 2021 season due to the prolonged closure of the Canada–United States border as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Titans, Aigles and Capitales later joined forces to form a new team that competed as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Can-Am Conference. Known as &quot;Équipe Québec&quot;, they began the season as a traveling team, and starting on July 30, 2021, started sharing home games between Québec City and Trois-Rivières following a loosening in border restrictions. 10 games were played in Québec City and 11 in Trois-Rivières. They did not play in Ottawa due to COVID-19 restrictions in Ontario.

On October 6, 2021, the owners of the Southern Illinois Miners, Jayne and John Simmons, announced they would be retiring from professional baseball to spend more time with family and the Miners would be ceasing operations and dropping out of the Frontier League. As a result, the league formed the Empire State Greys, to compete as a traveling team with a roster of players from the Empire Professional Baseball League.

In September 2023, the league announced a new team, the New England Knockouts, who were planned to play at Campanelli Stadium in Brockton, Massachusetts, beginning with the 2024 season. This brought the total number of permanent members of the league to sixteen teams. After playing one season as the Knockouts, the team was renamed as the Brockton Rox in January 2025.

In September 2024, the league announced an expansion to Mississippi and North Carolina. A franchise was awarded to Pearl, Mississippi, called the Mississippi Mud Monsters, following the departure of the Atlanta Braves Double-A affiliate the Mississippi Braves. The Down East Bird Dawgs, a new team in Kinston, North Carolina, will play in Grainger Stadium, which was formerly home of the Texas Rangers-affiliated Down East Wood Ducks.

== Season structure ==
The Frontier League season is divided into a preseason (late April and early May), a regular season (from early May through early September) and a postseason (the Frontier League playoffs).

Teams usually hold a spring showcase for prospects in April and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in late April. Full training camps begin in early May, including a preseason consisting of four exhibition games. Split squad games, in which parts of a team&#x27;s regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.

During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. Since 2021, in the regular season, all teams play 96 games: 48 games each of home and road, playing four series (12 games) against their three other divisional opponents; three series (9 games) against the four remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents; and only one series (3 games) against every team in the other conference—home or road.

The league&#x27;s regular season standings are based on a win system. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most wins in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league&#x27;s overall leader is awarded the league&#x27;s regular season champions.

The Frontier League playoffs, which go from early-to-late September, are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Frontier League champion. Four teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs: the top two teams in each division. The two conference champions proceed to the Frontier League Championship Series (FLCS). In all rounds, the higher-ranked team is awarded home-field advantage, with up to four of the seven games played at this team&#x27;s home venue. In the FLCS, the team with the most wins during the regular season has home-field advantage.

=== Players ===
The Frontier League uses a salary cap. The average player salary is $1,500 per month. Clubs provide housing for players, largely through host family programs. Teams set their own wages for managers, coaches, athletic trainers, and support staff.

Teams in the Frontier League must recruit and sign their own players, who usually are undrafted college players or one-time prospects who have been released by their teams.

The league also has several other rules to give younger players more opportunities. This includes a maximum of eight veterans per team, and a minimum of ten rookies (players in their first two years of professional baseball or under the age of 25) in their roster. The remaining six players on the 24-man roster can be classified as &quot;Experienced-1&quot; or &quot;Experienced-2&quot;. Rosters are limited to a size of 24 players on Opening Day, although up to 25 additional players can be added to a team&#x27;s roster during the regular season before the transactions limit.

== Teams ==

During the 2021 season, the FL consisted of 14 teams—13 based in the United States and 1 in Canada. The FL divided the 14 teams into two conferences: the Can-Am Conference and the Midwest Conference. Each conference was split into two divisions: the Can-Am Conference contained six teams (three per division), while the Midwest Conference had eight teams (four per division). With the addition of the Empire State Greys in 2022–23 as well as the New England Knockouts in 2024, the league operated with a total of 16 teams with only two divisions: East and West.

The expansion of the two new teams starting at the 2025 season marks the league&#x27;s first expansion into the deep south, and largest expansion in history. The league will revert to the 2021 setup: two conferences with four divisions. The Mississippi Mud Monsters will be playing in the West Division of the Midwest Conference while the Down East Bird Dawgs will be playing in the East Division of the Atlantic Conference.

<text>The Chillicothe Paints are a collegiate summer baseball team based in Chillicothe, Ohio, in the United States. The team is a member of the summer collegiate Prospect League. The Paints previously played in the professional independent Frontier League from 1993 to 2008. The Paints play their home games at V.A. Memorial Stadium in Chillicothe.

The Paints play in the Prospect League&#x27;s Eastern Conference – Northeast Division along with the Champion City Kings, Johnstown Mill Rats, and Lafayette Aviators.

==Frontier League era==
The Chillicothe Paints were one of the eight original franchises to begin Frontier League play in 1993. Two teams, the West Virginia Coal Sox and the Tri-State Tomahawks, did not complete the season as the league struggled with stability. In 1994, the Paints featured Brian Tollberg who went 7–4, 2.48 ERA, and was then signed by the Milwaukee Brewers organization. Tollberg would become the first Frontier League alumnus to make the majors when he started for the San Diego Padres on June 7, 2000, pitching 7 innings in a 3-1 Padres victory.

The league solidified and the Paints found their footing by 1996 when Chillicothe dominated the league with a 48-26 (.649) record, advancing to the Frontier League championship, losing to the Springfield Capitals 3–0 in the best of five series. This was the first of six championship series appearances for the Paints during the Frontier League era, none of which resulted in a championship. The 1996 Paints were led by a trio of power bats in Scott Pinoni (.384 BA, 11 HR, 65 RBI), Jackie Jempsen (.340 BA, 13 HR, 57 RBI) and Mitch House (.305 BA, 18 HR, 53 RBI).

Manager Roger Hanners had the team in the championship series again in both 1998 and 1999, dropping the 1998 series to Springfield 2-1 and the 1999 title series to the London Werewolves 2–0 in a best of three. The Paints were led at this time by the stellar hitting of Gator McBride, a former Atlanta Braves farmhand, who came to Chillicothe and would finish his Frontier League career with a .423 BA, .758 slugging percentage, 27 homers, and 111 RBI. The Boston Red Sox took notice of his resurrected career and signed him after 39 games of the 1999 season. His career was cut short by injuries sustained in an automobile accident in February 2000, forcing him into retirement.

The Paints returned to the Frontier League championship in 2001 with a division-winning 51-31 (.607) record, but were upset by the Richmond Roosters 2–0 in the series. Rick Blanc (13-1, 3.24 ERA), Matt McKay (.345 BA, 1 HR, 48 RBI), Darin Kinsolving (.327 BA, 10 HR, 62 RBI) and Joe Colameco (.325 BA, 10 HR, 60 RBI) paced the balanced Chillicothe squad.

Former major-leaguer Glenn Wilson took over as manager in 2005 and took the Paints to back-to-back championship appearances, dropping the 2005 series 3–2 to the Kalamazoo Kings and the 2006 series 3–0 to the Evansville Otters. John Martinez (16-4, 3.11 ERA), Jose Rodriguez (.380 BA, 5 HR, 36 RBI), and John Ramistella (.317 BA, 20 HR, 73 RBI) led the 2005 Paints, while Kurt Hartfelder (10-5, 16.7 ERA) and Travis Garcia (.289 BA, 11 HR, 66 RBI) led the 2006 team. VA Memorial Stadium had grass from 1993 to 2005, but the ballpark installed FieldTurf in 2006, the first baseball field in the United States to have a 100% FieldTurf playing surface, including base, mound and home plate areas.

The Frontier League had changed from predominately rural and smaller towns into a suburban league over the years, and the Paints faced financial and attendance challenges as a result. Following the 2008 season, the ownership announced that they would leave the Frontier League, becoming an amateur collegiate summer baseball team. The Paints were the longest tenured franchise in the Frontier League in 2008 and the last remaining original Frontier League team in the league.

The Paints are represented in the Frontier League Hall of Fame by owner Dr. Chris Hanners, 1B Scott Pinoni, infielder Mitch House, OF Willie Edwards, pitcher Bobby Chandler, OF Gator McBride, and 3B Travis Garcia.

==Prospect League era==
Since 2009, the Chillicothe Paints have competed in the Prospect League, an amateur collegiate summer league. In 2010, the Paints won their first Prospect League championship against the Danville Dans on an 11th inning walk off home run by Ian Nielsen. The 2010 Paints were led by OF Jeff Holm (.359 BA, 11 HR, 60 RBI), pitcher Blake Mascarello (7-1, 2.86 ERA) and closer Kyle Lindquist (4-1, 10 saves, 2.86 ERA).

The Paints celebrated their 25th season in 2017. As part of the festivities, the Paints retired longtime coach Marty Dunn&#x27;s number 25 in a pregame ceremony that included former players and staff throughout the first 24 seasons of Paints baseball. That season, the Paints averaged 1,959 fans per game, setting a franchise record in both average attendance and total attendance. The 58,755 total attendance marked a new Prospect League record. The Paints ranked in the top 10 of all summer collegiate teams nationwide in per-game attendance in 2017.

After missing the playoffs in 2016 and 2017, Chillicothe made a return to the playoffs in 2018, losing to the Kokomo Jackrabbits two games to one in the East Division Championship Series. It was the first playoff appearance for manager Brian Bigam since he took over the reins in 2016. Jack Raines was named the Prospect League&#x27;s Galen Woods Fireman of the Year (Reliever of the Year).

The Paints began the 2019 season 2–7, but went 41-14 the rest of the campaign (including 3–1 in the playoffs) and defeated the Danville Dans in a one-game East Division Championship Game and then, after losing game one of the Prospect League Championship Series at home to the league&#x27;s newest team, the Cape Catfish, the Paints won games two and three in Cape Girardeau, Mo., to capture the franchise&#x27;s second league title. Trailing 2–1 in the middle of the game, Trey Smith hit a grand slam to put Chillicothe in the lead 5–2, the eventual final score. Closer Nate Haugh was named the Prospect League&#x27;s Galen Woods Fireman of the Year (Reliever of the Year) and the team was paced by C Cole Andrews (.320 BA, 11 HR, 61 RBI) and pitcher Austin Calopietro (6-1, 2.47 ERA). For the first time in team history, the Paints averaged at least 2,000 fans per game (2,037) and totaled 57,040 for the season, leading the league and ranking 15th nationally in both categories among similar type teams nationwide.

<text>Quercus rubra, the northern red oak, is an oak tree in the red oak group (&quot;Quercus&quot; section &quot;Lobatae&quot;). It is a native of North America, in the eastern and central United States and southeast and south-central Canada. It has been introduced to small areas in Western Europe, where it can frequently be seen cultivated in gardens and parks. It prefers good soil that is slightly acidic. Often simply called red oak, northern red oak is so named to distinguish it from southern red oak (&quot;Q. falcata&quot;), also known as the Spanish oak. Northern red oak is sometimes called champion oak.

==Description==
In many forests, &quot;Quercus rubra&quot; grows straight and tall, to , exceptionally to tall, with a trunk of up to in diameter. Open-grown trees do not get as tall, but can develop a stouter trunk, up to in diameter. It has stout branches growing at right angles to the stem, forming a narrow round-topped head.

Under optimal conditions and full sun, northern red oak is fast growing and a 10-year-old tree can be tall. Trees may live up to 400 years; a living example of 326 years was noted in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.eku.edu/pedersonn/OLDLISTeast&quot;&gt;Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Columbia University, Eastern US oldlist&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern red oak is easy to recognize by its bark, which features ridges that appear to have shiny stripes down the center. A few other oaks have bark with this kind of appearance in the upper tree, but the northern red oak is the only tree with the striping all the way down the trunk.

As with most other deciduous oaks, leafout takes place in spring when day length has reached 13 hours—it is tied entirely to photoperiod and will take place regardless of air temperature. As a consequence (see below), in cooler regions, northern red oaks often lose their flowers to late spring frosts, resulting in no seed crop for the year. The catkins and leaves emerge at the same time. The acorns develop on the tree for two growing seasons and are released from the tree in early October, and leaf drop begins when day length falls under 11 hours. The timing of leafout and leaf drop can vary by as much as three weeks in the northern and southern US. Seedlings emerge in spring when soil temperatures reach .

* Bark: Dark reddish gray brown, with broad, thin, rounded ridges, scaly. On young trees and large stems, smooth and light gray. Rich in tannin. Branchlets slender, at first bright green, shining, then dark red, finally dark brown. Bark is brownish gray, becoming dark brown on old trees.
* Wood: Pale reddish brown, sapwood darker, heavy, hard, strong, coarse-grained. Cracks in drying, but when carefully treated could be successfully used for furniture. Also used in construction and for interior finish of houses. Sp. gr., 0.6621; weight of cu. ft., 41.25 lbs.
* Winter buds: Dark chestnut brown (reddish brown), ovate, acute, generally long
* Leaves and acorns: Alternate, oblong-ovate to oblong, five to ten inches long, four to six inches broad; seven to eleven lobes tapering gradually from broad bases, acute, and usually repandly dentate and terminating with long bristle-pointed teeth; the second pair of lobes from apex are largest; midrib and primary veins conspicuous. Lobes are often less deeply cut than most other oaks of the red oak group. Leaves emerge from the bud convolute, pink, covered with soft silky down above, coated with thick white tomentum below. When full grown are dark green and smooth, sometimes shining above, yellow green, smooth or hairy on the axils of the veins below. In autumn they turn a rich red, sometimes brown. Often the petiole and midvein are a rich red color in midsummer and early autumn, though this is not true of all red oaks. The acorns mature in about 18 months after pollination; solitary or in pairs, sessile or stalked; nut oblong-ovoid with broad flat base, full, with acute apex, one half to one and one-fourth of an inch long, first green, maturing nut-brown; cup, saucer-shaped and shallow, wide, usually covering only the base, sometimes one-fourth of the nut, thick, shallow, reddish brown, somewhat downy within, covered with thin imbricated reddish brown scales. Its kernel is white and very bitter.

Red oak acorns, unlike the white oak group, display epigeal dormancy and will not germinate without a minimum of three months&#x27; exposure to temperatures below . They also take two years of growing on the tree before development is completed.
==Distribution and habitat==
The species grows from the north end of the Great Lakes, east to Nova Scotia, south as far as Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, and west to Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota.

It grows rapidly and is tolerant of many soils and varied situations, although it prefers the glacial drift and well-drained borders of streams. In the southeastern United States, it is frequently a part of the canopy in an oak-heath forest, but generally not as important as some other oaks.

Northern red oak is the most common species of oak in the northeastern US after the closely related pin oak (&quot;Q. palustris&quot;). The red oak group as a whole are more abundant today than they were when European settlement of North America began as forest clearing and exploitation for lumber much reduced the population of the formerly dominant white oaks.

==Reproduction==
“Northern red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra&quot; ) is monoecious, dichogamous, wind-pollinated, and self-incompatible”. Pollination occurs in the first growing season, but fertilization and acorn maturation occur during the second growing season.

==Ecology==

Over the last few decades, the northern red oak has dealt with several environmental factors, mainly disease, predation by insects, and limited opportunities for dispersal. These stresses have impacted the species&#x27; ability to proliferate in both the Northeast and Europe. The various environmental responses observed in &quot;Quercus rubra&quot; across several temperate environmental conditions have allowed for it to serve as a model organism for studying symbiotic relationships, dispersal, and habituation between tree species.

===Pests and diseases===
Canker pathogen, &quot;Diplodia corticola,&quot; has become a major pathogen to the species over the last decade, causing leaf browning, bark cracking and bleeding, and high rates of tree mortality across the northeastern United States. The northern red oak is also characterized as one of the most susceptible species to plant fungi &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; and &quot;Phytophthora ramorum,&quot; which have caused severe, red-black cankers in the trunk region of the species. Both &quot;P. cinnamomi&quot; and &quot;P. ramorum&quot; grow under warmer temperature conditions; as a result, northern red oak trees found in California, France, and northern Spain all have a higher incidence of fungal infection. Oak Wilt caused by the fungus &quot;Bretziella fagacearum&quot; is a major pathogen found in eastern North America that can kill trees quickly.

There has been a recent northern red oak decline in Arkansas which is “unique in that it is associated with increases in red oak borer” (Enaphalodes rufulus) which “is native to the eastern United States and usually occurs in mixed oak forests”. “It damages the phloem, sapwood, and heartwood which means the ability for growth and repair is attacked as well as the stability of the tree”.

=== Abiotic stresses ===
Northern red oak seedlings have been known to have a high mortality rate in northeast regions prone to spring freeze, particularly in Massachusetts. Acorns produced by oaks in this region are typically smaller in size as an adaptation to frost produced in high latitudes; however, the resulting smaller seedlings have produced limited opportunities for animal consumption and dispersal. Flooding along the continental United States has been shown to be a major issue for the northern red oak, in which decreased phloem transport and photosynthetic activity has been observed, but only after multiple days of flooding, indicating that the northern red oak has adapted moderate resistance to excess water exposure. The northern red oak has also developed tolerance mechanisms for heat stress, particularly observed in deciduous forests in the Southeastern United States, where, during summer heat waves, temperatures can exceed . The leaves of the northern red oak have been observed to have an acclimation to Rubisco activase activity that is directly correlated to acclimations with repeated exposure to heat waves. Consistent photosynthetic activity in the red oak has also been observed in the presence of high carbon dioxide levels that often occur as a result of elevated temperatures.

===Animals===
Northern red oak kernels have highly concentrated amounts of bitter-tasting tannin, a biochemical classified as a predator deterrent, which has limited appeal for consumption among animals. Despite this, the acorns are eaten by deer, squirrels and birds. In Europe, the acorns are consumed by several moth species, particularly &quot;Cydia fagiglandana&quot; and &quot;Cydia splendana&quot;, which increases their niche breadths and reduces their competition with &quot;Curculio&quot; weevils. Due to this, germination rates among the northern red oak acorns have decreased significantly and resulted in less seed dispersal by animals within Poland. In addition, limited opportunities for dispersal have become costly for the northern red oak in Europe. European animals known for dispersing tendencies, such as the European jay and wood mouse, have been found to be more attracted to local oak species.

===Fungi===
&quot;Quercus rubra&quot; has effective ectomycorrhizal relationships that have been correlated with increased growth rates. Northern red oak trees have been shown to increase growth in the presence of various ascomycetes that coil at the base of the oak trunk. The fungi, which eventually proliferate at the stumps of deciduous trees, have been found to be host-specific to both &quot;Quercus rubra&quot; and &quot;Quercus montana&quot; and primarily promote growth upon infection.

===Invasiveness in Europe===
It was introduced to Europe in the 1700s and has naturalized throughout most of western and central Europe.
Across western and central Europe, the northern red oak has become the fourth-most significant invasive species, colonizing several regions across Belgium, Germany, Northern Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, European Russia, the Urals and Western Siberia). The northern red oak is primarily found on the edges of woodland reserves in Europe, where light availability, tannin concentration, and animal dispersal are the most necessary component for the species&#x27; longevity and survival. The high influx of the species in Europe is primarily based on its economic productivity as a fast-growing source of timber; however, it has been linked to lower percentages of trace elements and minerals found in the surrounding soil and reduced richness among native oak species such as &quot;Quercus robur&quot;.

==Uses==
The northern red oak is one of the most important oaks for timber production in North America. Quality red oak is of high value as lumber and veneer, while defective logs are used as firewood. Other related oaks are also cut and marketed as red oak, although their wood is not always of as high a quality. These include eastern black oak, scarlet oak, pin oak, Shumard oak, southern red oak and other species in the red oak group. Construction uses include flooring, veneer, interior trim, and furniture. It is also used for lumber, railroad ties, and fence posts.

Red oak wood grain is so open that smoke can be blown through it from end-grain to end-grain on a flat-sawn board. For this reason, it is subject to moisture infiltration and is unsuitable for outdoor uses such as boatbuilding or exterior trim.

The acorns can be collected in autumn, shelled, tied up in a cloth, and leached to remove bitterness. They can then be eaten whole or ground into meal.

===Ornamental use===

&quot;Quercus rubra&quot; is grown in parks and large gardens as a specimen tree. It is not planted as often as the closely related pin oak as it develops a taproot and quickly becomes difficult to transplant, however modern growing pots have made starting seedlings with taproots easier than in the past.

==Culture==
It is the state tree of New Jersey and the provincial tree of Prince Edward Island.
