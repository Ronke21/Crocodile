<text>The Venera (, &#x27;Venus&#x27;) program was a series of space probes developed by the Soviet Union between 1961 and 1984 to gather information about the planet Venus. 

Thirteen probes successfully entered the Venusian atmosphere, including the two Vega program and Venera-Halley probes. Ten of those successfully landed on the surface of the planet. Due to the extreme conditions, the probes could only survive for a short period on the surface, from 23 minutes to two hours.

The &quot;Venera&quot; program established a number of precedents in space exploration, among them being the first human-made devices to enter the atmosphere of another planet (Venera 3 on 1 March 1966), the first to make a soft landing on another planet (Venera 7 on 15 December 1970), the first to return images from another planet&#x27;s surface (Venera 9 on 8 June 1975), the first to record sounds on another planet (Venera 13 on 30 October 1981), and the first to perform high-resolution radar mapping scans (Venera 15 on 2 June 1983).

==The Venera probes==

===Venera 1 and 2===


The first Soviet attempt at a flyby probe to Venus was launched on 4 February 1961, but failed to leave Earth orbit. In keeping with the Soviet policy at that time of not announcing details of failed missions, the launch was announced under the name Tyazhely Sputnik (&quot;Heavy Satellite&quot;). It is also known as Venera 1VA.

As with some of the Soviet Union&#x27;s other planetary probes, the later versions were launched in pairs, with a second vehicle launched soon after the first.

Venera 1 and Venera 2 were intended to fly past Venus without entering orbit. Venera 1 was launched on 12 February 1961. Telemetry on the probe failed seven days after launch. It is believed to have passed within of Venus and remains in heliocentric orbit. Venera 2 launched on 12 November 1965, but also suffered a telemetry failure after leaving Earth orbit.

Several other failed attempts at Venus flyby probes were launched by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, but were not announced as planetary missions at the time, and hence did not officially receive the &quot;Venera&quot; designation.

===Venera 3 to 6===
The Venera 3 to 6 probes were similar. Weighing approximately one ton, and launched by the Molniya-type booster rocket, they included a cruise &quot;bus&quot; and a spherical atmospheric entry probe. The probes were optimised for atmospheric measurements, but not equipped with any special landing apparatus. Although it was hoped they would reach the surface still functioning, the first probes failed almost immediately, thereby disabling data transmission to Earth.

Venera 3 became the first human-made object to impact another planet&#x27;s surface as it crash-landed on 1 March 1966. However, as the spacecraft&#x27;s data probes had failed upon atmospheric penetration, no data from within the Venusian atmosphere were retrieved from the mission.

On 18 October 1967, Venera 4 became the first spacecraft to measure the atmosphere of another planet. This spacecraft first showed the major gas of Venus&#x27;s atmosphere to be CO2. While the Soviet Union initially claimed the craft reached the surface intact, re-analysis, including atmospheric occultation data from the American Mariner 5 spacecraft that flew by Venus the day after its arrival, demonstrated that Venus&#x27;s surface pressure was 75–100 atmospheres, much higher than Venera 4&#x27;s 25 atm hull strength, and the claim was retracted.

Realizing the ships would be crushed before reaching the surface, the Soviets launched Venera 5 and Venera 6 as atmospheric probes. Designed to jettison nearly half their payload prior to entering the planet&#x27;s atmosphere, these craft recorded 53 and 51 minutes of data, respectively, while slowly descending by parachute before their batteries failed.

Around that time it became increasingly known that Venus was unlikely to have liquid bodies of water, however the designs for the Soviet &quot;Venera&quot; probes still considered the possibility of a water landing as late as 1964.

===Venera 7===
The Venera 7 probe, launched in August 1970, was the first one designed to survive Venus&#x27;s surface conditions and to make a soft landing. Massively overbuilt to ensure survival, it had few experiments on board, and scientific output from the mission was further limited due to an internal switchboard failure that stuck in the &quot;transmit temperature&quot; position. Still, the control scientists succeeded in extrapolating the pressure (90 atm) from the temperature data with , which resulted from the first direct surface measurements. The Doppler measurements of the Venera 4 to 7 probes were the first evidence of the existence of zonal winds with high speeds of up to 100 metres per second (330 ft/s, 362 km/h, 225 mph) in the Venusian atmosphere (super rotation). Along with the pressure and temperature data acquired Venera 7 also measured atmospheric composition.

Venera 7&#x27;s parachute failed shortly before landing very close to the surface. It impacted at and toppled over, but survived. This caused antenna misalignment making the radio signal very weak, but it was detected (with temperature telemetry) for 23 more minutes before its batteries expired. Thus, it became, on 15 December 1970, the first human-made probe to transmit data from the surface of Venus.
===Venera 8===

Venera 8, launched in 1972, was equipped with an extended set of scientific instruments for studying the surface (gamma-spectrometer etc.). The cruise bus of Venera 7 and 8 was similar to that of earlier ones, with the design ascending to the Zond 3 mission. The lander transmitted data during the descent and landed in sunlight. It measured the light level but had no camera. It transmitted data for almost an hour.

===Venera 9 to 12===

Following the failed Kosmos 482, the 1975 Venera 9 and 10 probes and 1978 Venera 11 and 12 probes were of a different design. They weighed approximately five tons and were launched by the powerful Proton booster. They included a transfer and relay bus that had engines to brake into Venus orbit (Venera 9 and 10, 11 and 12) and to serve as receiver and relay for the entry probe&#x27;s transmissions. The entry probe was attached to the top of the bus in a spherical heat shield. The probes were optimized for surface operations with an unusual design that included a spherical compartment to protect the electronics from atmospheric pressure and heat for as long as possible. Beneath this was a shock-absorbing &quot;crush ring&quot; for landing. Above the pressure sphere was a cylindrical antenna structure and a wide, dish-shaped structure that resembled an antenna but was actually an aerobrake. They were designed to operate on the surface for a minimum of 30 minutes. Instruments varied on different missions, but included cameras and atmospheric and soil analysis equipment. All four landers had problems with some or all of their camera lens caps not releasing.

The Venera 9 lander operated for at least 53 minutes and took pictures with one of two cameras; the other lens cap did not release.

The Venera 10 lander operated for at least 65 minutes and took pictures with one of two cameras; the other lens cap did not release.

The Venera 11 lander operated for at least 95 minutes but neither camera&#x27;s lens cap released.

The Venera 12 lander operated for at least 110 minutes but neither camera&#x27;s lens cap released.

===Venera 13 and 14===
Venera 13 and 14 (1981–82) each had a descent craft/lander that contained most of the instrumentation and electronics, and a flyby spacecraft that was used as a communications relay. The design was similar to the earlier Venera 9–12 landers. They carried instruments to take scientific measurements of the ground and atmosphere once landed, including cameras, a microphone, a drill and surface sampler, and a seismometer. They also had instruments to record electric discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian atmosphere.

The two descent craft landed about apart, just east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as Phoebe Regio. The Venera 13 lander survived for 127 minutes, and the Venera 14 lander for 57 minutes, where the planned design life was only 32 minutes. The Venera 14 craft had the misfortune of ejecting the camera lens cap directly under the surface compressibility tester arm, and returned information for the compressibility of the lens cap rather than the surface. The descent vehicles transmitted data to the buses, which acted as data relays as they flew by Venus.

===Venera 15 and 16===

The 1983 Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were orbiter missions, similar to previous probes, but the entry probes were replaced with surface imaging radar equipment. Radar imaging was necessary to penetrate the dense cloud of Venus and both missions included identical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and radio altimeter systems. The SAR system was crucial in the mapping efforts of the mission and featured an 8-month operational tour to capture Venus&#x27;s surface at a resolution of 1 to 2 kilometers (0.6 to 1.2 miles). When the system was switched to radio altimeter mode the antenna operated at an 8-centimeter wavelength band to send and receive signals off of the Venusian surface over a period of 0.67 milliseconds. 

The results were a detailed map of the reflectivity distribution over the surface of the Venusian Northern Hemisphere. The linear distance measurements that were taken ranged from 91 to 182 kilometers. The twin Soviet spacecraft flew in near-polar elliptical orbits and succeeded in mapping the top half of the northern atmosphere (from the north pole to 30 degrees N latitude, about 115 million square kilometers or 71 million square miles) by the end of the main mission. An altimeter provided topographical data with a height resolution of 50 m (164 feet), and an East German instrument mapped surface temperature variations.

===VeGa probes===

The VeGa (Cyrillic: ВеГа) probes to Venus and comet 1/P Halley launched in 1984 also used this basic Venera design, including landers but also atmospheric balloons which relayed data for about two days. &quot;VeGa&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;Venera&quot; (Venus in Russian) and &quot;Gallei&quot; (Halley in Russian).

==Future==
===Venera-D===
Venera-D is a proposed mission to Venus that would include a highly capable orbiter and a lander. From the standpoint of total mass delivered to Venus, the best launch opportunities occur in 2026 and 2031; however, as of March 2021, Venera-D is planned for launch no earlier than November 2029. Venera-D could incorporate some NASA components, including balloons, a subsatellite for plasma measurements, or a long-lived (24 hours) surface station on the lander.

==Scientific findings==

There were many scientific findings from the data retrieved by the Venera probes making them pivotal in our understanding of Venus. The Venera probes provided direct data regarding Venus&#x27; surface and atmosphere while also providing important information on electronics lifetime under Venus&#x27; harsh conditions. Venera 4 was the first successful probe, and showed that CO2 is the main component in Venus&#x27; atmosphere. Venera 7 found the temperature and pressure data as well as the atmospheric composition. Venera 8 measured the K, U, and Th on the surface through gamma-ray analysis. Venera 9 provided the first images of the surface of Venus as well as more gamma-ray analysis. By sending the first images of Venus&#x27; surface back to Earth the Venera missions provided scientists with the ability to relay the achievements with the public. Venera 13 provided the first color images and X-ray fluorescence data of the surface of the planet. After analyzing the radar images returned from Venera 15 and 16, it was concluded that the ridges and grooves on the surface of Venus were the result of tectonic deformations. This was found by radar imaging while in orbit. Even with their short lifetimes, the Venera missions each added significant understanding of our sister planet.

<doc id="68282" wikidata="Q838811" url="?curid=68282" title="Peasant">
<text>A peasant is a pre-industrial agricultural laborer or a farmer with limited land-ownership, especially one living in the Middle Ages under feudalism and paying rent, tax, fees, or services to a landlord. In Europe, three classes of peasants existed: non-free slaves, semi-free serfs, and free tenants. Peasants might hold title to land outright (fee simple), or by any of several forms of land tenure, among them socage, quit-rent, leasehold, and copyhold.

In some contexts, &quot;peasant&quot; has a pejorative meaning, even when referring to farm laborers. As early as in 13th-century Germany, the concept of &quot;peasant&quot; could imply &quot;rustic&quot; as well as &quot;robber&quot;, as the English term villain/villein. In 21st-century English, the word &quot;peasant&quot; can mean &quot;an ignorant, rude, or unsophisticated person&quot;.
The word rose to renewed popularity in the 1940s–1960s as a collective term, often referring to rural populations of developing countries in general, as the &quot;semantic successor to &#x27;native&#x27;, incorporating all its condescending and racial overtones&quot;.

The word peasantry is commonly used in a non-pejorative sense as a collective noun for the rural population in the poor and developing countries of the world. Via Campesina, an organization claiming to represent the rights of about 200 million farm-workers around the world, self-defines as an &quot;International Peasant&#x27;s Movement&quot; . The United Nations and its Human Rights Council prominently uses the term &quot;peasant&quot; in a non-pejorative sense, as in the UN &quot;Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas&quot; adopted in 2018. In general English-language literature, the use of the word &quot;peasant&quot; has steadily declined since about 1970.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;peasant&quot; is derived from the 15th-century French word , meaning one from the &quot;pays&quot;, or countryside; ultimately from the Latin , or outlying administrative district.

==Social position==
Peasants typically made up the majority of the agricultural labour force in a pre-industrial society. The majority of the people—according to one estimate 85% of the population—in the Middle Ages were peasants.

Though &quot;peasant&quot; is a word of loose application, once a market economy had taken root, the term &quot;peasant proprietors&quot; was frequently used to describe the traditional rural population in countries where smallholders farmed much of the land. More generally, the word &quot;peasant&quot; is sometimes used to refer pejoratively to those considered to be &quot;lower class&quot;, perhaps defined by poorer education and/or a lower income.

==Medieval European peasants==
The open field system of agriculture dominated most of Europe during medieval times and endured until the nineteenth century in many areas. Under this system, peasants lived on a manor presided over by a lord or a bishop of the church. Peasants paid rent or labor services to the lord in exchange for their right to cultivate the land. Fallowed land, pastures, forests, and wasteland were held in common. The open field system required cooperation among the peasants of the manor. It was gradually replaced by individual ownership and management of land.

The relative position of peasants in Western Europe improved greatly after the Black Death had reduced the population of medieval Europe in the mid-14th century, resulting in more land for the survivors and making labor more scarce. In the wake of this disruption to the established order, it became more productive for many laborers to demand wages and other alternative forms of compensation, which ultimately led to the development of widespread literacy and the enormous social and intellectual changes of the Enlightenment.

The evolution of ideas in an environment of relatively widespread literacy laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution, which enabled mechanically and chemically augmented agricultural production while simultaneously increasing the demand for factory workers in cities, who became what Karl Marx called the proletariat. The trend toward individual ownership of land, typified in England by Enclosure, displaced many peasants from the land and compelled them, often unwillingly, to become urban factory-workers, who came to occupy the socio-economic stratum formerly the preserve of the medieval peasants.

This process happened in an especially pronounced and truncated way in Eastern Europe. Lacking any catalysts for change in the 14th century, Eastern European peasants largely continued upon the original medieval path until the 18th and 19th centuries. Serfdom was abolished in Russia in 1861, and while many peasants would remain in areas where their family had farmed for generations, the changes did allow for the buying and selling of lands traditionally held by peasants, and for landless ex-peasants to move to the cities. Even before emancipation in 1861, serfdom was on the wane in Russia. The proportion of serfs within the empire had gradually decreased &quot;from 45–50 percent at the end of the eighteenth century, to 37.7 percent in 1858.&quot;

==Early modern Germany==
In Germany, peasants continued to center their lives in the village well into the 19th century. They belonged to a corporate body and helped to manage the community resources and to monitor community life. In the East they had the status of serfs bound permanently to parcels of land. A peasant is called a &quot;Bauer&quot; in German and &quot;Bur&quot; in Low German (pronounced in English like &quot;boor&quot;).

In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord—typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages&#x27; communal life centered on church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.

==France==
Information about the complexities of the French Revolution, especially the fast-changing scene in Paris, reached isolated areas through both official announcements and long-established oral networks. Peasants responded differently to different sources of information. The limits on political knowledge in these areas depended more on how much peasants chose to know than on bad roads or illiteracy. Historian Jill Maciak concludes that peasants &quot;were neither subservient, reactionary, nor ignorant.&quot;

In his seminal book &quot;Peasants into Frenchmen: the Modernization of Rural France, 1880–1914&quot; (1976), historian Eugen Weber traced the modernization of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He emphasized the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military-service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas. The book was widely praised, but some argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.

==Chinese farmers==


Farmers in China have been sometimes referred to as &quot;peasants&quot; in English-language sources. However, the traditional term for farmer, &quot;nongfu&quot; (), simply refers to &quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;agricultural worker&quot;. In the 19th century, Japanese intellectuals reinvented the Chinese terms &quot;fengjian&quot; () for &quot;feudalism&quot; and &quot;nongmin&quot; (), or &quot;farming people&quot;, terms used in the description of feudal Japanese society. These terms created a negative image of Chinese farmers by making a class distinction where one had not previously existed. Anthropologist Myron Cohen considers these terms to be neologisms that represented a cultural and political invention. He writes:

Writers in English mostly used the term &quot;farmers&quot; until the 1920s, when the term &quot;peasant&quot; came to predominate, implying that China was feudal, ready for revolution, like Europe before the French Revolution. This Western use of the term suggests that China is stagnant, &quot;medieval&quot;, underdeveloped, and held back by its rural population. Cohen writes that the &quot;imposition of the historically burdened Western contrasts of town and country, shopkeeper and peasant, or merchant and landlord, serves only to distort the realities of the Chinese economic tradition&quot;.

==Latin American farmers==
In Latin America, the term &quot;peasant&quot; is translated to &quot;Campesino&quot; (from campo—country person), but the meaning has changed over time. While most Campesinos before the 20th century were in equivalent status to peasants—they usually did not own land and had to make payments to or were in an employment position towards a landlord (the hacienda system), most Latin American countries saw one or more extensive land reforms in the 20th century. The land reforms of Latin America were more comprehensive initiatives that redistributed lands from large landholders to former peasants—farm workers and tenant farmers. Hence, many Campesinos in Latin America today are closer smallholders who own their land and do not pay rent to a landlord, rather than peasants who do not own land.

The Catholic Bishops of Paraguay have asserted that &quot;Every campesino has a natural right to possess a reasonable allotment of land where he can establish his home, work for [the] subsistence of his family and a secure life&quot;.

==Historiography==

In medieval Europe society was theorized as being organized into three estates: those who work, those who pray, and those who fight. The Annales School of 20th-century French historians emphasized the importance of peasants. Its leader Fernand Braudel devoted the first volume—called &quot;The Structures of Everyday Life&quot;—of his major work, &quot;Civilization and Capitalism 15th–18th Century&quot; to the largely silent and invisible world that existed below the market economy.

Other research in the field of peasant studies was promoted by Florian Znaniecki and Fei Xiaotong, and in the post-1945 studies of the &quot;great tradition&quot; and the &quot;little tradition&quot; in the work of Robert Redfield. In the 1960s, anthropologists and historians began to rethink the role of peasant revolt in world history and in their own disciplines. Peasant revolution was seen as a Third World response to capitalism and imperialism.

The anthropologist Eric Wolf, for instance, drew on the work of earlier scholars in the Marxist tradition such as Daniel Thorner, who saw the rural population as a key element in the transition from feudalism to capitalism. Wolf and a group of scholars criticized both Marx and the field of Modernization theorists for treating peasants as lacking the ability to take action. James C. Scott&#x27;s field observations in Malaysia convinced him that villagers were active participants in their local politics even though they were forced to use indirect methods. Many of these activist scholars looked back to the peasant movement in India and to the theories of the revolution in China led by Mao Zedong starting in the 1920s. The anthropologist Myron Cohen, however, asked why the rural population in China were called &quot;peasants&quot; rather than &quot;farmers&quot;, a distinction he called political rather than scientific. One important outlet for their scholarly work and theory was &quot;The Journal of Peasant Studies&quot;.

<text>Robert Towne (born Robert Bertram Schwartz; November 23, 1934 – July 1, 2024) was an American screenwriter and director. He started writing films for Roger Corman, including &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot; in 1964, and was later part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking.

Towne wrote and won the Academy Award-winning original screenplay for Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974); starring Jack Nicholson, widely considered one of the greatest screenplays ever written, as well as its sequel, &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; (1990). For Hal Ashby, he penned the comedy-dramas &quot;The Last Detail&quot; (1973) and &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975). He collaborated with Tom Cruise on the films &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993) and the first two installments of the &quot;&quot; franchise (1996, 2000).

Towne directed the sports dramas &quot;Personal Best&quot; (1982) and &quot;Without Limits&quot; (1998), the crime thriller &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (1988), and the romantic drama &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Towne was born Robert Bertram Schwartz in Los Angeles, California, the son of Helen and Lou Schwartz, a clothing store owner and property developer. He grew up in San Pedro and Rolling Hills and attended Chadwick School. His family was Jewish, and had emigrated from Romania on his father&#x27;s side and Russia on his mother&#x27;s. He had a younger brother, Roger, who co-wrote the 1984 film &quot;The Natural&quot; starring Robert Redford.

He graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, California, studying philosophy and literature. After college, Towne served in the U.S. Army before doing odd jobs including working as a tuna fisherman.

==Career==
===Roger Corman===
Towne originally sought work as a writer and actor. He took an acting class with Roger Corman taught by Jeff Corey where his classmates also included Jack Nicholson (with whom he shared an apartment), Irvin Kershner, and Sally Kellerman.

Corman was known for giving work to untested people of talent. Towne wrote the screenplay for the Corman-financed &quot;Last Woman on Earth&quot; (1960), in which Towne also played one of the lead roles.

The following year he also starred in the Corman-financed &quot;Creature from the Haunted Sea&quot; (1961).

===Television===
Towne started writing for television on such programs as &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;, &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;.

He also wrote a screenplay for the Corman-directed &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot; (1965). In 1981 Towne said &quot;I worked harder on... [that] screenplay for him than on anything I think I have ever done.&quot;

Towne went back to working in television when Corman hired him to write a script for a Western, which became &quot;A Time for Killing&quot; (1967). Corman left the project during filming and Towne took his name off the credits. Towne said later he &quot;hated&quot; the film.

===Script doctor===
Towne&#x27;s script for &quot;A Time for Killing&quot; had been read and admired by Warren Beatty, who asked Towne to help out on the script for &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). Towne later claimed his main contributions were removing the ménage à trois relationship between Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D., making some structural changes. Towne was on set during filming and continued to work during post-production. The film was a huge success and although Towne&#x27;s contribution was credited only as a &quot;special consultant&quot;, he began to earn a reputation in Hollywood as a top script doctor.

Towne was credited on &quot;Villa Rides&quot; (1968), which he later said he did as a favor for Robert Evans, head of Paramount. He hated the experience.

Towne did uncredited work on the scripts for &quot;Drive, He Said&quot; (1971), directed by Jack Nicholson; &quot;Cisco Pike&quot; (1972), which Towne said turned into &quot;a pretty good movie&quot; but where he got &quot;so angry with the director&quot; he took his name off; and &quot;The New Centurions&quot; (1972), where he was to share credit with Stirling Silliphant but asked for his name to be taken off after he saw the film.

He did uncredited work for Francis Ford Coppola during the making of &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), including the final scene between Michael and Vito in a garden, shortly before Vito dies. Coppola later thanked Towne for writing this pivotal and &quot;very beautiful&quot; scene in his Academy Award speech for Best Screenplay.

Towne also did some work on &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974) at the behest of star Warren Beatty.

===&quot;The Last Detail&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and &quot;Shampoo&quot;===
Towne received acclaim and was nominated in the Best Original and Adapted Screenplay categories for his scripts &quot;The Last Detail&quot; (1973), &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), and &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975).
He won for &quot;Chinatown&quot;. He later said it was inspired by a chapter in Carey McWilliams&#x27;s &quot;Southern California Country: An Island on the Land&quot; (1946) and a &quot;West&quot; magazine article on Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Los Angeles.

According to Sam Wasson&#x27;s &quot;The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood&quot;, Towne &quot;secretly employed an old college friend named Edward Taylor as his uncredited writing partner for more than 40 years.&quot; (Taylor died in 2013).

Towne was credited for his work on &quot;The Yakuza&quot; (1975) and did script doctoring on &quot;The Missouri Breaks&quot; (1976), &quot;Orca&quot; (1977) and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978).

===Director===
Towne turned to directing with &quot;Personal Best&quot; (1982). He also wrote the script for &quot;&quot;, hoping to direct, but &quot;Personal Best&quot; was a financial failure, and he had to sell the &quot;Greystoke&quot; script. He grew dissatisfied with the production and credited his dog, P. H. Vazak, with the script. Vazak became the first dog nominated for an Academy Award for screenwriting.

Towne did uncredited work on &quot;Deal of the Century&quot; (1983), &quot;8 Million Ways to Die&quot; (1986) (), &quot;Tough Guys Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1987) and &quot;Frantic&quot; (1988).

His second feature film as director was &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (1988), which he wrote back in the early 1980s. Towne told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; is &quot;a movie about the use and abuse of friendship.&quot;

===&quot;The Two Jakes&quot;===
Towne expressed his disappointment in &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; in many interviews. He told writer Alex Simon, &quot;In the interest of maintaining my friendships with Jack Nicholson and Robert Evans, I’d rather not go into it, but let’s just say &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; wasn’t a pleasant experience for any of us. But, we’re all still friends, and that’s what matters most.&quot;

In a November 5, 2007, interview with MTV, Jack Nicholson claimed that Towne had written the part of Gittes specifically for him and had conceived &quot;Chinatown&quot; as a trilogy, with the third film set in 1968 and dealing in some way with Howard Hughes. Towne said he did not know how the rumour started and denied any planned trilogy.

===Tom Cruise===
Towne wrote the script for &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990) and formed a close friendship with its star Tom Cruise.

He was one of the writers on Cruise&#x27;s &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), then Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994). Cruise brought him on to &quot;&quot; (1996) and co-produced Towne&#x27;s third film as director, &quot;Without Limits&quot; (1998). He also co-wrote &quot;Mission Impossible II&quot; (2000) for Cruise.

===Later career===
A project Towne had long sought to bring to the screen came to fruition in 2006 with &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, a romantic period piece set in Los Angeles based on the novel by John Fante and starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek. Towne had found the novel decades earlier during his research for &quot;Chinatown&quot;, as he was looking for authentic descriptions of 1930s Los Angeles. He enjoyed the book, considering it &quot;the best book about Los Angeles ever written&quot;, and arranged a meeting with Fante, himself a screenwriter. As a result of that meeting, Towne was granted the screen rights to the novel. The rights eventually lapsed, and the new owner was Mel Brooks. In 1993, Towne wrote the script for free in exchange for the chance to direct the film. Tom Cruise (with Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions) served as one of the film&#x27;s producers. &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; received mixed reviews and failed at the box office. The film was entered into the 28th Moscow International Film Festival.

Towne framed several of his signature films as elaborate melodramas. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;I think melodrama is always a splendid occasion to entertain an audience and say things you want to say without rubbing their noses in it. With melodrama, as in dreams, you&#x27;re always flirting with the disparity between appearance and reality, which is a great deal of fun. And that&#x27;s also not unrelated to my perception of my life working in Hollywood, where you&#x27;re always wondering, &#x27;What does that guy really mean?&#x27;&quot;

In 2006, Towne was the subject of artist Sarah Morris&#x27;s film, &quot;Robert Towne&quot;. Morris describes him as an “elliptical figure” whose career exemplifies a certain characteristic mode of working in the film industry, marked by collaboration, shared or changing roles. Morris&#x27;s painting installation in the entryway to the Lever House in Manhattan, commissioned by the Public Art Fund, was also titled &quot;Robert Towne&quot;.

In the 2010s, Towne returned to television, working as a consulting producer on &quot;Mad Men&quot; and writing two episodes of &quot;Welcome to the Basement&quot;.

In 2019, Towne began co-writing, with David Fincher, a Netflix-exclusive prequel television series based on &quot;Chinatown&quot; character J. J. Gittes, with Fincher serving as showrunner. By June 2024, a week before his death, Towne confirmed that the script for each episode had been completed.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Towne met actress Julie Payne; they were married from 1977 to 1982. According to Sam Wasson&#x27;s &quot;The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood&quot;, Towne was addicted to cocaine during this period and was occasionally violent, which led to a bitter divorce and custody battle over their daughter Katharine (born 1978).

In 1984, Towne married Luisa Gaule. They had one daughter, Chiara.

He was the former son-in-law of late actor John Payne and actress Anne Shirley. Through his daughter Katharine, he was former father-in-law of actor Charlie Hunnam.

Towne died at his home in Los Angeles on July 1, 2024, at the age of 89.

<doc id="68284" wikidata="Q269100" url="?curid=68284" title="Chop suey">
<text>Chop suey (usually pronounced ) is a dish from American Chinese cuisine and other forms of overseas Chinese cuisine, generally consisting of meat (usually chicken, pork, beef, shrimp or fish) and eggs, cooked quickly with vegetables such as bean sprouts, cabbage, and celery, and bound in a starch-thickened sauce. It is typically served with rice, but can become the Chinese-American form of chow mein with the substitution of stir-fried noodles for rice.

Chop suey has become a prominent part of American Chinese cuisine, British Chinese cuisine, Filipino Chinese cuisine, Canadian Chinese cuisine, Thai Chinese cuisine, Indian Chinese cuisine, and Polynesian cuisine. In Chinese Indonesian cuisine it is known as &quot;cap cai&quot; (tjap tjoi) (雜菜, &quot;mixed vegetables&quot;) and mainly consists of vegetables.

==Origins==
Chop suey is widely believed to have been developed in the U.S. by Chinese Americans. However, the anthropologist E. N. Anderson traces the dish to &quot;tsap seui&quot; (杂碎, &quot;miscellaneous leftovers&quot;), common in Taishan, Guangdong (Toisan) the home of many early Chinese immigrants to the United States. Hong Kong doctor Li Shu-fan likewise reported that he knew it in Toisan in the 1890s.

The long list of conflicting stories about the origin of chop suey is, in the words of food historian Alan Davidson, &quot;a prime example of culinary mythology&quot; and typical of popular foods.

One account claims that it was invented by Chinese American cooks working on the transcontinental railroad in the 19th century. Another tale is that it was created during Qing dynasty premier Li Hongzhang&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1896 by his chef, who tried to create a meal suitable for both Chinese and American palates. Another story is that Li wandered to a local Chinese restaurant after the hotel kitchen had closed, where the chef, embarrassed that he had nothing ready to offer, came up with the new dish using scraps of leftovers. Yet recent research by the scholar Renqiu Yu led him to conclude that &quot;no evidence can be found in available historical records to support the story that Li Hung Chang [Li Hongzhang] ate chop suey in the United States.&quot; Li brought three Chinese chefs with him, and would not have needed to eat in local restaurants or invent new dishes in any case. Yu speculates that shrewd Chinese American restaurant owners took advantage of the publicity surrounding his visit to promote chop suey as Li&#x27;s favorite.

Another myth is that, in the 1860s, a Chinese restaurant cook in San Francisco was forced to serve something to drunken miners after hours, when he had no fresh food. To avoid a beating, the cook threw leftover meat and vegetables into a wok and served it to the miners, who loved it and asked what dish it was—he replied &quot;chopped sui&quot;. There is no good evidence for any of these stories.

Chop suey appears in an 1884 article in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, by Wong Chin Foo, &quot;Chinese Cooking&quot;, in which he says it &quot;may justly be so-called the &#x27;national dish of China&#x27;.&quot; In 1888 Wong wrote that a &quot;staple dish for the Chinese gourmand is chow chop svey , a mixture of chickens&#x27; livers and gizzards, fungi, bamboo buds, pigs&#x27; tripe, and bean sprouts stewed with spices.&quot; An 1896 newspaper report states: &quot;Chow chop suey is a sort of stew made of chicken&#x27;s livers and gizzards, calves&#x27; tripe, bean sprouts, celery and &#x27;meu&#x27;, which is a sort of Chinese first cousin to macaroni&quot;. An article in &quot;The Illustrated American&quot; on Chinese cuisine in 1897, reproduces a menu from Ma Hung Low&#x27;s restaurant on Mott Street in New York&#x27;s Chinatown quarter which includes the dish &quot;Beef Chop Suey with Bean Sprouts, Water Chestnuts and Boiled Rice.&quot; The dish itself, referred to as &quot;the standard Chinese dish of chop suey,&quot; is described as &quot;a stew of beef, chicken, or pork, with bean sprouts, mushrooms, water-lily roots, sprouted grain and unknown flavorings.&quot; In 1898, it is described as &quot;A Hash of Pork, with Celery, Onions, Bean Sprouts, etc.&quot;

During his travels in the United States, Liang Qichao, a Guangdong (Canton) native, wrote in 1903 that there existed in the United States a food item called &quot;chop suey&quot; which was popularly served by Chinese restaurateurs, but which local Chinese people do not eat, because the cooking technique is &quot;really awful&quot;.

In earlier periods of Chinese history, &quot;chop suey&quot; or &quot;chap sui&quot; in Cantonese, and &quot;za sui&quot;, in Mandarin, has different meanings of cooked animal offal or entrails. For example, in the classic novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (circa 1590), Sun Wukong tells a lion-monster in chapter 75: &quot;When I passed through Guangzhou, I bought a pot for cooking &quot;za sui&quot; – so I&#x27;ll savor your liver, entrails, and lungs.&quot; The term &quot;za sui&quot; (杂碎) is found in newer Chinese-English dictionaries with both meanings listed: cooked entrails, and &quot;chop suey&quot; in the Western sense.

<text>The Viet Cong (VC) was an epithet and umbrella term to refer to the communist-driven armed movement and united front organization in South Vietnam. It was formally organized as and led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and conducted military operations under the name of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV). The movement fought under the direction of North Vietnam against the South Vietnamese and United States governments during the Vietnam War. The organization had both guerrilla and regular army units, as well as a network of cadres who organized and mobilized peasants in the territory the VC controlled. During the war, communist fighters and some anti-war activists claimed that the VC was an insurgency indigenous to the South that represented the legitimate rights of people in South Vietnam, while the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments portrayed the group as a tool of North Vietnam. It was later conceded by the modern Vietnamese communist leadership that the movement was actually under the North Vietnamese political and military leadership, aiming to unify Vietnam under a single banner.

North Vietnam established the NLF on December 20, 1960, at Tân Lập village in Tây Ninh Province to foment insurgency in the South. Many of the VC&#x27;s core members were volunteer &quot;regroupees&quot;, southern Viet Minh who had resettled in the North after the Geneva Accord (1954). Hanoi gave the regroupees military training and sent them back to the South along the Ho Chi Minh trail in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The VC called for the unification of Vietnam and the overthrow of the American-backed South Vietnamese government. The VC&#x27;s best-known action was the Tet Offensive, an assault on more than 100 South Vietnamese urban centers in 1968, including an attack on the U.S. embassy in Saigon. The offensive riveted the attention of the world&#x27;s media for weeks, but also overextended the VC. Later communist offensives were conducted predominantly by the North Vietnamese. The organization officially merged with the Fatherland Front of Vietnam on February 4, 1977, after North and South Vietnam were officially unified under a communist government.

== Names ==
The term &quot;Việt Cộng&quot; appeared in Saigon newspapers beginning in 1956. It is a contraction of (Vietnamese communist). The earliest citation for &quot;Viet Cong&quot; in English is from 1957. American soldiers referred to the Viet Cong as Victor Charlie or VC. &quot;Victor&quot; and &quot;Charlie&quot; are both letters in the NATO phonetic alphabet. &quot;Charlie&quot; referred to communist forces in general, both VC and North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN).

The official Vietnamese history gives the group&#x27;s name as the Liberation Army of South Vietnam or the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLFSV; ). Many writers shorten this to National Liberation Front (NLF). In 1969, the NLF created the &quot;Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam&quot; (&quot;Chính Phủ Cách Mạng Lâm Thời Cộng Hòa Miền Nam Việt Nam&quot;), abbreviated PRG. Although the NLF was not officially abolished until 1977, the NLF no longer used the name after the PRG was created. Members generally referred to the NLF as &quot;the Front&quot; (&quot;Mặt trận&quot;). Today&#x27;s Vietnamese media most frequently refers to the group as the &quot;Liberation Army of South Vietnam&quot; (&quot;Quân Giải phóng Miền Nam Việt Nam&quot;) .

==History==

===Origin===
By the terms of the Geneva Accord (1954), which ended the Indochina War, France and the Viet Minh agreed to a truce and to a separation of forces. The Viet Minh had become the government of North Vietnam, and military forces of the communists regrouped there. Military forces of the non-communists regrouped in South Vietnam, which became a separate state. Elections on reunification were scheduled for July 1956. A divided Vietnam angered Vietnamese nationalists, but it made the country less of a threat to China. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai negotiated the terms of the ceasefire with France and then imposed them on the Viet Minh.

About 90,000 Viet Minh were evacuated to the North while 5,000 to 10,000 cadre remained in the South, most of them with orders to refocus on political activity and agitation. The Saigon-Cholon Peace Committee, the first VC front, was founded in 1954 to provide leadership for this group. Other front names used by the VC in the 1950s implied that members were fighting for religious causes, for example, &quot;Executive Committee of the Fatherland Front&quot;, which suggested affiliation with the Hòa Hảo sect, or &quot;Vietnam-Cambodia Buddhist Association&quot;. Front groups were favored by the VC to such an extent that its real leadership remained shadowy until long after the war was over, prompting the expression &quot;the faceless Viet Cong&quot;.

Led by Ngô Đình Diệm, South Vietnam refused to sign the Geneva Accord. Arguing that a free election was impossible under the conditions that existed in communist-held territory, Diệm announced in July 1955 that the scheduled election on reunification would not be held. After subduing the Bình Xuyên organized crime gang in the Battle for Saigon in 1955, and the Hòa Hảo and other militant religious sects in early 1956, Diệm turned his attention to the VC. Within a few months, the Viet Cong had been driven into remote swamps. The success of this campaign inspired U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower to dub Diệm the &quot;miracle man&quot; when he visited the U.S. in May 1957. France withdrew its last soldiers from Vietnam in April 1956.

In March 1956, southern communist leader Lê Duẩn presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled &quot;The Road to the South&quot; to the other members of the Politburo in Hanoi. He argued adamantly that war with the United States was necessary to achieve unification. But as China and the Soviets both opposed confrontation at this time, Lê Duẩn&#x27;s plan was rejected and communists in the South were ordered to limit themselves to economic struggle. Leadership divided into a &quot;North first&quot;, or pro-Beijing, faction led by Trường Chinh, and a &quot;South first&quot; faction led by Lê Duẩn.

As the Sino-Soviet split widened in the following months, Hanoi began to play the two communist giants off against each other. The North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive the southern insurgency in December 1956. Lê Duẩn&#x27;s blueprint for revolution in the South was approved in principle, but implementation was conditional on winning international support and on modernizing the army, which was expected to take at least until 1959. President Hồ Chí Minh stressed that violence was still a last resort. Nguyễn Hữu Xuyên was assigned military command in the South, replacing Lê Duẩn, who was appointed North Vietnam&#x27;s acting party boss. This represented a loss of power for Hồ, who preferred the more moderate Võ Nguyên Giáp, who was defense minister.

An assassination campaign, referred to as &quot;extermination of traitors&quot; or &quot;armed propaganda&quot; in communist literature, began in April 1957. Tales of sensational murder and mayhem soon crowded the headlines. Seventeen civilians were killed by machine gun fire at a bar in Châu Đốc in July and in September a district chief was killed with his entire family on a main highway in broad daylight. In October 1957, a series of bombs exploded in Saigon and left 13 Americans wounded.

In a speech given on September 2, 1957, Hồ reiterated the &quot;North first&quot; line of economic struggle. The launch of Sputnik in October boosted Soviet confidence and led to a reassessment of policy regarding Indochina, long treated as a Chinese sphere of influence. In November, Hồ traveled to Moscow with Lê Duẩn and gained approval for a more militant line. In early 1958, Lê Duẩn met with the leaders of &quot;Inter-zone V&quot; (northern South Vietnam) and ordered the establishment of patrols and safe areas to provide logistical support for activity in the Mekong Delta and in urban areas. In June 1958, the VC created a command structure for the eastern Mekong Delta. French scholar Bernard Fall published an influential article in July 1958 which analyzed the pattern of rising violence and concluded that a new war had begun.

===Launches armed struggle===
The Communist Party of Vietnam approved a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; on the South at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. In May 1959, Group 559 was established to maintain and upgrade the Ho Chi Minh trail, at this time a six-month mountain trek through Laos. About 500 of the &quot;regroupees&quot; of 1954 were sent south on the trail during its first year of operation. The first arms delivery via the trail, a few dozen rifles, was completed in August 1959.

Two regional command centers were merged to create the Central Office for South Vietnam (&quot;Trung ương Cục miền Nam&quot;), a unified communist party headquarters for the South. COSVN was initially located in Tây Ninh Province near the Cambodian border. On July 8, the VC killed two U.S. military advisors at Biên Hòa, the first American dead of the Vietnam War. The &quot;2d Liberation Battalion&quot; ambushed two companies of South Vietnamese soldiers in September 1959, the first large unit military action of the war. This was considered the beginning of the &quot;armed struggle&quot; in communist accounts. A series of uprisings beginning in the Mekong Delta province of Bến Tre in January 1960 created &quot;liberated zones&quot;, models of VC-style government. Propagandists celebrated their creation of battalions of &quot;long-hair troops&quot; (women). The fiery declarations of 1959 were followed by a lull while Hanoi focused on events in Laos (1960–61). Moscow favored reducing international tensions in 1960, as it was election year for the U.S. presidency. Despite this, 1960 was a year of unrest in South Vietnam, with pro-democracy demonstrations inspired by the South Korean student uprising that year and a failed military coup in November.

To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the VC was stressed in communist propaganda. The VC created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 at Tân Lập village in Tây Ninh as a &quot;united front&quot;, or political branch intended to encourage the participation of non-communists. The group&#x27;s formation was announced by Radio Hanoi and its ten-point manifesto called for, &quot;overthrow the disguised colonial regime of the imperialists and the dictatorial administration, and to form a national and democratic coalition administration.&quot; Thọ, a lawyer and the VC&#x27;s &quot;neutralist&quot; chairman, was an isolated figure among cadres and soldiers. South Vietnam&#x27;s Law 10/59, approved in May 1959, authorized the death penalty for crimes &quot;against the security of the state&quot; and featured prominently in VC propaganda. Violence between the VC and government forces soon increased drastically from 180 clashes in January 1960 to 545 clashes in September.

By 1960, the Sino-Soviet split was a public rivalry, making China more supportive of Hanoi&#x27;s war effort. For Chinese leader Mao Zedong, aid to North Vietnam was a way to enhance his &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; credentials for both domestic and international audiences. About 40,000 communist soldiers infiltrated the South in 1961–63. The VC grew rapidly; an estimated 300,000 members were enrolled in &quot;liberation associations&quot; (affiliated groups) by early 1962. The ratio of VC to government soldiers jumped from 1:10 in 1961 to 1:5 a year later.

The level of violence in the South jumped dramatically in the fall of 1961, from 50 guerrilla attacks in September to 150 in October. U.S. President John F. Kennedy decided in November 1961 to substantially increase American military aid to South Vietnam. The arrived in Saigon with 35 helicopters in December 1961. By mid-1962, there were 12,000 U.S. military advisors in Vietnam. The &quot;special war&quot; and &quot;strategic hamlets&quot; policies allowed Saigon to push back in 1962, but in 1963 the VC regained the military initiative. The VC won its first military victory against South Vietnamese forces at Ấp Bắc in January 1963.

A landmark party meeting was held in December 1963, shortly after a military coup in Saigon in which Diệm was assassinated. North Vietnamese leaders debated the issue of &quot;quick victory&quot; vs &quot;protracted war&quot; (guerrilla warfare). After this meeting, the communist side geared up for a maximum military effort and the troop strength of the PAVN increased from 174,000 at the end of 1963 to 300,000 in 1964. The Soviets cut aid in 1964 as an expression of annoyance with Hanoi&#x27;s ties to China. Even as Hanoi embraced China&#x27;s international line, it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on technical specialists and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization. The winter of 1964–1965 was a high-water mark for the VC, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse. Soviet aid soared following a visit to Hanoi by Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in February 1965. Hanoi was soon receiving up-to-date surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. would have 200,000 soldiers in South Vietnam by the end of the year.

In January 1966, Australian troops uncovered a tunnel complex that had been used by COSVN. Six thousand documents were captured, revealing the inner workings of the VC. COSVN retreated to Mimot in Cambodia. As a result of an agreement with the Cambodian government made in 1966, weapons for the Viet Cong were shipped to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville and then trucked to VC bases near the border along the &quot;Sihanouk Trail&quot;, which replaced the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Many VC units operated at night, and employed terror as a standard tactic. Rice procured at gunpoint sustained the Viet Cong. Squads were assigned monthly assassination quotas. Government employees, especially village and district heads, were the most common targets. But there were a wide variety of targets, including clinics and medical personnel. Notable VC atrocities include the massacre of over 3,000 unarmed civilians at Huế, 48 killed in the bombing of My Canh floating restaurant in Saigon in June 1965 and a massacre of 252 Montagnards in the village of Đắk Sơn in December 1967 using flamethrowers. VC death squads assassinated at least 37,000 civilians in South Vietnam; the real figure was far higher since the data mostly cover 1967–72. They also waged a mass murder campaign against civilian hamlets and refugee camps; in the peak war years, nearly a third of all civilian deaths were the result of VC atrocities. Ami Pedahzur has written that &quot;the overall volume and lethality of Vietcong terrorism rivals or exceeds all but a handful of terrorist campaigns waged over the last third of the twentieth century&quot;.
===Logistics and equipment===

===Tet Offensive===
Major reversals in 1966 and 1967, as well as the growing American presence in Vietnam, inspired Hanoi to consult its allies and reassess strategy in April 1967. While Beijing urged a fight to the finish, Moscow suggested a negotiated settlement. Convinced that 1968 could be the last chance for decisive victory, General Nguyễn Chí Thanh, suggested an all-out offensive against urban centers. He submitted a plan to Hanoi in May 1967. After Thanh&#x27;s death in July, Giáp was assigned to implement this plan, now known as the Tet Offensive. The Parrot&#x27;s Beak, an area in Cambodia only from Saigon, was prepared as a base of operations. Funeral processions were used to smuggle weapons into Saigon. VC entered the cities concealed among civilians returning home for Tết. The U.S. and South Vietnamese expected that an announced seven-day truce would be observed during Vietnam&#x27;s main holiday.
At this point, there were about 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, as well as 900,000 allied forces. General William Westmoreland, the U.S. commander, received reports of heavy troop movements and understood that an offensive was being planned, but his attention was focused on Khe Sanh, a remote U.S. base near the DMZ. In January and February 1968, some 80,000 VC struck more than 100 towns with orders to &quot;crack the sky&quot; and &quot;shake the Earth.&quot; The offensive included a commando raid on the U.S. Embassy in Saigon and the massacre at Huế of about 3,500 residents. House-to-house fighting between VC and South Vietnamese Rangers left much of Cholon, a section of Saigon, in ruins. The VC used any available tactic to demoralize and intimidate the population, including the assassination of South Vietnamese commanders. A photo by Eddie Adams showing the summary execution of a VC in Saigon on February 1 became a symbol of the brutality of the war. In an influential broadcast on February 27, newsman Walter Cronkite stated that the war was a &quot;stalemate&quot; and could be ended only by negotiation.

The offensive was undertaken in the hope of triggering a general uprising, but urban Vietnamese did not respond as the VC anticipated. About 75,000 VC/PAVN soldiers were killed or wounded, according to Trần Văn Trà, commander of the &quot;B-2&quot; district, which consisted of southern South Vietnam. &quot;We did not base ourselves on scientific calculation or a careful weighing of all factors, but...on an illusion based on our subjective desires&quot;, Trà concluded. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Tet resulted in 40,000 communist dead (compared to about 10,600 U.S. and South Vietnamese dead). &quot;It is a major irony of the Vietnam War that our propaganda transformed this debacle into a brilliant victory. The truth was that Tet cost us half our forces. Our losses were so immense that we were unable to replace them with new recruits&quot;, said PRG Justice Minister Trương Như Tảng. Tet had a profound psychological impact because South Vietnamese cities were otherwise safe areas during the war. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Westmoreland argued that panicky news coverage gave the public the unfair perception that America had been defeated.

Aside from some districts in the Mekong Delta, the VC failed to create a governing apparatus in South Vietnam following Tet, according to an assessment of captured documents by the U.S. CIA. The breakup of larger VC units increased the effectiveness of the CIA&#x27;s Phoenix Program (1968–72), which targeted individual leaders, as well as the Chiêu Hồi Program, which encouraged defections. By the end of 1969, there was little communist-held territory, or &quot;liberated zones&quot;, in the rural lowlands of Cochin China, according to the official communist military history. The US military believed that 70 percent of communist main-force combat troops in the South were northerners, but most communist military personnel were not main-force combat troops. Even in early 1970, MACV estimated that northerners made up no more than 45 percent of communist military forces overall in South Vietnam.

The VC created an urban front in 1968 called the Alliance of National, Democratic, and Peace Forces. The group&#x27;s manifesto called for an independent, non-aligned South Vietnam and stated that &quot;national reunification cannot be achieved overnight.&quot; In June 1969, the alliance merged with the VC to form a &quot;Provisional Revolutionary Government&quot; (PRG).

===Vietnamization===
The Tet Offensive increased American public discontent with participation in the Vietnam War and led the U.S. to gradually withdraw combat forces and to shift responsibility to the South Vietnamese, a process called Vietnamization. Pushed into Cambodia, the VC could no longer draw South Vietnamese recruits. In May 1968, Trường Chinh urged &quot;protracted war&quot; in a speech that was published prominently in the official media, so the fortunes of his &quot;North first&quot; faction may have revived at this time. COSVN rejected this view as &quot;lacking resolution and absolute determination.&quot; The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 led to intense Sino-Soviet tension and to the withdrawal of Chinese forces from North Vietnam. Beginning in February 1970, Lê Duẩn&#x27;s prominence in the official media increased, suggesting that he was again top leader and had regained the upper hand in his longstanding rivalry with Trường Chinh. After the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk in March 1970, the VC faced a hostile Cambodian government which authorized a U.S. offensive against its bases in April. However, the capture of the Plain of Jars and other territory in Laos, as well as five provinces in northeastern Cambodia, allowed the North Vietnamese to reopen the Ho Chi Minh trail. Although 1970 was a much better year for the VC than 1969, it would never again be more than an adjunct to the PAVN. The 1972 Easter Offensive was a direct North Vietnamese attack across the DMZ. Despite the Paris Peace Accords, signed by all parties in January 1973, fighting continued. In March, Trà was recalled to Hanoi for a series of meetings to hammer out a plan for an enormous offensive against Saigon.

===Fall of Saigon===

In response to the anti-war movement, the U.S. Congress passed the Case–Church Amendment to prohibit further U.S. military intervention in Vietnam in June 1973 and reduced aid to South Vietnam in August 1974. With U.S. bombing ended, communist logistical preparations could be accelerated. An oil pipeline was built from North Vietnam to VC headquarters in Lộc Ninh, about northwest of Saigon. (COSVN was moved back to South Vietnam following the Easter Offensive.) The Ho Chi Minh Trail, beginning as a series of treacherous mountain tracks at the start of the war, was upgraded throughout the war, first into a road network driveable by trucks in the dry season, and finally, into paved, all-weather roads that could be used year-round, even during the monsoon. Between the beginning of 1974 and April 1975, with now-excellent roads and no fear of air interdiction, the North delivered nearly 365,000 tons of war matériel to battlefields, 2.6 times the total for the previous 13 years.

The success of the 1973–74 dry season offensive convinced Hanoi to accelerate its timetable. When there was no U.S. response to a successful PAVN attack on Phước Bình in January 1975, South Vietnamese morale collapsed. The next major battle, at Buôn Ma Thuột in March, was a walkover. After the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the PRG moved into government offices there. At the victory parade, Tạng noticed that the units formerly dominated by southerners were missing, replaced by northerners years earlier. The bureaucracy of the Republic of Vietnam was uprooted and authority over the South was assigned to the PAVN. People considered tainted by association with the former South Vietnamese government were sent to re-education camps, despite the protests of the non-communist PRG members including Tạng. Without consulting the PRG, North Vietnamese leaders decided to rapidly dissolve the PRG at a party meeting in August 1975. North and South were merged as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in July 1976 and the PRG was dissolved. The VC was merged with the Vietnamese Fatherland Front on February 4, 1977.

==Relationship with North Vietnam==
Activists opposing American involvement in Vietnam said that the VC was a nationalist insurgency indigenous to the South. They said that the VC was composed of several parties—the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, the Democratic Party and the Radical Socialist Party—and that VC chairman Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was not a communist.

Anti-communists countered that the VC was merely a front for Hanoi. They said some statements issued by communist leaders in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that southern communist forces were influenced by Hanoi. According to the memoirs of Trà, the VC&#x27;s top commander and PRG defense minister, he followed orders issued by the &quot;Military Commission of the Party Central Committee&quot; in Hanoi, which in turn implemented resolutions of the Politburo. Trà himself was deputy chief of staff for the PAVN before being assigned to the South. The official Vietnamese history of the war states that &quot;The Liberation Army of South Vietnam [Viet Cong] is a part of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam&quot;.

<text>The My Lai massacre ( ; ) was a United States war crime committed on 16 March 1968, involving the mass murder of unarmed civilians in Sơn Mỹ village, Quảng Ngãi province, South Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. At least 347 and up to 504 civilians, almost all women, children, and elderly men, were murdered by U.S. Army soldiers from C Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade and B Company, 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade of the 23rd (Americal) Division (organized as part of Task Force Barker). Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies mutilated, and some soldiers mutilated and raped children as young as 12. The incident was the largest massacre of civilians by U.S. forces in the 20th century.

On the morning of the massacre, C Company, commanded by Captain Ernest Medina, was sent into one of the village&#x27;s hamlets (marked on maps as My Lai 4) expecting to engage the Viet Cong&#x27;s Local Force 48th Battalion, which was not present. The killing began while the troops were searching the village for guerillas, and continued after they realized that no guerillas seemed to be present. Villagers were gathered together, held in the open, then murdered with automatic weapons, bayonets, and hand grenades; one large group of villagers was shot in an irrigation ditch. Soldiers also burned down homes and killed livestock. Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr. and his helicopter crew are credited with attempting to stop the massacre. On the same day, B Company massacred an additional 60 to 155 people in the nearby hamlet of My Khe 4.

The massacre was originally reported as a battle against Viet Cong troops, and was covered up in initial investigations by the U.S. Army. The efforts of veteran Ronald Ridenhour and journalist Seymour Hersh broke the news of the massacre to the American public in November 1969, prompting global outrage and contributing to domestic opposition to involvement in the war. Twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offenses, but only Lieutenant William Calley Jr., the leader of 1st Platoon in C Company, was convicted. He was found guilty of murdering 22 villagers and originally given a life sentence, but served three-and-a-half years under house arrest after U.S. president Richard Nixon commuted his sentence.

==Operation==

Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division, arrived in South Vietnam in December 1967. Though their first three months in Vietnam passed without any direct contact with People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam or Viet Cong (VC) forces, by mid-March the company had suffered 28 casualties involving mines or booby-traps.

During the Tet Offensive in January 1968, attacks were carried out in Quảng Ngãi by the VC 48th Local Force Battalion. U.S. military intelligence assumed that the 48th Battalion, having retreated and dispersed, was taking refuge in the village of Sơn Mỹ, in Quảng Ngãi province. A number of specific hamlets within that village – designated Mỹ Lai (1) through Mỹ Lai (6) – were suspected of harboring the 48th. Sơn Mỹ was located southwest of the Batangan Peninsula, a VC stronghold throughout the war.

In February and March 1968, the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) was aggressively trying to regain the strategic initiative in South Vietnam after the Tet Offensive, and the search-and-destroy operation against the 48th Battalion thought to be located in Sơn Mỹ became a small part of the U.S. military&#x27;s overall strategy. Task Force Barker (TF Barker), a battalion-sized ad hoc unit of 11th Brigade, was to be deployed for the operation. It was formed in January 1968, composed of three rifle companies of the 11th Brigade, including Charlie Company, led by Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Frank A. Barker. Sơn Mỹ village was included in the area of operations of TF Barker. The area of operations (AO) was codenamed Muscatine AO, after Muscatine County, Iowa, the home county of the 23rd Division&#x27;s commander, Major General Samuel W. Koster.

In February 1968, TF Barker had already tried to secure Sơn Mỹ, with limited success. After that, the village area began to be referred to as &quot;Pinkville&quot; by TF Barker troops. The U.S. Army slang name for the hamlets and sub-hamlets in that area was &quot;Pinkville&quot;, due to the reddish-pink color used on military maps to denote a more densely populated area, and the carnage was initially referred to as the Pinkville Massacre.

On 16–18 March, TF Barker planned to engage and destroy the remnants of the 48th Battalion, allegedly hiding in the Sơn Mỹ village area. Before the engagement, Colonel Oran K. Henderson, the 11th Brigade commander, urged his officers to &quot;go in there aggressively, close with the enemy and wipe them out for good&quot;. In turn, LTC Barker reportedly ordered the 1st Battalion commanders to burn the houses, kill the livestock, destroy food supplies, and destroy or poison the wells.

On the eve of the attack, at the Charlie Company briefing, Captain Ernest Medina told his men that nearly all the civilian residents of the hamlets in Sơn Mỹ village would have left for the market by 07:00, and that any who remained would most likely be VC or VC sympathizers. He was asked whether the order included the killing of women and children. Those present later gave differing accounts of Medina&#x27;s response. Some, including platoon leaders, testified that the orders, as they understood them, were to kill all VC and North Vietnamese combatants and &quot;suspects&quot; (including women and children, as well as all animals), to burn the village, and pollute the wells. He was quoted as saying, &quot;They&#x27;re all VC, now go and get them&quot;, and was heard to reply to the question &quot;Who is my enemy?&quot;, by saying, &quot;Anybody that was running from us, hiding from us, or appeared to be the enemy. If a man was running, shoot him, sometimes even if a woman with a rifle was running, shoot her.&quot;

At Calley&#x27;s trial, one defense witness testified that he remembered Medina instructing to destroy everything in the village that was &quot;walking, crawling or growling&quot;.

Charlie Company was to enter the village of Sơn Mỹ spearheaded by 1st Platoon, engage the enemy, and flush them out. The other two companies from TF Barker were ordered to secure the area and provide support if needed. The area was designated a free fire zone, where American forces were allowed to deploy artillery and air strikes in populated areas, without consideration of risk to civilian or non-combatant lives. Varnado Simpson, a rifleman in Charlie Company, said, &quot;We were told to leave nothing standing. We did what we were told, regardless of whether they were civilians.&quot;

===Killings===
On the morning of 16 March at 07:30, around 100 soldiers from Charlie Company led by Medina, following a short artillery and helicopter gunship barrage, landed in helicopters at Sơn Mỹ, a patchwork of individual homesteads, grouped settlements, rice paddies, irrigation ditches, dikes, and dirt roads, connecting an assortment of hamlets and sub-hamlets. The largest among them were the hamlets Mỹ Lai, Cổ Lũy, Mỹ Khê, and Tu Cung.

The GIs expected to engage the Vietcong Local Force 48th Battalion, which was one of the Vietcong&#x27;s most successful units. Although the GIs were not fired upon after landing, they still suspected there were VC guerrillas hiding underground or in the huts. Confirming their suspicions, the gunships engaged several armed enemies in the vicinity of Mỹ Lai, killing four; later, one weapon was retrieved from the site.

According to the operational plan, 1st Platoon, led by Second Lieutenant (2LT) William Calley, and 2nd Platoon, led by 2LT Stephen Brooks, entered the hamlet of Tu Cung in line formation at 08:00, while the 3rd Platoon, commanded by 2LT Jeffrey U. Lacross, and Captain Medina&#x27;s command post remained outside. On approach, both platoons fired at people they saw in the rice fields and in the brush.

Instead of the expected enemy, the GIs found women, children and old men, many of whom were cooking breakfast over outdoor fires. The villagers were getting ready for a market day and at first did not panic or run away as they were herded into the hamlet&#x27;s common spaces and homestead yards. Harry Stanley, a machine gunner from Charlie Company, said during the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division inquiry that the killings started without warning. He first observed a member of 1st Platoon strike a Vietnamese man with a bayonet. Then the same trooper pushed another villager into a well and threw a grenade in the well. Next, he saw fifteen or twenty people, mainly women and children, kneeling around a temple with burning incense. They were praying and crying. They were all killed by shots to the head.

Most of the killings occurred in the southern part of Tu Cung, a sub-hamlet of Xom Lang, which was a home to 700 residents. Xom Lang was erroneously marked on the U.S. military operational maps of Quảng Ngãi Province as Mỹ Lai.

A large group of approximately 70–80 villagers was rounded up by 1st Platoon in Xom Lang and led to an irrigation ditch east of the settlement. They were then pushed into the ditch and shot dead by soldiers after repeated orders issued by Calley, who was also shooting. PFC Paul Meadlo testified that he expended several M16 rifle magazines. He recollected that women were saying &quot;No VC&quot; and were trying to shield their children. He remembered that he was shooting old men and women, ranging in ages from grandmothers to teenagers, many with babies or small children in their arms, since he was convinced at that time that they were all booby-trapped with grenades and poised to attack. On another occasion during the security sweep of My Lai, Meadlo again fired into civilians side by side with Lieutenant Calley.

PFC Dennis Konti, a witness for the prosecution, told of one especially gruesome episode during the shooting, &quot;A lot of women had thrown themselves on top of the children to protect them, and the children were alive at first. Then, the children who were old enough to walk got up and Calley began to shoot the children&quot;. Other 1st Platoon members testified that many of the deaths of individual Vietnamese men, women and children occurred inside Mỹ Lai during the security sweep. To ensure the hamlets could no longer offer support to the enemy, the livestock was shot as well.

When PFC Michael Bernhardt entered the subhamlet of Xom Lang, the massacre was underway:

One group of 20–50 villagers was herded south of Xom Lang and killed on a dirt road. According to U.S. Army photographer Sgt. Ronald Haeberle&#x27;s eyewitness account of the massacre, in one instance,

Calley testified that he heard the shooting and arrived on the scene. He observed his men firing into a ditch with Vietnamese people inside, then began to take part in the shooting himself, using an M16 from a distance of no more than . During the massacre, a helicopter landed on the other side of the ditch and the pilot asked Calley if they could provide any medical assistance to the wounded civilians in Mỹ Lai; Calley admitted replying that &quot;a hand grenade was the only available means he had for their evacuation&quot;. At 11:00 Medina radioed an order to cease fire, and 1st Platoon took a break, during which they ate lunch.
Members of 2nd Platoon killed at least 60–70 Vietnamese, as they swept through the northern half of Mỹ Lai and through Binh Tay, a small sub-hamlet about north of Mỹ Lai. After the initial sweeps by 1st and 2nd Platoons, 3rd Platoon was dispatched to deal with any &quot;remaining resistance&quot;. 3rd Platoon, which stayed in reserve, reportedly rounded up and killed a group of seven to twelve women and children.

Since Charlie Company had not met any enemy opposition at Mỹ Lai and did not request back-up, Bravo Company, 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of TF Barker was transported by air between 08:15 and 08:30 away. It attacked the subhamlet My Hoi of the hamlet known as Cổ Lũy, which was mapped by the Army as Mỹ Khê. During this operation, between 60 and 155 people, including women and children, were killed.

Over the remaining day, both companies were involved in the further burning and destruction of dwellings, as well as continued mistreatment of Vietnamese detainees. While it was noted in the Courts Martial proceedings that some soldiers of Charlie Company did not participate in any killings, it was noted they neither openly protested against them nor filed complaints later to their superiors.

William Thomas Allison, a professor of Military History at Georgia Southern University, wrote, &quot;By midmorning, members of Charlie Company had killed hundreds of civilians and raped or assaulted countless women and young girls. They encountered no enemy fire and found no weapons in My Lai itself&quot;.

By the time the killings stopped, Charlie Company had suffered one casualtya soldier who had intentionally shot himself in the foot to avoid participating in the massacreand just three enemy weapons were confiscated.

=== Rapes ===

According to the Peers Commission Investigation, the U.S. government allocated commission for inquiry into the incident, concluded at least 20 Vietnamese women and girls were raped during the Mỹ Lai massacre. Since there had been little research over the case other than that of the Peers Commission, which solely accounts the cases with explicit rape signs like torn cloth and nudity, the actual number of rapes is not easy to estimate. According to the reports, the rape victims ranged between the ages of 10 and 45, with nine being under 18. The sexual assaults included gang rapes and sexual torture.

No U.S. serviceman was charged with rape. According to an eyewitness, as reported by Seymour Hersh in his book on the massacre, a woman was raped after her children were killed by the U.S. soldiers. Another Vietnamese villager also noticed soldiers rape a 13-year-old girl.

===Helicopter crew intervention===
Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr., a helicopter pilot from Company B (Aero-Scouts), 123rd Aviation Battalion, Americal Division, saw dead and wounded civilians as he was flying over the village of Sơn Mỹ, providing close-air support for ground forces. The crew made several attempts to radio for help for the wounded. They landed their helicopter by a ditch, which they noted was full of bodies and in which they could discern movement by survivors. Thompson asked a sergeant he encountered there (David Mitchell of 1st Platoon) if he could help get the people out of the ditch; the sergeant replied that he would &quot;help them out of their misery&quot;. Thompson, shocked and confused, then spoke with 2LT Calley, who claimed to be &quot;just following orders&quot;. As the helicopter took off, Thompson saw Mitchell firing into the ditch.

Thompson and his crew witnessed an unarmed woman being kicked and shot at point-blank range by Medina, who later claimed that he thought she had a hand grenade. Thompson then saw a group of civilians at a bunker being approached by ground personnel. Thompson landed, and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the villagers while he was trying to get them out of the bunker, then they were to open fire on the soldiers.

Thompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant (identified as Stephen Brooks of 2nd Platoon) and told him there were women and children in the bunker, and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out. According to Thompson, &quot;he [the lieutenant] said the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade&quot;. Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to &quot;just hold your men right where they are, and I&#x27;ll get the kids out.&quot; He found 12–16 people in the bunker, coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter, standing with them while they were flown out in two groups.

Returning to Mỹ Lai, Thompson and other air crew members noticed several large groups of bodies. Spotting some survivors in the ditch, Thompson landed again. A crew member, Specialist 4 Glenn Andreotta, entered the ditch and returned with a bloodied but apparently unharmed four-year-old girl, who was then flown to safety.

Upon returning to the LZ Dottie base in his OH-23, Thompson reported to his section leader, Captain Barry Lloyd, that the American infantry were no different from Nazis in their slaughter of innocent civilians: It&#x27;s mass murder out there. They&#x27;re rounding them up and herding them in ditches and then just shooting them. Thompson then reported what he had seen to his company commander, Major Frederic W. Watke, using terms such as &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;needless and unnecessary killings&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s statements were confirmed by other helicopter pilots and air crew members.

For his actions at Mỹ Lai, Thompson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while his crew members Glenn Andreotta and Lawrence Colburn were awarded the Bronze Star. Glenn Andreotta was awarded his medal posthumously, as he was killed in Vietnam on 8 April 1968. As the DFC citation included a fabricated account of rescuing a young girl from Mỹ Lai from &quot;intense crossfire&quot;, Thompson threw his medal away. He later received a Purple Heart for other services in Vietnam.

In March 1998, the helicopter crew&#x27;s medals were replaced by the Soldier&#x27;s Medal, the highest the U.S. Army can award for bravery not involving direct conflict with the enemy. The medal citations state they were &quot;for heroism above and beyond the call of duty while saving the lives of at least 10 Vietnamese civilians during the unlawful massacre of non-combatants by American forces at My Lai&quot;.

Thompson initially refused to accept the medal when the U.S. Army wanted to award it quietly. He demanded it be done publicly and that his crew be honored in the same way.

==Aftermath==
After returning to base at about 11:00, Thompson reported the massacre to his superiors. His allegations of civilian killings quickly reached LTC Barker, the operation&#x27;s overall commander. Barker radioed his executive officer to find out from Medina what was happening on the ground. Medina then gave the cease-fire order to Charlie Company to &quot;cut [the killing] out – knock it off&quot;.

Since Thompson made an official report of the civilian killings, he was interviewed by Colonel Oran Henderson, the commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade. Concerned, senior American officers canceled similar planned operations by Task Force Barker against other villages (My Lai 5, My Lai 1, etc.) in Quảng Ngãi Province. Despite Thompson&#x27;s revealing information, Henderson issued a Letter of Commendation to Medina on 27 March 1968.

The following day, 28 March, the commander of Task Force Barker submitted a combat action report for the 16 March operation, in which he stated that the operation in Mỹ Lai was a success, with 128 VC combatants killed. The Americal Division commander, General Koster, sent a congratulatory message to Charlie Company.

General William C. Westmoreland, the head of MACV, also congratulated Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry for &quot;outstanding action&quot;, saying that they had &quot;dealt [the] enemy [a] heavy blow&quot;. Later, he changed his stance, writing in his memoir that it was &quot;the conscious massacre of defenseless babies, children, mothers, and old men in a kind of diabolical slow-motion nightmare that went on for the better part of a day, with a cold-blooded break for lunch&quot;.

Owing to the chaotic circumstances of the war and the U.S. Army&#x27;s decision not to undertake a definitive body count of noncombatants in Vietnam, the number of civilians killed at Mỹ Lai cannot be stated with certainty. Estimates vary from source to source, with 347 and 504 being the most commonly cited figures. The memorial at the site of the massacre lists 504 names, with ages ranging from one to 82. A later investigation by the U.S. Army arrived at a lower figure of 347 deaths, the official U.S. estimate. The official estimate by the local government remains 504.

=== Investigation and cover-up ===

Initial reports claimed &quot;128 Viet Cong and 22 civilians&quot; had been killed in the village during a &quot;fierce fire fight&quot;. Westmoreland congratulated the unit on the &quot;outstanding job&quot;. As relayed at the time by &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; magazine, &quot;U.S. infantrymen had killed 128 Communists in a bloody day-long battle.&quot;

On 16 March 1968, in the official press briefing known as the &quot;Five O&#x27;Clock Follies&quot;, a mimeographed release included this passage: &quot;In an action today, Americal Division forces killed 128 enemy near Quang Ngai City. Helicopter gunships and artillery missions supported the ground elements throughout the day.&quot;

Initial investigations of the Mỹ Lai operation were undertaken by Colonel Henderson, under orders from the Americal Division&#x27;s executive officer, Brigadier General George H. Young. Henderson interviewed several soldiers involved in the incident, then issued a written report in late April claiming that some 20 civilians were inadvertently killed during the operation. According to Henderson&#x27;s report, the civilian casualties that occurred were accidental and mainly attributed to long-range artillery fire. The Army at this time was still describing the event as a military victory that had resulted in the deaths of 128 enemy combatants.

Six months later, Tom Glen, a 21-year-old soldier of the 11th Light Infantry Brigade, wrote a letter to General Creighton Abrams, the new MACV commander. He described an ongoing and routine brutality against Vietnamese civilians on the part of American forces in Vietnam that he had personally witnessed, and then concluded,

Colin Powell, then a 31-year-old Army major serving as an assistant chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division, was charged with investigating the letter, which did not specifically refer to Mỹ Lai, as Glen had limited knowledge of the events there. In his report, Powell wrote, &quot;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal Division soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.&quot; A 2018 U.S. Army case study of the massacre noted that Powell &quot;investigated the allegations described in the [Glen] letter. He proved unable to uncover either wide-spread unnecessary killings, war crimes, or any facts related to My Lai&quot;. Powell&#x27;s handling of the assignment was later characterized by some observers as &quot;whitewashing&quot; the atrocities of Mỹ Lai.

In May 2004, Powell, then United States Secretary of State, told CNN&#x27;s Larry King, &quot;I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for Mỹ Lai. I got there after Mỹ Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored.&quot;

Seven months prior to the massacre at Mỹ Lai, on Robert McNamara&#x27;s orders, the Inspector General of the U.S. Defense Department investigated press coverage of alleged atrocities committed in South Vietnam. In August 1967, the 200-page report &quot;Alleged Atrocities by U.S. Military Forces in South Vietnam&quot; was completed.

Independently of Glen, Specialist 5 Ronald L. Ridenhour, a former door gunner from the Aviation Section, Headquarters Company, 11th Infantry Brigade, sent a letter in March 1969 to thirty members of Congress imploring them to investigate the circumstances surrounding the &quot;Pinkville&quot; incident. He and his pilot, Warrant Officer Gilbert Honda, flew over Mỹ Lai several days after the operation and observed a scene of complete destruction. At one point, they hovered over a dead Vietnamese woman with a patch of the 11th Brigade on her body.

Ridenhour himself had not been present when the massacre occurred, but his account was compiled from detailed conversations with soldiers of Charlie Company who had witnessed and, in some cases, participated in the killing. He became convinced that something &quot;rather dark and bloody did indeed occur&quot; at Mỹ Lai, and was so disturbed by the tales he heard that within three months of being discharged from the Army he penned his concerns to Congress as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the President. He included the name of Michael Bernhardt, an eyewitness who agreed to testify, in the letter.

Most recipients of Ridenhour&#x27;s letter ignored it, with the exception of Congressman Mo Udall and Senators Barry Goldwater and Edward Brooke. Udall urged the House Armed Services Committee to call on Pentagon officials to conduct an investigation.

=== Public revelation and reaction ===

Under mounting pressure caused by Ridenhour&#x27;s letter, on 9 September 1969, the Army quietly charged Calley with six specifications of premeditated murder for the deaths of 109 South Vietnamese civilians near the village of Sơn Mỹ, at a hamlet called simply &quot;My Lai&quot;. Calley&#x27;s court martial was not released to the press and did not commence until over a year later in November 1970. However, word of Calley&#x27;s prosecution found its way to American investigative reporter and freelance journalist Seymour Hersh.

My Lai was first revealed to the public on 13 November 1969—more than a year and a half after the incident—when Hersh published a story through the Dispatch News Service. After extensive interviews with Calley, Hersh broke the Mỹ Lai story in 35 newspapers; additionally, the &quot;Alabama Journal&quot; in Montgomery and &quot;the New York Times&quot; ran separate stories on the allegations against Calley on 12 and 13 November, respectively. On 20 November, explicit color photographs and eye-witness testimony of the massacre taken by U.S. Army combat photographer Ronald L. Haeberle were published in &quot;The Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;. The same day, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; all covered the story, and CBS televised an interview with Paul Meadlo, a soldier in Calley&#x27;s unit during the massacre. From the U.S. Government and Army&#x27;s point of view, Haeberle&#x27;s photos transformed the massacre from potentially manageable to a very serious problem. The day after their publication, Melvin Laird the Secretary of Defense discussed them with Henry Kissinger who was at the time National Security Advisor to President Richard Nixon. Laird was recorded as saying that while he would like &quot;to sweep it under the rug&quot;, the photographs prevented it. &quot;They&#x27;re pretty terrible&quot;, he said. &quot;There are so many kids just laying there; these pictures are authentic&quot;. Within the Army, the reaction was similar. Chief Warrant Officer André Feher, with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Division (CID), was assigned the case in early August 1969. After he interviewed Haeberle, and was shown the photographs which he described as &quot;evidence that something real bad had happened&quot;, he and the Pentagon officials he reported to realized &quot;that news of the massacre could not be contained&quot;.

The story threatened to undermine the U.S. war effort and severely damage the Nixon presidency. Inside the White House, officials privately discussed how to contain the scandal. On November 21, National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger emphasized that the White House needed to develop a &quot;game plan&quot;, to establish a &quot;press policy&quot;, and maintain a &quot;unified line&quot; in its public response. The White House established a &quot;My Lai Task Force&quot; whose mission was to &quot;figure out how best to control the problem&quot;, to make sure administration officials &quot;all don&#x27;t go in different directions&quot; when discussing the incident, and to &quot;engage in dirty tricks&quot;. These included discrediting key witnesses and questioning Hersh&#x27;s motives for releasing the story. What soon followed was a public relations offensive by the administration designed to shape how My Lai would be portrayed in the press and understood among the American public.

As members of Congress called for an inquiry and news correspondents abroad expressed their horror at the massacre, the General Counsel of the Army Robert Jordan was tasked with speaking to the press. He refused to confirm allegations against Calley. Noting the significance that the statement was given at all, Bill Downs of ABC News said it amounted to the first public expression of concern by a &quot;high defense official&quot; that American troops &quot;might have committed genocide&quot;.

On 24 November 1969, Lieutenant General William R. Peers was appointed by the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff to conduct a thorough review of the My Lai incident, 16–19 March 1968, and its investigation by the Army. Peers&#x27;s final report, presented to higher-ups on 17 March 1970, was highly critical of top officers at brigade and divisional levels for participating in the cover-up, and the Charlie Company officers for their actions at Mỹ Lai.

According to Peers&#x27; findings:

In 2003 Hugh Thompson, the pilot who had intervened during the massacre, said of the Peers report:

In 1968, an American journalist, Jonathan Schell, wrote that in the Vietnamese province of Quang Ngai, where the Mỹ Lai massacre occurred, up to 70% of all villages were destroyed by the air strikes and artillery bombardments, including the use of napalm; 40 percent of the population were refugees, and the overall civilian casualties were close to 50,000 a year. Regarding the massacre at Mỹ Lai, he stated, &quot;There can be no doubt that such an atrocity was possible only because a number of other methods of killing civilians and destroying their villages had come to be the rule, and not the exception, in our conduct of the war&quot;.

In May 1970, a sergeant who participated in Operation Speedy Express wrote a confidential letter to then Army Chief of Staff Westmoreland describing civilian killings he said were on the scale of the massacre occurring as &quot;a My Lai each month for over a year&quot; during 1968–69. Two other letters to this effect from enlisted soldiers to military leaders in 1971, all signed &quot;Concerned Sergeant&quot;, were uncovered within declassified National Archive documents. The letters describe common occurrences of civilian killings during population pacification operations. Army policy also stressed very high body counts and this resulted in dead civilians being marked down as combatants. Alluding to indiscriminate killings described as unavoidable, the commander of the 9th Infantry Division, then Major General Julian Ewell, in September 1969, submitted a confidential report to Westmoreland and other generals describing the countryside in some areas of Vietnam as resembling the battlefields of Verdun.

In July 1969, the Office of Provost Marshal General of the Army began to examine the evidence regarding possible criminal charges. Eventually, Calley was charged with several counts of premeditated murder in September 1969, and 25 other officers and enlisted men were later charged with related crimes.

In April 1972, Congressman Les Aspin sued the Department of Defense in District Court to reveal the Peers Commission. Following the massacre a Pentagon task force called the Vietnam War Crimes Working Group (VWCWG) investigated alleged atrocities which were committed against South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops and created a secret archive of some 9,000 pages which documents 320 alleged incidents from 1967 to 1971 including 7 massacres in which at least 137 civilians died; 78 additional attacks targeting noncombatants in which at least 57 were killed, 56 were wounded and 15 were sexually assaulted; and 141 incidents of U.S. soldiers torturing civilian detainees or prisoners of war. 203 U.S. personnel were charged with crimes, 57 of them were court-martialed and 23 of them were convicted. The VWCWG also investigated over 500 additional alleged atrocities but it could not verify them.

===Court martial===
On 17 November 1970, a court-martial in the United States charged 14 officers, including Major General Koster, the Americal Division&#x27;s commanding officer, with suppressing information related to the incident. Most of the charges were later dropped. Brigade commander Colonel Henderson was the only high ranking commanding officer who stood trial on charges relating to the cover-up of the Mỹ Lai massacre; he was acquitted on 17 December 1971.

During the four-month-long trial, Calley consistently claimed that he was following orders from his commanding officer, Captain Medina. Despite that, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on 29 March 1971, after being found guilty of premeditated murder of not fewer than 20 people. Two days later, President Richard Nixon made the controversial decision to have Calley released from armed custody at Fort Benning, Georgia, and put under house arrest pending appeal of his sentence. Calley&#x27;s conviction was upheld by the Army Court of Military Review in 1973 and by the U.S. Court of Military Appeals in 1974.

In August 1971, Calley&#x27;s sentence was reduced by the convening authority from life to twenty years. Calley would eventually serve three and one-half years under house arrest at Fort Benning including three months in the disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In September 1974, he was paroled by the Secretary of the Army, Howard Callaway.

In a separate trial, Medina denied giving the orders that led to the massacre, and was acquitted of all charges, effectively negating the prosecution&#x27;s theory of &quot;command responsibility&quot;, now referred to as the &quot;Medina standard&quot;. Several months after his acquittal, however, Medina admitted he had suppressed evidence and had lied to Henderson about the number of civilian deaths.

Captain Kotouc, an intelligence officer from 11th Brigade, was also court-martialed and found not guilty. Koster was demoted to brigadier general and lost his position as the Superintendent of West Point. His deputy, Brigadier General Young, received a letter of censure. Both were stripped of Distinguished Service Medals which had been awarded for service in Vietnam.

Of the 26 men initially charged, Calley was the only one convicted. Some have argued that the outcome of the Mỹ Lai courts-martial failed to uphold the laws of war established in the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals. 

===Classification as a war crime===
Telford Taylor, a senior American prosecutor at Nuremberg, wrote that legal principles established at the war crimes trials could have been used to prosecute senior American military commanders for failing to prevent atrocities such as the one at Mỹ Lai.

Howard Callaway, Secretary of the Army, was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1976 as stating that Calley&#x27;s sentence was reduced because Calley honestly believed that what he did was a part of his orders—a rationale that contradicts the standards set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, where following orders was not a defense for committing war crimes. On the whole, aside from the Mỹ Lai courts-martial, there were 36 military trials held by the U.S. Army from January 1965 to August 1973 for crimes against civilians in Vietnam.

Some authors have argued that the light punishments of the low-level personnel present at Mỹ Lai and unwillingness to hold higher officials responsible was part of a pattern in which the body-count strategy and the so-called &quot;Mere Gook Rule&quot; encouraged U.S. soldiers to err on the side of killing suspected Vietnamese enemies even if there was a very good chance that they were civilians. This in turn, Nick Turse argues, made lesser known massacres similar to Mỹ Lai and a pattern of war crimes common in Vietnam.

==Survivors==
In early 1972, the camp at Mỹ Lai (2) where the survivors of the Mỹ Lai massacre had been relocated was largely destroyed by Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) artillery and aerial bombardment, and remaining eyewitnesses were dispersed. The destruction was officially attributed to &quot;Viet Cong terrorists&quot;. Quaker service workers in the area gave testimony in May 1972 by Martin Teitel at hearings before the &quot;Congressional Subcommittee to Investigate Problems Connected with Refugees and Escapees&quot; in South Vietnam. In June 1972, Teitel&#x27;s account was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Many American soldiers who had been in Mỹ Lai during the massacre accepted personal responsibility for the loss of civilian lives. Some of them expressed regrets without acknowledging any personal guilt, as, for example, Ernest Medina, who said, &quot;I have regrets for it, but I have no guilt over it because I didn&#x27;t cause it. That&#x27;s not what the military, particularly the United States Army, is trained for.&quot;

Lawrence La Croix, a squad leader in Charlie Company in Mỹ Lai, stated in 2010: &quot;A lot of people talk about My Lai, and they say, &#x27;Well, you know, yeah, but you can&#x27;t follow an illegal order.&#x27; Trust me. There is no such thing. Not in the military. If I go into a combat situation and I tell them, &#x27;No, I&#x27;m not going. I&#x27;m not going to do that. I&#x27;m not going to follow that order&#x27;, well, they&#x27;d put me up against the wall and shoot me.&quot;

On 16 March 1998, a gathering of local people and former American and Vietnamese soldiers stood together at the place of the Mỹ Lai massacre in Vietnam to commemorate its 30th anniversary. American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl at the time of the massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, &quot;We don&#x27;t say we forget. We just try not to think about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that&quot;. Colburn challenged Lieutenant Calley &quot;to face the women we faced today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the tears in their eyes and tell them why it happened&quot;. No American diplomats or any other officials attended the meeting.

More than a thousand people turned out on 16 March 2008, forty years after the massacre. The Sơn Mỹ Memorial drew survivors and families of victims and some returning U.S. veterans. One woman (an 8-year-old at the time) said, &quot;Everyone in my family was killed in the Mỹ Lai massacre—my mother, my father, my brother and three sisters. They threw me into a ditch full of dead bodies. I was covered with blood and brains.&quot; The U.S. was unofficially represented by a volunteer group from Wisconsin called Madison Quakers, who in 10 years built three schools in Mỹ Lai and planted a peace garden.

On 19 August 2009, Calley made his first public apology for the massacre in a speech to the Kiwanis club of Greater Columbus, Georgia:

Trần Văn Đức, who was seven years old at the time of the Mỹ Lai massacre and now resides in Remscheid, Germany, called the apology &quot;terse&quot;. He wrote a public letter to Calley describing the plight of his and many other families to remind him that time did not ease the pain, and that grief and sorrow over lost lives will forever stay in Mỹ Lai.

* COL Oran K. Henderson – 11th Infantry Brigade commander, who ordered the attack and flew in a helicopter over Mỹ Lai during it. After Hugh Thompson immediately reported multiple killings of civilians, Henderson started the cover-up by dismissing the allegation about the massacre and reporting to the superiors that indeed 20 people from Mỹ Lai died by accident. Accused of cover-up and perjury by the Army; charges dropped.Died on June 2, 1998,
* MG Samuel W. Koster – commander of the 23rd Infantry Division, was not involved with planning the Mỹ Lai search-and-destroy mission.

===1st Platoon, Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry===
* PFC James Bergthold, Sr. – Assistant gunner and ammo bearer on a machine gun team with Maples. Was never charged with a crime. Admitted that he killed a wounded woman he came upon in a hut, to put her out of her misery.
* PFC Michael Bernhardt – Rifleman; he dropped out of the University of Miami to volunteer for the Army. Bernhardt refused to kill civilians at Mỹ Lai. Captain Medina reportedly later threatened Bernhardt to deter him from exposing the massacre. As a result, Bernhardt was given more dangerous assignments such as point duty on patrol and would later be afflicted with a form of trench foot as a direct result. Bernhardt told Ridenhour, who was not present at Mỹ Lai during the massacre, about the events, pushing him to continue his investigation. Later he would help expose and detail the massacre in numerous interviews with the press, and he served as a prosecution witness in the trial of Medina, where he was subjected to intense cross examination by defense counsel F. Lee Bailey backed by a team of attorneys including Gary Myers. Bernhardt is a recipient of the New York Society for Ethical Culture&#x27;s 1970 Ethical Humanist Award.
* PFC Herbert L. Carter – &quot;tunnel rat&quot;; shot himself in the foot while reloading his pistol and claimed that he shot himself in the foot to be MEDEVACed out of the village when the massacre started.
* PFC Dennis L. Conti – Grenadier/Minesweeper; testified that he initially refused to shoot but later fired some M79 rounds at a group of fleeing people with unknown effect.
* SP4 Lawrence C. La Croix – Squad Leader; testified favorably for Captain Medina during his trial. In 1993, he sent a letter to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, saying, &quot;Now, 25 years later, I have only recently stopped having flashbacks of that morning. I still cannot touch a weapon without vomiting. I am unable to interact with any of the large Vietnamese population in Los Angeles for fear that they might find out who I am; and, because I cannot stand the pain of remembering or wondering if maybe they had relatives or loved ones who were victims at Mỹ Lai ... some of us will walk in the jungles and hear the cries of anguish for all eternity&quot;.
* PFC James Joseph Dursi – Rifleman; followed orders to round up civilians, but refused to open fire, even when ordered to do so by Lieutenant Calley. Earlier that day, he had shot a fleeing villager who was apparently carrying a weapon but turned out to be a woman carrying her baby. Afterwards, Dursi had vowed to not kill again.
* PFC Ronald Grzesik – a team leader. He claimed he followed orders to round up civilians but refused to kill them.
* SP4 Robert E. Maples – Machine gunner attached to SSG Bacon&#x27;s squad; stated that he refused an order to kill civilians hiding in a ditch and claimed his commanding officer threatened to shoot him.
* PFC Paul D. Meadlo – Rifleman; said he was afraid of being shot if he did not participate. Lost his foot to a land mine the next day; later, he publicly admitted his part in the massacre.
* SSG David Mitchell – Squad Leader; accused by witnesses of shooting people at the ditch site; pleaded not guilty. Mitchell was acquitted.
* SP4 Charles Sledge – Radiotelephone Operator; later a prosecution witness.
* PV2 Harry Stanley – Grenadier; claimed to have refused an order from Lieutenant Calley to kill civilians that were rounded-up in a bomb-crater but refused to testify against Calley. After he was featured in a documentary and several newspapers, the city of Berkeley, California, designated 17 October as &quot;Harry Stanley Day&quot;.
* SGT Esequiel Torres – previously had tortured and hanged an old man because Torres found his bandaged leg suspicious. He and Roschevitz (described below) were involved in the shooting of a group of ten women and five children in a hut. Calley ordered Torres to man the machine gun and open fire on the villagers that had been grouped together. Before everyone in the group was down, Torres ceased fire and refused to fire again. Calley took over the M60 and finished shooting the remaining villagers in that group himself. Torres was charged with murder but acquitted.Died June 26.2015
* SP4 Frederick J. Widmer – Assistant Radiotelephone Operator; Widmer, who has been the subject of pointed blame, is quoted as saying, &quot;The most disturbing thing I saw was one boy—and this was something that, you know, this is what haunts me from the whole, the whole ordeal down there. And there was a boy with his arm shot off, shot up half, half hanging on and he just had this bewildered look in his face and like, &#x27;What did I do, what&#x27;s wrong?&#x27; He was just, you know, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s hard to describe, couldn&#x27;t comprehend. I, I shot the boy, killed him and it&#x27;s—I&#x27;d like to think of it more or less as a mercy killing because somebody else would have killed him in the end, but it wasn&#x27;t right.&quot; Widmer died on 11 August 2016, aged 68.

Before being shipped to South Vietnam, all of Charlie Company&#x27;s soldiers went through an advanced infantry training and basic unit training at Pohakuloa Training Area in Hawaii. At Schofield Barracks they were taught how to treat POWs and how to distinguish VC guerrillas from civilians by a Judge Advocate.

===Other soldiers===
* Nicholas Capezza – Chief Medic; HHQ Company; insisted he saw nothing unusual.
* William Doherty and Michael Terry – 3rd Platoon soldiers who participated in the killing of the wounded in a ditch.
* SGT Ronald L. Haeberle – Photographer; Information Office, 11th Brigade; was attached to Charlie Company. Then SGT Haeberle carried two Army issued black and white cameras for official photos and his own personal camera containing color slide film. He submitted the black and white photos as part of the report on the operation to brigade authorities. By his own testimony at the Courts Martial, he admitted that official photographs generally did not include soldiers committing the killings and generally avoided identifying the individual perpetrators, while his personal color camera contained a few images of soldiers killing elderly men, women of various ages and children. Haeberle also testified that he destroyed most of the color slides which incriminated individual soldiers on the basis that he believed it was unfair to place the blame only on these individuals when many more were equally guilty. He gave his color images to his hometown newspaper, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, and then sold them to &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Criticism was initially levelled at Haeberle for not reporting what he witnessed or turning in his color photographs to the Army. He responded that &quot;he had never considered&quot; turning in his personal color photos and explained, &quot;If a general is smiling wrong in a photograph, I have learned to destroy it. ... My experience as a G.I. over there is that if something doesn&#x27;t look right, a general smiling the wrong way ... I stopped and destroyed the negative.&quot; He felt his photographs would never have seen the light of day if he had turned them in. It was confirmed in the U.S. Army&#x27;s own investigation that Haeberle had, in fact, been reprimanded for taking pictures which &quot;were detrimental to the United States Army&quot;. 
* Sergeant Minh, Duong – ARVN interpreter, 52nd Military intelligence Detachment, attached to Task Force Barker; confronted Captain Medina about the number of civilians that were killed. Medina reportedly replied, &quot;Sergeant Minh, don&#x27;t ask anything – those were the orders.&quot;
* SGT Gary D. Roschevitz – Grenadier; 2nd platoon; according to the testimony of James M. McBreen, Roschevitz killed five or six people standing together with a canister shot from his M79 grenade launcher, which had a shotgun effect after exploding; also grabbed an M16 rifle from Varnado Simpson to kill five Vietnamese prisoners. According to various witnesses, he later forced several women to undress with the intention of raping them. When the women refused, he reportedly shot at them.died 12 August 2020
* PFC Varnado Simpson – Rifleman; 2nd Platoon; admitted that he slew around 10 people in My Lai on CPT Medina&#x27;s orders to kill not only people, but even cats and dogs. He fired at a group of people where he allegedly saw a man with a weapon, but instead killed a woman with a baby. He committed suicide in 4 May 1997, after repeatedly acknowledging remorse for several murders in Mỹ Lai.
* SGT Kenneth Hodges, squad leader, was charged with rape and murder during the My Lai Massacre. In every interview given he strictly claimed that he was following orders.

==Media coverage==
A photographer and a reporter from the 11th Brigade Information Office were attached to Task Force Barker and landed with Charlie Company in Sơn Mỹ on 16 March 1968. Neither the &quot;Americal News Sheet&quot; published 17 March 1968, nor the &quot;Trident&quot;, 11th Infantry Brigade newsletter from 22 March 1968, reported the deaths of noncombatants in Mỹ Lai. The &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; published a laudatory piece, &quot;U.S. troops Surrounds Red, Kill 128&quot;, on March 18.

On 12 April 1968, the &quot;Trident&quot; wrote, &quot;The most punishing operations undertaken by the brigade in Operation Muscatine&#x27;s area involved three separate raids into the village and vicinity of My Lai, which cost the VC 276 killed&quot;. On 4 April 1968, the information office of the 11th Brigade issued a press-release, &quot;Recent Operations in Pinkville,&quot; without reporting mass casualties among civilians. Subsequent criminal investigation found that &quot;Both individuals failed to report what they had seen, the reporter wrote a false and misleading account of the operation, and the photographer withheld and suppressed from proper authorities the photographic evidence of atrocities he had obtained.&quot;

The first reporting of the Mỹ Lai massacre appeared in the American media after Fort Benning issued a press release related to the charges pressed against Lieutenant William Calley. This was issued on 5 September 1969.

Consequently, NBC aired on 10 September 1969 a segment in the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; which reported the killings of numerous civilians in South Vietnam. Following that, Ronald Ridenhour decided to disobey the Army&#x27;s order to withhold the information from the media. He approached reporter Ben Cole of the &quot;Phoenix Republic&quot;, who chose not to handle the scoop. Charles Black from the &quot;Columbus Enquirer&quot; uncovered the story on his own but also decided to put it on hold. Two major national news press outlets—&quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;—received some tips with partial information but did not act on them.

Ridenhour called Seymour Hersh on 22 October 1969. The freelance investigative journalist conducted an independent inquiry, and published to break the wall of silence that was surrounding the Mỹ Lai massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Look&quot; magazines; both turned it down. Hersh went to the small, Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty accepted it for publication. &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several survivors of the Mỹ Lai massacre in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of civilians killed as 567.

Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first who started to uncover the truth about the Mỹ Lai massacre. Haeberle contacted Joseph Eszterhas of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, which then published Haeberle&#x27;s grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on 20 November 1969. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; article on 28 November 1969 and in &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 5 December 1969, both of which included Haeberle&#x27;s photos, finally brought Mỹ Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.

Richard L. Strout, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; political commentator, wrote: &quot;American press self-censorship thwarted Mr. Ridenhour&#x27;s disclosures for a year. &#x27;No one wanted to go into it&#x27;, his agent said of telegrams sent to &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines outlining allegations.&quot;

Afterward, interviews and stories connected to the Mỹ Lai massacre started to appear regularly in the American and international press.

Concluding an ABC television news broadcast, anchorman Frank Reynolds said to his audience that, as a consequence of the allegations, &quot;our spirit as a people is scarred&quot;. The massacre, he believed, offered &quot;the most compelling argument yet advanced for America to end its involvement in Vietnam, not alone because of what the war is doing to the Vietnamese or to our reputation abroad, but because of what it is doing to us&quot;.

==Cultural representations==

===Music===

* Over 100 songs were released about the My Lai massacre and Lt. William Calley, identified by the Vietnam War Song Project. During the war years (from 1969 to 1973), pro-Calley songs outnumbered anti-Calley songs 2–1, according to the research collected by Justin Brummer, the founding editor of the Vietnam War Song Project. All the songs in the post-war era were critical of the actions of Calley and his platoon. Commercially, the most successful song was &quot;The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley&quot; by Terry Nelson, which peaked at No. 37 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 1 May 1971, selling over 1 million records. Despite its success, Tex Ritter cancelled his cover of the song because his record label, Capitol, viewed it as controversial. John Deer&#x27;s cover of the song bubbled under the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 1 May 1971, at No. 114.
* In 1971 American composer Arnold Rosner wrote an extended symphonic work entitled &quot;A My Lai Elegy&quot;. It received its premiere by the Colorado Symphony under the direction of Carl Topilow in 1974. The work was recorded by Toccata Classics in 2024, in a performance by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Nick Palmer. 
* In 2016, &quot;Mỹ Lai&quot;, an operatic account about the massacre was created by composer Jonathan Berger and libretto by Harriet Scott Chessman and performed by the Kronos Quartet, along with tenor Rinde Eckert and instrumentalist Vân-Ánh Vanessa Võ; centering on the experiences of the helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson&#x27;s intervention in stopping further bloodshed on the civilians. The opera made its world premiere at the Harris Theater in Chicago on January 29, 2016 and received wide critical acclaim. The album recording was released on March 16, 2022 on the fifty-fourth anniversary of the massacre, including the fiftieth anniversary founding of the Kronos Quartet.

===On television, film and video===
* In the third season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, the episode &quot;To Kill or Be Killed&quot;, aired on January 13, 1971, has a highly decorated army officer relate events alluding to the massacre just prior to committing suicide.
* The 1971 documentary short &quot;Interviews with My Lai Veterans&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, Short Subjects. In it, five American soldiers discussed their participation in the massacres.

* On 2 May 1989, the British television station Yorkshire Television broadcast the documentary &quot;Four Hours in My Lai&quot;, directed by Kevin Sim, as part of the networked series &quot;First Tuesday&quot;. Using eyewitness statements from both Vietnamese and Americans, the programme revealed new evidence about the massacre. The program was subsequently aired by PBS in the United States on 23 May as &quot;Remember My Lai&quot; (&quot;Frontline&quot;, Season 7).
* In 1994, a video film &quot;My Lai Revisited&quot; was aired on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; by CBS.
* Photography of the massacre is shown on screen and discussed in a philosophical context in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s 1995 horror film &quot;The Addiction&quot;.
* On 15 March 2008, the BBC broadcast the documentary &quot;The My Lai Tapes&quot; on Radio 4 and subsequently on the BBC World Service, in both English and Vietnamese, that used never-before-heard audio recordings of testimony taken at The Pentagon during the 1969–70 Peers&#x27;s Inquiry.
* On 26 April 2010, the American PBS broadcast a documentary as part of its &quot;American Experience&quot; series, entitled &quot;The American Experience: My Lai&quot;.
* On 10 December 2010, Italian producer Gianni Paolucci released a movie entitled &quot;My Lai Four&quot;, directed by Paolo Bertola, starring American actor Beau Ballinger as Calley, and adapted from the Pulitzer Prize–winning book by Seymour Hersh.
* Episode 8 of Ken Burns&#x27; 2017 documentary series &quot;The Vietnam War&quot; relates to these events.
*In 2018, &quot;My Lai Inside&quot;, a documentary by Christoph Felder was released

===In theater===

&quot;The Lieutenant&quot; is a 1975 Broadway rock opera that concerns the Mỹ Lai massacre and resulting courts martial. It was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical.

===Photography===

The Mỹ Lai massacre, like many other events in Vietnam, was captured on camera by U.S. Army personnel. The most published and graphic images were taken by Ronald Haeberle, a U.S. Army Public Information Detachment photographer who accompanied the men of Charlie Company that day.

In 2009, Haeberle said that he destroyed a number of photographs he took during the massacre. Unlike the photographs of the dead bodies, the destroyed photographs depicted Americans in the actual process of murdering Vietnamese civilians. According to M. Paul Holsinger, the &quot;And babies&quot; poster, which used a Haeberle photo, was &quot;easily the most successful poster to vent the outrage that so many felt about the human cost of the conflict in Southeast Asia. Copies are still frequently seen in retrospectives dealing with the popular culture of the Vietnam War era or in collections of art from the period.&quot;

Another soldier, John Henry Smail of the 3rd Platoon, took at least 16 color photographs depicting U.S. Army personnel, helicopters, and aerial views of Mỹ Lai. These, along with Haeberle&#x27;s photographs, were included in the &quot;Report of the Department of the Army review of the Preliminary Investigations into the My Lai Incident&quot;. Former First Lieutenant (1LT) Roger L. Alaux Jr., a forward artillery observer, who was assigned to Charlie Company during the combat assault on Mỹ Lai 4, also took some photographs from a helicopter that day, including aerial views of Mỹ Lai, and of the Charlie Company&#x27;s landing zone.
===Historical memorials===
====Ho Chi Minh City====

The massacre is memorialized at two locations within Vietnam. The first is in Ho Chi Minh City at the War Remnants Museum, which contains exhibits relating to the First Indochina War and the Second Indochina War (the Vietnam War in the United States). This museum is the most popular museum in the city, attracting approximately half a million visitors every year. A number of Haeberle&#x27;s photos are displayed in the museum along with other artifacts and information about the massacre.

====Sơn Mỹ====
The second is the Sơn Mỹ Memorial Museum which is located at the site of the massacre and includes the remains of the village of Sơn Mỹ in Quảng Ngãi Province. A large black marble plaque just inside the entrance to the museum lists the names of all 504 civilians killed by the American troops, including &quot;17 pregnant women and 210 children under the age of 13.&quot; A number of enlarged versions of Haeberle&#x27;s photos are shown inside the museum. The images are dramatically backlit in color and share the central back wall with a life-size recreation of American soldiers &quot;rounding up and shooting cowering villagers.&quot; The museum also celebrates American heroes, including Ronald Ridenhour who first exposed the killings, as well as Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn who intervened to save a number of villagers.
At the center of the museum grounds, which is at the heart of the destroyed village, is a large stone monument. The two children to the lower right in the sculpture are modeled on the two children in one of Haeberle&#x27;s photos, often called &quot;Two Children on a Trail&quot;.

Some American veterans choose to go on pilgrimage to the site of the massacre to heal and reconcile.

====Mỹ Lai Peace Park====

On the 30th anniversary of the massacre, 16 March 1998, a groundbreaking ceremony for the Mỹ Lai Peace Park was held away from the site of the massacre. Veterans, including Hugh Thompson Jr. and Lawrence Colburn from the helicopter rescue crew, attended the ceremony. Mike Boehm, a veteran who was instrumental in the peace park effort, said, &quot;We cannot forget the past, but we cannot live with anger and hatred either. With this park of peace, we have created a green, rolling, living monument to peace.&quot;

On 16 March 2001, the Mỹ Lai Peace Park was dedicated, a joint venture of the Quảng Ngãi Province Women&#x27;s Union, the Madison Quakers&#x27; charitable organization, and the Vietnamese government.

<text>Eryngium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. There are about 250 species. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with centres of diversity in the western Mediterranean, South America and Mexico. Common names include eryngo and sea holly (though not to be confused with true hollies, of the genus &quot;Ilex&quot;).

These are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves. The dome-shaped umbels of steely blue or white flowers have whorls of spiny basal bracts. European and Asian species tend to be native to dry, rocky and coastal areas, and the American species are native to often damp grasslands.

In the language of flowers, they represent admiration.

== Systematics ==
===Taxonomic history===
The genus name &quot;Eryngium&quot; was established by Linnaeus in 1753 where he mentioned eight species, including two from America (&quot;E. aquaticum&quot;, &quot;E. foetidum&quot;). Linnaeus, in &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; (1754), cited his source of the name &quot;Eryngium&quot; as being from Joseph Tournefort’s &quot;Institutiones rei herbariae&quot; (1700). The name itself has an Ancient Greek origin as eryggion (ερυγγιον). 

Prior to the nomenclatural establishment of &quot;Eryngium&quot; by Linnaeus, plants that can be recognised as belonging to the genus were mentioned by Theophrastus (371–287BC), Pedanius Dioscorides (40–90AD), Otto Brunfels (1532) and Leonhart Fuchs (1543). Early mentions of American species were made by Francisco Hernández de Toledo (1651) and Leonard Plukenet (1692).

After Linnaeus, a major treatment of the genus was made by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1798) who mentioned 25 species, and Antonio José Cavanilles (1800, 1801) who described at least seven species, six of which were from America. The first monograph of the genus was by François-Étienne de La Roche (1808), which covers 50 species. In the 19th century further European and Asian species were described by Pierre Edmond Boissier and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, and American species by Adelbert von Chamisso, Joseph Decaisne, William Jackson Hooker, August Grisebach, Willis Linn Jepson and Rodolfo Amando Philippi. In 1913 Karl F.A.H. Wolff published a major revision of the genus, discussing 196 species which he allocated to 34 sections while also recognising a division between Old World (Europe and Asia) and New World (America and Australia) species. The understanding of American species was further enhanced by Mildred E. Mathias (1906–1995) and Lincoln Constance (1909–2001) who published a synopsis of North American species (Mathias &amp; Constance 1941) and described a total of 18 species from North and South America. 

More recently, Arno Wörz has made a major contribution to the understanding of the genus with his revision of European, Asian and African species (Wörz 2011 ) and his checklist of all species (Wörz 1999 ).

===Evolutionary history===
It is likely that the genus originated in Eurasia, with a radiation from west to east in subgenus &quot;Eryngium&quot;, and the western Mediterranean being a primary centre of diversity. The American species are probably derived from a more recent intensive evolution and radiation, possibly from a single trans-Atlantic dispersal and subsequent landfall in southeastern South America where there is a primary diversity centre in southern Brazil and a younger secondary one in Mexico. It is likely that the sword-leaved structure seen in many American species occurred only once in the evolution of the genus. The palmate leaf patterns seen in Eurasian species do not occur in any American species.

===Classification===
Wörz (2011 ) divided the genus into six subgenera, with one subgenus divided into 10 sections:
*subgenus &quot;Lessonia&quot;
*subgenus &quot;Monocotyloidea&quot;
*subgenus &quot;Semiaquatica&quot;
*subgenus &quot;Ilicifolia&quot;
*subgenus &quot;Foetida&quot;
*subgenus &quot;Eryngium&quot;
**section &quot;Alpina&quot;
**section &quot;Amethystina&quot;
**section &quot;Astrantiifolia&quot;
**section &quot;Bourgatiorum&quot;
**section &quot;Bungeorum &quot;
**section &quot;Eryngium&quot;
**section &quot;Gigantophylla&quot;
**section &quot;Palmito&quot;
**section &quot;Plana&quot;
**section &quot;Thorifolia&quot;

== Uses ==
===Horticulture===

Eryngos are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. The most widely grown species are &quot;E. agavifolium&quot;, &quot;E. alpinum&quot;, &quot;E. bourgatii&quot;, &quot;E. giganteum&quot;, &quot;E. pandanifolium&quot;, &quot;E. planum&quot;, &quot;E. variifolium&quot; and &quot;E. yuccifolium&quot;. Two hybrids have also been selected for garden use, one being &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;olivierianum&quot; (syn. &quot;E.&quot; x &quot;zabelii&quot;), of which there are several cultivars such as ‘Big Blue’, and the other is &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;tripartitum&quot;. The species with the most cultivars is &quot;E. planum&quot;. Overall, around 250 cultivars have been named in the genus. Some species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Medicine and food===

Many species of &quot;Eryngium&quot; have been used as medicine and food. &quot;Eryngium campestre&quot; is used as a folk medicine in Turkey. In Iran, &quot;Eryngium&quot; (Boghnagh فارسی- بوقناق) is used as herbal tea to lower blood sugar. &quot;Eryngium creticum&quot; is a herbal remedy for scorpion stings in Jordan. &quot;Eryngium elegans&quot; is used in Argentina and &quot;Eryngium foetidum&quot; in Latin America and South-East Asia. Native American peoples used many species for varied purposes. Cultures worldwide have used &quot;Eryngium&quot; extracts as anti-inflammatory agents. &quot;Eryngium&quot; yields an essential oil and contains many kinds of terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, coumarins, and steroids.

The roots, particularly those of &quot;Eryngium maritimum&quot;, have been used as vegetables or sweetmeats. Young shoots and leaves are sometimes used as vegetables like asparagus. &quot;Eryngium foetidum&quot; is used as a culinary herb in tropical parts of the Americas and Asia. It tastes similar to coriander or cilantro, and is sometimes mistaken for it. It may be called spiny coriander or culantro, or by its Vietnamese name of ngo gai.

<doc id="68296" wikidata="Q52650" url="?curid=68296" title="Cabrera, Balearic Islands">
<text>Cabrera (, , ) is an island in the Balearic Islands, Spain located in the Mediterranean Sea off the southern coast of Mallorca. A National Park, its highest point is Na Picamosques (172 m). Uninhabited, it’s administratively part of the city of Palma in Mallorca.

Cabrera is the largest island of the small archipelago that includes (from south to north) the islands of Estells de Fora, L&#x27;Imperial, Illa de ses Bledes, Na Redona, Conillera, L&#x27;Esponja, Na Plana, Illot Pla, Na Pobra and Na Foradada.

== History ==
In December 1530, Hayreddin Barbarossa, an Ottoman admiral of the fleet, captured the Castle of Cabrera, and started to use the island as a logistic base for his operations in the area. Barbarossa&#x27;s naval victories secured Ottoman dominance over the Mediterranean during the mid-16th century, from 1530 until the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.

Cabrera was used to house French prisoners of war following the 1808 Battle of Bailén. Of the 9,000 sent to Cabrera during the war, only 3,600 remained to be repatriated at its end in 1814, though 876 officers and sergeants were taken off in July 1810 and sailed to England. The island was to be supplied every two days with food and water but these ships often did not set sail. As well as dying of starvation, thirst and disease many were driven insane and some became cannibalistic. Inscriptions by the prisoners have been discovered in a cave at Cap Ventos, in the northwest of the island, an area still littered with buttons from their disintegrated uniforms.

Late in 1916, a malfunctioning Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine remained at Cabrera for several hours, and the Spanish government subsequently decided to expropriate the island for defense. It is alleged that Juan March Ordinas, avoiding the blockade, had been selling supplies, including fuel, to submarine personnel, from the area of Cala Ganduf and S&#x27;Olla. There was strong international protest, particularly by the British Admiralty, as Spain was officially neutral during the First World War.

Cabrera remained a military zone until the 1980s, although from the 1920s some Mallorcan civilians rented out their Cabrera land for agriculture.

In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, a Republican Air Force Dornier Wal D-1 airplane crashed near the island. The crew were captured by military nationalist forces, but two Republican submarines (a B2 and B3) sent by order of Pedro Marqués Barber (an old NCO and former military Menorca self-proclaimed governor) came immediately and the small Cabreran force surrendered. Facundo Flores Horrach (the chief military officer), Mariano Ferrer Bravo (a retired Spanish officer) and three civilians (males of the Suñer Mas family) were taken to Menorca and executed in a harbour place named S&#x27;Hort d&#x27;en Morillo (Mahón). After the failure of Captain Alberto Bayo Column landing in Mallorca, from 15 August to 4 September, the Republican troops left Cabrera. Bayo&#x27;s plan was for the CNT column, stationed in Cabrera, to appear at Dragonera Island just southwest of Mallorca and simulate a false landing. But the anarchist CNT command refused this tactic and later went to Mallorca. A bloody battle destroyed them in Porto Cristo. The rest of this column failed before it arrived and was killed on Sa Cabana, just outside their point of entry at Manacor.

Cabrera, which had been a former Santa Catalina, Palma de Mallorca district, was declared a National Park in April 1991. The Cabrera National Park is now administratively grouped with the municipality of Palma de Mallorca.

<text>Lluís Companys i Jover (; 21 June 1882 – 15 October 1940) was a Catalan politician who served as president of Catalonia, Spain from 1934 and during the Spanish Civil War.

Companys was a lawyer close to labour movement and one of the most prominent leaders of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) political party, founded in 1931. He had a key role in the events of the proclamation and first steps of the Second Spanish Republic. Appointed president of the Generalitat of Catalonia in 1934, after the death of the previous president, Francesc Macià, his government tried to consolidate the recently acquired Catalan self-government and implement a progressive agenda, despite the internal difficulties. Opposed to the inclusion of the right-wing CEDA party in the coalition Spanish government during the strikes and insurgency in October 1934, on 6 October he proclaimed a new Catalan State. He and the Catalan government were subsequently arrested and imprisoned. 

After the left-wing Popular Front won the Spanish national election in 1936, Companys was pardoned, and he returned to head the fractious Catalan government. He remained president during the Spanish Civil War, loyal to the Republican faction. A refugee in France after the Republican defeat in 1939, he was arrested in 1940 by the secret police of Nazi Germany, the Gestapo. Extradited back to Francoist Spain, he was executed on 15 October 1940.

==Early life==
Lluís Companys i Jover was born in El Tarròs near Lleida in western Catalonia on 21 June 1882. His parents, Josep Companys and Maria Lluïsa de Jover, were peasants with aristocratic roots. The second child of ten, Companys was sent to boarding school in Barcelona at the &quot;Liceu Poliglot&quot;. He obtained his law degree from the University of Barcelona, where he met Francesc Layret, another Catalan nationalist with an interest in politics. 

Companys participated in the political life of Catalonia from a young age. In 1906, the military pressured and attacked the offices of Catalan newspapers &quot;Cu-Cut!&quot; and &quot;La Veu de Catalunya&quot;, events which were followed by the passage of the repressive &quot;Ley de Jurisdicciones&quot; (&quot;Law of Jurisdictions&quot;), making speech against Spain and its symbols a criminal offense. In response to these events, he participated in the creation of the successful coalition Solidaritat Catalana. Later, he became affiliated with the ephemeral Republican Nationalist Federal Union (&quot;Unió Federal Nacionalista Republicana&quot;), where he was president of the youth section. He was investigated for his intense youth activities and was jailed fifteen times. After the violent confrontations in Barcelona during Tragic Week in 1909, he was classified as a &quot;dangerous individual&quot; in police records.

With Francesc Layret, Companys represented the left-wing labour faction of the Partit Republicà Català (Catalan Republican Party), for which he was elected local councilor of Barcelona in 1916. In November 1920, he was arrested together with Salvador Seguí (known as &quot;El Noi del Sucre&quot;), Martí Barrera and other trade unionists, and he was deported to the &quot;Castell de la Mola&quot; in Mahón, Menorca. While Layret was preparing Companys&#x27; legal defense, he was assassinated by gunmen of the Sindicatos Libres. In the 1920 Spanish legislative elections Companys took the place of Layret, who would likely have won that election, and despite having been deported, Companys was elected member of parliament for Sabadell. As a member of parliament he had legal immunity, which secured his release from prison.

In 1922 Companys was one of the founders of the peasants&#x27; trade union Unió de Rabassaires, where he worked as lawyer and director of the &quot;La Terra&quot; magazine during the years of the Primo de Rivera regime in the 1920s. Detained again, he was unable to attend the &quot;Conferència d&#x27;Esquerres&quot; (Conference of Leftists), held from 12 to 19 March 1931. The conference produced the political party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC, Republican Left of Catalonia) by merging Estat Català (led by Francesc Macià), the Partit Republicà Català itself, and the journal L&#x27;Opinió. The latter included Joan Lluhí as prominent figure. Nevertheless, Companys was elected as an executive member of ERC, representing the Partit Republicà Català. Thanks to the bonds between the Spanish labor movement and the Spanish trade union movement, the election of Companys to this position gave the ERC great prestige in left-wing public opinion, as it would otherwise have been regarded as a party of the progressive petty bourgeoisie.

== Proclamation of Second Spanish Republic ==
In the 1931 Spanish local elections, the ERC won a surprise victory in Barcelona and other municipalities of Catalonia. After he learned the results, on 14 April, Companys, who was elected a city representative, and other ERC candidates together with the Party&#x27;s leader Francesc Macià, decided to take over by surprise the office of mayor and entered the City Hall. After some dispute, the transitional Mayor of Barcelona was deposed, and Companys was proclaimed new mayor. Subsequently, he hung a tricolour Spanish Republican Flag from the City Hall&#x27;s balcony and proclaimed the Republic. Shortly after, Francesc Macià proclaimed the Catalan Republic within the Federation of Iberian Republics, a project that was later abandoned after gaining the promise of regional devolution and the restitution of the Catalan Generalitat (as autonomous government) from the new Republican government.

After controlling the Barcelona City Hall, Macià ordered Companys to take the office of &quot;Gobernador Civil&quot; (civil governor) of the Barcelona Province, which at that time held considerable powers such as policing. It had been controlled by republican radicals during the proclamation of the republic. Macià probably wanted a less public office for Companys, whom he thought of as a political rival. Companys ran as a Barcelona provincial candidate in the December 1931 Spanish legislative election. After gaining a seat, he led the ERC representation and the Catalan minority group in the new Republican Parliament. He described his political objectives in Madrid: &quot;We, the Catalan members of the Parliament, have come here not only to defend our Statute of Autonomy [law of self-government], and the fraternal and democratic understanding of the members of Parliament; but, also to participate in matters that affect the greatness of Spain: the Constitution, the agrarian reforms and social legislation&quot;. In 1932, Companys was elected the first Speaker of the Parliament of Catalonia.

==Presidency of Catalonia and proclamation of Catalan State==
After the death of Francesc Macià on 25 December 1933, who was presiding over the Generalitat of Catalonia, Companys was elected the successor President of the Generalitat by the Catalan Parliament. He appointed a new coalition government composed by the Republican Left of Catalonia and the other left-wing republican and catalanist parties. Under his presidency, the Parliament passed laws to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie. One example was the Crop Contracts Law, which protected the tenant farmers and granted them access to the land they were cultivating. The law increased tensions, however, after it was contested by the Regionalist League, and it provoked a legal dispute with the Spanish government led by Ricardo Samper. Meanwhile, the Generalitat established its own Court of Appeal (&quot;Tribunal de Cassació&quot;) and assumed executive powers in public order, according as the Statute of Autonomy stipulated. 

On 6 October 1934, with the support of the Worker&#x27;s Alliance and the pro-independence Escamots, Companys led a Catalan nationalist uprising. Companys proclaimed the Catalan State (Estat Català) within the &quot;Spanish Federal Republic&quot;. The uprising was opposed by both the centrist and conservative Catalan representatives and the new centrist and right-wing republican government, led by Alejandro Lerroux. That government included ministers from the political party CEDA, which was considered by many left-wing sectors as nearly fascist. The attempt to form the Catalan state was seen as an attempt at a coup d&#x27;état, as Companys had revolted against the newly appointed center-right republican government and joined the Asturias miners&#x27; attempt at revolution. Companys asked Manuel Azaña, who happened to be in Barcelona during the events, to lead the newly-proclaimed Spanish Republican government, but Azaña rejected the proposition. The proclamation was suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan government members were arrested. Companys was sentenced to 30 years in prison. After the victory of the left-wing coalition Popular Front in the 1936 election, he was pardoned by the new Spanish government, and the Catalan government was restored. 

The period after that election until July 1936 is considered a time of relative peace in Catalonia, in contrast with the rest of Spain. The Parliament restored their legislative activities. As a response to the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics held in Nazi Germany, the government prepared the People&#x27;s Olympiad in Barcelona, with Companys as its honorary president. The Olympiad was planned to commence on 19 July, but on that same day the Spanish Army began a national coup d&#x27;état that would fail but eventually precipitate the Spanish Civil War. On the morning of 19 July, civil conflict began between Republican and Nationalist forces in Barcelona.

==Civil War==

When the Spanish Civil War began, Companys sided with the Spanish Republic against the Nationalist faction. Responding to the coup attempt in Barcelona, several Catalan political and workers parties independently fought to defeat the local Nationalist forces, subsequently causing tensions in political power. As a consequence of the independently organized resistance, by the end of the fighting on 21 July some of the political parties wielded considerably more power than the government. These parties included: the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), an anarchist syndicalist trade union; the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), a Spanish anarchist organization; the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a revolutionary anti-Stalinist communist party; and others. Companys was instrumental in organizing an umbrella collaboration between these diverse groups called the Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias (CCMA). CCMA was formed on 21 July and sponsored by his Catalan government to reconcile the political tensions, recover the control of the situation, and organize the war effort.
In November 1936, the Generalitat government was the target of a planned coup by members of the pro-independence party Estat Català, a break-away political party from Companys&#x27; ERC. Primarily objecting to Companys conciliation with anarchist groups, the conspirators intended to replace him with Prime Minister Joan Casanovas. The plot was exposed and some of its leaders jailed. Companys continued to try to maintain the unity of his fragile political coalition, but after the Soviet Union&#x27;s consul, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, threatened to cut off Russian aid to Catalonia for his continued collaboration with the anti-Stalinist POUM, he sacked POUM leader Andreu Nin from his post as Minister of Justice in December 1936. After May Days, a series of clashes between Republican factions in early May 1937 which saw the removal of the central role played by the anarchist CNT-FAI, control of public order, defense, borders and war industries (in the hands of the Generalitat since the beginning of the war) was assumed by the Spanish Republican government. Companys could only protest, and political tensions with the Spanish Republican forces increased. As a consequence of Soviet/COMINTERN and Spanish Communist Party (PCE) pressures, POUM was declared illegal on 16 June 1937; Nin disappeared soon thereafter, widely viewed as having been assassinated by Soviet agents.

With the fall of Barcelona to the Nationalists in January 1939, Companys feared for his life and left the city, departing on 24 January, 2 days prior to the Nationalist takeover. Ten days later he joined the half-million Republican soldiers and civilians in La Retirada escaping the Nationalists of Francisco Franco by crossing the Pyrenees of Catalonia to France. Companys crossed the French border at Coll de Lli, La Vajol with the Basque lehendakari (president) José Antonio Aguirre on 5 February 1939, thus beginning his exile.

==Exile and execution==
A refugee in France in 1939 after the Civil War, Companys passed up various chances to leave France because his son Lluís was seriously ill in a clinic in Paris. His position became particularly perilous after Germany took France in June 1940. In collaboration with the Spanish police, the Gestapo arrested him in La Baule-les-Pins near Nantes on 13 August 1940. First detained in La Santé Prison in Paris, he was then extradited by Nazi German authorities to Spain in early September 1940. He was imprisoned at Puerta del Sol, Madrid&#x27;s central square, in the basement of the headquarters of the Dirección General de Seguridad (General Directorate of State Security) at the Real Casa de Correos (Royal House of the Post Office). Held there for five weeks, he was kept in solitary confinement, interrogated, starved, tortured and brutally beaten. Senior figures of the Francoist State visited his cell, insulted him and threw coins or crusts of bread at him. 
In a military trial held in Barcelona in mid-October 1940,
Companys was accused of military rebellion and sentenced to death. The trial lasted less than one hour and lacked legal guarantees. During the trial, Companys was courageously defended by Ramón de Colubí, a young soldier who had fought in the war for the rebels. Colubí sent a telegram to Franco pleading for clemency for Companys, to no avail. In 2015 Víctor Gay Zaragoza, a Catalan writer, found that Companys and Colubí were relatives.

Efforts to save Companys were useless, and at 6:30 a.m. on 15 October 1940 he was executed at Montjuïc Castle. Refusing to wear a blindfold, he was taken barefoot before a firing squad of Civil Guards, and, as they fired, Companys shouted &#x27;Per Catalunya!&#x27; (For Catalonia!). The cause of death was given as &#x27;traumatic internal hemorrhage&#x27;. He was the only democratically-elected president executed by fascism in Europe.

==Legacy==

Lluís Companys is buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery within the memorial space Fossar de la Pedrera, which is dedicated to Republican victims of the Civil War. An annual memorial to Companys and the 1,700 Republicans executed for political reasons is held at his grave site on the anniversary of his execution on 15 October.

In Catalonia, Companys is viewed as a martyr to Catalan nationalism and independence. In Spain, Companys’ legacy is divisive, however. While perceived favorably and with reverence by liberals, progressives and those favoring independence in Catalonia, conservative and right-wing factions in Catalonia and Spain view his memory as a threat to the unity of Spain. In recent years, multiple controversial and unsuccessful attempts have been made to rescind the guilty verdict of Companys&#x27; court martial.

In 1998 a monument to Companys was installed near Arc de Triomf, on Passeig de Lluís Companys in Barcelona. The poet Conxita Julià, who as a teenager had written to Companys while he was in prison in 1934-1936, is portrayed next to Companys&#x27; image in the monument. The main stadium used for the 1992 Summer Olympics, located on Montjuïc, was officially named in his memory in 2001. Many cities and villages of Catalonia have named streets and squares after him.

His personal archive is located in the CRAI Library of the Pavilion of the Republic at the University of Barcelona. It consists of correspondence about him, as well as discourses and declarations between 1936 and 1938.

<text>Huesca (; ) is a city in north-eastern Spain, within the autonomous community of Aragon. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon between 1096 and 1118. It is also the capital of the Spanish province of the same name and of the comarca of Hoya de Huesca. In 2009, it had a population of 52,059, almost a quarter of the total population of the province. The city is one of the smallest provincial capitals in Spain.

Huesca celebrates its main festival, the &quot;Fiestas de San Lorenzo&quot;, in honor of Saint Lawrence, from 9 to 15 August.

==History==

Huesca dates from pre-Roman times, and was once known as &quot;Bolskan&quot; (Iberian: ) in the ancient Iberian language. It was once the capital of the Vescetani, in the north of Hispania Tarraconensis, on the road from Tarraco (modern Tarragona) and Ilerda (modern Lleida) to Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza). During Roman times, the city was known as Osca, and was a Roman colony under the rule of Quintus Sertorius, who made Osca his base. The city minted its own coinage and was the site of a prestigious school founded by Sertorius to educate young Iberians in Latin and Roman customs. After Sertorius, it is thought that it was renamed Ileoscan () by Strabo. It appears to have been situated on silver mines.

Eighteenth-century Spanish historian Enrique Flórez has pointed out the impossibility of one city supplying such vast quantities of minted silver as has been recorded by ancient writers under the terms &quot;argentum Oscense&quot;, &quot;signatum Oscense&quot;; and is of the opinion that &quot;Oscense&quot; meant &quot;Spanish&quot;, being a corruption of &quot;Eus-cara&quot;. The Romanised city was made a &quot;municipium&quot; by decree of Augustus in 30 BC.
The Arabs conquered the city in the late 8th century, and the city came to be called &quot;Washqah&quot; (وشقة in Arabic), falling within the Upper March of the Emirate of Córdoba. It was ruled by a local governor appointed from Córdoba, but was repeatedly subject to political turmoil, rebellion and assassination as the Banu Qasi, Banu Amrus and Banu al-Tawil clans, as well as the Arista dynasty of Pamplona, struggled for control, autonomy and independence from the Emirate. In the mid-10th century, Wasqah was transferred to the Banu Tujib, who governed the Upper March from Zaragoza, and it became part of the Taifa of Zaragoza in 1018 when they successfully freed themselves from the disintegrating Caliphate. In 1094 Sancho Ramirez built the nearby Castle of Montearagón with the intention of laying siege to Wasqah but was killed by a stray arrow as he reached the city&#x27;s walls. It was conquered in 1096 by Peter I of Aragon and moved his royal capital to Huesca from the ancient capital of Jaca. In 1118 the Aragonese capital was moved to Zaragoza.

In 1354, King Peter IV of Aragon founded the , which initially had a faculty of theology. The school expanded, but by the end of the 16th century was eclipsed by the University of Zaragoza. The university was abolished in 1845.

Historically, Huesca was home to one of the most important Jewish communities in Aragon, third after Zaragoza and Calatayud. The Jewish community flourished until the 1492 expulsion of the Jews.

During the First Carlist War, Huesca was the site of a battle between Spanish Constitutionalists and Carlists.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) the &quot;Huesca Front&quot; was the scene of some of the worst fighting between the Republicans and Franco&#x27;s army. Held by the Nationalists, the city was besieged by the Republicans, with George Orwell among them, but did not fall.

==Modern Huesca==
Various streets in the centre of Huesca have recently been pedestrianised.

==Geography==
Huesca lies on a plateau in the northern region of Aragón, with an elevation of above sea level. Close to the city lie the Sierra de Guara mountains, which reach 2,077 m. The geographical coordinates of the city are: 42° 08´ N, 0° 24´ W.

==Coat of arms==
Both the modern Coat of Arms of Huesca (es) (which date from the 16th century) and its mediaeval predecessor (from the 13th) include at their top the device of a block having a V-shaped notch. It is commonly said that it symbolises Salto de Roldán (&#x27;Roland&#x27;s Leap&#x27;), a natural rock formation about north of the city. Some writers have suggested that the official Spanish name of Huesca () derives from a Latin, Basque and Catalan word &quot;&quot;, meaning notch or indentation, referring to the Salto de Roldán.

Huesca celebrates its most important annual festival in August: the festival (or fiesta) of San Lorenzo (Saint Lawrence), a native of Huesca martyred in 268 AD. The anniversary of his martyrdom falls on August 10. The fiesta starts on 9 August and finishes on the 15. Many of the inhabitants dress in green and white for the duration.

The grille is the symbol of San Lorenzo and can be seen in a number of decorative works in the city.

<text>Teruel () is a city in Aragon, located in eastern Spain, and is also the capital of Teruel Province. It had a population of 35,900 as of 2022, making it the least populated provincial capital in Spain. It is noted for its harsh climate, with a wide daily variation on temperatures and its renowned &quot;jamón serrano&quot; (cured ham), its pottery, its surrounding archaeological sites, rock outcrops containing some of the oldest dinosaur remains of the Iberian Peninsula, and its famous events: &quot;La Vaquilla del Ángel&quot; during the weekend (Friday to Monday) closest to 10 July and &quot;Bodas de Isabel de Segura&quot; around the third weekend of February.

Teruel is regarded as the &quot;town of Mudéjar&quot; (Moorish-influenced architecture) due to numerous buildings designed in this style. All of them are comprised in the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO.
Teruel&#x27;s remote and mountainous location above sea level and its low population has led to relative isolation within Spain. A campaign group with the slogan &quot;Teruel existe&quot; (&quot;Teruel exists&quot;) was founded in 1999 to press for greater recognition and investment in the town and the province. Due in part to the campaign, transport connections to Teruel were improved with the construction of a motorway between Zaragoza and Sagunto. However, Teruel remains the only provincial capital in peninsular Spain without a direct road or railway link to the national capital, Madrid. A running joke in the Spanish online satirical publication El Mundo Today is that Teruel does not exist.

==History==

The area around Teruel has been populated since the times of the Celtiberians, who called it Turboleta. The place-name Turboleta could come from the Basque-Iberian term &quot;itur&quot; + &quot;olu&quot; + &quot;eta&quot; (place of the water source, spring), according to the theory of Basque-Iberism. The area was later occupied by the Romans, who left remains in nearby towns, such as Cella.

Some authors claim that in the location of the current city of Teruel (specifically its Jewish quarter) was originally called Tirwal, a name that would have come from the Arabic word meaning &quot;tower.&quot; A Muslim enclave is said to have existed in that location in the year 935. However, the corresponding archaeological sites found there belong to a defensive structure, not a population center.

On 1 October 1171, King Alfonso II captured Tirwal. He was threatened by the Almohads’ capture of Valencia, and wanted to strengthen the southern border of his kingdom. In the same year, he founded the city of Teruel, granting it fueros and privileges to facilitate the repopulation of the area.

The foundation of Teruel marked an unprecedented change in the political and territorial structure of southern Aragon. The predominance of Albarracín and Alfambra during the Muslim era was replaced by that of the newly-founded cities, Teruel in particular, to the detriment of Alfambra, which would remain in the background under the organizing principle of manorialism.

According to one legend, Teruel was founded when all the wise and important people of the town came together to look for signs and omens. The omen they found favorable was a bull, mooing from atop a high place with a star shining on it from above. The high place where they found the bull was eventually made into the town’s main square. According to some authors, the name of the city has its origins in this meeting, since the combination of the words “bull” (&quot;toro&quot;) and the name of the star, &quot;Actuel,&quot; would make &quot;Toroel,&quot; which could become &quot;Toruel.&quot; The legend of this encounter also explains the star and bull on the city’s flag and coat of arms.

The inhabitants of Teruel intervened in the conquest of Valencia, which had been in the hands of the Muslims, and in the War of the Two Peters against the Kingdom of Castile. The population was granted the title of city in 1347 by Pedro IV of Aragon for their support in the Battle of Épila. In the Middle Ages, the Jewish and Mudejar communities attained considerable importance within the social and economic life of the city, since their aljamas were consolidated towards the end of the 13th century. 
The Jewish Quarter of Teruel still preserves its name, and many archaeological sites have been found there. In the Middle Ages, Teruel possessed a prominent Jewish community, which was robust during the centuries Muslims were in power and enjoyed several privileges. Later on after the Christian reconquest of Spain, the Jewish community paid a yearly tax of 300 sueldos (in the 14th century). Its members were engaged in commerce and industry, especially in wool-weaving. During the persecutions of 1391 many of them were killed, while others accepted Christianity in order to save their lives.

Teruel was fought over in the Spanish Civil War, and much of the city was destroyed. The Battle of Teruel in December 1937-February 1938, was one of the bloodiest of the war. The town changed hands several times, first falling to the Republicans and eventually being re-taken by the Nationalists. In the course of the fighting, Teruel was subjected to heavy artillery and aerial bombardment. The two sides suffered up to 140,000 casualties between them in the three-month battle. The Nationalists won a decisive victory.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification, Teruel has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). Summer temperatures are warm to hot, although there is much daily variation, and winters are cool, with low minimum temperatures sometimes dropping to . The lowest amount of rainfall is in winter and the highest in late spring and mid autumn.

The temperature records registered at the Observatory of Teruel were on August 14, 2021 and on January 12, 2021.

==Main sights==
The beauty of the town&#x27;s cultural inheritance, which has some Islamic influence, has been recognised by UNESCO, which includes four churches in the World Heritage Site Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon, notably the town&#x27;s ornate cathedral in the Mudéjar style.

One of Teruel&#x27;s best known monuments is very small statue of a bull on top of a tall column, known as &quot;El Torico&quot; (&quot;the little bull&quot;). It is located in the main square, &quot;Plaza Carlos Castell&quot;, more commonly known as the &quot;Plaza del Torico&quot; in the middle of the town center.

Other sights include:

*&quot;Torre de El Salvador&quot; (14th century), in &quot;mudéjar&quot; style
*Cathedral: Catedral de Santa María de Teruel, in &quot;mudéjar&quot; style
*&quot;San Pedro&quot;, a &quot;mudéjar&quot; church (16th century) with a tower similar to that of the cathedral. It includes a mausoleum, Mausoleo de Los Amantes, housing the mummified bodies of Isabel de Segura (a wealthy woman) and Diego de Marcilla (a poor man who battled at Crusades to earn some money with the intention to return to get married with Isabel) whose love ended tragically. This story is known as &quot;los amantes de Teruel&quot; and has inspired writers (for example Hartzenbusch) and an opera composed by Tomás Bretón.
*Church of &quot;La Merced&quot;, with a bell tower in &quot;mudéjar&quot; style (the upper sector added later in Baroque style).
*Church of &quot;San Salvador&quot; (17th century), with one of the most outstanding &quot;mudéjar&quot; towers. It houses a 14th-century wooden sculpture of Christ.
*Church of &quot;San Martín&quot; (17th century).
*&quot;Torre de San Martín&quot; (14th century), in &quot;mudéjar&quot; style
*Church of &quot;San Miguel&quot; (12th century), remade in the 17th century in Baroque style.
*&quot;Castillo de Alambes&quot;, a 15th-century fortification built over the Arabic Alcazar.
*&quot;Casa El Torico&quot;, &quot;Casa Ferrán&quot; and &quot;Casa La Madrileña&quot;, 1910s liberty style houses
*Palace of the Marquis of Tosos (17th century)
*The Gothic church of St. Francis (1391–1492). It has a single nave with chapels covered by a ribbed vault with no crossing.
*&quot;Los Arcos&quot;, an aqueduct with two orders of arcade from 1538.

On the outskirts of Teruel is Dinópolis Teruel, a combined theme park and museum centred on dinosaurs. Promoted as a paleontological park, it includes a life-size robotic model of a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. Dinópolis also owns three other museums in the surrounding area, which display the remains of dinosaurs discovered in the region. The chimney of the Teruel Power Plant is one of the tallest freestanding structures in Western Europe.

==Education and research==

A branch of the University of Zaragoza is located in Teruel. The Aragon Center for Physics of the Cosmos (CEFCA in Spanish), which conducts research in astrophysics and cosmology is also located in Teruel. CEFCA operates the Astrophysical Observatory of Javalambre (OAJ), which is located in the south of the Teruel province and recognized as a national .

==Transportation==
Teruel Airport opened in 2013, after being repurposed from an original military airbase; it is primarily an aircraft storage and maintenance facility, with no passenger traffic.
==Sport==

<doc id="68300" wikidata="Q131896729" url="?curid=68300" title="Dominance (genetics)">
<text>Dominance is the phenomenon of one variant (allele) of a gene on a chromosome mask or overrides the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome. The first variant is termed dominant and the second is called recessive. This state of having two different variants of the same gene on each chromosome is originally caused by a mutation in one of the genes, either new (&quot;de novo&quot;) or inherited. The terms autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive are used to describe gene variants on non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) and their associated traits, while variants on sex chromosomes (allosomes) are termed X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive or Y-linked; these have an inheritance and presentation pattern that depends on the sex of both the parent and the child (see Sex linkage). Since there is only one copy of the Y chromosome, Y-linked traits cannot be dominant or recessive. Additionally, there are other forms of dominance, such as incomplete dominance, in which a gene variant has a partial effect compared to when it is present on both chromosomes, and co-dominance, in which different variants on each chromosome both show their associated traits.

Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. Letters and Punnett squares are used to demonstrate the principles of dominance in teaching, and the upper-case letters are used to denote dominant alleles and lower-case letters are used for recessive alleles. An often quoted example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas. Peas may be round, associated with allele R, or wrinkled, associated with allele &quot;r&quot;. In this case, three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible: RR, Rr, and rr. The RR (homozygous) individuals have round peas, and the rr (homozygous) individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr (heterozygous) individuals, the R allele masks the presence of the &quot;r&quot; allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is dominant over allele r, and allele r is recessive to allele R.

Dominance is not inherent to an allele or its traits (phenotype). It is a strictly relative effect between two alleles of a given gene of any function; one allele can be dominant over a second allele of the same gene, recessive to a third, and co-dominant with a fourth. Additionally, one allele may be dominant for one trait but not others. Dominance differs from epistasis, the phenomenon of an allele of one gene masking the effect of alleles of a &quot;different&quot; gene.

==Background==

Gregor Johann Mendel, &quot;The Father of Genetics&quot;, promulgated the idea of dominance in the 1860s. However, it was not widely known until the early twentieth century. Mendel observed that, for a variety of traits of garden peas having to do with the appearance of seeds, seed pods, and plants, there were two discrete phenotypes, such as round versus wrinkled seeds, yellow versus green seeds, red versus white flowers or tall versus short plants. When bred separately, the plants always produced the same phenotypes, generation after generation. However, when lines with different phenotypes were crossed (interbred), one and only one of the parental phenotypes showed up in the offspring (green, round, red, or tall). However, when these hybrid plants were crossed, the offspring plants showed the two original phenotypes, in a characteristic 3:1 ratio, the more common phenotype being that of the parental hybrid plants. Mendel reasoned that each parent in the first cross was a homozygote for different alleles (one parent AA and the other parent aa), that each contributed one allele to the offspring, with the result that all of these hybrids were heterozygotes (Aa), and that one of the two alleles in the hybrid cross dominated expression of the other: A masked a. The final cross between two heterozygotes (Aa X Aa) would produce AA, Aa, and aa offspring in a 1:2:1 genotype ratio with the first two classes showing the (A) phenotype, and the last showing the (a) phenotype, thereby producing the 3:1 phenotype ratio.

Mendel did not use the terms gene, allele, phenotype, genotype, homozygote, and heterozygote, all of which were introduced later. He did introduce the notation of capital and lowercase letters for dominant and recessive alleles, respectively, still in use today.

In 1928, British population geneticist Ronald Fisher proposed that dominance acted based on natural selection through the contribution of modifier genes. In 1929, American geneticist Sewall Wright responded by stating that dominance is simply a physiological consequence of metabolic pathways and the relative necessity of the gene involved.

==Types of dominance==

===Complete dominance (Mendelian)===
In complete dominance, the effect of one allele in a heterozygous genotype completely masks the effect of the other. The allele that masks are considered &quot;dominant&quot; to the other allele, and the masked allele is considered &quot;recessive&quot;.

When we only look at one trait determined by one pair of genes, we call it monohybrid inheritance. If the crossing is done between parents (P-generation, F0-generation) who are homozygote dominant and homozygote recessive, the offspring (F1-generation) will always have the heterozygote genotype and always present the phenotype associated with the dominant gene.

However, if the F1-generation is further crossed with the F1-generation (heterozygote crossed with heterozygote) the offspring (F2-generation) will present the phenotype associated with the dominant gene ¾ times. Although heterozygote monohybrid crossing can result in two phenotype variants, it can result in three genotype variants -  homozygote dominant, heterozygote and homozygote recessive, respectively.

In dihybrid inheritance we look at the inheritance of two pairs of genes simultaneous. Assuming here that the two pairs of genes are located at non-homologous chromosomes, such that they are not coupled genes (see genetic linkage) but instead inherited independently. Consider now the cross between parents (P-generation) of genotypes homozygote dominant and recessive, respectively. The offspring (F1-generation) will always heterozygous and present the phenotype associated with the dominant allele variant.

However, when crossing the F1-generation there are four possible phenotypic possibilities and the phenotypical ratio for the F2-generation will always be 9:3:3:1.
===Incomplete dominance (non-Mendelian)===


Incomplete dominance (also called &quot;partial dominance&quot;, &quot;semi-dominance&quot;, &quot;intermediate inheritance&quot;, or occasionally incorrectly &quot;co-dominance&quot; in reptile genetics) occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes. The phenotypic result often appears as a blended form of characteristics in the heterozygous state. For example, the snapdragon flower color is homozygous for either red or white. When the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower, the result yields a pink snapdragon flower. The pink snapdragon is the result of incomplete dominance. A similar type of incomplete dominance is found in the four o&#x27;clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true-bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed. In quantitative genetics, where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically, if a heterozygote&#x27;s phenotype is exactly between (numerically) that of the two homozygotes, the phenotype is said to exhibit &quot;no dominance&quot; at all, i.e. dominance exists only when the heterozygote&#x27;s phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other.

When plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Pink:White).

===Co-dominance (non-Mendelian)===


Co-dominance occurs when the contributions of both alleles are visible in the phenotype and neither allele masks another.

For example, in the ABO blood group system, chemical modifications to a glycoprotein (the H antigen) on the surfaces of blood cells are controlled by three alleles, two of which are co-dominant to each other (&quot;IA&quot;, &quot;IB&quot;) and dominant over the recessive &quot;i&quot; at the ABO locus. The &quot;IA&quot; and &quot;IB&quot; alleles produce different modifications. The enzyme coded for by &quot;IA&quot; adds an N-acetylgalactosamine to a membrane-bound H antigen. The &quot;IB&quot; enzyme adds a galactose. The &quot;i&quot; allele produces no modification. Thus the &quot;IA&quot; and &quot;IB&quot; alleles are each dominant to &quot;i&quot; (&quot;IAIA&quot; and &quot;IAi&quot; individuals both have type A blood, and &quot;IBIB&quot; and &quot;IBi&quot; individuals both have type B blood), but &quot;IAIB&quot; individuals have both modifications on their blood cells and thus have type AB blood, so the &quot;IA&quot; and &quot;IB&quot; alleles are said to be co-dominant.

Another example occurs at the locus for the beta-globin component of hemoglobin, where the three molecular phenotypes of &quot;HbA/HbA&quot;, &quot;HbA/HbS&quot;, and &quot;HbS/HbS&quot; are all distinguishable by protein electrophoresis. (The medical condition produced by the heterozygous genotype is called &quot;sickle-cell trait&quot; and is a milder condition distinguishable from &quot;sickle-cell anemia&quot;, thus the alleles show &quot;incomplete dominance&quot; concerning anemia, see above). For most gene loci at the molecular level, both alleles are expressed co-dominantly, because both are transcribed into RNA.

Co-dominance, where allelic products co-exist in the phenotype, is different from incomplete dominance, where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype. For example, in co-dominance, a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots. When plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Spotted:White). These ratios are the same as those for incomplete dominance. Again, this classical terminology is inappropriate – in reality, such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all.

==Relationship to other genetic concepts==
Dominance can be influenced by various genetic interactions and it is essential to evaluate them when determining phenotypic outcomes. Multiple alleles, epistasis and pleiotropic genes are some factors that might influence the phenotypic outcome.

===Multiple alleles===
Although any individual of a diploid organism has at most two different alleles at a given locus, most genes exist in a large number of allelic versions in the population as a whole. This is called polymorphism, and is caused by mutations. Polymorphism can have an effect on the dominance relationship and phenotype, which is observed in the ABO blood group system. The gene responsible for human blood type have three alleles; A, B, and O, and their interactions result in different blood types based on the level of dominance the alleles expresses towards each other.

=== Pleiotropic genes ===

Pleiotropic genes are genes where one single gene affects two or more characters (phenotype). This means that a gene can have a dominant effect on one trait, but a more recessive effect on another trait.

===Epistasis===

Epistasis is interactions between multiple alleles at different loci. Easily said, several genes for one phenotype. The dominance relationship between alleles involved in epistatic interactions can influence the observed phenotypic ratios in offspring.

<doc id="68301" wikidata="Q172317" url="?curid=68301" title="Hijab">
<text>In modern usage, hijab (, ) refers to head coverings worn by Muslim women. Similar to the mitpaḥat/tichel or snood worn by religious married Jewish women, certain headcoverings worn by some Christian women, such as the hanging veil, apostolnik and kapp, and the dupatta favored by many Hindu and Sikh women, the hijab comes in various forms.

The term describes a scarf that is wrapped around the head, covering the hair, neck, and ears while leaving the face visible. The use of the hijab has grown globally since the 1970s, with many Muslims viewing it as a symbol of modesty and faith; it is also worn as a form of adornment. There is consensus among Islamic religious scholars that covering the head is required. In practice, most Muslim women choose to wear it.

The term was originally used to denote a partition and was sometimes used for Islamic rules of modesty. In the verses of the Qur&#x27;an, the term sometimes refers to a curtain separating visitors to Muhammad&#x27;s main house from his wives&#x27; lodgings. This has led some revisionists to claim that the mandate of the Qur&#x27;an applied only to the wives of Muhammad and not to all women. Another interpretation can also refer to the seclusion of women from men in the public sphere, whereas a metaphysical dimension may refer to &quot;the veil which separates man, or the world, from God&quot;. The Qur&#x27;an never uses the word &quot;hijab&quot; (lit. &#x27;barrier&#x27;) to refer to women&#x27;s clothing, but rather discusses the attire of women using other terms, such as Jilbāb and &quot;khimār&quot; (generic headscarf).

There is variation in interpretations regarding the extent of covering required. Some legal systems accept the hijab as an order to cover everything except the face and hands, whilst others accept it as an order to cover the whole body, including the face and hands, via niqab. These guidelines are found in texts of hadith and fiqh developed after the revelation of the Qur&#x27;an. Some state that these guidelines are aligned with Qur&#x27;anic verses (ayahs) about hijab, while others interpret them differently with various conclusions on the extent of the mandate.

Islamic veiling practices vary globally based on local laws and customs. In some regions, the hijab is mandated by law, while in others, its use is subject to restrictions or bans in both Europe and some Muslim countries. Additionally, women face informal pressure regarding their choice to wear or not wear the hijab. Muslim women often face heightened discrimination particularly in workplaces, a trend intensified after the rise of Islamophobia post-9/11. Hijab-wearing women face overt and covert prejudice, with covert bias often leading to hostile treatment. Studies show perceived discrimination can harm well-being but is often overcome by religious pride and community, with hijab-wearing women finding strength and belonging.

==Etymology==
The Arabic word hijab () is the verbal noun originating from the verb (hajaba), from the triliteral root (H-J-B), which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of hide, conceal, block.

==In Islamic scripture==
===Qur&#x27;an===
About seven verses address the way a woman should dress when walking in public; Muslims have differed as how to understand these verses; Sunni and twelver Shia scholars say hijab is mandatory, while Ismaili Shias, accounting for ~0.25% of all Muslims, believe it is not.

Qur&#x27;anic verses relating to dress materials use the &quot;khimār&quot; which translates to “headscarf” in English, coverings worn by women in Arabia at the advent of Islam mostly to protect against the hot sun and desert; by some, it is a headcovering and &quot;jilbāb&quot; (a dress or cloak) rather than &quot;ḥijāb&quot;.

The clearest verses on this topic are , telling both men and women to dress and act modestly, with more detail on women&#x27;s position.
In Luxenberg&#x27;s Syro-Aramaic reading, the verse instead commands women to &quot;snap their belts around their waists&quot; as an idiom, the belt was a symbol for chastity. According to him, the meanings of the words in the relevant part of the verse are as follows: Khimar; cummerbund, jyb; sinus, sac, ; &quot;let them hit.&quot; 

In Al-Aḥzāb: 59, there is a statement that tells women to wear their &quot;outer garments&quot; when going out for various needs (such as defecation), interpreted by some as a command and by others as a recommendation of protective measures against sexual harassment in Medina. The word used in the verse is the plural form of jilbab (), which translates to &quot;cloak&quot; in English. This verse was legislated after the hijrah to Medina; most Muslim scholars consider the jilbab described not to include the face, although a small group believe covering the face is included. The exact wording in Arabic () literally translates to &quot;so that they will be recognized and not be harmed.&quot;

According to the narrations and the most well-known explanation of the verse, the verse was an expression directed towards free and Muslim women, not slaves or non-Muslim women, for which Tabari cites Ibn Abbas. Ibn Kathir states that the &quot;jilbab&quot; was distinguishing free Muslim women from those of Jahiliyyah, so other men know they are free women and not slaves or prostitutes, so they are not harassed. Al-Qurtubi concurs with Tabari about this ayah being for those who are free. It is reported that Umar prohibited female slaves from resembling free women by covering their hair. Some later scholars like Ibn Hayyan, Ibn Hazm and Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani questioned cited common explanation. Ibn Hayyan believed that &quot;believing women&quot; referred to both free women and slaves as the latter are bound to more easily entice lust and their exclusion is not clearly indicated. Ibn Hazm too believed that it covered Muslim slaves as it would violate the law of not molesting a slave or fornication with her like that with a free woman. He stated that anything not attributed to Muhammad should be disregarded.

What is said about the dimensions of the Jilbab in use varies; Qurtubi reports that a &quot;jilbab&quot; covers the whole body. He also cites the Sahabah as saying it is no longer than a &quot;rida&quot; (a shawl or a wrap that covers the upper body). He also reports a minority view which considers the niqab or head-covering as jilbab. Ibn Arabi considered that excessive covering would make it impossible for a woman to be recognised which the verse mentions, though both Qurtubi and Tabari agree that the word recognition is about distinguishing free women.

The word &quot;ḥijāb&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an refers not to women&#x27;s clothing, but rather a spatial partition or curtain. Sometimes its use is literal, as in the verse which refers to the screen that separated Muhammad&#x27;s wives from the visitors to his house (33:53), while in other cases the word denotes separation between deity and mortals (42:51), wrongdoers and righteous (7:46, 41:5), believers and unbelievers (17:45), and light from darkness (38:32). The interpretations of the &quot;ḥijāb&quot; as separation can be classified into three types: as visual barrier, physical barrier, and ethical barrier. A visual barrier (for example, between Muhammad&#x27;s family and the surrounding community) serves to hide from sight something, which places emphasis on a symbolic boundary. A physical barrier is used to create a space that provides comfort and privacy for individuals, such as elite women. An ethical barrier, such as the expression &quot;purity of hearts&quot; in reference to Muhammad&#x27;s wives and the Muslim men who visit them, makes something forbidden.

===Hadith ===
The Hadiths sources specify the details of hijab for men and women, exegesis of the Qur&#x27;anic verses attributed to the sahabah, and are a major source which Muslim legal scholars used to derive rulings. Sahih al-Bukhari records Aisha saying:
Aisha also reported that when was revealed,
 Although these narrations imply black clothing, other narrations indicate wives of the prophet also wore other colored-clothes like yellow or rose.

====Shape and extent according to hadiths====
* Safiya bint Shaiba, said that &#x27;A&#x27;ishah mentioned the women of Ansar, praised them and said good words about them. She then said: When Surat an-Nur came down, they took the curtains, tore them and made head covers (veils) of them.. This hadith is often translated as &quot;...and covered their heads and faces with the cut pieces of cloth,&quot; Some commentators, such as Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani in Fatḥ al-Bārī, claimed that covering also covers the face, based on the word () in the text of this hadith.

* According to some hadiths from Bukhari, Abu Dawud and Nasai, during the time of Prophet, male and female Muslims were performing ablution from the same water bowl. “We used to perform ablution collectively, men and women, by lowering and dipping our hands into the same bowl.” indicating that women could perform ablution in the presence of men. In this case, the arms up to the elbows, feet, face and the part of the head that are essential for ablution and wiping can be considered as free zones.

=====In prayer=====
* Yahya related to me from Malik from Muhammad ibn Zayd ibn Qunfudh that his mother asked Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &quot;What clothes can a woman wear in prayer?&quot; She said, &quot;She can pray in the khimār and the diri&#x27; (, ) that reaches down and covers the top of her feet.&quot;
* Aishah narrated that Allah&#x27;s Messenger said: &quot;The Salat of a woman who has reached the age of menstruation is not accepted without a khimār.&quot;

== Dress code ==

Muslim scholars usually require women to cover everything but their hands and face in public, but do not require the &quot;niqab&quot; (a face covering worn by some Muslim women). In nearly all Muslim cultures, pre-pubescent girls are not required to wear a hijab. Some scholars argue that beyond the body of a woman, her voice is also a part of her &quot;awrah&quot; and should not be heard by men outside her immediate family. They cite some hadiths citing women&#x27;s voices as a source of temptation and fitna (charmingness, attractiveness) and should be kept private and some verse interpretations.

===Sunni===
In Sunni tradition, scholarly consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;&#x27;) has discerned hijab is mandatory. The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki and Hanbali) believe that it is obligatory for free women to cover their hair, and the entire body except her face and hands, while in the presence of people of the opposite sex other than close family members.

According to Hanafis and other scholars, these requirements extend to being around non-Muslim women as well, for fear that they may describe her physical features to unrelated men. The Sunni Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas in Saudi Arabia, and Muhammad ibn Adam Al-Kawthari also believe women should cover their head.

Men must cover from their belly buttons to their knees, though the schools differ on whether this includes covering the navel and knees or only what is between them.

It is recommended that women wear clothing that is not form fitting to the body, such as modest forms of Western clothing (long shirts and skirts), or the more traditional &quot;jilbāb&quot;, a high-necked, loose robe that covers the arms and legs. A &quot;khimār&quot; or &quot;shaylah&quot;, a scarf or cowl that covers all but the face, is also worn in many different styles.

===Shia===
In Shia jurisprudence, by consensus, it is obligatory for women to cover their hair, and the entire body except her hands and face, while in the presence of people of the opposite sex other than close family members.
The major and most important Shia hadith collections such as Nahj Al-Balagha and Kitab Al-Kafi for the most part do not give any details about hijab requirements. However a quotation from Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqih Musa al-Kadhim in reply to his brother makes reference to female hijab requirements during the salat (prayer), stating &quot;She covers her body and head with it then prays. And if her feet protrude from beneath, and she doesn&#x27;t have the means to prevent that, there is no harm&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===

In private, and in the presence of close relatives (&quot;mahrams&quot;), rules on dress relax. However, in the presence of the husband, most scholars stress the importance of mutual freedom and pleasure of the husband and wife.

Traditional scholars had differences of opinion on covering the hands and face. The majority adopted the opinion that the face and hands are not part of their nakedness. Some held the opinion that covering the face is recommended if the woman&#x27;s beauty is so great that it is distracting and causes temptation or public discord.

===Alternative views===
Leila Ahmed argues that head covering in Islam should not be seen as mandatory since it existed before the revelation of the Qur’an. It was introduced to Arabia through Arab interactions with Syria and Iran, where the hijab represented social status. Women who did not work in fields could afford to be secluded and veiled. Among her arguments is that while some Qur&#x27;anic verses enjoin women in general to &quot;draw their Jilbabs (overgarment or cloak) around them to be recognized as believers and so that no harm will come to them&quot; and &quot;guard their private parts ... and drape down &quot;khimar&quot; over their breasts [when in the presence of unrelated men]&quot;, they urge modesty. The word &quot;khimar&quot; or “veil” refers to a piece of cloth that was popularly used to cover the head in ancient Arabia. While the term &quot;hijab&quot; was originally anything that was used to conceal, it became used to refer to concealing garments worn by women outside the house, specifically the headscarf or khimar.

Modernist thinkers including Karen Armstrong, Reza Aslan and Leila Ahmed, believe the requirements of the hijab were initially intended solely for Muhammad&#x27;s wives, serving to preserve their sanctity. This was because Muhammad conducted religious and civic matters in the mosque next to his home. Leila Ahmed further explains that Muhammad aimed at fostering a sense of privacy and protecting the intimate space of his wives from the constant presence of the bustling community at their doorstep. They argue that the term &quot;darabat al-hijab&quot; (&#x27;taking the veil&#x27;) was used synonymously and interchangeably with ‘becoming Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s wife’ and that during Muhammad&#x27;s life no other Muslim woman wore the hijab. Aslan suggests that Muslim women started to wear the hijab to emulate Muhammad&#x27;s wives, who are revered as &quot;Mothers of the Believers&quot; in Islam, and states &quot;there was no tradition of veiling until around 627 C.E.&quot; in the Muslim community. The latter claim is widely disproved.
Khaled Abou El Fadl argues that all Islamic moderates agree that, in all cases, the decision whether to wear the hijab should be a woman&#x27;s autonomous decision
and that her choice must be respected because the moderate pro-choice position is based on the Quranic teachings that there ought to be no compulsion in religion.
Many scholars argue that these contemporary views and arguments, however, contradict the hadith sources, the classical scholars, exegesis sources, historical consensus, and interpretations of the companions (such as Aisha and Abdullah ibn Masud). Some traditionalist Muslim scholars accept the contemporary views and arguments as those hadith sources are not sahih and ijma would no longer be applicable if it is argued by scholars (even if it is argued by only one scholar). Notable examples of traditionalist Muslim scholars who accept these contemporary views include the Indonesian scholar Quraish Shihab.

==Contemporary practice==
The styles and practices of hijab vary widely across the world. An opinion poll conducted in 2014 by The University of Michigan&#x27;s Institute for Social Research asked residents of seven Muslim-majority countries (Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia) which style of women&#x27;s dress they considered to be most appropriate in public. The survey found that the headscarf (in its tightly- or loosely-fitting form) was chosen by the majority of respondents in Egypt, Iraq, Tunisia and Turkey. The response rate for people of Turkey was just about 60%. In Saudi Arabia, 63% gave preference to the &quot;niqab&quot; face veil; in Pakistan the &quot;niqab&quot;, the full-length &quot;chador&quot; robe and the headscarf, received about a third of the votes each; while in Lebanon half of the respondents in the sample (which included Christians and Druze) opted for no head covering at all. The survey found &quot;no significant difference&quot; in the preferences between surveyed men and women, except in Pakistan, where more men favoured conservative women&#x27;s dress. However, women more strongly support women&#x27;s right to choose how to dress. People with university education are less conservative in their choice than those without one, and more supportive of women&#x27;s right to decide their dress style, except in Saudi Arabia.

Some fashion-conscious women have been turning to non-traditional forms of hijab such as turbans. While some regard turbans as a proper head cover, others argue that it cannot be considered a proper Islamic veil if it leaves the neck exposed.

In Iran, where wearing the hijab is legally required, many women push the boundaries of the state-mandated dress code, risking a fine or a spell in detention. The former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani had vowed to rein in the morality police and their presence on the streets has decreased since he took office, but the powerful conservative forces in the country have resisted his efforts, and the dress codes are still being enforced, especially during the summer months. After Ebrahim Raisi became president, he started imposing hijab laws strictly, announcing use of facial recognition in public transport to enforce hijab law. An Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, died in custody of &#x27;morality police&#x27; after they arrested her on new stricter hijab laws, which led to widespread protests. Women&#x27;s resistance in Iran is gaining traction as an increasing number of women challenge the mandatory wearing of the hijab. Smith (2017) addressed the progress that Iranian women have made in her article, &quot;Iran surprises by realizing Islamic dress code for women,&quot; published by &quot;The Times&quot;, a news organization based in the UK. The Iranian government has enforced their penal dress codes less strictly and instead of imprisonment as a punishment have implemented mandatory reform classes in the liberal capital, Tehran. General Hossein Rahimi, the Tehran&#x27;s police chief stated, &quot;Those who do not observe the Islamic dress code will no longer be taken to detention centers, nor will judicial cases be filed against them&quot; (Smith, 2017). The remarks of Tehran&#x27;s recent police chief in 2017 reflect political progress in contrast with the remarks of Tehran&#x27;s 2006 police chief. Iranian women activists have made a headway since 1979 relying on fashion to enact cultural and political change.

In Turkey the hijab was formerly banned in private and state universities and schools. The ban applied not to the scarf wrapped around the neck, traditionally worn by Anatolian villager women, but to the head covering pinned neatly at the sides, called &quot;türban&quot; in Turkey, which has been adopted by a growing number of educated urban women since the 1980s. As of the mid-2000s, over 60% of Turkish women covered their head outside home. However the majority of those wear a traditional, non-Islamic head covering and only 11% wore a &quot;türban&quot;. The ban was lifted from universities in 2008, from government buildings in 2013, and from schools in 2014.

The hijab is also a common cultural practice for Muslims in the West. For example, in a 2016 Environics poll, a large majority (73%) of Canadian Muslim women reported wearing some sort of head-covering in public (58% wear the hijab, 13% wear the chador and 2% wear the niqab). Wearing a head covering in public had increased since the 2006 survey. Women who wear the Hijab may be called &quot;hijabi&quot;.

Meanwhile, in a Pew Research Center poll from 2011, most Muslim American women also reported wearing hijab, 36% indicating they wore hijab whenever they were in public, with an additional 24% saying they wore it most or some of the time; 40% said they never wore hijab.

==History==
===Pre-Islamic veiling practices===
Veiling did not originate with the advent of Islam. Statuettes depicting veiled priestesses date back as far as 2500 BC. Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status. In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit sumptuary laws detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman&#x27;s class, rank, and occupation in society. Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so. Veiling was thus not only a marker of aristocratic rank, but also served to &quot;differentiate between &#x27;respectable&#x27; women and those who were publicly available&quot;.

Strict seclusion and the veiling of matrons were also customary in ancient Greece. Between 550 and 323 BCE, prior to Christianity, respectable women in classical Greek society were expected to seclude themselves and wear clothing that concealed them from the eyes of strange men. Roman pagan custom included the practice of the head covering worn by the priestesses of Vesta (Vestal Virgins).

It is not clear whether the Hebrew Bible contains prescriptions with regard to veiling, but rabbinic literature presents it as a question of modesty (&quot;tzniut&quot;). Modesty became an important rabbinic virtue in the early Roman period, and it may have been intended to distinguish Jewish women from their non-Jewish counterparts in Babylonian and later in Greco-Roman society. According to rabbinical precepts, married Jewish women have to cover their hair (cf. &quot;Mitpaḥat&quot;). The surviving representations of veiled Jewish women may reflect general Roman customs rather than particular Jewish practices. According to Fadwa El Guindi, at the inception of Christianity, Jewish women were veiling their heads and faces.

The best-known view on Christian headcovering is delineated in the Bible within the passage in 1 Corinthians 11:4–7, which states that &quot;every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head&quot;. The early Church Fathers, including Tertullian of Carthage, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus of Rome, John Chrysostom and Augustine of Hippo attested in their writings that Christian women should wear a headcovering, while men should pray with their heads uncovered. There is archaeological evidence demonstrating that headcovering was observed as an ordinance by women in early Christianity, and the practice of Christian headcovering continues among female adherents of many Christian denominations today, especially among Anabaptist Christians, as well as among certain Eastern Orthodox Christians, Oriental Orthodox Christians and Reformed Christians, among others.

In the Indian subcontinent, some Hindu women cover their heads with a veil in a practice known as &quot;ghoonghat&quot;.

Intermixing of populations resulted in a convergence of the cultural practices of Greek, Persian, and Mesopotamian empires and the Semitic peoples of the Middle East. Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses. In the rural areas it was common to cover the hair, but not the face.

According to Leila Ahmed, the rigid norms pertaining to veiling and seclusion of women found in Christian Byzantine literature had been influenced by ancient Persian traditions, and there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice. Leila Ahmed argues that &quot;Whatever the cultural source or sources, a fierce misogyny was a distinct ingredient of Mediterranean and eventually Christian thought in the centuries immediately preceding the rise of Islam.&quot;

===During Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime===
Available evidence suggests that veiling was not introduced into Arabia by Prophet Muhammad, but already existed there, particularly in the towns, although it was probably not as widespread as in the neighbouring countries such as Syria and Palestine. Similarly to the practice among Greeks, Romans (Byzantines), Jews, and Assyrians, its use was associated with high social status. In early Islamic texts, the term &quot;hijab&quot; does not distinguish between veiling and seclusion, and can mean either &quot;veil&quot; or &quot;curtain&quot;. This is largely because khimar, the literal word for headscarf, was used to refer to the cover more often than the term &quot;hijab&quot; at the time. The only verses in the Qur&#x27;an that specifically reference women&#x27;s clothing are those promoting modesty, instructing women to observe the jilbab, guard their private parts and draw their headscarves over their breast area in the presence of men. The contemporary understanding of the hijab dates back to Hadith when the &quot;verse of the hijab&quot; descended upon the community in 627 CE. Now documented in Sura 33:53, the verse states, &quot;And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts&quot;. As Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s influence increased, he entertained more and more visitors in the mosque, which was then his home. Often, these visitors stayed the night only feet away from his wives&#x27; apartments. It is commonly understood that this verse was intended to protect his wives from these strangers.

===Later pre-modern history===
During the history of slavery in the Muslim world, it is known that female slaves did show themselves unveiled. Slave women were visually identified by their way of dress. While Islamic law dictated that a free Muslim woman should veil herself entirely, except for her face and hands, in order to hide her awrah (intimate parts) and avoid sexual harassment, the awrah of slave women were defined differently, and she was only to cover between her navel and her knee. 
This difference became even more prominent during the Abbasid Caliphate, when free Muslim women, in particular those of the upper classes, were subjected to even more sex segregation and harem seclusion, in contrast to the qiyan slave artists, who performed unveiled in male company.

The practice of veiling was borrowed from the elites of the Byzantine and Persian empires, where it was a symbol of respectability and high social status, during the Arab conquests of those empires. Reza Aslan argues that &quot;The veil was neither compulsory nor widely adopted until generations after Muhammad&#x27;s death, when a large body of male scriptural and legal scholars began using their religious and political authority to regain the dominance they had lost in society as a result of the Prophet&#x27;s egalitarian reforms&quot;.

Because Islam identified with the monotheistic religions of the conquered empires, the practice was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur&#x27;anic ideals regarding modesty and piety. Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities. Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields. Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, &quot;a veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle.&quot;

By the 19th century, upper-class urban Muslim and Christian women in Egypt wore a garment which included a head cover and a &quot;burqa&quot; (muslin cloth that covered the lower nose and the mouth). The name of this garment, &quot;harabah&quot;, derives from early Christian and Judaic religious vocabulary, which may indicate the origins of the garment itself. Up to the first half of the twentieth century, rural women in the Maghreb and Egypt put on a form of &quot;niqab&quot; when they visited urban areas, &quot;as a sign of civilization&quot;.

===Modern history===

Western clothing largely dominated fashion in Muslim countries in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, some women wore short skirts, flower printed hippie dresses, flared trousers, and went out in public without the hijab. This changed following the Soviet–Afghan War, military dictatorship in Pakistan, and Iranian revolution of 1979, when traditional conservative attire including the abaya, jilbab and niqab made a comeback. There were demonstrations in Iran in March 1979 after the hijab law, decreeing that women in Iran would have to wear scarves to leave the house, was brought in. However, this phenomenon did not happen in all countries with a significant Muslim population; in Turkey there has been a decline on women wearing the hijab in recent years, although under Erdoğan Turkey is becoming more conservative and Islamic, as Turkey repeals the Atatürk-era hijab ban, and the founding of new fashion companies catering to women who want to dress more conservatively.

Egyptian leader President Gamal Abdel Nasser claimed that, in 1953, he was told by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood organization that they wanted to enforce the wearing of the hijab, to which Nasser responded, &quot;Sir, I know you have a daughter in college, and she doesn&#x27;t wear a headscarf or anything! Why don&#x27;t you make her wear the headscarf? So you can&#x27;t make one girl, your own daughter, wear it, and yet you want me to go and make ten million women wear it?&quot;

The late-twentieth century saw a resurgence of the hijab in Egypt after a long period of decline as a result of westernization. Already in the mid-1970s some college aged Muslim men and women began a movement meant to reunite and rededicate themselves to the Islamic faith. This movement was named the Sahwah, or awakening, and sparked a period of heightened religiosity that began to be reflected in the dress code.
The uniform adopted by the young female pioneers of this movement was named al-Islāmī (Islamic dress) and was made up of an &quot;al-jilbāb—an unfitted, long-sleeved, ankle-length gown in austere solid colors and thick opaque fabric—and al-khimār, a head cover resembling a nun&#x27;s wimple that covers the hair low to the forehead, comes under the chin to conceal the neck, and falls down over the chest and back&quot;. In addition to the basic garments that were mostly universal within the movement, additional measures of modesty could be taken depending on how conservative the followers wished to be. Some women choose to also utilize a face covering (niqāb) that leaves only eye slits for sight, as well as both gloves and socks in order to reveal no visible skin.

Soon this movement expanded outside of the youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice. Women viewed this way of dress as a way to both publicly announce their religious beliefs as well as a way to simultaneously reject Western influences of dress and culture that were prevalent at the time. Despite many criticisms of the practice of hijab being oppressive and detrimental to women&#x27;s equality, many Muslim women view the way of dress to be a positive thing. It is seen as a way to avoid harassment and unwanted sexual advances in public and works to desexualize women in the public sphere in order to instead allow them to enjoy equal rights of complete legal, economic, and political status. This modesty was not only demonstrated by their chosen way of dress but also by their serious demeanor which worked to show their dedication to modesty and Islamic beliefs.

Controversy erupted over the practice. Many people, both men and women from backgrounds of both Islamic and non-Islamic faith questioned the hijab and what it stood for in terms of women and their rights. There was questioning of whether in practice the hijab was truly a female choice or if women were being coerced or pressured into wearing it.

As the awakening movement gained momentum, its goals matured and shifted from promoting modesty towards more of a political stance in terms of retaining support for Pan-Islamism and a symbolic rejection of Western culture and norms. Today the hijab means many different things for different people. For Islamic women who choose to wear the hijab it allows them to retain their modesty, morals and freedom of choice.

After the September 11 attacks, the discussion and discourse on the hijab in Western nations intensified as Islamic traditions and theology came under greater scrutiny, with Hijabis facing extensive discrimination. According to the Harvard University Pluralism Project: &quot;Some Muslim women cover their head only during prayer in the mosque; other Muslim women wear the hijab; still others may cover their head with a turban or a loosely draped scarf.&quot;

==Around the world==
Some governments encourage and even oblige women to wear the hijab, while others have banned it in at least some public settings. In many parts of the world women also experience informal pressure for or against wearing the hijab, including physical attacks.

===Legal enforcement===
In Gaza, there was a campaign by religious conservatives such as Hamas to impose the hijab on women during the First Intifada. In 1990, the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) declared that it rejected the imposition of a hijab policy for women, and targeted those who seek to impose the hijab, but that declaration was argued to have come too late, as many women had already yielded to the pressure in order to avoid harassment. After assuming the government in the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Hamas sought to enforce Islamic law, imposing the hijab on women at courts, institutions and schools.

Iran transitioned from banning veils in 1936 to mandating Islamic dress for women following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. By 1980, veiling was required in government and educational settings, with the 1983 penal code imposing 74 lashes for not adhering to the hijab, though the exact requirements were unclear. This led to public tensions and vigilante actions regarding proper hijab. Subsequent regulations in 1984 and 1988 clarified dress-code standards, and the current penal code prescribes fines or prison terms for failing to observe hijab, without detailing its specific form.
The enforcement of the dress code in Iran has fluctuated between strict and relaxed over the years, leading to ongoing debate between conservatives and reformists like Hassan Rouhani. The United Nations Human Rights Council has urged Iran to uphold the rights of those advocating for dress code reforms. Government and religious institutions mandate the khimar headscarf and overcoat, while women in other public areas often wear a loosely tied headscarf. The government officially promotes stricter veiling, citing both Islamic principles and pre-Islamic Iranian culture.

Ruhollah Khomeini maintained that women do not have to wear a full-body cover. He stated that women can choose any kind of attire they like so long as it covers them properly and they have a hijab. His successor, Ali Khamenei, stated that the hijab does not hinder participation in social, political, or academic activities. In 2024, the former president of Iran Hassan Rouhani criticised the reinstatement of Iran&#x27;s morality police and the implementation of the &quot;Noor plan&quot; by law enforcement authorities. He expressed shock over the hijab law approved by the Guardian Council which predicted severe punishment for those violating it, saying that it &quot;aligns neither with the Constitution, nor with justice, nor with the Qur&#x27;an and Islamic culture.&quot;

The Indonesian province of Aceh encourages Muslim women to wear hijab in public. Indonesia&#x27;s central government granted Aceh&#x27;s local government the right to impose Sharia in 2001, although that no local regulations should conflict with Indonesian national laws, in a deal aiming to put an end to the separatist movement in the province.

Saudi Arabia formally required women to cover their hair and wear a full-body garment, though enforcement varies. Saudi women typically wear the abaya, while foreigners may choose long coats. Regulations are enforced by religious police, which once faced criticism for their role in a fire rescue where schoolgirls&#x27; lack of hijabs was reportedly a factor, leading to 15 deaths. In 2018, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman stated that women must wear &#x27;decent, respectful clothing,&#x27; and that women are free to decide what form it should take, though the hijab remains mandatory in Mecca and Medina which hosts the holiest sites in Islam.

During the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the wearing of the hijab is mandated for women. The requirement extends to covering not only their heads but also their faces, as it was believed that doing so would prevent any perceived impropriety and maintain modesty in society.

===Legal bans===
==== Muslim world ====
The tradition of veiling hair in Persian culture has ancient pre-Islamic origins, but the widespread custom was ended by Reza Shah&#x27;s government in 1936, as the hijab was considered to be incompatible with modernization and he ordered &quot;unveiling&quot; act or Kashf-e hijab. In some cases the police arrested women who wore the veil and would forcibly remove it. These policies had popular support but outraged the Shi&#x27;a clerics, to whom appearing in public without their cover was tantamount to nakedness. Some women refused to leave the house out of fear of being assaulted by Reza Shah&#x27;s police. In 1941, the compulsory element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned.

Turkey had a ban on headscarves at universities until recently. In 2008, the Turkish government attempted to lift a ban on Muslim headscarves at universities, but were overturned by the country&#x27;s Constitutional Court. In December 2010, however, the Turkish government ended the headscarf ban in universities and schools. The ban for civil servants remains in place.

In Tunisia, women were banned from wearing the hijab in state offices in 1981; in the 1980s and 1990s, more restrictions were put in place.

In June 2024, Tajikistan&#x27;s parliament passed a bill banning &quot;foreign clothing&quot; and religious celebrations for children during the Islamic holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The upper house, Majlisi Milli, approved the legislation on June 19, following approval by the lower house, Majlisi Namoyandagon, on May 8. The bill specifically targets the hijab, a traditional Islamic headscarf. This formalization of restrictions comes after years of Tajikistan unofficially discouraging Islamic attire, including headscarves and bushy beards. In 2007, the Ministry of Education banned both Islamic clothing and Western-style miniskirts in schools, a policy later extended to all public institutions. Minister of Culture Shamsiddin Orumbekzoda told Radio Free Europe that Islamic dress was &quot;really dangerous&quot;. Under previous laws, women wearing hijabs are already banned from entering the country&#x27;s government offices.

==== Europe ====

On 15 March 2004, France passed a law banning &quot;symbols or clothes through which students conspicuously display their religious affiliation&quot; in public primary schools, middle schools, and secondary schools. In the Belgian city of Maaseik, the niqāb has been banned since 2006. On 13 July 2010, France&#x27;s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a bill that would ban wearing the Islamic full veil in public. It became the first European country to ban the full-face veil in public places, followed by Belgium, Latvia, Bulgaria, Austria, Denmark and some cantons of Switzerland in the following years.

Belgium banned the full-face veil in 2011 in places like parks and on the streets. In September 2013, the electors of the Swiss canton of Ticino voted in favour of a ban on face veils in public areas. In 2016, Latvia and Bulgaria banned the burqa in public places. In October 2017, wearing a face veil became also illegal in Austria. This ban also includes scarves, masks and clown paint that cover faces to avoid discriminating against Muslim dress. In 2016, Bosnia-Herzegovina&#x27;s supervising judicial authority upheld a ban on wearing Islamic headscarves in courts and legal institutions, despite protests from the Muslim community that constitutes 40% of the country. In 2017, the European Court of Justice ruled that companies were allowed to bar employees from wearing visible religious symbols, including the hijab. However, if the company has no policy regarding the wearing of clothes that demonstrate religious and political ideas, a customer cannot ask employees to remove the clothing item. In 2018, the Danish parliament passed a law banning the full-face veil in public places.

In 2016, more than 20 French towns banned the use of the burqini, a style of swimwear intended to accord with rules of hijab. Dozens of women were subsequently issued fines, with some tickets citing not wearing &quot;an outfit respecting good morals and secularism&quot;, and some were verbally attacked by bystanders when they were confronted by the police. Enforcement of the ban also hit beachgoers wearing a wide range of modest attire besides the burqini. Media reported that in one case the police forced a woman to remove part of her clothing on a beach in Nice. The Nice mayor&#x27;s office denied that she was forced to do so and the mayor condemned what he called the &quot;unacceptable provocation&quot; of wearing such clothes in the aftermath of the Nice terrorist attack.

A team of psychologists in Belgium have investigated, in two studies of 166 and 147 participants, whether the Belgians&#x27; discomfort with the Islamic hijab, and the support of its ban from the country&#x27;s public sphere, is motivated by the defence of the values of autonomy and universalism (which includes equality), or by xenophobia/ethnic prejudice and by anti-religious sentiments. The studies have revealed the effects of subtle prejudice/racism, values (self-enhancement values and security versus universalism), and religious attitudes (literal anti-religious thinking versus spirituality), in predicting greater levels of anti-veil attitudes beyond the effects of other related variables such as age and political conservatism.

In 2019, Austria banned the hijab in schools for children up to ten years of age. The ban was motivated by the equality between men and women and improving social integration with respect to local customs. Parents who send their child to school with a headscarf will be fined 440 euro. The ban was overturned in 2020 by the Austrian Constitutional Court.

In 2019, Staffanstorp Municipality in Sweden banned all veils for school pupils up to sixth grade.

==== India ====

In India, Muslim women are allowed to wear the hijab and/or burqa anytime, anywhere. However, in January 2022, a number of colleges in the South Indian state of Karnataka stopped female students wearing the hijab from entering the campus, following which the state government issued a circular banning &#x27;religious clothes&#x27; in educational institutions where uniforms are prescribed. On 15 March 2022, the Karnataka High Court, in a verdict, upheld the hijab ban in educational institutions where uniforms are prescribed, arguing that the practice is non-essential in Islam. The hijab ban was condemned inside India and abroad by officials in countries including the United States, Bahrain and Pakistan, as well as by Human Rights Watch, and by figures like Malala Yousafzai.

A study published by human rights body People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties reported that the move to ban hijab has widened the social divide and increased fear among Muslims in Karnataka.

===Unofficial pressure to wear hijab===

In Srinagar, the capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, a previously unknown militant group calling itself Lashkar-e-Jabbar claimed responsibility for a series of acid attacks on women who did not wear the burqa in 2001, threatening to punish women who do not adhere to their vision of Islamic dress. Women of Kashmir, most of whom are not fully veiled, defied the warning, and the attacks were condemned by prominent militant and separatist groups of the region.

Some women in Jordan have reported unofficial pressure to wear a hijab in 2018.

===Unofficial pressure against wearing the hijab===
In recent years, women wearing the hijab have been subjected to verbal and physical attacks worldwide, particularly following terrorist attacks. Louis A. Cainkar writes that the data suggest that women in hijab rather than men are the predominant target of anti-Muslim attacks, not because they are more easily identifiable as Muslims, but because they are seen to represent a threat to the local moral order that the attackers are seeking to defend. Some women stop wearing the hijab out of fear or following perceived pressure from their acquaintances, but many refuse to stop wearing it out of religious conviction, even when they are urged to do so for self-protection.

Kazakhstan has no official ban on wearing the hijab, but those who wear it have reported that authorities use a number of tactics to discriminate against them.

In 2015, authorities in Uzbekistan organized a &quot;deveiling&quot; campaign in the capital city Tashkent, during which women wearing the hijab were detained and taken to a police station. Those who agreed to remove their hijab were released &quot;after a conversation&quot;, while those who refused were transferred to the counterterrorism department and given a lecture. Their husbands or fathers were then summoned to convince the women to obey the police. This followed an earlier campaign in the Fergana Valley.

After the election of Shavkat Mirziyoyev as President of Uzbekistan in December 2016, Muslims were given the opportunity to openly express their religious identity, which manifested itself in the wider spread of hijabs in Uzbekistan. In July 2021, the state allowed the wearing of the hijab in public places.

In Kyrgyzstan in 2016, the government sponsored street banners aiming to dissuade women from wearing the hijab.

===Workplace discrimination against hijab-wearing women===

Discrimination against Muslims often affects women more due to the hijab making them more visible, leading to workplace prejudice, particularly after the rise of Islamophobia post-9/11. Hijab-wearing Muslim women face both overt and covert discrimination in job applications and workplace environments, with covert bias often resulting in more hostile treatment. Perceived discrimination can harm well-being, but may also be overcome by religious pride and community; studies show hijab-wearing women often find greater strength and belonging despite challenges.

The issue of discrimination against Muslims affects Muslim women more due to the hijab making them more identifiable compared to Muslim men. Particularly after the September 11 attacks and the coining of the term Islamophobia, some of Islamophobia&#x27;s manifestations are seen within the workplace. Women wearing the hijab are at risk of discrimination in their workplace because the hijab helps identify them for anyone who may hold Islamophobic attitudes. Their association with the Islamic faith automatically projects any negative stereotyping of the religion onto them. As a result of the heightened discrimination, some hijab-wearing Muslim women in the workplace resort to taking off their hijab in hopes to prevent any further prejudice acts.

A number of hijab-wearing women who were interviewed expressed that perceived discrimination also poses a problem for them. To be specific, Muslim women shared that they chose not to wear the headscarf out of fear of future discrimination.

The discrimination hijab-wearing Muslim women face goes beyond affecting their work experience; it also interferes with their decision to uphold religious obligations. As a result, hijab-wearing Muslim women in the United States have worries regarding their ability to follow their religion, because it might mean they are rejected employment. Ali, Yamada, and Mahmoud (2015) state that women of color who also follow the religion of Islam are considered to be in what is called &quot;triple jeopardy&quot;, due to being a part of two minority groups subject to discrimination.

A study by Ali et al. (2015) found a relationship between the discrimination Muslims face at work and their job satisfaction. In other words, the discrimination hijab-wearing Muslim women face at work is associated with their overall feeling of contentment of their jobs, especially compared to other religious groups.

Hijab-wearing Muslim women not only experience discrimination whilst in their job environment; they also experience discrimination in their attempts to get a job. An experimental study conducted on potential hiring discrimination among Muslims found that in terms of overt discrimination there were no differences between Muslim women who wore traditional Islamic clothing and those who did not. However, covert discrimination was noted towards Muslim who wore the hijab, and as a result were dealt with in a hostile and rude manner. While observing hiring practices among 4,000 employers in the U.S., experimenters found that employers who self-identified as Republican tended to avoid making interviews with candidates who appeared Muslim on their social network pages.

One instance that some view as hijab discrimination in the workplace that gained public attention and made it to the Supreme Court was &quot;EEOC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch&quot;. The U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took advantage of its power granted by Title VII and made a case for a young hijabi female who applied for a job, but was rejected due to her wearing a headscarf which violated Abercrombie &amp; Fitch&#x27;s pre-existing and longstanding policy against head coverings and all black garments.

Discrimination levels differ depending on geographical location; for example, South Asian Muslims in the United Arab Emirates do not perceive as much discrimination as their South Asian counterparts in the U.S. Although, South Asian Muslim women in both locations are similar in describing discrimination experiences as subtle and indirect interactions. The same study also reports differences among South Asian Muslim women who wear the hijab, and those who do not. For non-hijabis, they reported to have experienced more perceived discrimination when they were around other Muslims.

Perceived discrimination is detrimental to well-being, both mentally and physically. However, perceived discrimination may also be related to more positive well-being for the individual. A study in New Zealand concluded that while Muslim women who wore the headscarf did in fact experience discrimination, these negative experiences were overcome by much higher feelings of religious pride, belonging, and centrality.

==World Hijab Day==
The World Hijab Day (WHD), which is an annual event founded by Pakistani-American Nazma Khan in 2013, takes place on 1 February each year in 140 countries worldwide. Its stated purpose is to encourage women of all religions and backgrounds to wear and experience the hijab for a day and to educate and spread awareness on why hijab is worn.

<text>Chico and the Man is an American sitcom television series that aired on NBC for four seasons from September 13, 1974, to July 21, 1978. It stars Jack Albertson as Ed Brown (the Man), the cantankerous owner of a run-down garage in an East Los Angeles barrio, and Freddie Prinze (until Prinze&#x27;s suicide in the third season) as Chico Rodriguez, an upbeat, optimistic young Mexican American who comes in looking for a job. It was the first U.S. television series set in a Mexican-American neighborhood.

==Conception==
The series was created by James Komack who produced other successful TV shows such as &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;. Comedians Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong (better known as the comedic duo Cheech &amp; Chong) have stated that Komack followed the comedians on tour for three months; Chong wrote in his 2009 book &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography&quot; that Komack based the show on Cheech and Chong skits titled &quot;The Old Man in the Park&quot; and &quot;Pedro and Man&quot; and had acknowledged that fact to Chong after the television series&#x27; release. Cheech and Chong have both stated that Komack had originally approached them to star in the show, but they turned down the offer, preferring to stick to films.

Komack told the Associated Press that he first tried working with Cheech and Chong on a show about a Chicano and a Nisei. Komack said he decided to make the show about a young Chicano and a &quot;seventh-generation WASP&quot; after he and the comedy team &quot;couldn&#x27;t get it together&quot;.

NBC suggested someone like Jack Albertson as Ed/&quot;The Man&quot;, and Komack approached him. Though not impressed with the pilot script, Albertson agreed on the trust of Komack&#x27;s reputation. Freddie Prinze was discovered by Komack who received a recommendation from a friend who saw Prinze&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in December 1973. Komack thought he would be perfect for the role of Chico Rodriguez. Though initially rejected by NBC executives, he stood out against two other finalists in testing.

==Synopsis==

A hard-drinking widower, Ed stubbornly refuses to fit in with the changing East L.A. neighborhood and has alienated most of the people who live around him. He uses ethnic slurs and berates Chico, a Latino, in an effort to get him to leave when Chico comes looking for a job. Yet Chico sees something in Ed, and sneaks back in at night to clean up the garage and move into an old van that Ed has parked inside. As Ed sees all the effort Chico has put in, he begins to warm up to Chico. Over the course of the show, Ed grows to see Chico as family, although Ed denies this on several occasions.

The chemistry between Jack Albertson&#x27;s &quot;Ed&quot; and Freddie Prinze&#x27;s &quot;Chico&quot; was a major factor in making the show a hit in its first two seasons. It debuted in the top 10 and remained in the top 30 for its second season.

As the show progressed, Chico&#x27;s background was revealed as being Mexican on his father&#x27;s side and Puerto Rican on his mother&#x27;s side, and (in a nod to Prinze&#x27;s faux-Hungarian ancestry) &quot;... my grandmother speaks a little Hungarian!&quot; (though Prinze&#x27;s paternal ancestry was actually German, in his stage-act he would claim his father was Hungarian, thereby allowing him to comically refer to himself as &quot;Hungarican&quot;). Chico was revealed to have spent part of his childhood in Hungary following the death of his mother, being raised by his aunt Connie (a character who appeared in two other episodes). Chico attempts to explain his situation to Ed by portraying it as the dilemma of his distant cousin in Hungary, torn between the farmer for whom he now works and whom he has grown to love, and another farmer who has offered him a better job. During this scene and this episode, the love between these disparate characters was made clear for the first time, which Chico&#x27;s cousin Carlos (played by actor Richard Yniguez) notes when he releases Chico from his promise. By the second season, Ed begins to see that he is a part of a bigger world, although he still complains about it. By this time he has found himself a girlfriend by the name of Flora (played by Carole Cook).

The theme song was written and performed by José Feliciano.

===Prinze&#x27;s death===
After struggling with depression and drug use, Freddie Prinze shot himself on January 28, 1977. He was taken off life support and died the following day at the age of 22.

The last episode to star Prinze, &quot;Ed Talks to God&quot;, was taped several hours before Prinze&#x27;s death.

====Post-Prinze episodes====
After Prinze&#x27;s death, the producers considered canceling the show, but opted instead to try replacing the character. To write Chico out of the script, they had the other characters comment that he had gone to visit his father in Mexico. The third season finished out with three episodes without Chico, focusing on the other characters in the show.

In the opening episode of the fourth season, a replacement for Chico was introduced. Instead of an adult, the producers brought in 12-year-old Raul, played by Gabriel Melgar. His first appearance came when Ed and Louie go on a fishing trip to Tijuana and find the Mexican orphan hiding out in their trunk on their return. At the end of this episode, Ed is putting Raul to bed and accidentally calls him Chico. Raul corrects him and Ed remarks, &quot;You&#x27;re all Chicos to me.&quot; Ed eventually adopts Raul, only to have Raul&#x27;s overprotective Aunt Charo – played by actress/singer Charo – come from Spain and try to become a part of the &quot;family&quot;, as well.

A two-part episode ran in the final season in which Raul discovers Chico&#x27;s belongings in a closet. Ed catches Raul playing Chico&#x27;s guitar and Ed smashes it on the van in anger. Raul believes Ed does not love him anymore and runs away to Mexico. Ed goes after him and finally explains to Raul that Chico died, but did not say how, putting a measure of closure on the fate of Chico in the series.

In January 1978, after one further episode, NBC placed &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; on hiatus. The show returned in June, and the unaired episodes were broadcast through the summer of 1978, although one episode remained unaired during the final network run.

Toward the end of the show&#x27;s final season, actress Julie Hill was added to the cast as Monica, Ed&#x27;s attractive 18-year-old adopted niece. She had come to Los Angeles to break into show business, and lived in Chico&#x27;s old van while awaiting her big break. &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; was canceled at the end of the fourth season. The show&#x27;s ratings declined steadily after Prinze&#x27;s death and never recovered.

The show also had a veteran and talented supporting cast. Scatman Crothers portrayed Louie Wilson, Ed&#x27;s friend and garbageman; Bonnie Boland played Mabel, the mail lady; Isaac Ruiz portrayed Mando, Chico&#x27;s friend; and Ronny Graham played Rev. Bemis. Also, Della Reese played Della Rogers, Ed&#x27;s neighbor and landlady, and Jeannie Linero appeared in several episodes as one of Chico&#x27;s more constant girlfriends, nurse Liz Garcia.

==Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings==
==Syndication==
With 88 episodes, the series fell short of the 100 episodes most syndicators desired for a full rollout, and Prinze&#x27;s death caused a sudden shift in the series that further made the show undesirable for reruns. The series has only been shown in syndication in a few markets and only for a relatively short period. NBC broadcast repeats of &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; briefly on weekday mornings from May 9 to December 2, 1977.

Nickelodeon’s TV Land network also broadcast reruns during 2001 as did ION Television in 2007. AmericanLife TV Network also aired this series previously, as well as WGN-TV in Chicago.

In Canada, the show previously appeared on Sun TV (CKXT-TV) in Toronto.

In Italy, the show aired on Rete 4 in 1984.

From 2005 to 2009, episodes of the show were available on AOL&#x27;s now-defunct video website called In2TV.

The complete series began streaming on Tubi in December 2023.

==Home media==
On September 27, 2005, six episodes of &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; were released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Television Favorites&quot; compilation series and the episodes are as follows:

* &quot;Pilot&quot; (September 13, 1974): Chico tries to persuade Ed to give him a job in the garage.
* &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; (January 31, 1975): Chico has fallen head over heels in love and Ed is trying to turn him right side up.
* &quot;Chico and the Van&quot; (October 17, 1975): A city official claims Chico&#x27;s van is illegal, so he moves in with Ed.
* &quot;Chico&#x27;s Cousin Pepe&quot; (February 11, 1976): Chico&#x27;s blind, woman-chasing, singing cousin Pepe visits.
* &quot;Chico&#x27;s Padre&quot; (February 4, 1977): Chico&#x27;s long-lost rich father, Gilberto, returns to give him a better life.
* &quot;Ed Talks to God&quot; (March 4, 1977): Chico tries to change Ed&#x27;s mind about not attending his own birthday party by having Ed&#x27;s old friend impersonate God.

<doc id="68308" wikidata="Q344735" url="?curid=68308" title="Jack Albertson">
<text>Harold&quot;Jack&quot;Albertson (June 16, 1907 – November 25, 1981) was an American actor, dancer and singer who also performed in vaudeville. Albertson was a Tony, Oscar, and Emmy winning actor, which ranks him among a rare stature of 24 actors who have been awarded the &quot;Triple Crown of Acting&quot;.

For his performance as John Cleary in the 1964 play &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; and its 1968 film adaptation, he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This again places him among a select status as one of eleven peers who have won both awards for the same role. His other roles include Grandpa Joe in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), Manny Rosen in &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), and Ed Brown in the television sitcom &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; (1974–1978), for which he won an Emmy. For his contributions to the television industry, Albertson was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1977 at 6253 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Early life==
Albertson was born on June 16, 1907, in Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants Flora (née Craft) and Leopold Albertson. His older sister was actress Mabel Albertson. Their mother, a stock actress, supported the family by working in a shoe factory. Until the age of 22, Albertson was known as &quot;Harold Albertson&quot;. His father abandoned his mother before Jack was born, and the boy was raised by his stepfather, Alex Erlich, a barber.

During a 1972 &quot;New York Daily News&quot; interview with Sidney Fields, Albertson reminisced: Albertson dropped out of high school, ending his formal education after a single year. He worked at several different jobs including: the local General Electric plant; in one of many shoe factories in the Lynn, Massachusetts area; and as a rack boy in neighborhood pool parlors, where he was a fairly good pool hustler, although he was always on guard to avoid playing anyone who could &quot;out-hustle&quot; him. The pool hall provided Albertson with an opportunity to learn a few tap dance routines from his fellow hustlers.

When he was eighteen, he began to be paid for his prize winning shows. His sister Mabel taught him the first &quot;time steps&quot; in tap dancing, and he picked up additional routines by watching vaudeville acts that played his hometown. Around this time, he started singing with a group called &quot;The Golden Rule Four,&quot; who held their practice sessions beneath a railroad bridge.

==Career==
===Broadway===
Albertson joined the vaudeville road troupe known as the Dancing Verselle Sisters. He then worked in burlesque as a hoofer (soft shoe dancer) and straight man to Phil Silvers on the &quot;Minsky&#x27;s Burlesque Circuit&quot;. Besides vaudeville and burlesque, he appeared on the stage in many Broadway plays and musicals, including &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;, &quot;Top Banana&quot;, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, &quot;Make Mine Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, &quot;Meet the People&quot;, &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; – for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor, and &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; – for which he won a Tony for Best Supporting Actor.

===Film===
Albertson appeared in more than 30 films. He had an early minor role in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; as a postal worker who redirects dead letters addressed to &quot;Santa Claus&quot; to the courthouse where Kris Kringle is on trial. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the 1968 film &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot;. He later apologized to child actor and fellow nominee Jack Wild for winning the award; Albertson expected Wild to win for his role in &quot;Oliver!&quot; Also nominated was Albertson&#x27;s later &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; co-star Gene Wilder, for his role in &quot;The Producers&quot;.

Albertson appeared as Charlie Bucket&#x27;s Grandpa Joe in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), and in &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), where he played Manny Rosen, husband to Belle, played by Shelley Winters.

Albertson said that his one regret was that he did not reprise his role in the movie version of &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;. When producer Ray Stark acquired the film rights from Neil Simon in 1973, Albertson was expected to play the part, but by the time MGM had bought the rights in 1974 and was preparing to begin filming in February 1975, Albertson was not available because he was appearing on &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; on TV.

===Radio===
Albertson was a radio performer early in his career. Among the shows he appeared on were &quot;Just Plain Bill&quot;, &quot;Lefty&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s My Pop&quot; and &quot;The Jack Albertson Comedy Show&quot;. In the late 1940s he was for a time a regular on the &quot;Milton Berle Show&quot;.

===Television===
Albertson appeared in many television series, such as &quot;Hey, Jeannie!&quot; with Jeannie Carson, the syndicated Western series &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot; with Rex Allen, Rod Cameron&#x27;s syndicated crime drama &quot;State Trooper&quot;, and the 1961–1962 drama series &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. He guest-starred on the David Janssen crime-drama series &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;.

From 1960 to 1961, Albertson was cast in three episodes of &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams. On January 2, 1961, Albertson was cast as Sampson J. Binton, with DeForest Kelley as Alex Jeffords, in &quot;Listen to the Nightingale&quot;, the series finale of &quot;Riverboat&quot;, starring Darren McGavin. Albertson had a recurring role as the neighbor Walter Burton in eight episodes of the 1962 ABC sitcom &quot;Room for One More&quot;, with Andrew Duggan and Peggy McCay. He had recurring roles in &quot;Ensign O&#x27;Toole&quot; (1962–63) and &quot;Run, Buddy, Run&quot; (1966). Between 1961 and 1964, Albertson appeared seven times on &quot;Mister Ed&quot; as Paul Fenton, brother-in-law (later just brother) to Wilbur Post&#x27;s next-door-neighbor Kay, appearing as a stopgap regular for several episodes after the death of Larry Keating in 1963.

Other 1960s series on which Albertson appeared were: NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Happy&quot;, starring Ronnie Burns; &quot;Glynis&quot;, starring Glynis Johns; and Keith Andes, which aired for 13 weeks in the fall of 1963. Albertson appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In a 1967 episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, he played the ne&#x27;er-do-well cousin, Bradford J. Taylor, of series character Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). He also appeared in a 1969 episode of the TV series &quot;The Virginian&quot; entitled &quot;Girl in the Shadows.&quot; He appeared in The Big Valley episode &quot;The Battle of Mineral Springs&quot; (1969). In 1970, Albertson appeared as Billy &quot;Moose&quot; Valentine in The Men From Shiloh, the rebranded name for &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode titled &quot;With Love, Bullets and Valentines&quot;.

From 1971 to 1972, he co-starred, with actor Sam Groom, in the Canadian TV series &quot;Dr. Simon Locke&quot;. He then co-starred as &quot;The Man&quot; Ed Brown on the popular series &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; with Freddie Prinze. He stayed for its entire run from 1974 to 1978. He earned an Emmy Award for that role in 1976, which was his second; his first was for an appearance on the variety show &quot;Cher&quot; in 1975.

==Personal life==
He resided for many years in West Hollywood, California. In 1978, he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, but kept this information private and continued to act. Two of his last roles were in the television movies, &quot;My Body, My Child&quot; (1982) and &quot;Grandpa, Will You Run with Me?&quot; (1983), both filmed in 1981 and released posthumously. His final theatrical role was as the hunter, Amos Slade, in Disney&#x27;s 24th animated feature, &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, originally released in the summer of 1981, four months before his death.

He and his wife, June, had a daughter, Maura Dhu. 

==Death==
On the morning of November 25, 1981, Albertson died at his Los Angeles home in the Hollywood Hills at the age of 74 from colon cancer. He and his elder sister, &quot;Bewitched&quot; actress Mabel Albertson (who died 10 months later from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease), were cremated and their ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="68309" wikidata="Q1396282" url="?curid=68309" title="Q Public License">
<text>The Q Public License (QPL) is a non-copyleft license, created by the company Trolltech for its free software edition of the Qt toolkit and framework. It was used until Qt 3.0, until version 4.0 was released under the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s (FSF) GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.

It fails the Debian Free Software Guidelines, used by several Linux distributions, though it qualifies for the FSF&#x27;s Free Software Definition; however, it is incompatible with the FSF&#x27;s GPL, meaning that products derived from code under both the GPL and the QPL cannot be redistributed.

== History ==
KDE, a desktop environment for Linux, is based on Qt. Only the free open source edition of Qt was covered by the QPL; the commercial edition, which is functionally equal, is under a pay-per-use license and could not be freely distributed. Meanwhile, the Free Software Foundation and authors of the GPL objected to the QPL as it was a non-copyleft license incompatible with the GPL. As KDE grew in popularity, the free software community urged Trolltech to license Qt under the GPL to ensure that it would remain free software forever and could be used and developed by commercial third parties. Eventually, under pressure, Trolltech dual-licensed the free edition of Qt 2.2 for use under the terms of the GPL or the QPL.

== Adoption ==
Other projects that have adopted the Q Public License, sometimes with a change in the choice of jurisdiction clause, include:
* LibreSource is a versatile collaborative platform provided by artenum and dedicated to collaborative software development
* Jpgraph is a graph generation tool written in PHP that dynamically produces charts and graphs as image files for presentation on websites.
* Hercules, a software implementation of the System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture mainframe computer architectures. On January 1, 2024, Jay Maynard announced a proposal to relicense Hercules under an MIT License on July 1, 2024. however this proposal was rejected as it did not have the unanimous approval of all of the copyright holders.
* Tgif switched from a free-of-charge non-commercial license to the Q Public License.

Prior projects using the Q Public License include:
* The OCaml compiler and related tools from Projet Cristal at INRIA. Since April 2016, OCaml is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 with linking exception.
* Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) for versions 3.x. The CGAL library is released under GNU General Public License (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) since CGAL version 4.0 (March 2012).

The Debian project rejects software covered by solely QPL (and not dual licensed with something else like the GPL) because of:
* A choice of venue clause
* Forced distribution to a third party
* Forced blanket license to the original developer

== Compliance ==
All legal disputes about the license are settled in Oslo, Norway, but it has never been legally contested.

<doc id="68311" wikidata="Q171784" url="?curid=68311" title="Eurovision Song Contest 1956">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1956 was the first edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RSI) on behalf of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR). The contest, originally titled the  (; ), was held on 24 May 1956 at the in Lugano, Switzerland, and hosted by Swiss television presenter Lohengrin Filipello, which remains the only time that the contest has been hosted by a solo male presenter.

Inspired principally by the Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held annually since 1951, the concept of a televised European song contest, initially proposed by Italian broadcaster RAI, was formulated by an EBU committee led by Swiss broadcaster and executive Marcel Bezençon. Following approval at the EBU&#x27;s General Assembly in 1955, the rules and structure of the contest were agreed upon. Several of the rules utilised in this first contest would subsequently be altered for future editions, and it remains the only edition in which each country was represented by two songs, with a voting process which was held in secret and where juries could vote for the entries from their own country.

Seven countries participated in the inaugural edition of the contest, and the first winner was the host country , with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Lys Assia. The result was determined by an assembled jury composed of two jurors from each country, with each juror ranking each song between 1 and 10 points. Only the winning country and song were announced at the conclusion of the event, with the results of the remaining participants unknown. Even though it was broadcast on television and radio via the Eurovision network in ten countries, no video footage of the event is known to exist, with the only video available being of the reprise performance from an independent archiver; the majority of the broadcast is, however, available in audio.Maximum points Is 140, and Swiss Is Has 102.

== Origins ==

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed in 1950 among 23 organisations with the aim of facilitating creative cooperation and the exchange of television programmes. The word &quot;Eurovision&quot; was first used as a telecommunications term in the United Kingdom in 1951, in reference to a programme by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) being relayed by Dutch television, and was subsequently used as the title for the union&#x27;s new transmission network upon its creation in 1954. Following the formation of the EBU, a number of notable events were transmitted through its networks in several European countries, including Belgium, France, West Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A series of international exchange programmes were subsequently organised for 1954, with this &quot;European Television Season&quot; relayed live across Europe through the Eurovision network.

Following this series of transmissions, a &quot;Programme Committee&quot; was set up within the EBU to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters each year, with Marcel Bezençon of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR) serving as the committee&#x27;s first president. This committee agreed to study the concept for a new televised European song contest during a meeting in January 1955, a concept initially proposed by the Italian broadcaster RAI and inspired by the broadcaster&#x27;s Sanremo Music Festival, held annually since 1951. The new European contest was subsequently approved at the EBU&#x27;s annual General Assembly in October 1955, leading to the creation of the &quot;European Grand Prix&quot;.

== Location ==

The first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland; the country was awarded the contest in October 1955 at the EBU&#x27;s General Assembly following an offer by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR) to stage the event. In addition, Switzerland was a logical choice from a technical perspective for the hosting of what was an experiment in live, simultaneous, cross-border transmissions, as its geographically central location in Europe facilitated terrestrial broadcasts across the continent, as well as being the host country of the EBU&#x27;s headquarters.

Taking its inspiration from the Italian Sanremo Music Festival and Venice International Song Festival, a similar EBU-organised song contest held in 1955 and broadcast on radio, Lugano in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino was chosen as the first host city by SRG SSR. The selected venue for the contest was the , a casino and former theatre situated on Lake Lugano. It had a capacity of 700 seats. 400 seats in the stalls were reserved for invited guests whereas tickets for the balcony were on sale from 17 May 1956 for . The theatre, used for theatrical and musical performances, ballroom dance and other shows, closed shortly after featuring its last performance in April 1997 before being demolished in 2001 to make room for the extension of the casino.

== Participating countries ==

Broadcasters from seven countries participated in this first contest, , , , the , and (identified simply as &quot;Germany&quot; in the contest). Those from and are believed to have also been interested in participating; however, they reportedly missed the cut-off point for entry. These two, as well as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the , would broadcast the contest along with those in the participating countries, with the BBC having chosen to not send an entry for this event in favour of organising their own contest, the &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs&quot;.

Two of the performers, Switzerland&#x27;s Lys Assia and Luxembourg&#x27;s Michèle Arnaud, performed both entries for their respective countries. Assia, as well as the Netherlands&#x27; Corry Brokken and Belgium&#x27;s Fud Leclerc, would return to compete in the contest in future editions, with Assia returning and , Brokken also returning and , and Leclerc returning , , and .


== Production and format ==
A planning sub-group, headed by Eduard Hass of SRG SSR, was formed following the sign-off on the organisation of the event to build out the rules of the competition. Taking inspiration from the Sanremo Music Festival and the Venice International Song Festival as a basis in planning the new contest, the group made several amendments and additions to these rules to suit its international nature. Ideas suggested but ultimately rejected during this planning phase included featuring each song a second time with a piano accompaniment instead of orchestral backing, as well as technical initiatives such as a separate producer from each participating broadcaster involved in the contest&#x27;s organisation. Prize money for the winners was also ruled out at this stage. The rules of the contest were finalised and distributed to EBU members in early 1956. The rules set out in detail the criteria for the participating songs and performers; production details and requirements; timelines for the submission of materials by the participating broadcasters; the method by which the winning song would be determined; details related to the financing of the event; and the responsibilities which lay with the host broadcaster and the participating broadcasters.

The inaugural Eurovision Song Contest was produced by the Italian-language radio broadcaster (RSI), in cooperation with the German-language television broadcaster , which brought a television production truck from Zürich to Lugano. Franco Marazzi served as director of the event on behalf of RSI, with Rolf Liebermann overseeing the production and the jury deliberations on behalf of the EBU as its executive supervisor and jury president.

Each participating country, represented by one EBU member organisation, submitted into the contest a maximum of two songs not exceeding three to three-and-a-half minutes in duration, which must have been solely original compositions. Each participating organisation had sole discretion on how to select their entries for the contest but were strongly encouraged by the EBU to hold their own national contests to determine their representatives. Following the performance of all songs, the winner was determined by an assembled jury composed of two individuals from each country, with each individual member rating secretly each song between one and ten points, including those representing their own country, with higher scores given to more appreciated songs. The jury followed the contest in the bridge room in the same venue in Lugano through a small television screen, replicating the conditions as close as possible to how viewers at home would watch the contest. The winning song was thus that which gained the highest score from the votes of all jury members. In the event of a tie between two or more entries all songs with the highest score would have been declared winners.

In news reports at the time, according to one Dutch juror, the jury members were removed from the jury room once they had cast their votes and were therefore unable to follow the tabulation of the final results. The jury members from Luxembourg were unable to attend the contest in Lugano, and subsequently the EBU allowed two Swiss nationals to vote in their place. This would remain the only contest in which many of these rules would be utilised, and several changes were made ahead of the 1957 contest. These included restricting each country to only one song, expanding the number of performers allowed to participate for each country, introducing a more visible voting system, and restricting each country from voting for their own entry.

Each song was accompanied by a 24-piece orchestra, with members of the Radiosa Orchestra supplemented by strings of the Italian Swiss Radio Symphony Orchestra, presided over by the contest&#x27;s musical director, Fernando Paggi. Each participating broadcaster was allowed to supplement the orchestra with their own musical director for the performances of their entries, with the host musical director also conducting for those which did not appoint their own conductor. Broadcasters were required to submit to the EBU by 10 May 1956 scores for their participating songs for use by the orchestra, audio recordings of each song, and copies of the songs lyrics in the original language, as well as translations into French or English to aid the jury members and commentators. The confirmed selection of each country&#x27;s musical director (if separate to that of the host) was required to be communicated between 21 and 24 May. Rehearsals in the contest venue with the competing artists and the orchestra began on 21 May 1956.

According to the rules, the order in which the countries and songs were performed was to be determined artistically by the Swiss broadcasters, with input and support by the musical directors from each country. However, a draw determining the order of countries seems to have taken place in Gardone a few days prior to the contest.

== Contest overview ==

The contest was held on 24 May 1956, beginning at 21:00 (CET) with an approximate duration of 1 hour 40 minutes. The event was hosted in Italian by Lohengrin Filipello. This remains the only time in which the contest was hosted by a solo male presenter, and one of only two contests not to feature a female presenter, alongside the held 61 years later. Additionally this would remain the only contest to feature a male presenter for 22 years, until the featured a male and female presenting duo.

During the interval between the final competing act and the announcement of the winner, performances by and were featured to entertain the audience, with the latter performing &quot;Guerre de Troie&quot; along with other works. Upon the announcement of the results, the winning artist returned to the stage for a reprise performance of the winning song to end the broadcast.

The winning song was &quot;&quot;, composed by Géo Voumard, written by Émile Gardaz, performed by Lys Assia and representing the host country . During the reprise performance of the winning song, Assia became emotional and suffered a lapse in memory of the song&#x27;s lyrics, subsequently requesting a restart by the orchestra. After the show, a reception for the participating delegations was held in the upper hall of Teatro Kursaal on behalf of the host city Lugano, the canton Ticino, and SRG SSR.

The full results of the contest were not revealed at the time, with only the winning song named at the end of the show by the jury president Rolf Liebermann; the full breakdown of each juror&#x27;s votes has not been retained by the EBU, and is presumed lost. Attempts to reconstruct the voting through interviews with jury members have also failed to reveal a reliable result. An article in Italian newspaper published on 25 May 1956, the day after the contest, reported that Switzerland&#x27;s winning entry received 102 points in total, while in a post-contest interview with Stelio Molo, the Director General of SRG SSR, published in the Italian magazine in the weeks following the contest, the gap between the first- and second-placed songs was revealed by Molo to be two points, and that the remaining entries also finished close to the winner. These claims have however failed to be corroborated by the contest organisers in the years since.


== Broadcasts ==
Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. In addition to the television channels of the seven participating broadcasters and three non-participating passive broadcasters, the contest was also broadcast live on seven radio networks and recorded for later transmission by another 13. The United Kingdom&#x27;s BBC took only partial live transmission of the event, joining 45 minutes into the contest and only showing the second set of entries from each country. Due to a technical fault, the transmission of images was interrupted during Mathé Altéry&#x27;s performance for about three minutes on German, Danish and French television.

No video footage of the whole contest is known to exist, with the only known footage being clips of the reprise performance of the winning song via newsreel and other recordings. As such, this is one of only two editions of the contest, along with the , to not have video recordings of the full event retained. Audio of most of the contest has, however, survived, with only the majority of the contest&#x27;s interval acts currently lost. Attempts to find audiovisual materials related to the contest have yielded some results in recent years, including a large cache of photographs and some video footage taken by Swiss photographer Vincenzo Vicari from inside the venue.

Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="68314" wikidata="Q706208" url="?curid=68314" title="Temple name">
<text>Temple names are posthumous titles accorded to monarchs of the Sinosphere for the purpose of ancestor worship. The practice of honoring monarchs with temple names began during the Shang dynasty in China and had since been adopted by other dynastic regimes in the Sinosphere, with the notable exception of Japan. Temple names should not be confused with era names (年號), regnal names (尊號) or posthumous names (謚號).

Modern academia usually refers to the following rulers by their temple names: Chinese monarchs from the Tang to the Yuan dynasties, Korean rulers of the Goryeo (until AD 1274) and Joseon dynasties, and Vietnamese rulers of the Lý, Trần, and Later Lê dynasties (with the Hồ and Later Trần dynasties as exceptions).

Numerous individuals who did not rule as monarch during their lifetime were posthumously elevated to the position of monarch by their descendants and honored with temple names. For example, Cao Cao was posthumously honored as an emperor and given the temple name &quot;Taizu&quot; by Cao Pi of the Cao Wei dynasty. Meanwhile, several individuals who were initially assigned temple names had their titles revoked, as was the case for Emperor Huan, whose temple name, &quot;Weizong&quot;, was abolished by Emperor Xian of the Eastern Han dynasty. In other cases, numerous individuals were honored with more than one temple name by intentional changes or being accorded different titles by different individuals. For instance, the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty was originally honored as &quot;Taizong&quot; by the Hongxi Emperor, but his temple name was later amended to &quot;Chengzu&quot; by the Jiajing Emperor. There were also instances of individuals ruling as the sovereign of a particular realm but being accorded a temple name by another realm, as was the case for Möngke of the Mongol Empire, who was later honored as &quot;Xianzong&quot; by Emperor Shizu of the Yuan dynasty.

==Etymology==
The &quot;temple&quot; in &quot;temple name&quot; (廟號) refers to the grand temples (太廟) built by each dynasty for the purpose of ancestor worship. The temple name of each monarch was recorded on their respective ancestral tablet placed within the grand temple.

==History==
Temple names trace their origins to the Shang dynasty of China. In earlier times, temple names were exclusively assigned to competent rulers after their death.

The temple name system established during the Shang period utilized only four adjectives:
* 太 (&quot;tài&quot;; &quot;grand&quot;): honored to dynastic founders;
* 高 (&quot;gāo&quot;; &quot;high&quot;): honored to monarchs with great achievements;
* 世 (&quot;shì&quot;; &quot;eternal&quot;): honored to rulers deemed worthy of eternal remembrance; and
* 中 (&quot;zhōng&quot;; &quot;resurgent&quot;): honored to sovereigns who revitalized their realm following a period of decline.

Chinese monarchs of the Zhou dynasty were given posthumous names but not temple names. During the Qin dynasty, the practices both of assigning temple names and posthumous names was abandoned. The Han dynasty reintroduced both titles, although temple names were assigned sporadically and remained more exclusive than posthumous names. It was also during the Han era that other adjectives aside from the four listed above began appearing in temple names. Numerous Han emperors had their temple names removed by Emperor Xian of Han, Liu Xie, in AD 190.

Initially, in deciding whether a monarch should be honored as &quot;祖&quot; (&quot;zǔ&quot;; &quot;progenitor&quot;) or &quot;宗&quot; (&quot;zōng&quot;; &quot;ancestor&quot;), a principle was strictly adhered to: &quot;祖&quot; was to be given to accomplished rulers while &quot;宗&quot; was to be assigned to virtuous rulers. However, this principle was effectively abandoned during the Sixteen Kingdoms era with the ubiquitous usage of &quot;祖&quot; by various non-Han regimes.

Temple names became widespread from the Tang dynasty onwards. Apart from the final ruler of a dynasty, monarchs who died prematurely, or monarchs who were deposed, most Chinese monarchs were given temple names by their descendants.

The practice of honoring rulers with temple names had since been adopted by other dynastic regimes within the East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere, including those based on the Korean Peninsula and in Vietnam. Japan, while having adopted both posthumous names and era names from China, did not assign temple names to its monarchs.

==Structure==
Most temple names consist of two Chinese characters, unlike the more elaborate posthumous names. In extremely rare cases, temple names could consist of three characters.

The first character is an adjective, chosen to reflect the circumstances of the monarch&#x27;s reign. The vocabulary may overlap with that of the posthumous names&#x27; adjectives; however, for one sovereign, the temple name&#x27;s adjective character usually does not repeat as one of the many adjective characters in his posthumous name.

The last character is either &quot;祖&quot; or &quot;宗&quot;:
* 祖 (&quot;zǔ&quot;; &quot;progenitor&quot;): typically used for founders, either of a dynasty or a new line within an existing one. Temple names bearing this character were also accorded to monarchs with great accomplishments. The equivalent in Korean is &quot;jo&quot; (), and &quot;tổ&quot; in Vietnamese.
* 宗 (&quot;zōng&quot;; &quot;ancestor&quot;): used for all other monarchs. It is rendered as &quot;jong&quot; () in Korean, and &quot;tông&quot; in Vietnamese.

<doc id="68315" wikidata="Q215972" url="?curid=68315" title="Protagonist">
<text>A protagonist () is the main character of a story. The protagonist makes key decisions that affect the plot, primarily influencing the story and propelling it forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.

The protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist provides obstacles and complications and creates conflicts that test the protagonist, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist&#x27;s character, and having the protagonist develop as a result.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;protagonist&quot; comes , combined of (, &#x27;first&#x27;) and (, &#x27;actor, competitor&#x27;), which stems from (, &#x27;contest&#x27;) via (, &#x27;I contend for a prize&#x27;).

==Ancient Greece==
The earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in Ancient Greece. At first, dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. Then in &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engaging in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C. Then the poet Aeschylus, in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. Sophocles then wrote plays that included a third actor.

A description of the protagonist&#x27;s origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later. There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as &quot;deuteragonist&quot; and &quot;tritagonist&quot; primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part. However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the deuteragonist (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the tritagonist (third most important character), the left.

In Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term &quot;hero&quot;, which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being in the narrative.

==Types==
===Hero/Heroine===
In literary terms, a hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) protagonist is typically admired for their achievements and noble qualities. Heroes are lauded for their strength, courage, virtuousness, and honor, and are considered to be the &quot;good guys&quot; of the narrative.

Examples include DC Comics&#x27; Superman (hero) and Katniss Everdeen from &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; (heroine).

===Antihero===

An antihero (sometimes spelled as anti-hero) or antiheroine is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage, and morality.

Examples include Holden Caulfield from &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara from &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, Jay Gatsby from &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and Walter White from Breaking Bad.

===Tragic hero===

A tragic hero is the protagonist of a tragedy.

Examples include Oedipus from &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and Prince Hamlet from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

===Villain protagonist===
The protagonist is not always conventionally good. Contrasting the hero protagonist, a villain protagonist is a protagonist who is a villain, driving the story forward regardless of the evil qualities the main character has. These traits can include being cruel, malicious, and wicked.

Examples include Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; and Richard III in the eponymous play by William Shakespeare.

===Supporting protagonist===
When a supporting protagonist appears, the story is told from the perspective of a character who appears to be minor. This character may be more peripheral from the events of the story and are not as involved within the &quot;main action&quot; of the plot. The supporting protagonist may be telling the story while viewing another character as the main influence of the plot.

One example is Nick in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

==Further examples==

Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Hippolytus&quot; may be considered to have two protagonists, though one at a time. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.

In Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist is the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).

Sometimes, a work will have a false protagonist, who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) is an example.

A novel may contain a number of narratives, each with its own protagonist. Alexander Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;The First Circle&quot;, for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a gulag camp. Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.

Though many people equate protagonists with the term hero and possessing heroic qualities, it is not necessary, as even villainous characters can be protagonists. For example Michael Corleone from &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972–1990) film series (1978–1983).

In some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in Richard Adams&#x27; novel &quot;Watership Down,&quot; a group of anthropomorphised rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.

<text>A heat pump is a device that uses electricity to transfer heat from a colder place to a warmer place. Specifically, the heat pump transfers thermal energy using a heat pump and refrigeration cycle, cooling the cool space and warming the warm space. In winter a heat pump can move heat from the cool outdoors to warm a house; the pump may also be designed to move heat from the house to the warmer outdoors in summer. As they transfer heat rather than generating heat, they are more energy-efficient than heating by gas boiler. 

A gaseous refrigerant is compressed so its pressure and temperature rise. When operating as a heater in cold weather, the warmed gas flows to a heat exchanger in the indoor space where some of its thermal energy is transferred to that indoor space, causing the gas to condense into a liquid. The liquified refrigerant flows to a heat exchanger in the outdoor space where the pressure falls, the liquid evaporates and the temperature of the gas falls. It is now colder than the temperature of the outdoor space being used as a heat source. It can again take up energy from the heat source, be compressed and repeat the cycle.

Air source heat pumps are the most common models, while other types include ground source heat pumps, water source heat pumps and exhaust air heat pumps. Large-scale heat pumps are also used in district heating systems.

The efficiency of a heat pump is expressed as a coefficient of performance (COP), or seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP). The higher the number, the more efficient a heat pump is. For example, an air-to-water heat pump that produces 6kW at a SCOP of 4.62 will give over 4kW of energy into a heating system for every kilowatt of energy that the heat pump uses itself to operate. When used for space heating, heat pumps are typically more energy-efficient than electric resistance and other heaters.

Because of their high efficiency and the increasing share of fossil-free sources in electrical grids, heat pumps are playing a role in climate change mitigation. Consuming 1 kWh of electricity, they can transfer 1 to 4.5 kWh of thermal energy into a building. The carbon footprint of heat pumps depends on how electricity is generated, but they usually reduce emissions. Heat pumps could satisfy over 80% of global space and water heating needs with a lower carbon footprint than gas-fired condensing boilers: however, in 2021 they only met 10%.

== Principle of operation ==

Heat flows spontaneously from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Heat does not flow spontaneously from lower temperature to higher, but it can be made to flow in this direction if work is performed. The work required to transfer a given amount of heat is usually much less than the amount of heat; this is the motivation for using heat pumps in applications such as the heating of water and the interior of buildings.

The amount of work required to drive an amount of heat Q from a lower-temperature reservoir such as ambient air to a higher-temperature reservoir such as the interior of a building is:
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the work performed on the working fluid by the heat pump&#x27;s compressor.
* formula_3 is the heat transferred from the lower-temperature reservoir to the higher-temperature reservoir.
* formula_4 is the instantaneous coefficient of performance for the heat pump at the temperatures prevailing in the reservoirs at one instant.

The coefficient of performance of a heat pump is greater than one so the work required is less than the heat transferred, making a heat pump a more efficient form of heating than electrical resistance heating. As the temperature of the higher-temperature reservoir increases in response to the heat flowing into it, the coefficient of performance decreases, causing an increasing amount of work to be required for each unit of heat being transferred.

The coefficient of performance, and the work required by a heat pump can be calculated easily by considering an ideal heat pump operating on the reversed Carnot cycle:
*If the low-temperature reservoir is at a temperature of and the interior of the building is at the relevant coefficient of performance is 27. This means only 1 joule of work is required to transfer 27 joules of heat from a reservoir at 270 K to another at 280 K. The one joule of work ultimately ends up as thermal energy in the interior of the building so for each 27 joules of heat that are removed from the low-temperature reservoir, 28 joules of heat are added to the building interior, making the heat pump even more attractive from an efficiency perspective.
*As the temperature of the interior of the building rises progressively to the coefficient of performance falls progressively to 9. This means each joule of work is responsible for transferring 9 joules of heat out of the low-temperature reservoir and into the building. Again, the 1 joule of work ultimately ends up as thermal energy in the interior of the building so 10 joules of heat are added to the building interior.

This is the theoretical amount of heat pumped but in practice it will be less for various reasons, for example if the outside unit has been installed where there is not enough airflow. More data sharing with owners and academics—perhaps from heat meters—could improve efficiency in the long run.

== History ==
Milestones:

;1748
: William Cullen demonstrates artificial refrigeration.
;1834
: Jacob Perkins patents a design for a practical refrigerator using dimethyl ether.
;1852
: Lord Kelvin describes the theory underlying heat pumps.
;1855–1857
: Peter von Rittinger develops and builds the first heat pump.
;1877
: In the period before 1875, heat pumps were for the time being pursued for vapour compression evaporation (open heat pump process) in salt works with their obvious advantages for saving wood and coal. In 1857, Peter von Rittinger was the first to try to implement the idea of vapor compression in a small pilot plant. Presumably inspired by Rittinger&#x27;s experiments in Ebensee, Antoine-Paul Piccard from the University of Lausanne and the engineer J. H. Weibel from the Weibel–Briquet company in Geneva built the world&#x27;s first really functioning vapor compression system with a two-stage piston compressor. In 1877 this first heat pump in Switzerland was installed in the Bex salt works.
;1928
: Aurel Stodola constructs a closed-loop heat pump (water source from Lake Geneva) which provides heating for the Geneva city hall to this day.
;1937–1945
: During the First World War, fuel prices were very high in Switzerland but it had plenty of hydropower. In the period before and especially during the Second World War, when neutral Switzerland was completely surrounded by fascist-ruled countries, the coal shortage became alarming again. Thanks to their leading position in energy technology, the Swiss companies Sulzer, Escher Wyss and Brown Boveri built and put in operation around 35 heat pumps between 1937 and 1945. The main heat sources were lake water, river water, groundwater, and waste heat. Particularly noteworthy are the six historic heat pumps from the city of Zurich with heat outputs from 100 kW to 6 MW. An international milestone is the heat pump built by Escher Wyss in 1937/38 to replace the wood stoves in the City Hall of Zurich. To avoid noise and vibrations, a recently developed rotary piston compressor was used. This historic heat pump heated the town hall for 63 years until 2001. Only then was it replaced by a new, more efficient heat pump.
;1945
: John Sumner, City Electrical Engineer for Norwich, installs an experimental water-source heat pump fed central heating system, using a nearby river to heat new Council administrative buildings. It had a seasonal efficiency ratio of 3.42, average thermal delivery of 147 kW, and peak output of 234 kW.
;1948
: Robert C. Webber is credited as developing and building the first ground-source heat pump.
;1951
: First large scale installation—the Royal Festival Hall in London is opened with a town gas-powered reversible water-source heat pump, fed by the Thames, for both winter heating and summer cooling needs.
;2019
: The Kigali Amendment to phase out harmful refrigerants takes effect.

==Types==

===Air-source===
===Ground source===
=== Heat recovery ventilation ===

Exhaust air heat pumps extract heat from the exhaust air of a building and require mechanical ventilation. Two classes exist:
* Exhaust air-air heat pumps transfer heat to intake air.
* Exhaust air-water heat pumps transfer heat to a heating circuit that includes a tank of domestic hot water.

=== Solar-assisted ===
===Water-source===
A water-source heat pump works in a similar manner to a ground-source heat pump, except that it takes heat from a body of water rather than the ground. The body of water does, however, need to be large enough to be able to withstand the cooling effect of the unit without freezing or creating an adverse effect for wildlife. The largest water-source heat pump was installed in the Danish town of Esbjerg in 2023.

=== Others===
A thermoacoustic heat pump operates as a thermoacoustic heat engine without refrigerant but instead uses a standing wave in a sealed chamber driven by a loudspeaker to achieve a temperature difference across the chamber.

Electrocaloric heat pumps are solid state.

==Applications==
The International Energy Agency estimated that, as of 2021, heat pumps installed in buildings have a combined capacity of more than 1000 GW. They are used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and may also provide domestic hot water and tumble clothes drying. The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates.

===Space heating and sometimes also cooling===
In HVAC applications, a heat pump is typically a vapor-compression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of &quot;heat flow&quot; (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building.

Because the two heat exchangers, the condenser and evaporator, must swap functions, they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes. Therefore, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER in the US) or European seasonal energy efficiency ratio of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than those of two separately optimized machines. For equipment to receive the US Energy Star rating, it must have a rating of at least 14 SEER. Pumps with ratings of 18 SEER or above are considered highly efficient. The highest efficiency heat pumps manufactured are up to 24 SEER.

Heating seasonal performance factor (in the US) or Seasonal Performance Factor (in Europe) are ratings of heating performance. The SPF is Total heat output per annum / Total electricity consumed per annum in other words the average heating COP over the year.

====Window mounted heat pump====

Window mounted heat pumps run on standard 120v AC outlets and provide heating, cooling, and humidity control. They are more efficient with lower noise levels, condensation management, and a smaller footprint than window mounted air conditioners that just do cooling.

===Water heating===
In water heating applications, heat pumps may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools, homes or industry. Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank.

===District heating===
Large (megawatt-scale) heat pumps are used for district heating. However about 90% of district heat is from fossil fuels. In Europe, heat pumps account for a mere 1% of heat supply in district heating networks but several countries have targets to decarbonise their networks between 2030 and 2040. Possible sources of heat for such applications are sewage water, ambient water (e.g. sea, lake and river water), industrial waste heat, geothermal energy, flue gas, waste heat from district cooling and heat from solar seasonal thermal energy storage. Large-scale heat pumps for district heating combined with thermal energy storage offer high flexibility for the integration of variable renewable energy. Therefore, they are regarded as a key technology for limiting climate change by phasing out fossil fuels. They are also a crucial element of systems which can both heat and cool districts.

===Industrial heating===
There is great potential to reduce the energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in industry by application of industrial heat pumps, for example for process heat. Short payback periods of less than 2 years are possible, while achieving a high reduction of emissions (in some cases more than 50%). Industrial heat pumps can heat up to 200 °C, and can meet the heating demands of many light industries. In Europe alone, 15 GW of heat pumps could be installed in 3,000 facilities in the paper, food and chemicals industries.

==Performance==

The performance of a heat pump is determined by the ability of the pump to extract heat from a low temperature environment (the &quot;source&quot;) and deliver it to a higher temperature environment (the &quot;sink&quot;). Performance varies, depending on installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, location on site, pipe runs, flow rates, and maintenance. 

In general, heat pumps work most efficiently (that is, the heat output produced for a given energy input) when the difference between the heat source and the heat sink is small. When using a heat pump for space or water heating, therefore, the heat pump will be most efficient in mild conditions, and decline in efficiency on very cold days. Performance metrics supplied to consumers attempt to take this variation into account.

Common performance metrics are the SEER (in cooling mode) and seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) (commonly used just for heating), although SCOP can be used for both modes of operation. Larger values of either metric indicate better performance. When comparing the performance of heat pumps, the term &quot;performance&quot; is preferred to &quot;efficiency&quot;, with coefficient of performance (COP) being used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input. An electrical resistance heater has a COP of 1.0, which is considerably lower than a well-designed heat pump which will typically have a COP of 3 to 5 with an external temperature of 10 °C and an internal temperature of 20 °C. Because the ground is a constant temperature source, a ground-source heat pump is not subjected to large temperature fluctuations, and therefore is the most energy-efficient type of heat pump.

The &quot;seasonal coefficient of performance&quot; (SCOP) is a measure of the aggregate energy efficiency measure over a period of one year which is dependent on regional climate. One framework for this calculation is given by the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 813/2013.

A heat pump&#x27;s operating performance in cooling mode is characterized in the US by either its energy efficiency ratio (EER) or seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER), both of which have units of BTU/(h·W) (note that 1 BTU/(h·W) = 0.293 W/W) and larger values indicate better performance.

===Carbon footprint===
The carbon footprint of heat pumps depends on their individual efficiency and how electricity is produced. An increasing share of low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar will lower the impact on the climate.

In most settings, heat pumps will reduce emissions compared to heating systems powered by fossil fuels. In regions accounting for 70% of world energy consumption, the emissions savings of heat pumps compared with a high-efficiency gas boiler are on average above 45% and reach 80% in countries with cleaner electricity mixes. These values can be improved by 10 percentage points, respectively, with alternative refrigerants. In the United States, 70% of houses could reduce emissions by installing a heat pump. The rising share of renewable electricity generation in many countries is set to increase the emissions savings from heat pumps over time.

Heating systems powered by green hydrogen are also low-carbon and may become competitors, but are much less efficient due to the energy loss associated with hydrogen conversion, transport and use. In addition, not enough green hydrogen is expected to be available before the 2030s or 2040s.

==Operation==


Vapor-compression uses a circulating refrigerant as the medium which absorbs heat from one space, compresses it thereby increasing its temperature before releasing it in another space. The system normally has eight main components: a compressor, a reservoir, a reversing valve which selects between heating and cooling mode, two thermal expansion valves (one used when in heating mode and the other when used in cooling mode) and two heat exchangers, one associated with the external heat source/sink and the other with the interior. In heating mode the external heat exchanger is the evaporator and the internal one being the condenser; in cooling mode the roles are reversed.

Circulating refrigerant enters the compressor in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated vapor and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then in the thermodynamic state known as a superheated vapor and it is at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed with either cooling water or cooling air flowing across the coil or tubes. In heating mode this heat is used to heat the building using the internal heat exchanger, and in cooling mode this heat is rejected via the external heat exchanger.

The condensed, liquid refrigerant, in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated liquid, is next routed through an expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in the adiabatic flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant. The auto-refrigeration effect of the adiabatic flash evaporation lowers the temperature of the liquid and-vapor refrigerant mixture to where it is colder than the temperature of the enclosed space to be refrigerated.

The cold mixture is then routed through the coil or tubes in the evaporator. A fan circulates the warm air in the enclosed space across the coil or tubes carrying the cold refrigerant liquid and vapor mixture. That warm air evaporates the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture. At the same time, the circulating air is cooled and thus lowers the temperature of the enclosed space to the desired temperature. The evaporator is where the circulating refrigerant absorbs and removes heat which is subsequently rejected in the condenser and transferred elsewhere by the water or air used in the condenser.

To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor from the evaporator is again a saturated vapor and is routed back into the compressor.

Over time, the evaporator may collect ice or water from ambient humidity. The ice is melted through defrosting cycle. An internal heat exchanger is either used to heat/cool the interior air directly or to heat water that is then circulated through radiators or underfloor heating circuit to either heat or cool the buildings.

===Improvement of coefficient of performance by subcooling===

Heat input can be improved if the refrigerant enters the evaporator with a lower vapor content. This can be achieved by cooling the liquid refrigerant after condensation. The gaseous refrigerant condenses on the heat exchange surface of the condenser. To achieve a heat flow from the gaseous flow center to the wall of the condenser, the temperature of the liquid refrigerant must be lower than the condensation temperature.

Additional subcooling can be achieved by heat exchange between relatively warm liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser and the cooler refrigerant vapor emerging from the evaporator. The enthalpy difference required for the subcooling leads to the superheating of the vapor drawn into the compressor. When the increase in cooling achieved by subcooling is greater that the compressor drive input required to overcome the additional pressure losses, such a heat exchange improves the coefficient of performance.

One disadvantage of the subcooling of liquids is that the difference between the condensing temperature and the heat-sink temperature must be larger. This leads to a moderately high pressure difference between condensing and evaporating pressure, whereby the compressor energy increases.

===Refrigerant choice===

Pure refrigerants can be divided into organic substances (hydrocarbons (HCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), and HCFOs), and inorganic substances (ammonia (), carbon dioxide (), and water ()). Their boiling points are usually below −25 °C.

In the past 200 years, the standards and requirements for new refrigerants have changed. Nowadays low global warming potential (GWP) is required, in addition to all the previous requirements for safety, practicality, material compatibility, appropriate atmospheric life, and compatibility with high-efficiency products. By 2022, devices using refrigerants with a very low GWP still have a small market share but are expected to play an increasing role due to enforced regulations, as most countries have now ratified the Kigali Amendment to ban HFCs. Isobutane (R600A) and propane (R290) are far less harmful to the environment than conventional hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and are already being used in air-source heat pumps. Propane may be the most suitable for high temperature heat pumps. Ammonia (R717) and carbon dioxide (R-744) also have a low GWP. smaller heat pumps are not widely available and research and development of them continues. A 2024 report said that refrigerants with GWP are vulnerable to further international restrictions.

Until the 1990s, heat pumps, along with fridges and other related products used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerants, which caused major damage to the ozone layer when released into the atmosphere. Use of these chemicals was banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987.

Replacements, including R-134a and R-410A, are hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) with similar thermodynamic properties with insignificant ozone depletion potential (ODP) but had problematic GWP. HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change. Dimethyl ether (DME) also gained in popularity as a refrigerant in combination with R404a. More recent refrigerants include difluoromethane (R32) with a lower GWP, but still over 600.

Devices with R-290 refrigerant (propane) are expected to play a key role in the future. The 100-year GWP of propane, at 0.02, is extremely low and is approximately 7000 times less than R-32. However, the flammability of propane requires additional safety measures: the maximum safe charges have been set significantly lower than for lower flammability refrigerants (only allowing approximately 13.5 times less refrigerant in the system than R-32). This means that R-290 is not suitable for all situations or locations. Nonetheless, by 2022, an increasing number of devices with R-290 were offered for domestic use, especially in Europe.

At the same time, HFC refrigerants still dominate the market. Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant. Replacements such as R-32 and R-410A are being promoted as environmentally friendly but still have a high GWP. A heat pump typically uses 3 kg of refrigerant. With R-32 this amount still has a 20-year impact equivalent to 7 tons of , which corresponds to two years of natural gas heating in an average household. Refrigerants with a high ODP have already been phased out.

==Government incentives==
Financial incentives aim to protect consumers from high fossil gas costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and are currently available in more than 30 countries around the world, covering more than 70% of global heating demand in 2021.

===Australia===
Food processors, brewers, petfood producers and other industrial energy users are exploring whether it is feasible to use renewable energy to produce industrial-grade heat. Process heating accounts for the largest share of onsite energy use in Australian manufacturing, with lower-temperature operations like food production particularly well-suited to transition to renewables.

To help producers understand how they could benefit from making the switch, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) provided funding to the Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity (A2EP) to undertake pre-feasibility studies at a range of sites around Australia, with the most promising locations advancing to full feasibility studies.

In an effort to incentivize energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact, the Australian states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland have implemented rebate programs targeting the upgrade of existing hot water systems. These programs specifically encourage the transition from traditional gas or electric systems to heat pump based systems.

===Canada===
In 2022, the Canada Greener Homes Grant provides up to $5000 for upgrades (including certain heat pumps), and $600 for energy efficiency evaluations.

=== China ===
Purchase subsidies in rural areas in the 2010s reduced burning coal for heating, which had been causing ill health.

In the 2024 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) titled &quot;The Future of Heat Pumps in China,&quot; it is highlighted that China, as the world&#x27;s largest market for heat pumps in buildings, plays a critical role in the global industry. The country accounts for over one-quarter of global sales, with a 12% increase in 2023 alone, despite a global sales dip of 3% the same year.

Heat pumps are now used in approximately 8% of all heating equipment sales for buildings in China as of 2022, and they are increasingly becoming the norm in central and southern regions for both heating and cooling. Despite their higher upfront costs and relatively low awareness, heat pumps are favored for their energy efficiency, consuming three to five times less energy than electric heaters or fossil fuel-based solutions. Currently, decentralized heat pumps installed in Chinese buildings represent a quarter of the global installed capacity, with a total capacity exceeding 250 GW, which covers around 4% of the heating needs in buildings.

Under the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which aligns with China&#x27;s carbon neutrality goals, the capacity is expected to reach 1,400 GW by 2050, meeting 25% of heating needs. This scenario would require an installation of about 100 GW of heat pumps annually until 2050. Furthermore, the heat pump sector in China employs over 300,000 people, with employment numbers expected to double by 2050, underscoring the importance of vocational training for industry growth. This robust development in the heat pump market is set to play a significant role in reducing direct emissions in buildings by 30% and cutting PM2.5 emissions from residential heating by nearly 80% by 2030.

===European Union===
To speed up the deployment rate of heat pumps, the European Commission launched the Heat Pump Accelerator Platform in November 2024. It will encourage industry experts, policymakers, and stakeholders to collaborate, share best practices and ideas, and jointly discuss measures that promote sustainable heating solutions.

===United Kingdom===

Until 2027 fixed heat pumps have no Value Added Tax (VAT). the installation cost of a heat pump is more than a gas boiler, but with the &quot;Boiler Upgrade Scheme&quot; government grant and assuming electricity/gas costs remain similar their lifetime costs would be similar on average. However lifetime cost relative to a gas boiler varies considerably depending on several factors, such as the quality of the heat pump installation and the tariff used. In 2024 England was criticised for still allowing new homes to be built with gas boilers, unlike some other counties where this is banned.

===United States===

The High-efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program was created in 2022 to award grants to State energy offices and Indian Tribes in order to establish state-wide high-efficiency electric-home rebates. Effective immediately, American households are eligible for a tax credit to cover the costs of buying and installing a heat pump, up to $2,000. Starting in 2023, low- and moderate-level income households will be eligible for a heat-pump rebate of up to $8,000.

In 2022, more heat pumps were sold in the United States than natural gas furnaces.

In November 2023 Biden&#x27;s administration allocated 169 million dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act to speed up production of heat pumps. It used the Defense Production Act to do so, because according to the administration, energy that is better for the climate is also better for national security.

<text>The Battle of the Boyne ( ) took place in 1690 between the forces of the deposed King James II, and those of King William III who, with his wife Queen Mary II (his cousin and James&#x27;s daughter), had acceded to the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1689. The battle was fought across the River Boyne close to the town of Drogheda in the Kingdom of Ireland, modern-day Republic of Ireland, and resulted in a victory for William. This turned the tide in James&#x27;s failed attempt to regain the British crown and ultimately aided in ensuring the continued Protestant ascendancy in Ireland.

The battle took place on 1 July 1690 O.S. William&#x27;s forces defeated James&#x27;s army, which consisted mostly of raw recruits. Although the Williamite War in Ireland continued until the signing of the Treaty of Limerick in October 1691, James fled to France after the Boyne, never to return.

==Background==
The battle was a major encounter in James&#x27;s attempt to regain the thrones of England and Scotland, resulting from the Invitation to William and William&#x27;s wife, Mary, from the &#x27;immortal seven&#x27; English peers to take the throne to defend Protestantism. But the conflict had broader and deeper European geopolitical roots, of the League of Augsburg and the Grand Alliance against the expansionist ambitions of Catholic Louis XIV of France, or of the House of Bourbon against the House of Habsburg. If the battle is seen as part of the War of the Grand Alliance, Pope Alexander VIII was an ally of William and a friend to James; the Papal States were part of the Grand Alliance with a shared hostility to the Catholic Louis XIV of France, who at the time was attempting to establish dominance in Europe and to whom James was an ally.

The previous year William had sent the Duke of Schomberg to take charge of the Irish campaign. He was a 75-year-old professional soldier who had accompanied William during the Glorious Revolution. He brought an army of 20,000 men, which arrived at Bangor. Under his command, affairs had remained static and very little had been accomplished, partly because the English troops suffered severely from fever and the army&#x27;s move south was blocked by Jacobite forces; both sides camped for the winter.

In an Irish context, the war was a sectarian and ethnic conflict, in many ways a re-run of the Irish Confederate Wars of 50 years earlier. For the Jacobites, the war was fought for Irish sovereignty, religious tolerance for Catholicism, and land ownership. The Catholic upper classes had lost or had been forced to exchange almost all their lands after Cromwell&#x27;s conquest, as well as the right to hold public office, practice their religion, and sit in the Irish Parliament. To these ends, under Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel, they had raised an army to restore James II after the Glorious Revolution. Sir James Fitz Edmond Cotter being the commander-in-chief of all King James&#x27;s forces in the counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. By 1690, they controlled all of Ireland except for Derry and Enniskillen.
The majority of Irish people were Jacobites and supported James II due to his 1687 Declaration of Indulgence or, as it is also known, the Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II&#x27;s promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.

Conversely, for the Williamites in Ireland, the war was about maintaining Protestant rule in Ireland. They feared for their lives and their property if James and his Catholic supporters were to rule Ireland, nor did they trust the promise of tolerance, seeing the Declaration of Indulgence as a ploy to re-establish Catholicism as the sole state religion. James had already antagonised English Protestants with his actions. In particular, they dreaded a repeat of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, which had been marked by widespread killing. For these reasons, Protestants fought &quot;en masse&quot; for William of Orange. Many Williamite troops at the Boyne, including their very effective irregular cavalry, were Ulster Protestants, who called themselves &quot;Enniskilliners&quot; and were referred to by contemporaries as &quot;Scots-Irish&quot;. These &quot;Enniskilliners&quot; were mostly the descendants of Anglo-Scottish border reivers; large numbers of these reivers had settled around Enniskillen in County Fermanagh.

===Commanders===

The opposing armies in the battle were led by the Roman Catholic king James II of England and Ireland (VII of Scotland) and, opposing him, his nephew and son-in-law, the Protestant king William III (&quot;William of Orange&quot;) who had deposed James the previous year. James&#x27;s supporters controlled much of Ireland and the Irish Parliament. James also enjoyed the support of his cousin, Louis XIV, who did not want to see a hostile monarch on the throne of England. Louis sent 6,000 French troops to Ireland to support the Irish Jacobites. William was already Stadtholder of the Netherlands and was able to call on Dutch and allied troops from Europe as well as England and Scotland.

James was a seasoned officer who had proved his bravery when fighting in Europe, notably at the Battle of the Dunes. However, recent historians have suggested that he was prone to panicking under pressure and making rash decisions, which it has been suggested may have been due to poor health associated with the Stuart line.

William, although a seasoned commander, had yet to win a major battle. William&#x27;s success against the French had been reliant upon tactical manoeuvres and good diplomacy rather than force. His diplomacy had assembled the League of Augsburg, a multi-national coalition formed to resist French aggression in Europe. From William&#x27;s point of view, his taking power in England and the ensuing campaign in Ireland was just another front in the war against France in general, and Louis XIV in particular.

James II&#x27;s subordinate commanders were Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, who was Lord Deputy of Ireland and James&#x27;s most powerful supporter in Ireland; Sir James Fitz Edmond Cotter, Brigadier General in command of all the Jacobite forces in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary, and an intimate of James II; and the French general Lauzun. William&#x27;s commander-in-chief was the Duke of Schomberg. Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Schomberg had fought for a few different countries and had formerly been a Marshal of France, but, being a Huguenot, was compelled to leave France in 1685 because of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

===Armies===
The Williamite army at the Boyne was about 36,000 strong, composed of troops from many countries; Only around half of them were British. Around 20,000 troops had been in Ireland since 1689, commanded by Schomberg. William himself had landed in Carrickfergus on 14 June O.S. He met Schomberg at nearby Whitehouse, and then proceeded south through Belfast. Loughbrickland was the rallying point of the scattered divisions of the army. He arrived there with another 16,000 in June 1690. On 30 June O.S. William had reached the top of a hill near the southern border of County Louth.

William&#x27;s troops were generally far better trained and equipped than James&#x27;s. The best Williamite infantry were from Denmark (7000) and the Netherlands (6000), professional soldiers equipped with the latest flintlock muskets. The Danish infantry was commanded by General Ernst von Tettau. There was also a large (3000) contingent of French Huguenot troops fighting with the Williamites. William did not yet have a high opinion of his English and Scottish troops, with the exception of the Ulster Protestant &quot;skirmishers&quot; who had held Derry in the previous year; the English and Scottish troops were felt at this stage to be politically unreliable, since James had been their legitimate monarch up to a year before. Moreover, they had only been raised recently and had seen little action. However, this battle would give William cause to evaluate them more favourably, due to the impressive behaviour of the English troops, such as the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Regiment of Foot.

James’s flag was erected at the town of Donore, on the opposite side of the river Boyne. The Jacobites were 23,500 strong. James had several regiments of French troops, but most of his manpower was provided by Irish Catholics, with some English and Scottish Jacobites also present. The Jacobites&#x27; Irish cavalry, who were recruited from among the dispossessed Irish gentry, proved themselves to be high-calibre troops during the course of the battle. However, the Irish infantry, predominantly peasants who had been pressed into service, were not trained soldiers. They had been hastily trained, poorly equipped, and only a minority of them had functional muskets. In fact, some of them carried only farm implements such as scythes at the Boyne. Furthermore, the Jacobite infantry who actually had firearms were all equipped with the obsolete matchlock musket. The French and Irish troops wore a white rallying mark, as a compliment to the Bourbons and to distinguish them from the Williamites.

==Battle==

William sailed from Hoylake in Cheshire, landing at Carrickfergus, County Antrim on 14 June O.S. and marched south. Referring to Dublin, he was heard to remark that &quot;the place was worth fighting for&quot;. James chose to place his line of defence on the River Boyne, around from Dublin. The Williamites reached the Boyne on 29 June. The day before the battle, William himself had a narrow escape when he was wounded in the shoulder by Jacobite artillery while surveying the fords over which his troops would cross the Boyne.

The battle itself was fought on 1 July O.S. (11 July N.S.), for control of a ford on the Boyne near Drogheda, about north-west of the hamlet of Oldbridge. As a diversionary tactic, William sent about a quarter of his men under the cover of morning mist to cross the river at Roughgrange, about west of Donore and about south-west of Oldbridge. The Duke of Schomberg&#x27;s son, Meinhardt, led this crossing, which a small force of Irish dragoons in picquet under Neil O&#x27;Neill unsuccessfully opposed. James thought that he might be outflanked and sent a large part of his army, including his best French troops along with most of his artillery, to counter this move. What neither side had realised was that there was a deep, swampy ravine at Roughgrange. Because of this ravine, the opposing forces there could not engage each other, but literally sat out the battle as artillery engaged. The Williamite forces went on a long detour march which, later in the day, almost saw them cut off the Jacobite retreat at the village of Naul.

At the main ford near Oldbridge, William&#x27;s infantry, led by the elite Dutch Blue Guards under Solms, forced their way across the river, using their superior firepower to slowly drive back the Jacobite foot soldiers, but were pinned down when the Jacobite cavalry, commanded by James II&#x27;s son James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, counter-attacked. Having secured the village of Oldbridge, the Williamite infantry tried to hold off successive Jacobite Irish cavalry attacks with disciplined volley fire, but many were scattered and driven into the river, with the exception of the Blue Guards. When William saw his Dutch Guards isolated on the enemy side of the river and without any protection from natural obstacles he was extremely worried according to an eyewitness: The Blue Guards had formed up in three separate squares and were, by using platoon fire, able to drive away the Jacobite cavalry. The Williamites were not able to resume their advance until their own horsemen managed to cross the river and, after being badly mauled, particularly the Huguenots, managed to hold off the Jacobite cavalry. William&#x27;s second-in-command, the Duke of Schomberg, and George Walker were killed in this phase of the battle. The Irish cavalry finally gave up when Danish infantry commanded by Wurttemberg and cavalry led by Godert de Ginkel (about 11 or 12 squadrons), who had both crossed the river further downstream, advanced towards them.

The Jacobites retired in good order. William had a chance to trap them as they retreated across the River Nanny at Duleek, but his troops were held up by a successful rear-guard action. The Dutch secretary of King William, Constantijn Huygens Jr., has given a good description (in Dutch) of the battle and its aftermath, including subsequent cruelties committed by the victorious soldiers.

The casualty figures of the battle were quite low for a battle of such a scale—of the 50,000 or so participants, about 2,000 died. Three quarters of the dead were Jacobites. William&#x27;s army had far more wounded. At the time, most casualties of battles tended to be inflicted in the pursuit of an already-beaten enemy; this did not happen at the Boyne, as the counter-attacks of the skilled Jacobite cavalry screened the retreat of the rest of their army, and in addition William was always disinclined to endanger the person of James, since he was the father of his wife, Mary. The Jacobites were badly demoralised by the order to retreat, which lost them the battle. Many of the Irish infantrymen deserted, abandoning clothing in their escape. The Williamites triumphantly marched into Dublin two days after the battle. The Jacobite army abandoned the city and marched to Limerick, behind the River Shannon, where they were unsuccessfully besieged.

Soon after the battle, William issued the Declaration of Finglas, offering full pardons to ordinary Jacobite soldiers, but not to their leaders.

The battle was overshadowed in Britain by the defeat of an Anglo-Dutch fleet by the French on the previous day at the Battle of Beachy Head, a far more serious event in the short term; but on the continent the Battle of the Boyne was treated as an important victory. Its importance lay in the fact that it was the first proper victory for the League of Augsburg, a precarious alliance between the Vatican and Protestant countries. The victory motivated more nations to join the alliance and in effect ended the fear of a French conquest of Europe.

The Boyne also had strategic significance for both England and Ireland. It marked the beginning of the end of James&#x27;s hope of regaining his throne by military means and probably assured the triumph of the Glorious Revolution. In Scotland, news of this defeat temporarily silenced the Highlanders supporting the Jacobite rising, which had been led by Bonnie Dundee who was killed the previous July at the Battle of Killiecrankie. The battle was a general victory for William. Owing to the political situation mentioned above, Catholic institutions amongst William&#x27;s continental allies hailed his victory with bell-ringing.

The battle caused the Jacobites to abandon the city of Dublin, which was occupied by William&#x27;s forces, without a fight. Despairing of his hopes for victory, James II fled to Duncannon and returned to exile in France, even though his army left the field relatively unscathed. James&#x27;s loss of nerve and speedy exit from the battlefield enraged his Irish supporters and he was derisively nicknamed &quot;Séamus a&#x27; chaca&quot; (&quot;James the shit&quot;) in Irish. The war in Ireland had not ended, however. The Franco-Irish Jacobite army regrouped in Limerick and fought off a Williamite assault on the city in late August. It was not until the following year and battle of Aughrim that their forces were broken and after another siege of Limerick, they surrendered to William&#x27;s general Godard de Ginkel. The war in Ireland formally ended with the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. This allowed over 14,000 Irish soldiers under Patrick Sarsfield, to leave for France and allowed most Irish Catholic land owners to keep their land provided they swore allegiance to William of Orange. However, the Protestant dominated Irish Parliament rejected these terms, not ratifying the treaty until 1697—and then not in full—and imposed a tough Penal Code resented by Irish Catholics for many years.

==Commemoration==
Originally, the Twelfth of July commemoration was that of the Battle of Aughrim, symbolising British Protestants&#x27; victory in the Williamite war in Ireland. At Aughrim, which took place a year after the Boyne, the Jacobite army was destroyed, deciding the war in the Williamites&#x27; favour. The Boyne, which, in the old Julian calendar, took place on 1 July O.S., was treated as less important, third after Aughrim and the anniversary of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 on 23 October O.S.

In 1752, the Gregorian calendar was also adopted in Ireland. However, even after this date, &quot;The Twelfth&quot; continued to be commemorated at Aughrim, on 12 July NS, following the usual historical convention of commemorating events of that period within Great Britain and Ireland by mapping the Julian date directly onto the modern Gregorian calendar date (as happens for example with Guy Fawkes Night on 5 November). But, after the Orange Order was founded in 1795 amid sectarian violence in County Armagh, the two events were combined in the late 18th century.
===&quot;The Twelfth&quot; in Northern Ireland today===
The Battle of the Boyne remains a controversial topic today in Northern Ireland, where some Protestants remember it as the great victory over Catholics that resulted in the sovereignty of Parliament and the Protestant monarchy.

In recent decades, &quot;The Twelfth&quot; has often been marked by confrontations, as members of the Orange Order attempt to celebrate the date by marching past or through what they see as their traditional route. Some of these areas, however, now have a nationalist majority who object to marches passing through what they see as their areas.

Many nationalists still see these marches as provocative, whilst Unionist marchers insist that it is part of their historical right to celebrate. Since the start of the Troubles, the celebrations of the battle have been seen as playing a critical role in the awareness of those involved in the unionist/nationalist tensions in Northern Ireland. Better policing and improved dialogue between the sides in the 21st century have made for more peaceful parades.

=== &quot;The Eleventh Night&quot; in Northern Ireland ===
There are also traditions set to happen on 11 July, the eve of the Twelfth Night, known as the Eleventh Night. On this night, Protestants ignite bonfires all over Northern Ireland to celebrate the commencement of the Twelfth Night.

The reason they use bonfires to symbolize the event dates back to the pagan celebrations of Midsummer, Bealtaine and Samhain, where fire is used as a symbol of celebration.

Many object to the use of bonfires in Loyalist celebrations today, especially because many bonfires now include &quot;the burning of flags, effigies and election posters.&quot;

===Battlefield preservation===
The site of the Battle of the Boyne sprawls over a wide area west of the town of Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland. In the County Development Plan for 2000, Meath County Council rezoned the land at the eastern edge of Oldbridge, at the site of the main Williamite crossing, to residential status. A subsequent planning application for a development of over 700 houses was granted by Meath County Council and this was appealed against by local historians to An Bord Pleanála (The Planning Board). In March 2008, after an extremely long appeal process, An Bord Pleanála approved permission for this development to proceed. Further plans have been submitted for hundreds more homes and a link to the River Boyne Boardwalk.

The Battle of the Boyne Visitor Centre at Oldbridge house is run by the Office of Public Works, an agency of the Irish government, and is about to the west of the main river crossing point. The battle&#x27;s other main combat areas, at Duleek, Donore and Plattin, along the Jacobite line of retreat, are marked with tourist information signs.

On 4 April 2007, in a sign of improving relations between unionist and nationalist groups, the newly elected First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Reverend Ian Paisley, was invited to visit the battle site by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern later in the year. Following the invitation, Paisley commented that &quot;such a visit would help to demonstrate how far we have come when we can celebrate and learn from the past so the next generation more clearly understands&quot;. On 10 May, the visit took place, and Paisley presented the Taoiseach with a Jacobite musket in return for Ahern&#x27;s gift at the St Andrews talks of a walnut bowl made from a tree from the site. A new tree was also planted in the grounds of Oldbridge House by the two politicians to mark the occasion.

<text>Cesario Estrada Chavez (; ; March 31, 1927 – April 23, 1993) was an American labor leader and civil rights activist. Along with Dolores Huerta and lesser known Gilbert Padilla, he co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) to become the United Farm Workers (UFW) labor union. Ideologically, his worldview combined left-wing politics with Catholic social teachings.

Born in Yuma, Arizona, to a Mexican-American family, Chavez began his working life as a manual laborer before spending two years in the U.S. Navy. Relocating to California, where he married, he got involved in the Community Service Organization (CSO), through which he helped laborers register to vote. In 1959, he became the CSO&#x27;s national director, a position based in Los Angeles. In 1962, he left the CSO to co-found the NFWA, based in Delano, California, through which he launched an insurance scheme, a credit union, and the &quot;El Malcriado&quot; newspaper for farmworkers. Later that decade, he began organizing strikes among farmworkers, most notably the successful Delano grape strike of 1965–1970. Amid the grape strike, his NFWA merged with Larry Itliong&#x27;s AWOC to form the UFW in 1967. Influenced by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, Chavez emphasized direct nonviolent tactics, including pickets and boycotts, to pressure farm owners into granting strikers&#x27; demands. He imbued his campaigns with Roman Catholic symbolism, including public processions, Masses, and fasts. He received much support from labor and leftist groups but was monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

In the early 1970s, Chavez sought to expand the UFW&#x27;s influence outside California by opening branches in other U.S. states. Viewing illegal immigrants as a major source of strike-breakers, he also pushed a campaign against illegal immigration into the U.S., which generated violence along the U.S.-Mexico border and caused schisms with many of the UFW&#x27;s allies. Interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, he established a remote commune at Keene. His increased isolation and emphasis on unrelenting campaigning alienated many California farmworkers who had previously supported him, and by 1973 the UFW had lost most of the contracts and membership it won during the late 1960s. His alliance with California Governor Jerry Brown helped ensure the passing of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, although the UFW&#x27;s campaign to get its measures enshrined in California&#x27;s constitution failed. Influenced by the Synanon religious organization, Chavez re-emphasized communal living and purged perceived opponents. Membership of the UFW dwindled in the 1980s, with Chavez refocusing on anti-pesticide campaigns and moving into real-estate development, generating controversy for his use of non-unionized laborers.

Chavez became a controversial figure. UFW critics raised concerns about his autocratic control of the union, the purges of those he deemed disloyal, and the personality cult built around him, while farm owners considered him a communist subversive. He became an icon for organized labor and leftist groups in the U.S. Posthumously, he became a &quot;folk saint&quot; among Mexican Americans. His birthday is a federal commemorative holiday in several U.S. states, while many places are named after him, and in 1994 he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1927–1945===
Cesario Estrada Chavez was born in Yuma, Arizona on March 31, 1927. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Cesario Chavez, a Mexican who had crossed into Texas in 1898. Cesario had established a successful wood haulage business near Yuma, and in 1906 bought a farm in the Sonora Desert&#x27;s North Gila Valley. Cesario had brought his wife Dorotea and eight children with him from Mexico; the youngest, Librado, was Cesar&#x27;s father. Librado married Juana Estrada Chavez in the early 1920s. Born in Ascensión, Chihuahua, she had crossed into the U.S. with her mother as a baby. They lived in Picacho, California before moving to Yuma, where Juana worked as a farm laborer and then an assistant to the chancellor of the University of Arizona. Librado and Juana&#x27;s first child, Rita, was born in August 1925, with their first son, Cesar, following nearly two years later. Chavez also had three younger siblings. In November 1925, Librado and Juana bought a series of buildings near the family home which included a pool hall, store, and living quarters. They soon fell into debt and were forced to sell these assets. By April 1929, they moved into the &quot;galera&quot; storeroom of Librado&#x27;s parental home, then owned by the widowed Dorotea.

Chavez was raised in what his biographer Miriam Pawel called &quot;a typical extended Mexican family&quot;; she noted that they were &quot;not well-off, but they were comfortable, well-clothed, and never hungry&quot;. The family spoke Spanish, and he was raised as a Roman Catholic, with his paternal grandmother Dorotea largely overseeing his religious instruction. His mother Juana engaged in forms of folk Catholicism, being a devotee of Santa Eduviges. As a child, Chavez was nicknamed &quot;Manzi&quot; in reference to his fondness for manzanilla tea. To entertain himself, he played handball and listened to boxing matches on the radio. One of five children, he had two sisters, Rita and Vicki, and two brothers, Richard and Librado.

Cesario began attending Laguna Dam School in 1933; there, the speaking of Spanish was forbidden and Cesario was expected to change his name to Cesar. After Dorotea died in July 1937, the Yuma County local government auctioned off her farmstead to cover back taxes, and despite Librado&#x27;s delaying tactics, the house and land were sold in 1939. This was a seminal experience for Cesar, who regarded it as an injustice against his family, with the banks, lawyers, and Anglo-American power structure as the villains of the incident. Influenced by his Roman Catholic beliefs, he increasingly came to see the poor as a source of moral goodness in society.

The Chavez family joined the growing number of American migrants who were moving to California amid the Great Depression. First working as avocado pickers in Oxnard and then as pea pickers in Pescadero, the family made it to San Jose, where they first lived in a garage in the city&#x27;s impoverished Mexican district. They moved regularly, and on weekends and holidays, Cesar joined his family in working as an agricultural laborer. In California, he moved schools many times, spending the longest time at Miguel Hidalgo Junior School; here, his grades were generally average, although he excelled at mathematics. At school, he faced ridicule for his poverty, while more broadly, he experienced anti-Latino prejudice from many European-Americans, with many establishments refusing to serve non-white customers. He graduated from junior high in June 1942, after which he left formal education and became a full-time farm laborer.

===Early adulthood: 1946–1953===
In 1944, Chavez enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and was sent to Naval Training Center San Diego. In July, he was stationed at the U.S. base in Saipan, and six months later moved to Guam, where he was promoted to the rank of seaman first class. He was then stationed to San Francisco, where he decided to leave the Navy, receiving an honorable discharge in 1946. Relocating to Delano, California, where his family had settled, he returned to working as an agricultural laborer.

In 1947, Chavez joined the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU), which, until its 1947 affiliation with the American Federation of Labor, was the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU). (Later, the NFLU became the National Agricultural Workers Union.) That year, he was picketing cotton fields in Corcoran, near Delano, for the NFLU. The union had called a strike against the DiGiorgio grape fields in 1947. As in the STFU&#x27;s strikes against cotton plantations in Arkansas, strikers formed &quot;caravans&quot; and marched around the perimeter of the DiGiorgio property, asking its workers to join them. Chavez led one of those caravans.

Chavez entered a relationship with Helen Fabela, who soon became pregnant. They married in Reno, Nevada in October 1948; it was a double wedding, with Chavez&#x27;s sister Rita marrying her fiancé at the same ceremony. By early 1949, Chavez and his new wife had settled in the Sal Si Puedes neighborhood of San Jose, where many of his other family members were now living. Their first child, Fernando, was born there in February 1949; a second, Sylvia, followed in February 1950; and then a third, Linda, in January 1951. The latter had been born shortly after they had relocated to Crescent City, where Chavez was employed in the lumber industry. They then returned to San Jose, where Chavez worked as an apricot picker and then as a lumber handler for the General Box Company.

There, he befriended two social justice activists, Fred Ross and Father Donald McDonnell, both European-Americans whose activism was primarily within the Mexican-American community. Chavez helped Ross establish a chapter of his Community Service Organization (CSO) in San Jose, and joined him in voter registration drives. He was soon voted vice president of the CSO chapter. He also helped McDonnell construct the first purpose-built church in Sal Si Puedes, the Our Lady of Guadalupe church, which opened in December 1953. In turn, McDonnell lent Chavez books, encouraging the latter to develop a love of reading. Among the books were biographies of the saint Francis of Assisi, the U.S. labor organizers John L. Lewis and Eugene V. Debs, and the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi, introducing Chavez to the ideas of nonviolent protest.

==Early activism==
===Working for the Community Service Organization: 1953–1962===

In late 1953, Chavez was laid off by the General Box Company. Ross then secured funds so that the CSO could employ Chavez as an organizer, traveling around California setting up other chapters. In this job, he traveled across Decoto, Salinas, Fresno, Brawley, San Bernardino, Madera, and Bakersfield. Many of the CSO chapters fell apart after Ross or Chavez ceased running them, and to prevent this Saul Alinsky advised them to unite the chapters, of which there were over twenty, into a self-sustaining national organization. In late 1955, Chavez returned to San Jose to rebuild the CSO chapter there so that it could sustain an employed full-time organizer. To raise funds, he opened a rummage store, organized a three-day carnival and sold Christmas trees, although often made a loss.

In early 1957, he moved to Brawley to rebuild the chapter there. His repeated moving meant that his family were regularly uprooted; he saw little of his wife and children, and was absent for the birth of his sixth child.
Chavez grew increasingly disillusioned with the CSO, believing that middle-class members were becoming increasingly dominant and were pushing its priorities and allocation of funds in directions he disapproved of; he for instance opposed the decision to hold the organization&#x27;s 1957 convention in Fresco&#x27;s Hacienda Hotel, arguing that its prices were prohibitive for poorer members. Amid the wider context of the Cold War and McCarthyite suspicions that leftist activism was a front for Marxist-Leninist groups, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began monitoring Chavez and opened a file on him.

At Alinsky&#x27;s instigation, the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) paid $20,000 to the CSO for the latter to open a branch in Oxnard; Chavez became its organizer, working with the largely Mexican farm laborers. In Oxnard, Chavez worked to encourage voter registration. He repeatedly heard concerns from local Mexican-American laborers that they were being routinely passed over or fired so that employers could hire cheaper Mexican guest workers, or &quot;braceros&quot;, in violation of federal law. To combat this practice, he established the CSO Employment Committee that launched a &quot;registration campaign&quot; through which unemployed farm workers could sign their name to highlight their desire for work.

The Committee targeted its criticism at Hector Zamora, the director of the Ventura County Farm Labor Association, who controlled most of the jobs in the area. It used sit-ins of workers to raise the profile of their cause, a tactic also used by proponents of the civil rights movement in the southern U.S. at that time. It had some success in getting companies to replace &quot;braceros&quot; with unemployed Americans. Its campaign also ensured that federal officials began properly investigating complaints about the use of &quot;braceros&quot; and received assurances from the state farm placement service that they would seek out unemployed Americans rather than automatically hiring &quot;bracero&quot; labor. In May, the Employment Committee was formerly transferred from the CSO to the UPWA.

In 1959, Chavez moved to Los Angeles to become the CSO&#x27;s national director. He, his wife, and now eight children settled into the largely Mexican neighborhood of Boyle Heights. He found the CSO&#x27;s financial situation was bad, with even his own salary in jeopardy. He laid off several organizers to keep the organization afloat. He tried to organize a life insurance scheme among CSO members to raise funds, but this project failed to materialize. Under Chavez, the CSO secured financing from wealthier donors and organizations, usually to finance specific projects for a set period of time. The California American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) for instance paid it $12,000 to conduct voter registration schemes in six counties with high Mexican populations. The wealthy benefactor Katy Peake then offered it $50,000 over three years to organize California&#x27;s farm workers. Under Chavez&#x27;s leadership, the CSO assisted the successful campaign to get the government to extend the state pension to non-citizens who were permanent residents. At the ninth annual CSO convention in March 1962, Chavez resigned.

===Founding the National Farm Workers Association: 1962–1965===
In April 1962, Chavez and his family moved to Delano, California, an agricultural community in the southern San Joaquin Valley, where they rented a house on Kensington Street. He was intent on forming a labor union for farm workers but, to conceal this aim, told people that he was simply conducting a census of farm workers to determine their needs. He began devising the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), referring to it as a &quot;movement&quot; rather than a trade union. He was aided in this project both by his wife and by Dolores Huerta; according to Pawel, Huerta became his &quot;indispensable, lifelong ally&quot;. Other key supporters of his project were the Reverend Jim Drake and other members of the California Migrant Ministry; although as a Roman Catholic Chavez was initially suspicious of these Protestant preachers, he came to view them as key allies.

Chavez spent his days traveling around the San Joaquin Valley, meeting with workers and encouraging them to join his association. At the time, he lived off a combination of unemployment benefit, his wife&#x27;s wage as a farmworker, and donations from friends and sympathizers. On September 30, 1962, he formalized the Association at a convention in Fresno. There, delegates elected Chavez as the group&#x27;s general-director. They also agreed that, once the association had a life insurance policy up and running, members would start paying monthly dues of $3.50. The group adopted the motto &quot;viva la causa&quot; (&quot;long live the cause&quot;) and a flag featuring a black eagle on a red and white background. At the organization&#x27;s constitutional convention held in Fresno in January 1963, Chavez was elected president, with Huerta, Julio Hernandez, and Gilbert Padilla its vice presidents.

Chavez wanted to control the NFWA&#x27;s direction and to that end ensured that the role of the group&#x27;s officers was largely ceremonial, with control of the group being primarily in the hands of the staff, headed by himself. At the NFWA&#x27;s second convention, held in Delano in 1963, Chavez was retained as its general director while the role of the presidency was scrapped. That year, he began collecting membership dues, before establishing an insurance policy for FWA members. Later in the year he launched a credit union for NFWA members, having gained a state charter after the federal government refused him one. The NFWA attracted volunteers from other parts of the country. One of these, Bill Esher, became editor of the group&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;El Malcriado&quot;, which soon after launching increased its print run from 1,000 to 3,000 to meet demand.

The NFWA was initially based out of Chavez&#x27;s house although in September 1964 it moved its headquarters to an abandoned Pentecostal church in Albany Street, West Delano. During its second full year in operation the association more than doubled both its income and its expenditures. As it became more secure, it began to plan for its first strike. In April 1965, rose grafters approached the organization and requested help in organizing their strike for better working conditions. The strike targeted two companies, Mount Arbor and Conklin. Aided by the NFWA, the workers struck on May 3, and after four days the growers agreed to raise wages, after which the strikers returned to work. Following this success, Chavez&#x27;s reputation began to filter through leftist activist circles across California.

==Delano Grape Strike==
===Start of the Delano Grape Strike: 1965–1966===
In September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages. Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them. The strike covered an area of over ; Chavez divided the picketers among four quadrants, each with a mobile crew led by a captain. As the picketers urged those who continued to work to join them on strike, the growers sought to provoke and threaten the strikers. Chavez insisted that the strikers must never respond with violence. The picketers also protested outside strike-breakers&#x27; homes, with the strike dividing many families and breaking friendships. Police monitored the protests, photographing many of those involved; they also arrested various strikers. To raise support for those arrested, Chavez called for donations at a speech in Berkeley&#x27;s Sproul Plaza in October; he received over $1,000. Many growers considered Chavez a communist, and the FBI launched an investigation into both him and the NFWA.
In December, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Walter Reuther joined Chavez in a pro-strike protest march through Delano. This was the first time that the strike attracted national media attention. Reuther then pledged that the UAW would donate $5,000 a month to be shared between the AWOC and NFWA. Chavez also met with representatives of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which became an important ally of the strikers. Influenced by the civil rights movement&#x27;s successful use of boycott campaigns, Chavez decided to launch his own, targeting companies which owned Delano vineyards or sold grapes grown there. The first target selected, in December 1965, was the Schenley liquor company, which owned one of the area&#x27;s smaller vineyards. Chavez organized pickets to take place in other cities where Schenley&#x27;s grapes were being delivered for sale.

By 1965, Chavez was aware that the numbers joining the picket lines had declined; although hundreds of pickers had initially struck, some had returned to their jobs, found employment elsewhere, or moved away from Delano. To keep the pickets going, Chavez invited left-wing activists from elsewhere to join them; many, particularly university students, came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Recruitment was fueled by coverage of the strike in the SNCC&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Movement&quot;, and the Marxist &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; newspaper. By late fall 1966, a protest camp had formed in Delano, opening its own medical clinic and children&#x27;s nursery. Protesters were entertained by Luis Valdez&#x27;s El Teatro Campesino, which put on skits with a political message. Within the protest movement there were some tensions between the striking farm-workers and the influx of student radicals.
===Growing success: 1966–1967===
In March 1966, the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare&#x27;s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held three hearings in California. The third, which took place in Delano, was attended by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who toured a labor camp with Chavez and addressed a mass meeting. As the strike began to flag in winter, Chavez decided on a march of to the state capitol at Sacramento. This would pass through dozens of farmworker communities and attract attention for their cause. In March, the procession started out with about fifty marchers who left Delano.

Chavez imbued the march with Roman Catholic significance. Marchers carried crucifixes and a banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe and used the slogan &quot;Peregrinación, Penitencia, Revolución&quot; (&quot;Pilgrimage, Penitence, Revolution&quot;). Portraying the march as an act of penance, he argued that the image of his personal suffering—his feet became painful and for part of the journey he had to walk with a cane—would be useful for the movement. At each stop, they read aloud a &quot;Plan de Delano&quot; written by Valdez, deliberately echoing the &quot;Plan de Ayala&quot; of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. At Easter, the marchers arrived in Sacramento, where over 8,000 people amassed in front of the state capitol. Chavez briefly addressed the crowd.

During the march, Chavez had been approached by Schenley&#x27;s lawyer, Sidney Korshak. They agreed to contract negotiations within 60 days. Chavez then declared an end to the Schenley boycott; instead, the movement would switch the boycott to the DiGiorgio Corporation, a major Delano land owner. DiGiorgio then called an election among their vineyard workers, hoping to challenge the NFWA&#x27;s influence. A more conservative union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was competing against the NFWA in the DiGiorgio workers&#x27; election. After DiGiorgio altered the terms of the election to benefit a Teamster victory, Chavez removed the NFWA from the ballot and urged his supporters to abstain. When the vote took place in June 1966, nearly half of eligible workers abstained, allowing a Teamster victory. Chavez then appealed to Pat Brown, the Governor of California, to intervene. Brown agreed, wanting the endorsement of the Mexican American Political Association. He declared the DiGiorgio election invalid and called for an August rerun to be supervised by the American Arbitration Association. On September 1, Chavez&#x27;s union was declared the victor in the second election. DiGiorgio subsequently largely halted grape production in Delano. The focus then shifted to Giumarra, the largest grape grower in the San Joaquin Valley. In August 1967, Chavez announced a strike against them followed by a boycott of their grapes.

An agreement was reached that Chavez&#x27;s NFWA would merge with the AWOC, resulting in a new United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC). AWOC&#x27;s Larry Itliong became the new group&#x27;s assistant director, although soon felt marginalized by Chavez. UFWOC was also made an organizing committee of the AFL-CIO; this ensured that it would become a formal part of the U.S. labor movement and would receive a monthly subsidy. Not all of Chavez&#x27;s staff agreed with the merger; many of its more left-wing members mistrusted the growing links with organized labor, particularly due to the AFL-CIO&#x27;s anti-communist views. The UFWOC was plagued by ethnic divisions between its Filipino and Mexican members, although it continued to attract new volunteers. The majority of the volunteers were whites brought into the movement via left-wing and religious groups, or as part of social service internships. Chavez brought new people, such as LeRoy Chatfield, Marshall Ganz, and the lawyer Jerry Cohen, into his inner circle. His old friend Fred Ross had also joined. Soon, the secretary–treasurer Antonio Orendain was left as the only Mexican migrant in the union&#x27;s senior ranks.

In June 1967, Chavez launched his first purge of the union to remove those he deemed disruptive or disloyal to his leadership. His cover story was that he wanted to eject members of the Communist Party USA and related far-left groups, although the FBI&#x27;s report at the time found no evidence of communist infiltration of the union. Some longstanding members, such as Esher, left because they disapproved of these purges. Tensions between Chavez and the Teatro had been building for some time; the Teatro&#x27;s members were among those highly critical of the union&#x27;s new links with the AFL-CIO. Chavez was concerned that the Teatro had become a rival to his prominent standing in the movement and was questioning his actions. Chavez asked the Teatro to disband, at which it split from the union and went on a tour of the U.S.

===Forty Acres and public fasts: 1967–1968===
The union purchased land known as The Forty Acres for their new headquarters. Chavez hoped for it to be a &quot;spiritual&quot; center where union members would relax; he designed it to have a swimming pool, a chapel, a market, and a gas station, as well as gardens with outdoor sculptures. He wanted the main building to be decorated inside with Gandhi quotations in English and Spanish. Meanwhile, Chavez was increasingly concerned that his supporters might turn to violence. Members had engaged in the destruction of property, something they regarded as not breaching the movement&#x27;s ethos on non-violence. Chavez&#x27;s cousin Manuel had tampered with refrigerator units on trains, so that grapes being shipped out of Delano spoiled before reaching their destination; Chavez noted that &quot;He&#x27;s done all the dirty work for the union. There&#x27;s a lot of fucking dirty work, and he did it all.&quot; In February 1968, the Giumarra company obtained a contempt citation against the union, claiming that its members had used threatening and intimidating behavior against its employees and had placed roofing nails at the entrances to its ranches.

In February 1968, Chavez began a fast; he publicly stated that in doing so he was reaffirming his commitment to peaceful protest and presented it as a form of penance. He stated that he would remain at Forty Acres for the duration of his fast, which at this point had only a gas station there. Many members of the union were critical of what they saw as a stunt; Itliong was annoyed that Chavez had not consulted the union&#x27;s board before making his declaration. The union introduced a motion urging Chavez to cancel his plan, although this failed. Father Mark Day announced that a Mass would be held every night at Forty Acres. These attracted many of Chavez&#x27;s supporters, with the gas station decorated as an impromptu shrine. Sympathetic Protestant clergy and Jewish rabbis also spoke at these Masses. After three weeks, Chavez&#x27;s doctors urged him to end the fast. He agreed to do so at a public event on March 10. He invited Robert Kennedy to be the guest of honor at this event. Kennedy arrived at the event, which was attended by thousands of observers as well as the national press, and there they shared bread.

Not long after, Kennedy announced his candidacy to be the Democratic Party&#x27;s next presidential candidate. He asked Chavez to run as a delegate in the California primary. Throughout May, Chavez traveled across California, urging farmworkers and registered Democrats to back Kennedy. His activism was a contributing factor to Kennedy&#x27;s victory in that state. It was at the victory celebration in Los Angeles, an event attended by Chavez, that Kennedy was assassinated on June 5. Chavez then attended Kennedy&#x27;s New York funeral as a pallbearer. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination came two months after that of Martin Luther King, generating growing concerns among the union that Chavez would also be targeted by those who opposed him.

In May, Chavez appeared on the &quot;Today&quot; television show and announced a boycott of all grapes produced in California. The boycotters&#x27; message was that consumers should avoid buying California grapes so that farmworkers would get better wages and working conditions. Supporters across the country picketed stores selling California grapes and disrupted annual meetings of several supermarket chains. Chavez hoped that by putting pressure on the supermarkets, they in turn would pressure the grape growers to give in to strikers&#x27; demands. The growers hired a public relations firm to counteract the boycott, warning stores that if they gave in to the boycott they would soon be faced with similar boycotts for many other products. The growers also turned to the newly elected Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, who in turn sought the support of the Teamsters.

Chavez&#x27;s back pain worsened and in September 1968 he was hospitalized at O&#x27;Connor Hospital in San Jose. He followed this with a recuperation stay at St Anthony&#x27;s Seminary in Santa Barbara. He returned home, but finding it too crowded moved in to Forty Acres. Due to a donation from the United Auto Workers, the union had erected an office and meeting hall here, with a trailer being used as a medical clinic; it was still far from Chavez&#x27;s original vision. He used his image of physical suffering as a tactic in his cause, although some of his inner circle thought his pain to be at least partially psychosomatic. By 1968, Chavez was a national celebrity. Journalists increasingly approached him for interviews; he granted particularly close access to Peter Matthiessen and Jacques E. Levy, both of whom wrote favorable books about him. In July 1969, Chavez&#x27;s portrait appeared on the front of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Within the union, personal loyalty to Chavez became increasingly important; tensions between him and Itliong grew.

===End of the Grape Strike: 1969–1970===
In March 1969, the doctor Janet Travell visited Chavez and determined that fused vertebrae were the source of his back pain. She prescribed various exercises and other treatments which he found eased his pain. Between September and December, Chavez traveled the country in a Winnebago speaking at dozens of fundraisers and rallies for the grape boycott. At a speech in Washington D.C., he came out publicly against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, a topic he had previously avoided speaking on, because his son Fernando had been arrested as a conscientious objector.

In the late 1970s, Chavez also sought to advance his control over the California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), a group which advocated for farmworkers. Chavez demanded that the CRLA make its staff available for union work and that it would allow the union&#x27;s attorneys to decide which cases the CRLA would pursue. Under the leadership of Cruz Reynoso, a former Chavez ally, the CRLA refused. Pawel believed that these attempts reflected Chavez&#x27;s desire to be seen as the only voice for farmworkers.

Chavez negotiated with Lionel Steinberg, a grape grower in the Coachella area. They signed contracts allowing Steinberg&#x27;s products to be sold with a union logo on them, indicating that they would be exempt from the boycott. Other Coachella growers regarded Steinberg as a traitor for negotiating with Chavez but ultimately followed suit, resulting in contracts being signed with the union. In July 1969, the Delano growers agreed to negotiate. Chavez insisted that their negotiations also cover issues at the Delano High School, where several pupils, including his own daughter Eloise, had been suspended or otherwise disciplined for protesting in support of the boycott. On July 29, 1970, the Delano growers signed contracts with the union at the Forty Acres Hall, in front of press. These contracts agreed to wage rises for pickers, the introduction of a health plan, and new safety measures regarding the use of pesticides on the crop.

==Later activism==

===Salinas Lettuce Strike: 1970–1971===
In July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California&#x27;s Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees. Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them. In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them. Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters. There, the cutters voted to go on strike. Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW. Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley&#x27;s largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company. Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement. The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative.

The Salinas lettuce growers secured a temporary restraining order preventing a strike, at which Chavez initiated another protest fast. Amid a ten-day truce, he reached an agreement with Interharvest but not the other Salinas growers. Thus, the strike against them began on August 24, when cutters started picketing the lettuce fields. Lettuce production slumped by three quarters and prices of lettuces doubled. Various restraining orders were issued against the picketers, and when they broke them they were fined; the UFW paid many of these, as well as financially supporting the strikers in other ways. This proved expensive for the union, and Chavez decided that the pickets could not be maintained. Instead he decided to switch towards a boycott of Salinas lettuce. Chavez selected the Bud Antle company as the first target of the boycott campaign.

Bud Antle secured an injunction legally preventing a boycott against them, but Chavez continued regardless. Due to this, Chavez was charged, found guilty of contempt of court, and sentenced to ten days imprisonment in the Monterey County jail. During Chavez&#x27;s imprisonment, supporters held a round-the-clock vigil outside the jail. Among those who visited him were Martin Luther King&#x27;s widow Coretta Scott King, and Robert Kennedy&#x27;s widow, Ethel Kennedy. She took part in a rally which included a Roman Catholic Mass; it was opposed by a group of local counter-protesters who opposed the concentration of leftist activism in their community. These events attracted national media attention. Soon after, the California Supreme Court voted to dissolve key aspects of Bud Antle&#x27;s injunction and ordered Chavez&#x27;s release.

Chavez wanted a more remote base for his movement than Forty Acres, especially one where he could experiment with his ideas about communal living. To this end, the Hollywood movie producer Edward Lewis, a wealthy supporter of Chavez&#x27;s, fronted the purchase of an old tuberculosis sanatorium in Keene, along the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains, for the union. Chavez named this new base Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz (&quot;Our Lady Queen of Peace&quot;), although it became commonly known just as &quot;La Paz&quot;. Renovating the existing buildings, he invited various families to come and live there. In creating this commune, he drew on Gandhi&#x27;s experiments with &quot;ashrams&quot; in India; he envisioned it as a retreat center where workers could come for three day retreats modeled on the Roman Catholic &quot;cursillo&quot;. La Paz became the union&#x27;s new headquarters, something that various backers and funders were critical of due to its remote location; Chavez said that this was necessary for his security, particularly following allegations of a plot against his life. At night, the perimeter of the commune was patrolled by armed guards. The organization at La Paz was often chaotic, with frustrated detractors in the movement referring to it as &quot;Magic Mountain&quot;. Amid his growing frustrations with Chavez&#x27;s leadership, Itliong resigned in October 1971.

===Expanding beyond California: 1972===
Arizona became the first state to pass a bill that was designed to keep the UFW out of their state; this would criminalize boycotts and make union elections among farm-workers almost impossible. In response, Chavez drove to Arizona and demanded a meeting with Governor Jack Williams, who refused. They subsequently launched a campaign to gain a recall election to remove Williams from office. This started the UFW&#x27;s first major farm-worker campaign outside California. Farmworkers rallied outside Williams&#x27; office while Chavez embarked on a fast in the Santa Rita Center, a hall used by a local Chicano group. On the nineteenth day of his fast, Chavez was hospitalized. He then broke the fast at a memorial Mass on the anniversary of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s death, where he was joined by the folk singer Joan Baez. It was during the Arizona campaign that the UFW started using the slogan &quot;Si Se Puede&quot; (&quot;It Can be Done&quot;), which subsequently became closely associated with it.

Chavez increasingly pushed for the UFW to become a national organization, with a token presence being established in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Texas, and Florida. Parts of the union expressed concern that it was now overstretching its resources. Chavez also pushed for the California Migrant Ministry, which supported the UFW, to transform into a National Farm Worker Ministry (NFWM), insisting that the UFW should have the power to veto decisions made by the NFWM.

At the AFL-CIO&#x27;s request, Chavez had suspended the Salinas lettuce boycott, but prepared to relaunch it eight months later as the growers had only conceded to one of their demands. Tensions grew between the UFW and AFL-CIO, with the latter&#x27;s president George Meany concerned that if the UFW broke the law by extending its boycott to cover supermarket chains then the AFL-CIO could be held liable. As a result, Chavez formally requested a charter so that the UFW could become an independently chartered union separate from the AFL-CIO; he was loath to do so as it meant losing the AFL-CIO&#x27;s subsidy.

While Chavez had been focusing on Salinas, his brother Richard had been tasked with overseeing the UFW&#x27;s activities in Delano. In early 1972, Richard visited Chavez and confronted him about the problems in Delano, telling him that the union was losing support among farmworkers and that they were in danger of losing the contracts when they came up for renewal. In Richard&#x27;s opinion, Chavez was losing touch with the union&#x27;s membership. There was anger that members were expected to pay monthly dues to the union when their work was usually seasonal; there was also frustration at the union&#x27;s $1-a-week voluntary fund to support the Salinas strikers. Part of the membership thought that Chavez&#x27;s new isolation at La Paz was leading him to take decisions unpopular with the farmworkers. There were concerns about the inept and inexperienced volunteers, mostly English-speaking European-Americans, who were running the UFW&#x27;s hiring halls; growers were complaining that these volunteers were often hostile and uncooperative. Union branches had been ordering members to miss work to engage in political rallies and Salinas picket lines, further angering growers. Chavez responded to these criticisms by reassigning his brother away from Delano. In late 1972, Richard and Huerta, his partner at the time, briefly left the UFW in frustration with Chavez&#x27;s leadership. Other senior members continued to warn Chavez about the same issues that Richard did, but Chavez dismissed their concerns as grower propaganda.

California growers then organized a ballot on Proposition 22 for November 1972 which would ban boycott campaigns in the state. Chavez tasked LeRoy Chatfield with running the campaign against it; at the ballot, Proposition 22 lost by 58 percent to 42 percent.
In April 1973, the UFW&#x27;s contact with grape growers in the Delano area expired. At this, Chavez called a strike in the Coachella Valley. The Teamsters union saw this as an opportunity to replace the UFW in representing the region&#x27;s farmworkers. The Teamsters organized counter-protests; their picketers were often armed and violent clashes between members of the two unions broke out. The UFW used these instances of Teamster violence to rally public support for their cause. The AFL-CIO was concerned by this clash between unions, and Meany struck a deal with Chavez that they would provide the UFW with renewed financial support if it pushed for state legislation to govern the rights of farmworkers to organize. Chavez agreed; although he did not want such a law and he thought that Governor Reagan would never agree to it anyway. The AFL-CIO gave the UFW $1.6 million, allowing the latter to pay Salinas picketers $75 and later $90 a week.

Amid the Delano strike, one of the UFW strikers, the Yemeni migrant Nagi Moshin Daifullah, died after an altercation with a police officer breaking up a bar-room fight. The UFW portrayed Daifullah as a martyr for the cause and over 5000 people marched at his funeral, with Chavez fasting for three days. Chavez then called off the Delano strike, stating that he would do so until the federal government guaranteed the safety of UFW protesters; the government believed that this was a cover to conceal the financial problems that the strike was causing the UFW. By this point, the UFW had lost much of its membership, and most of its California contracts, to the Teamsters. Many farmworkers found that while the Teamsters appeared less interested in workers&#x27; rights, they did not expect their employees to spend their weekends on political campaigns and boycotts as the UFW did.

===Immigration and legislative campaigns: 1973–1975===
In September 1973, the UFW&#x27;s first constitutional convention was held in Fresno, representing the final step in the organization becoming a full union. A new constitution was announced that gave the group&#x27;s president, a post occupied by Chavez, significant powers; he feared that greater democracy would paralyze the group. At the convention, the UFW agreed to scrap monthly membership fees in favor of charging members 2 percent of their annual income. It also announced that volunteers who had worked for the UFW for more than six months could become members with voting rights. Previously, membership had been restricted primarily to farmworkers. The new executive committee, which included Huerta and Richard Chavez, was racially mixed, although some members expressed dissatisfaction that it did not contain more Mexican Americans. By 1974, the UFW was again broke and its boycott was floundering. That year, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; opened with a headline: &quot;Is Chavez Beaten?&quot;. Chavez flew to Europe to urge the unions there to block the imported goods that the UFW were sending there. He traveled through London, Oslo, Stockholm, Geneva, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Brussels, and Paris, although he found that the unions were cautious about joining his campaign. In Rome, he met with Pope Paul VI, who commended his activism.

Chavez increasingly blamed the failure of the UFW strike on illegal immigrants who were brought in as strikebreakers. He made the unsubstantiated claim that the CIA was involved in part of a conspiracy to bring illegal migrants into the country so that they could undermine his union. He launched the &quot;Illegals Campaign&quot; to identify illegal migrants so that they could be deported, appointing Liza Hirsch to oversee the campaign. In Chavez&#x27;s view, &quot;if we can get the illegals out of California, we will win the strike overnight.&quot; This was a reiteration of an early view he expressed concerning the problems the UFW boycott faced in 1972. Chavez believed that any strike undertaken by agricultural workers could be undermined by &quot;wetbacks&quot; and &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;. Huerta urged him not to refer to migrants who had come to the U.S. illegally as &quot;illegals&quot; but Chavez refused, stating: &quot;a spade&#x27;s a spade.&quot; Some UFW field offices refused to collaborate with the campaign, and the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) refused to allow its interns to work on it, at which Chavez cut the UFW&#x27;s links with the NLG.

While Chavez had been in Europe, his cousin Manuel Chavez had established a UFW patrol, or &quot;wet line&quot;, along Arizona&#x27;s border with Mexico to stop illegal migrants crossing into the United States. There were rumors that this patrol was employing violence against these migrants, beating and robbing them and in one case castrating a man. These allegations soon appeared in the local press. A Mexican investigation determined that the UFW had bribed San Luis city officials to prevent them from interfering in these activities along the border. A Mexican union, the Confederation of Mexican Workers, broke its links with the UFW over the issue. Chavez dismissed the reports of violence as the smears of paid provocateurs, a claim which many of his supporters accepted. Chavez protected Manuel, while the executive board kept silent on his activities, regarding him as useful. The Chicano activist Bert Corona staged a protest against the UFW wet line, at which Chavez directed Jerry Cohen to launch an investigation into the funding of Corona&#x27;s group.

In 1974, Chavez proposed the idea of a Poor People&#x27;s Union with which he could reach out to poor white communities in the San Joaquin Valley who were largely hostile to the UFW. Meanwhile, the UFW announced that it would launch a boycott of the Gallo Wine company. In February 1975, the UFW organized a four-day march from San Francisco to the Gallo headquarters in Modesto, where a crowd of around 10,000 protesters amassed. The Modesto march had been a means of trying to rekindle the successes of the late 1960s and a public display of strength despite the setbacks that the UFW had experienced.

In November 1974, the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate, the modern liberal Jerry Brown, was elected governor of California. At this point, farm-worker&#x27;s rights took center stage in the state&#x27;s political agenda. Chavez met with Brown and together they developed a strategy: Brown would introduce a bill to improve farmworkers&#x27; rights, at which the UFW would support a more radical alternative. Brown would then negotiate a law with other stakeholders that included all the UFW&#x27;s bottom lines. The purpose of this law would be to guarantee farmworkers the right to a secret ballot in which they could decide which union, if any, should represent them in their negotiations with their employer. Brown signed the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA) into law in June 1975. This was widely seen as a UFW victory, as California now had the most favorable labor bill in the country. Chavez nevertheless worried that it would kill the movement&#x27;s spirit, stating that the cause would now lose &quot;the essential fight of recognition, which is the one that appeals to the human mind and the heart&quot;, instead focusing on more prosaic issues such as wages and benefits.

===Proposition 14: 1976–1977===
The ALRA law created a state agency, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), to oversee union elections among farmworkers. Brown appointed a five-person board to lead the ALRB which was sympathetic to Chavez; it included the former UFW official LeRoy Chatfield. As the UFW prepared for the elections in the fields, Chavez organized a &quot;1000 mile march&quot; from the San Diego border up the coast in July 1975. During the march, he stopped to attend the second UFW convention. For the campaign, the UFW hired 500 organizers, many of them farmworkers. The UFW won more elections than it lost, although in instances where it went head-to-head with the Teamsters, the latter beat the UFW. This indicated that the UFW&#x27;s greatest strengths were among vegetable and citrus growers, rather than in their original heartlands of the Delano vineyards. The Teamster victories in the Delano vineyards angered Chavez, who insisted that there had not been free elections there. Chavez criticised the ALRB and launched a targeted campaign against Walter Kintz, the ALRB&#x27;s general counsel, demanding his resignation. He also put pressure on Governor Brown to remove Kintz.

UFW organizers moved to follow their electoral victories by signing contracts with the growers; the UFW needed these contracts to stabilize its finances. Meanwhile, to develop the UFW&#x27;s administration, Chavez hired the management consultant Crosby Milne, whose ideas led to a restructuring of the union. These reforms further centralized the union&#x27;s powers among the executive committee. The changes involved decision-making powers being delegated from Chavez to the department heads, although Chavez—who liked to oversee everything personally—found this difficult to adhere to in practice. As part of these reforms, Chavez continued to call on the union&#x27;s leaders to all relocate to La Paz, which many were reluctant to do. In July 1976, Chavez traveled to New York to attend the Democratic Party&#x27;s National Congress, at which he gave a speech nominating Brown as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Brown would come third in the contest, which would be won by Jimmy Carter. Carter went on to win the 1976 election, initiating an administration that was keen to fund UFW projects.

In 1976, the ALRB ran out of its budgeted money for the year. The California legislature refused to allocate more money, so the ALRB closed shop for the year. Seeking to get the farmworkers&#x27; rights introduced by ALRA enshrined in California&#x27;s constitution, in early 1976 UFW activists put forward the idea of Proposition 14, which would go forward to the electorate later that year. Chavez thought that Proposition 14 had little chance of being passed by the electorate and was concerned that devoting its resources to the campaign would be financially costly for the UFW. Brown also warned them not to, arguing that it would backfire on farmworkers by polarizing communities. Despite these concerns, Fred Ross urged the union to take on the issue, and after much debate, the UFW&#x27;s executive board voted to involve itself in the &#x27;vote yes&#x27; campaign on Proposition 14. Growers responded with a well-funded multi-media campaign that emphasized the claim that the measure would give unions the right to trespass on private property. When it went to the electorate in November 1976, Proposition 14 was defeated by a measure of two-to-one. Although this defeat had little serious impact on the UFW, Chavez took it as a very public rejection of him personally.

Chavez blamed the defeat on the UFW&#x27;s national boycott director, Nick Jones, who had been the only staff member to publicly voice disquiet over the Proposition 14 campaign. He claimed that Jones and the New York boycott director, Charlie March, had been part of a far-left conspiracy to undermine the UFW. Under pressure, in November 1976, Jones resigned; in a letter to the executive board he stated that he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the direction in which Chavez was taking the union. Chavez also fired Joe Smith, the editor of &quot;El Macriado&quot;, after accusing him of deliberately undermining the newspaper. He then ordered Ross and Ganz to interrogate everyone who worked on the campaign, ostensibly to decide on new assignments but also to route out alleged malcontents, agitators, and spies. Many of those involved in running the UFW&#x27;s boycott expressed concerns about a McCarthyite-style atmosphere developing within the union, and Chavez&#x27;s purge attracted press attention. As the criticisms of his leadership intensified, Chavez responded with further purges, inspired by those in China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. He became convinced that there was a far-left conspiracy, whose members he called the &quot;assholes&quot; or &quot;them&quot;, who were trying to undermine the UFW. At a La Paz meeting in April 1977, later called &quot;the Monday Night Massacre,&quot; Chavez called together a range of individuals whom he denounced as malcontents or spies. They were verbally abused by members of the executive board and ejected from the community. He later accused Philip Vera Cruz, the oldest member of the executive board, of also being part of the conspiracy, and forced him out.

Chavez reversed many of the changes he had implemented under Milne&#x27;s guidance, with executive board members being reassigned to cover geographic areas rather than having union-wide responsibilities. Milne, who had been living at La Paz, soon left, with Chavez later alleging he had been part of a conspiracy against the union. UFW had also entered into a negotiation with the Teamsters union, a process led by Cohen. The two unions reached an agreement by which the UFW would cease bringing litigation against the Teamsters if the latter ceased operating among farm-workers altogether. This left the UFW as the only dominant union among the farmworkers. The Teamsters agreed because farmworkers were a marginal group for them; their typically low incomes also meant that farmworkers did not generate sufficient funds for the union to warrant its ongoing and costly clashes with the UFW.

===Links with Synanon and Ferdinand Marcos: 1977===
Chavez told the executive committee that radical change was necessary in the UFW; he stated that they could be either a union or a movement, but not both. If the former, they would have to start paying wages to their staff rather than relying on volunteers, which at that time they were not in a financial position to do. He instead urged them to become a movement, which he argued meant establishing communal settlements for members, drawing on a Californian religious organization, Synanon, as an exemplar. Chavez had become increasingly interested in Synanon, a drug-treatment organization that had declared itself a religion in 1975 and which operated out of a compound east of Fresno. He admired Synanon&#x27;s leader Charles Dederich, and the way that the latter controlled his planned community. In Chavez&#x27;s opinion, Dederich was &quot;a genius in terms of people&quot;.

In February 1977, Chavez took the UFW&#x27;s executive board on a visit to the Synanon compound. There, they took part in a therapy system based on Dederich&#x27;s own process, &quot;the Game,&quot; as part of which each &quot;player&quot; was singled out in turn to receive harsh, profanity-laced criticism from the rest of the community. Dederich had told Chavez that &quot;the Game&quot; was key to reshaping the UFW, and the latter decided that he wanted everyone at La Paz to play it. He received tacit agreement from the executive board, although some of its members privately opposed the measure. The Game took place at La Paz on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings, and at its height, about 100 people were taking part in it each week. There it was used to shape behavior and punish nonconformity. Many individuals dreaded the humiliation it involved, disliked the obscenities that were part of it, and found going through it to be a traumatic experience. Chavez remained enthusiastic about the Game, calling it &quot;a good tool to fine-tune the union&quot;. Many of those close to Chavez, including his wife and Richard Chavez, refused to take part. The farmworkers were not informed about the Game. Various long-term supporters of the UFW, including various clerical figures, visited La Paz at this time and left alarmed by how it had changed.

Synanon provided the UFW with $100,000 worth of cars and materials; building links with Chavez&#x27;s movement burnished Dederich&#x27;s reputation with rich liberals who were among Synanon&#x27;s core constituency. Dederich suggested that Synanon and the UFW establish a joint communal farm, and although the option was explored, it did not materialize. Following Dederich&#x27;s advice, Chavez began grooming young people who had grown up in the movement to remain committed to him and his ideals. He created a curriculum for them to follow, which included the Game. Whereas Chavez had previously refused to accept government money, he now applied for over $500,000 in grants for a school and other projects. Formal celebrations and group rituals became an important part of life at La Paz, while Chavez also declared that on Saturday mornings all residents of La Paz should work in the vegetable and flower gardens to improve sociability. A rule was passed that everyone at La Paz had to wear a UFW button at all times on penalty of a fine. After attending a course in Los Angeles, Chavez began claiming that he could heal people by laying on his hands.

In the field elections, the UFW was largely rebuffed by Filipino-American workers. Seeking to remedy this, in 1977 Chavez traveled to the Philippines as the guest of its president, Ferdinand Marcos. There, he was treated as a high-ranking dignitary, and received both an award from Marcos and an honorary doctorate from the Far Eastern University in Manila. He then spoke to a reporter from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; where he spoke positively about Marcos&#x27; introduction of martial law. This generated outcry in the U.S., especially among religious groups, who argued that Chavez was overlooking the human rights abuses taking place under Marcos&#x27; administration. Chavez then organized an event on Delano for five senior Filipino government officially to speak to an assembled audience. The incident eroded support among religious organizations, a key constituency for Chavez and the UFW.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine published a story reporting on violence and child abuse at Synanon, which it termed a &quot;kooky cult&quot;. Synanon launched a boycott of &quot;Time&quot; in response, with Chavez urging the UFW to support it, stating that they should assist their friends and help protect religious freedom. Los Angeles police then raided Synanon&#x27;s compound and revealed evidence that Dederich had sanctioned the use of violence against the group&#x27;s critics and ex-members; several senior members were also found guilty of murdering a lawyer representing ex-Synanon members. Shortly after, the Peoples Temple run by the civil rights activist Jim Jones, a group which had been closely linked with California&#x27;s leftist movement, committed mass suicide at their Jonestown community. A Democratic assemblyman soon issued a press release comparing the cult surrounding Chavez to the Peoples Temple. The UFW stopped using the Game in response to these developments; Chavez&#x27;s calls for it to resume were rejected by other senior members.

The UFW continued to rely on voluntary labor, only paying a small number of employees, such as lawyers. When the union&#x27;s lawyers, who were paid, asked for a raise, it generated a major debate among the executive committee. Chavez framed the issue along the lines of whether the UFW should start paying wages to everyone or instead continue to rely on volunteers. The executive committee split largely on generational lines, with older members backing Chavez&#x27;s desire to remain a voluntary organization, and this attitude narrowly prevailed. Medina, one of only two former farmworkers on the board, resigned over the issue. Drake also resigned.
Half of the lawyers left straight away, and the others in the coming weeks as the UFW switched to a voluntary legal department; the new volunteers were largely inexperienced. It was also in 1977 that the UFW declared that contributions to the union&#x27;s political fund would become mandatory for members; this was then used to support political groups and candidates considered sympathetic to the UFW&#x27;s interests.

==Later life==
===Growing schisms: 1978–1982===
In June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel&#x27;s Arizona melon strike. This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night. By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers; they were frustrated by its incompetency, especially in the running of its medical plan. In the 22 farmworker elections that took place between June and September 1978, the UFW lost two-thirds. To stop the loss of its contracts and members, Chavez launched his Plan de Flote, an initiative to regain the trust of the vegetable pickers. Chavez organized a new strike over wages, hoping that salary increases would stem the UFW&#x27;s losses; the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired. Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, which caused lettuce prices to soar.

During the strike, the picketers trespassed on the Mario Saikhon company fields and attempted to drive away those still working. The foreman and other employees opened fire and one picketer, Rufino Contreras, was killed. Chavez urged the strikers not to resort to violence and with Contreras&#x27; father led a three-mile candlelit funerary procession, attended by 7000 people. In June, Ganz and other strike organizers planned a show of strength whereby strikers rushed onto the Salinas field to cause disruption. This generated violent clashes; several people sustained stab wounds and 75 were arrested. Vegetable growers accused Chavez of terrorism over the incident; Chavez criticized Ganz for organizing this without his approval. He then led a 12-day march from San Francisco to San Jose, beginning a fast on the sixth day. Arriving in Salinas, he met with strike leaders at a UFW convention. He argued that the strike was proving too costly for the UFW—it cost the union between $300,000 and $400,000 a month—and that they should end the strike and switch to a boycott campaign. The strike leaders rejected these suggestions. To end the strike, in August and September, several growers signed contracts with the UFW but many held out and the union was broke. Chavez continued arguing for a boycott, suggesting that the union could use alcoholics from the cities to run the boycott campaign, an idea most of the executive board rejected.

Under the new contracts, the growers agreed to pay for paid workers&#x27; representatives whose job it would be to ensure a smooth relationship between the growers and the UFW. Chavez brought these paid representatives to La Paz for a five-day training session in May 1980. Ganz, who was becoming increasingly distant from Chavez, helped tutor them. Chavez called all staff to a meeting at La Paz in May 1981, where he again insisted that the UFW was being infiltrated by spies seeking to undermine it and overthrow him. He arranged for more of his loyalists to be put on the executive board, which now had no farmworkers sitting on it. At the UFW&#x27;s Fresno convention in September 1981, the paid representatives nominated some of their own choices, rather than Chavez&#x27;s, to go on the board. Chavez&#x27;s supporters responded with leaflets claiming that the paid representatives were puppets of &quot;the two Jews&quot;, Ganz and Cohen, who were trying to undermine the union. This brought allegations of antisemitism against Chavez. Seeking to undermine the paid representatives, Chavez proposed a measure that if 8% of workers at a ranch signed a petition, the representatives of that ranch would be obliged to vote for Chavez&#x27;s chosen candidates. The measure passed.

By October, all of those who had opposed Chavez&#x27;s choices at the convention had been fired. They responded by launching a fast in protest outside the UFW&#x27;s Salinas office. Nine of them then sued Chavez in a federal court, claiming that he had no right to fire them from positions that they had been elected to represent by their peers in the fields. Chavez responded with a counter-suit, suing them for libel and slander. He acknowledged to a reporter that in doing so, he was trying to intimidate the protester&#x27;s lawyer, something which brought negative publicity for the UFW. One of the protesters, Chava Bustamante, got work with the California Rural Legal Assistance group, at which the UFW began picketing their offices, trying to get Bustamante fired. In court, Chavez denied that the paid representatives were ever elected, alleging that they were appointed by him personally, but produced no evidence to support this claim. The US District Court Judge William Ingram rejected Chavez&#x27;s argument, ruling that the sacking of the paid representatives had been unlawful. The UFW appealed the ruling, which dragged out for years, until the paid representatives ran out of funds to continue.

Opposition to Chavez&#x27;s hostility to illegal migrants led senior UFW members in Texas and Arizona to break from the union and form their own groups, such as the Texas Farm Workers Union and the Maricopa County Organizing Project. Chavez and his cousin Manuel went to Texas to try and rally opposition to the schism. Manuel also went to Arizona, where he introduced a range of measures to undermine the new group. This led to the investigative journalist Tom Barry looking into Manuel&#x27;s activities. It was revealed that under a pseudonym he had become a melon grower in Mexico, and that he was initiating strikes among U.S. melon pickers as a means of improving the market for his own produce. The UFW&#x27;s reputation was further damaged after the magazine &quot;Reason&quot; exposed that the union had improperly spent nearly $1 million in federal funds. Federal and national investigations followed, confirming these allegations. The government asked the UFW to return over $250,000 in funds while the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the union owed $390,000 in back social security and federal unemployment taxes.

In 1982, the UFW held a celebration of the twentieth anniversary of its first convention at San Jose. It was in October that year that Chavez&#x27;s father died, with the funeral being held in San Jose. Chavez was also involving himself in a broader range of leftist events. He co-chaired Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda&#x27;s fund-raising dinner for their Campaign for Economic Democracy. In the summer of 1982 he also appeared at Peace Sunday, an anti-nuclear event. The UFW had established itself as one of the largest political donors in California. Its political donations were often concealed from the public, funneled through intermediary committees. It donated thousands of dollars to Howard Berman&#x27;s campaign to unseat Leo McCarthy as the Speaker of the California State Assembly because of McCarthy&#x27;s role in defeating Proposition 14. Many Democrats feared that Berman would be beholden to Chavez and so backed Willie Brown, who won. The UFW subsequently also donated to Willie Brown.

===The Chicano Lobby and commercial activities: 1983–1989===
The UFW&#x27;s membership, and the subsequent membership dues they paid, continued to decline. In January 1983, UFW contracts covered 30,000 jobs but by January 1986 this had fallen to 15,000. In 1982, the dues that membership brought in were $2.9 million although this had fallen to $1 million three years later. By the early 1980s, there was a burgeoning Latino middle-class in the U.S. Although Chavez hated the aspirational approach that had encouraged working-class Latinos to become middle-class, he recognized that this offered the UFW a wider support base. At the 1983 UFW convention, he announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the Chicano Lobby. At the Lobby&#x27;s launch, addresses were given by the San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and the newly elected president of the Mexican American Political Association, Chavez&#x27;s eldest son Fernando. To cope with its declining membership, the UFW sought to build its political influence. In November 1984, Chavez gave a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California. The UFW launched a print shop, with politicians who were eager to court the Latino vote increasingly used.

Chavez launched a boycott of grapes and Red Coach Lettuce because their parent company, Bruce Church, had refused to sign a contract with the UFW. Chavez launched a boycott of Lucky, a California supermarket chain. His strategy was to convince the supermarket that the UFW could damage its patronage among Latinos. Chavez had observed that the Christian Right was beginning to use new computer technologies to reach potential supporters and decided that the UFW should do the same. Through this, they were better able to target specific groups whom they regarded as sympathetic to their cause: Hispanics, middle-class African Americans, and liberal professionals living in the major cities. As part of its boycott, the UFW also bought television commercials, which it used to help raise money.

From the mid-1980s, Chavez increasingly focused the UFW&#x27;s campaigns on opposing the use of pesticides in the fields, which he argued posed a danger both to farmworkers and to consumers. The UFW raised over $100,000, as well as donated equipment, to launch its own pesticide research lab, but this never opened. In his anti-pesticide campaigns he gained support from Ralph Nader. Chavez linked this approach in with the ongoing boycott of Bruce Church, arguing that if consumers boycotted the company&#x27;s products, the growers would stop using pesticides. The UFW claimed that the high rates of childhood cancer in McFarland represented evidence of how pesticides impacted humans; they used footage of some of these children in a 17-minute video, &quot;The Wrath of Grapes&quot;. Many of the parents were angered and several sued the UFW, claiming that the union was exploiting their children for its own agenda. UFW activists also turned up at the funeral procession of a 14-year old who had died from cancer, where they carried union flags; the child&#x27;s furious mother demanded that they leave.

In 1982, Jerry Brown ceased to be governor of California. He was replaced by the Republican George Deukmejian, who had the backing of the state&#x27;s growers; under Deukmejian, the ALRB&#x27;s influence eroded. In 1987, the UFW was found liable for $1.7 million in damages to the Maggio company for the illegal actions that the union carried out against it during their 1979 strike. As the UFW&#x27;s boycott of Bruce Church products failed to gain traction, in July 1988 Chavez launched another public fast at Forty Acres. Three of Robert Kennedy&#x27;s children visited, generating media attention for the fast. After 19 days, Chavez broke the fast at a ceremony attended by the Democratic politician Jesse Jackson. The fast was followed by further purges at La Paz as Chavez accused more people of being saboteurs. Hartmire was among those pushed out, resigning in January 1989. Some of those at La Paz left before Chavez could target them, and the commune became increasingly depopulated. Chavez meanwhile continued to receive awards and honors. In November 1989, the Mexican government awarded him the Order of the Aztec Eagle, during which he had a private audience with Mexican President Carlos Salinas. In October 1990, Coachella became the first district to name a school after Chavez; he attended the dedication ceremony.

With membership dues declining, the UFW increasingly turned to commercial activities as a means of raising funds. It began marketing UFW branded merchandise through El Taller Grafico Speciality Advertising (ETG), which had Chavez as its chair. Chavez also set himself up as a housing developer, working in partnership with the Fresno businessman Celestino Aguilar. Together they bought properties undergoing foreclosure, renovated them, before selling them on. They ultimately moved from foreclosures to high-end custom built houses and subsidized apartment blocks. To conceal the UFW&#x27;s involvement in these projects, Chavez and Aguilar formed the company American Liberty Investments. They also established the Ideal Minimart Corporation, which built two strip malls and operated a check-cashing store. Richard&#x27;s company, Bonita Construction, was hired for some of the work. The &quot;Fresno Bee&quot; subsequently reported that most of the UFW&#x27;s housing projects had been built by non-union contractors. The trade unions representing the building unions expressed outrage at the news, highlighting that they had previously given financial support to the UFW. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; later termed the incident an &quot;embarrassment&quot;.

===Final years: 1990–1993===
In the early 1990s, the UFW continued to market Chavez as a heroic figure, especially on university and college campuses. In 1990, he appeared at 64 events, earning an average of $3,800 for each appearance. In 1991, he launched a &quot;Public Action Speaking Tour&quot; of U.S. colleges and universities. His standard speech at these events covered the problems facing farmworkers, the dangers of pesticides, the alliance of agribusiness and the Republican Party, and his view that boycotts and marches were a better means of achieving change than electoral politics.

Chavez&#x27;s mother died in December 1991, aged 99. The following year, in September 1992, Chavez&#x27;s mentor Ross died. Chavez gave the eulogy at his funeral. Chavez&#x27;s final years saw the UFW&#x27;s involvement in a legal battle with Bruce Church. The company had sued the union, claiming it libeled them and had illegally threatened supermarkets to stop them selling Red Coach lettuce. In 1988, a jury returned a $5.4 million verdict against the UFW, but this verdict was thrown out in the appeals court. The case was then remanded for trial on narrower grounds. Chavez was called to testify in front of a Yuma court in 1993. The stakes were high; a verdict against the UFW would have been financially devastating.

During the case, Chavez stayed at the home of a San Luis supporter. It was there that he died in bed on April 23. He was aged 66. Chavez&#x27;s body was flown to Bakersfield aboard a chartered plane. The autopsy proved inconclusive, with the family stating that he had died of natural causes. Chavez had already stipulated that he wanted his brother Richard to build his coffin, and that his funeral should take place at Forty Acres. There, his body lay in state, where tens of thousands of people visited it. A funeral procession took place in Delano, with 120 pallbearers taking turns to carry the coffin. Chavez was then buried in a private ceremony at La Paz.

==Personal life==
When Chavez returned home from his service in the military in 1948, he married his high school sweetheart, Helen Fabela. The couple moved to San Jose, California. With his wife, he had eight children: Fernando (b.1949), Sylvia (b.1950), Linda (b.1951), Eloise (b.1952), Anna (b.1953), Paul (b.1957), Elizabeth (b.1958), and Anthony (b.1958). Helen avoided the limelight, a trait which Chavez admired. While he led the union, she focused on raising the children, cooking, and housekeeping. During the latter part of the 1970s, his infidelity with a range of women became common knowledge among senior UFW figures, who kept this knowledge quiet so as not to damage his reputation as a devoted Catholic family man. After Helen read a love letter written to Chavez by another woman, she temporarily left La Paz and lived with one of her daughters in Delano. Chavez&#x27;s children resented the union and displayed little interest in it, although most ended up working for it. Of these children, Chavez&#x27;s eldest son, Fernando, was the only one to graduate college; Chavez&#x27;s relationship with Fernando was strained, as he was frustrated with what he saw as his son&#x27;s interest in becoming middle-class.

Chavez expressed traditional views on gender roles and was little influenced by the second wave feminism that was contemporary with his activism. In his movement, men took almost all the senior roles, with women largely being confined to background roles as secretaries, nurses, or in child-care; the main exception was Huerta. Chavez had a close working relationship with Huerta. They became mutually dependent, and although she did not hesitate to raise complaints with him, she also usually deferred to him. During their working relationship, they often argued, something which intensified in the latter part of the 1970s. Huerta stated that she was Chavez&#x27;s &quot;whipping girl&quot; when he was under pressure. He never had close friendships outside of his family, believing that friendships distracted from his political activism.

Physically, Chavez was short, and had jet black hair. He was quiet, and Bruns described him as being &quot;outwardly shy and unimposing&quot;. Like many farm laborers, he experienced severe back pain throughout his life. He could be self-conscious about his lack of formal education and was uncomfortable interacting with affluent people. When speaking with reporters, he sometimes mythologized his own life story.
Chavez was not a great orator; according to Pawel, &quot;his power lay not in words, but in actions&quot;. She noted that he was &quot;not an articulate speaker&quot;, and similarly, Bruns observed that he &quot;had no special talent as a public speaker&quot;. He was soft-spoken, and according to Pawel had an &quot;informal, conversational style&quot;, and was &quot;good at reading people&quot;. He was unwilling to delegate or trust others. He preferred to tackle every task personally. He was also capable of responding quickly and decisively to events.

Bruns described Chavez as combining a &quot;remarkable tenacity with a sense of serenity&quot;. A tireless worker, he was known for often working 18 hours a day; he used to start his working day at 3.30am and would often continue working until 10pm. He stated that &quot;I just sleep and eat and work. I do nothing else.&quot; Pawel stated that as a leader, Chavez was both &quot;charming, attentive, and humble&quot; as well as being &quot;single-minded, demanding, and ruthless&quot;. When he wanted to criticize one of his volunteers or staff members he usually did so in private but on occasion could berate them in a public confrontation.
He described his own life&#x27;s work as a crusade against injustice, and displayed a commitment to self-sacrifice. Pawel thought that &quot;Chavez thrived on the power to help people and the way that made him feel&quot;. Ross, who was a friend and colleague of Chavez&#x27;s for many years, noted that &quot;He would do in thirty minutes what it would take me or somebody else thirty days&quot;. Pawel noted that Chavez was &quot;openly ruthless&quot; in his &quot;drive to be the one and only farm labor leader&quot;. He was stubborn and would rarely back down once he had taken a stance. He would not accept criticism of himself, but would deflect it.

Chavez was a Catholic whose faith strongly influenced both his social activism and his personal outlook. He rarely missed Mass and liked to open all of his meetings with either a Mass or a prayer. Privately, he also liked to meditate. In 1970, he became a vegetarian, stating that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t eat my dog, you know. Cows and dogs are about the same.&quot; As part of this diet he also shunned most dairy products except cottage cheese. He credited this diet with easing his chronic back pain. He also avoided eating processed foods. Among his favorite foods were traditional Mexican and Chinese cuisines.

Chavez had a love of the music of Duke Ellington and big band music; he enjoyed dancing. He was also an amateur photographer, and a keen gardener, making his own compost and growing vegetables. For much of his adult life he kept German shepherd dogs for personal protection; two of those he kept at La Paz were named Boycott and Huelga. Chavez preserved many of his notes, letters, the minutes of meetings, as well as tape recordings of many interviewers, and at the encouragement of Philip P. Mason donated these to the Walter P. Reuther Library, where they are kept. He disliked telephone conversations, suspecting that his phone line was bugged. He tended to see problems faced by his movement not as evidence of innocent mistakes but as deliberate sabotage.

Chavez was self-educated, with Pawel noting that he was &quot;disinclined to analyze information&quot;. Once Chavez accepted an idea, he could dedicate himself to it wholeheartedly.

==Political views==
Chavez described his movement as promoting &quot;a Christian radical philosophy&quot;.
According to Chavez biographer Roger Bruns, he &quot;focused the movement on the ethnic identity of Mexican Americans&quot; and on a &quot;quest for justice rooted in Catholic social teaching&quot;. Chavez saw his fight for farmworkers&#x27; rights as a symbol for the broader cultural and ethnic struggle for Mexican Americans in the United States.

Chavez utilized a range of tactics drawing on Roman Catholic religion, including vigils, public prayers, a shrine on the back of his station wagon, and references to dead farmworkers as &quot;martyrs&quot;. His point in doing so was not necessarily to proselytize, but to use the socio-political potential of Christianity for his own campaigns. Most of the farmworkers his union represented shared his Roman Catholicism and were happy to incorporate its religious practices into their marches, strikes, and other UFW activities. Chavez called on his fellow Roman Catholics to be more consistent in standing up for the religion&#x27;s values. He stated that &quot;in a nutshell, what do we want the Church to do? We don&#x27;t ask for more cathedrals. We don&#x27;t ask for bigger churches or fine gifts. We ask for its presence with us, beside us, as Christ among us. We ask the Church to sacrifice with the people for social change, for justice, and for love of brother.&quot; Ospino stated that &quot;The combination of labor organizing strategies with explicit expressions of Catholic religiosity made Chavez&#x27;s approach unique&quot; within the U.S. labor movement, although some of his associates, non-Catholics, and other parts of the labor movement were critical of his use of Catholic elements.

Chavez abhorred poverty, regarding it as dehumanizing, and wanted to ensure a better standard of living for the poor. He was frustrated that most farmworkers appeared more interested in money and did not appreciate the values that he espoused. He was concerned that, as he had seen with the CSO, individuals moving out of poverty often adopted middle-class values; he viewed the middle classes with contempt. He recognized that union activity was not a long-term solution to poverty across society and suggested that forming co-operatives therefore might be the best solution. In Chavez&#x27;s view, workers&#x27; cooperatives offered a middle ground economic choice between the failed system of capitalism and the state socialism of Marxist-Leninist countries. His son Paul recalls &quot;My father&#x27;s basic premise was that capitalism was not going to work because it was too harsh and always took advantage of those least able to defend themselves&quot;. He also embraced ideals about communal living, and saw the La Paz commune he established in California as a model for others to follow.

Chavez kept a large portrait of Gandhi in his office, alongside another of Martin Luther King and busts of both John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln. Influenced by the ideas of Gandhi and King, Chavez emphasized non-violent confrontation as a tactic. He repeatedly referred to himself as the leader of the &quot;non-violent Viet Cong&quot;, a reference to the Vietnamese Marxist-Leninist militia that the U.S. was combating in the Vietnam War. He was interested not only in Gandhi&#x27;s ideas on non-violence but also in the Indian&#x27;s voluntary embrace of poverty, his use of fasting, and his ideas about community. Fasting was important for Chavez. He saw it not as a tactic to pressure his opponents, but rather to motivate his supporters, keeping them focused on the cause and on avoiding violence. He also saw it as a sign of solidarity with the suffering of the people. Chavez was also interested in Gandhi&#x27;s ideas about sacrifice, noting that &quot;I like the idea of sacrifice to do things. If they are done that way they are more lasting. If they cost more, then you will value them more.&quot;

Apart from Catholic social teaching, the movement of Chavez was also based on liberation theology, emphasizing liberation of the poor and self-sacrifice in the pursuit of justice. Liberation theology sought to centralize Catholic faith on the perspective and plight of the excluded, marginalized, poor and oppressed; basic points of liberation theology was the belief that God speaks directly for and to the poor, and that socioeconomic systems that oppress the poor are morally unacceptable. Gustavo Gutierrez, who provided much of the theoretical basis for liberation theology, stated that the &quot;theology of liberation represents the right of the poor to think&quot;. Frederick John Dalton argues that Chavez was the reflection of liberation theology, writing: &quot;The moral vision of Cesar Chavez is the moral vision of a Mexican-American migrant farm worker and labor organizer with no formal education beyond the eighth grade. It is the moral vision of a man who knew the indignities of being impoverished and excluded. A field laborer of Mexican descent, he experienced life as a nonperson, as little more than an agricultural implement, a cost to be minimized.&quot; Similarly, Mark R. Day, a member of UFW, remarked that “in many ways we were practicing liberation theology in Delano in the late 1960s.”

Many of the UFW&#x27;s protests have been interpreted as representing not only farmworkers but the Mexican-American community more broadly, making a statement that Anglo-Americans must recognize Mexican-Americans as &quot;legitimate players in American life&quot;. Chavez saw parallels in the way that African Americans were treated in the United States to the way that he and his fellow Mexican Americans were treated. He absorbed many of the tactics that African American civil rights activists had employed throughout the 1960s, applying them to his own movement. He was willing to take risks. Chavez recognized the impact that his farm-worker campaigns had had on the Chicano Movement during the early 1970s, although he kept his distance from the latter movement and many of its leaders. He condemned the violence that some figures in the Chicano Movement espoused.

===On organization and leadership===
Chavez placed the success of the movement above all else; Pawel described him as &quot;the ultimate pragmatist&quot;. He felt that he had to be both the leader and the organizer-in-chief of his movement because only he had the necessary commitment to the cause. He was interested in power and how to use it; although his role model in this was Gandhi, he also studied the ideas about power by Niccolò Machiavelli, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong, drawing ideas from each. His use of purges to expel people from his movement was influenced by Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, and he opened a June 1978 board meeting by reciting a poem by Mao. Chavez repeatedly referred to himself as a community organizer rather than as a labor leader and underscored that distinction. He wanted his organization to represent not just a union but a larger social movement. He was ambivalent about the national labor movement. He personally disliked many of the prominent figures within the American labor movement but, as a pragmatist, recognized the value of working with organized labor groups. He opposed the idea of paying wages to those who worked for the union, believing that it would destroy the spirit of the movement. He rarely fired people from their positions, but instead made their working situation uncomfortable so that they would resign.

Chavez&#x27;s leadership style was authoritarian; he stated that when he launched his movement, he initially had &quot;total, absolute power&quot; over it. Bruns characterized the UFW under Chavez as an &quot;autocratic regime&quot;. Ex-members of the group, such as Bustamante and Padilla described Chavez as a dictator within the union. Chavez felt unable to share the responsibilities of running his movement with others. In 1968, Fred Hirsch noted that &quot;one thing which characterizes Cesar&#x27;s leadership is that he takes full responsibility for as much of the operation as he is physically capable of. All decisions are made by him.&quot; Itliong noted that &quot;Cesar is afraid that if he shares the authority with the people [...] they might run away from him.&quot; Pawel noted that Chavez wanted &quot;yes-men&quot; around him. He divided members of movements such as his into three groups: those that achieved what they set out to do, those that worked hard but failed what they set out to do, and those that were lazy. He thought that the latter needed to be expelled from the movement. He highly valued individuals who were loyal, efficient, and took the initiative. Explaining his attitudes toward activism, he told his volunteers that &quot;nice guys throughout the ages have done very little for humanity. It isn&#x27;t the nice guy who gets things done. It&#x27;s the hardheaded guy.&quot; He admitted that he could be &quot;a real bastard&quot; when dealing with movement members; Chavez told UFW volunteers that &quot;I&#x27;m a son of a bitch to work with.&quot; He would play different people against each other to get what he wanted, particularly to break apart allies who might form an independent power bloc that would threaten his domination of the movement.

==Reception and legacy==

In the popular imagination, Chavez and the movement he led became largely synonymous, although throughout his career, Chavez prompted strong reactions from others. Since his death, there has been a struggle to define his legacy.

During his lifetime, many of Chavez&#x27;s supporters idolized him, engaging in a form of hero worship. Bruns noted that many of his supporters &quot;nearly worshipped him as a folk hero&quot;. In 1982, the American country music singer Kris Kristofferson called Chavez &quot;the only true hero we have walking on this Earth today.&quot; These supporters were known as &quot;Chavistas&quot;; many of them, especially those living at the La Paz commune, emulated his vegetarian diet. By the 1970s, he was increasingly referred to as a &quot;saint&quot; among those who supported him. In response to these claims, Chavez insisted that &quot;There is a big difference between being a saint and being an angel[...] Saints are known for being tough and stubborn.&quot; In 1972, John Zerzan described Chavez as presenting himself as &quot;a Christ-figure sacrificing all for his flock&quot; through his fasts, adding that Chavez took the form of a &quot;messianic leader&quot;. The scholar of Latino studies Lilia Soto called him and Huerta &quot;freedom fighters&quot;. He received a range of awards and accolades, which he claimed to hate. For these supporters, his visions for the future were regarded as inspirational. Bruns noted that he had &quot;a mesmerizing effect on the lives of thousands. They saw in him nobility, sacrifice, and the grit of the underdog who refuses to give up.&quot; Throughout his career as an activist, he received strong ecumenical support. The UFW gained the support of mainline Protestant groups in a way that previous farmworker movements never had.

Chavez was despised by many growers. John Giumarra Jr, of the Giumarra company, called Chavez a &quot;New Left guerrilla&quot;, someone who wanted to topple &quot;the established structure of American democracy&quot;. The FBI monitored him and many other senior figures in his movement, concerned that they were subversive. Having monitored him for over a decade, the FBI&#x27;s dossier on Chavez grew to over 1,500 pages in length. They ultimately found no evidence suggesting he had communist leanings. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he received a series of death threats, and—according to Bruns—he often faced &quot;spiteful mobs and scurrilous race-baiting&quot;.

Within Chavez&#x27;s movement itself, there was concern and criticism of his methods. It the early 1970s, for instance, Chavez-supporter George Higgins wrote a private memo arguing that Chavez &quot;appealed very crassly&quot; to feelings of guilt among many &quot;Protestant social actionists&quot; and threatened them &quot;with the enmity of the poor&quot; if they failed to meet with Chavez&#x27;s demands. Many ex-members of the UFW took the view that Chavez had been a poor administrator. Other labor unions had long been wary of Chavez&#x27;s movement, with the UFW gaining a reputation for always wanting money but doing little to assist others. In the U.S. union movement, many skeptics believed that Chavez&#x27;s idealism detracted from his effectiveness as a union leader. Paul Hall of the Seafarers International Union of North America met him in Washington, D.C., during the 1970s, at which he criticized Chavez for acting like a saint rather than a union leader, stating that he had become &quot;a fad – the poor man others can support to expiate their sins.&quot; Some Mexican-Americans were critical of Chavez, believing him an agitator and trouble-maker who was insufficiently patriotic in his views of the United States. Some critics believed that Chavez&#x27;s activism was mobilized largely by the desire for personal gain and ambition.

Bruns noted that Chavez&#x27;s movement was &quot;part of the fervor of change [in the United States] of the late 1960s&quot;, alongside the civil rights movement and the campaign against the Vietnam War. The historian Ronald A. Wells described Chavez as &quot;one of the most important Christian activists in our time,&quot; while the theologian Hosffman Ospino called him &quot;one of the most influential social leaders in the history of the United States&quot;. Pawel referred to Chavez as &quot;an improbable idol in an era of telegenic leaders and charismatic speakers&quot;. The historian Nelson Lichtenstein commented that Chavez&#x27;s UFW oversaw &quot;the largest and most effective boycott [in the United States] since the colonists threw tea into Boston Harbor&quot;. Lichtenstein also stated that Chavez had become &quot;an iconic, foundational figure in the political, cultural, and moral history&quot; of the Latino American community. Many Latinos drew inspiration from his movement, including student activists – for instance, UCSC&#x27;s Cesar Chavez Convocation. He has been described as a &quot;folk saint&quot; of the Mexican-American community. A poll conducted by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1983 found that Chavez was the Latino whom the Latinos of California most admired.

The scholar Steven Lloyd-Moffett argued that after Chavez&#x27;s death, the &quot;liberal intelligentsia and Chicano activists&quot; came to dominate attempts to define his legacy and that they downplayed his firm commitment to Christianity so as to portray him as being motivated by &quot;a secular ideology of justice and non-violence&quot;. When the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency in 2008, he used &quot;Sí se puede&quot;—translated into English as &quot;Yes we can&quot;—as one of his main campaign slogans. When Obama was seeking re-election in 2012, he visited Chavez&#x27;s grave and placed a rose upon it, also declaring his Union Headquarters to be a national monument. Chavez&#x27;s work has continued to exert influence on later activists. For instance, in his 2012 article in the &quot;Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics&quot;, Kevin J. O&#x27;Brien argued that Chavez could be &quot;a vital resource for contemporary Christian ecological ethics&quot;. O&#x27;Brien argued that it was both Chavez&#x27;s focus on &quot;the moral centrality of human dignity&quot; as well as his emphasis on sacrifice that could be of use by Christians wanting to engage in environmentalist activism. The theologian Carlos R. Piar similarly stated that Hispanic people should look to Chavez as an exemplar for &quot;a way of being Christian in the United States.&quot;

===Orders, decorations, monuments, and honors===
Chavez received a range of awards, both during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1973, he received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, and in 1992 the &quot;Pacem in Terris&quot; Award, a Catholic award meant to honor &quot;achievements in peace and justice&quot;. In August 1994, Chavez was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country&#x27;s highest honor for non-military personnel, by Democratic President Bill Clinton. Chavez&#x27;s widow collected it from the White House. Clinton stated that Chavez had been a &quot;remarkable man&quot; and that &quot;he was for his own people a Moses figure.&quot; In 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger inducted Chavez into the California Hall of Fame. Asteroid 6982 Cesarchavez, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in 1993, was named in his memory; the official was published by the Minor Planet Center on August 27, 2019 (). In March 2013, Google celebrated his 86th birthday with a Google Doodle.

The Reuther-Chavez Award was created in 2002 by Americans for Democratic Action &quot;to recognize important activist, scholarly and journalistic contributions on behalf of workers&#x27; rights, especially the right to unionize and bargain collectively.&quot; Colegio Cesar Chavez, named after Chavez while he was still alive, was a four-year &quot;college without walls&quot; in Mount Angel, Oregon, intended for the education of Mexican-Americans, that ran from 1973 to 1983. On May 18, 2011, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that the Navy would be naming the last of 14 Lewis and Clark-class cargo ships after Cesar Chavez. The USNS &quot;Cesar Chavez&quot; was launched on May 5, 2012.

In 2004, the National Chavez Center was opened on the UFW national headquarters campus in Keene by the César E. Chávez Foundation. It currently consists of a visitor center, memorial garden and his grave site. When it is fully completed, the site will include a museum and conference center to explore and share Chavez&#x27;s work. On September 14, 2011, the U.S. Department of the Interior added the Nuestra Senora Reina de La Paz ranch to the National Register of Historic Places. On October 8, 2012, President Barack Obama designated the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument within the National Park system. California State University San Marcos&#x27; Chavez Plaza includes a statue to Chavez. In 2007, The University of Texas at Austin unveiled its own Cesar Chavez statue on campus. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 authorized the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study of sites that are significant to the life of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement in the western United States. The study evaluated the significance and suitability of sites significant to Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement, and the feasibility and appropriateness of a National Park Service role in the management of any of these sites.

Cesar Chavez&#x27;s birthday, March 31, is a holiday in California, Denver (Colorado), and Texas. It is intended to promote community service in honor of Chavez&#x27;s life and work. Many, but not all, state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed. Many public schools in the three states are also closed. Chavez Day is an optional holiday in Arizona. Although it is not a federal holiday, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31 &quot;Cesar Chavez Day&quot; in the United States, with Americans being urged to &quot;observe this day with appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor César Chávez&#x27;s enduring legacy&quot;. The heavily Hispanic city of Laredo, Texas, observes &quot;Cesar Chavez Month&quot; during March. Organized by the local League of United Latin American Citizens, a citizens&#x27; march is held in downtown Laredo on the last Saturday morning of March to commemorate Chavez. In the Mission District, San Francisco a &quot;Cesar Chavez Holiday Parade&quot; is held on the second weekend of April, in honor of Cesar Chavez.

Chavez was referenced by Stevie Wonder in the song &quot;Black Man&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. The 2014 American film &quot;César Chávez&quot;, starring Michael Peña as Chavez, covered Chavez&#x27;s life in the 1960s and early 1970s. That same year, a documentary film, titled &quot;Cesar&#x27;s Last Fast&quot;, was released. He received belated full military honors from the U.S. Navy at his graveside on April 23, 2015, the 22nd anniversary of his death. In 2015, statues of Chavez and Huerta were erected above a pizzeria in Downtown Napa, financed by a wealthy private citizen, Michael Holcomb, rather than city authorities.

There is a portrait of Chavez in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2003, the United States Postal Service honored Chavez with a postage stamp. A three-dimensional mural by artist Johanna Poethig, &quot;Tiene la lumbre por dentro&quot; (He Has the Fire Within Him) (2000) at Sonoma State University, honors Chavez and the Farm Workers Movement. The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) nominated him three times for the Nobel Peace Prize.

At the start of the presidency of Joe Biden, a bust of Chavez was placed on a table directly behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.

<text>Dorothy Faye Dunaway (born January 14, 1941) is an American actress. She is the recipient of many accolades, including an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a BAFTA Award. In 2011, the government of France made her an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters.

Her career began in the early 1960s on Broadway. She made her screen debut in 1967 in &quot;The Happening&quot;, the same year she made &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot; with an all-star cast, and rose to fame with her portrayal of outlaw Bonnie Parker in Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. Her most notable films include the crime caper &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968), the romantic drama &quot;The Arrangement&quot; (1969), the revisionist Western &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), a two-part adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas classic &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973, with &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; following in 1974), the neo-noir mystery &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) for which she earned her second Oscar nomination, the action-drama disaster &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), the political thriller &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), the satire &quot;Network&quot; (1976) for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress, the thriller &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; (1978), and the sports drama &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979).

Her career evolved to more mature character roles in subsequent years, often in independent features, beginning with her controversial portrayal of Joan Crawford in the 1981 biopic &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;. Her later films include &quot;Supergirl&quot; (1984), &quot;Barfly&quot; (1987), &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1990), &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1994), &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; (1995), &quot;The Twilight of the Golds&quot; (1997), &quot;Gia&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (2002). Dunaway has also performed on stage in several plays, including &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1961–63), &quot;After the Fall&quot; (1964), &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Goat&quot; (1965–67), and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1973). She was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas in &quot;Master Class&quot; (1996).

Protective of her private life, she rarely gives interviews and makes very few public appearances. After romantic relationships with Jerry Schatzberg and Marcello Mastroianni, Dunaway married twice, first to singer Peter Wolf and then to photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill, with whom she had a son, Liam.

==Early life and education==
Dunaway was born in Bascom, Florida, the daughter of Grace April (née Smith), a housewife, and John MacDowell Dunaway Jr., a career non-commissioned officer in the United States Army. Her parents married as teenagers in 1939 and divorced in 1955. She had one younger brother, lawyer Mac Simmion Dunaway. She is of Ulster Scottish, Irish, and German descent. She spent her childhood traveling throughout the United States and Europe, including lengthy stays in Mannheim, Germany, and Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.

Dunaway took ballet, tap, piano, and singing lessons, while growing up and graduated from Leon High School in Tallahassee, Florida. She then studied at Florida State University and the University of Florida, later graduating from Boston University with a degree in theatre. 

She spent the summer before her senior year in a summer-stock company at Harvard&#x27;s Loeb Drama Center, where one of her co-players was Jane Alexander, an actress and future head of the National Endowment for the Arts. During her senior year, she worked with director Lloyd Richards on a BU production of a new version of &quot;The Crucible&quot;, where Arthur Miller saw her perform. Following graduation in 1962, at the age of 21, she took acting classes at the American National Theater and Academy, and was recommended to director Elia Kazan, who was in search of young talent for his Lincoln Center Repertory Company. She also studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.

Shortly after graduating from Boston University, Dunaway appeared on Broadway as a replacement in Robert Bolt&#x27;s drama &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. She subsequently appeared in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;After the Fall&quot; and the award-winning &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Goat&quot; by Harvard professor William Alfred, who became her mentor and spiritual advisor. In her 1995 autobiography, Dunaway said of him: &quot;With the exception of my mother, my brother, and my beloved son, Bill Alfred has been without question the most important single figure in my lifetime. A teacher, a mentor, and I suppose the father I never had, the parent and companion I would always have wanted, if that choice had been mine. He has taught me so much about the virtue of a simple life, about spirituality, about the purity of real beauty, and how to go at this messy business of life.&quot;

==Career==

=== 1967–1968: Early films and breakthrough ===

Dunaway&#x27;s first screen role was in the comedy crime film &quot;The Happening&quot; (1967), which starred Anthony Quinn. Her performance earned her good notices from critics; however, Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; panned the performance, saying that she &quot;exhibits a real neat trick of resting her cheek on the back of her hand.&quot; That same year, she had a supporting role in Otto Preminger&#x27;s drama &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot;, opposite Michael Caine and Jane Fonda. Filming proved to be difficult for Dunaway, as she clashed with Preminger, who she felt did not know &quot;anything at all about the process of acting.&quot; She later described this experience as a &quot;psychodrama that left me feeling damaged at the end of each day.&quot; Dunaway had signed a six-picture deal with Preminger, but decided during the filming to get her contract back. &quot;As much as it cost me to get out of the deal with Otto, if I&#x27;d had to do those movies with him, then I wouldn&#x27;t have done &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, or &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, or any of the movies I was suddenly in a position to choose to do. Beyond the movies I might have missed, it would have been a kind of Chinese water torture to have been stuck in five more terrible movies. It&#x27;s impossible to assess the damage that might have done to me that early on in my career.&quot; Preminger&#x27;s film did not meet critical or box office success, but Dunaway retained notice enough to earn a Golden Globe Award nomination for New Star of the Year.

Dunaway had tried to get an interview with director Arthur Penn when he was directing &quot;The Chase&quot; (1966), but was rebuffed by a casting director who did not think that she had the right face for the movies. When Penn saw her scenes from &quot;The Happening&quot; before its release, he decided to let her read for the role of the bank robber Bonnie Parker for his upcoming film, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). Casting for the role of Bonnie had proved to be difficult, and many actresses had been considered for the role, including Jane Fonda, Tuesday Weld, Ann-Margret, Carol Lynley, Leslie Caron, and Natalie Wood. Penn loved Dunaway and managed to convince actor and producer Warren Beatty, who played Clyde Barrow in the film, that she was right for the part. Besides Dunaway&#x27;s being a comparative unknown, Beatty&#x27;s concern was her &quot;extraordinary bone structure,&quot; which he thought might be inappropriate for Bonnie Parker, a local girl trying to look innocent while she held up small-town Texas banks. He changed his mind, though, after seeing some photographs of Dunaway taken by Curtis Hanson on the beach: &quot;She could hit the ball across the net, and she had an intelligence and a strength that made her both powerful and romantic.&quot; Dunaway only had a few weeks to prepare for the role, and when she was asked to lose weight to give her character a Depression-era look, she went on a starvation diet, stopped eating, and dropped .

The film was controversial on its original release for its supposed glorification of murderers and level of graphic violence, which was unprecedented at the time. It performed well at the box office and elevated Dunaway to stardom. Roger Ebert gave the film a rave review and wrote, &quot;The performances throughout are flawless. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, in the title roles, surpass anything they have done on the screen before, and establish themselves (somewhat to my surprise) as major actors.&quot; The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Dunaway received her first nomination for Best Actress. Her performance earned her a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer and a David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress, and she was now among the most bankable actresses in Hollywood, as she later recalled. &quot;It put me firmly in the ranks of actresses that would do work that was art. There are those who elevate the craft of acting to the art of acting, and now I would be among them. I was the golden girl at that time. One of those women who was going to be nominated year after year for an Oscar and would win at least one. The movie established the quality of my work. &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; would also turn me into a star.&quot;

Dunaway followed the success with another hit, &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968), in which she played Vicki Anderson, an insurance investigator who becomes involved with Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen), a millionaire who attempts to pull off the perfect crime. Norman Jewison hired Dunaway after he saw scenes from &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; before its release. As Arthur Penn had needed to persuade Warren Beatty to cast Dunaway, Jewison had to convince McQueen that she was right for the part. The film emphasized Dunaway&#x27;s sensuality and elegance with a character who has remained an influential style icon. The role required over 29 costume changes and was a complex one to play. &quot;Vicki&#x27;s dilemma was, at the time, a newly emerging phenomenon for women: How does one do all of this in a man&#x27;s world and not sacrifice one&#x27;s emotional and personal life in the process?&quot; Despite his original reluctance to work with her, McQueen later called Dunaway the best actress he ever worked with. Dunaway was also very fond of McQueen. &quot;It was really my first time to play opposite someone who was a great big old movie star, and that&#x27;s exactly what Steve was. He was one of the best-loved actors around, one whose talent more than equaled his sizable commercial appeal.&quot; The film was immensely popular and was famed for a scene where Dunaway and McQueen play a chess game and silently engage in a seduction of each other across the board.

=== 1969–1973: Career setbacks ===

Following the completion of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, Dunaway leapfrogged France&#x27;s new wave directors to begin filming in Italy Vittorio de Sica&#x27;s romantic drama, &quot;A Place for Lovers&quot; (1968). This film was with Marcello Mastroianni, in which she played a terminally ill American fashion designer in Venice who has a whirlwind affair with a race-car driver. Although Dunaway had always wanted to avoid romances with her co-stars, she began a love affair with Mastroianni that lasted for two years. The film was an artistic disappointment and a commercial failure. In 1969, Dunaway appeared in &quot;The Arrangement&quot;, a drama directed by Elia Kazan, based upon his novel of the same title, opposite Kirk Douglas. The film did poorly at the box office, receiving mostly negative reviews, although Dunaway was praised, with Roger Ebert writing that her acting &quot;is not only the equal of in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, but is, indeed, the only good acting she has done since&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that she was &quot;looking so cool and elegant that the sight of her almost pinches the optic nerves&quot;. Also in 1969, &quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot;, a comedy adventure directed by John Frankenheimer and also starring David Niven that she shot right after &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, was released to poor reviews and proved to be a commercial failure. Despite protests from her agent, Dunaway turned down many high-profile projects to spend time with Mastroianni.

In 1969, Dunaway took a supporting role as a favor to Arthur Penn in his Western, &quot;Little Big Man&quot;. In a rare comic role, Dunaway played the sexually repressed wife of a minister who helps raise and seduce a boy raised by Native Americans, played by Dustin Hoffman. The film was widely praised by critics and was one of Dunaway&#x27;s few commercial successes at this point. That same year, she appeared in the lead role in &quot;Puzzle of a Downfall Child&quot; (1970), an experimental drama directed by Jerry Schatzberg and inspired by the life of model Anne St. Marie. The film failed to generate commercial interest, though it earned for Dunaway a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. The film remained in obscurity over 40 years, until it was revived at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival in honor of Dunaway. Involved in domestic issues in Italy with Mastroianni, after some months away from the industry, she finally found her next role in the Western &quot;Doc&quot; (1971), which tells the story of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and of one of its protagonists, Doc Holliday. During the filming, Dunaway realized how much she had missed working. That same year, she went on to make the French thriller &quot;The Deadly Trap&quot; with her Lincoln Center compatriot Frank Langella. Rather than working with a director from the already crested new wave, Jean-Luc Godard, who had originally made contributions to the first script of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, she worked with the French postwar director, who was held in the highest respect, René Clément. Only five months after the first day of shooting, the film was screened at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival but was not entered into the main competition.

Neither &quot;Doc&quot; nor &quot;The Deadly Trap&quot; had generated much attention, either critically or financially, so Dunaway accepted an offer to star in a movie for television, &quot;The Woman I Love&quot; (1972), in which she portrayed Wallis Simpson. She returned to film in 1973 with Stanley Kramer&#x27;s drama, &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot;, opposite George C. Scott. It was an ambitious project in which Dunaway had to play another complex character, &quot;a woman who is caught between her ambition and her femininity. When the film opens, she is as tough as nails, a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later woman. Along the way, she slowly opens herself up to her estranged father and a lover. I understood that dilemma well, the conflict between ambition and love, the fear of trusting someone else with your love.&quot; The film was a modest success, but Dunaway received good notices for her performance. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert noted how she had never topped the work she did in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, and said that her career had been &quot;rather absentminded&quot; ever since. He praised her performance in &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot;, saying that she played the role with &quot;a great deal of style,&quot; while adding, &quot;Perhaps she has decided to get back to acting.&quot;

In 1972, following the filming of &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot;, Dunaway returned to the stage in an adaptation of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Old Times&quot;. She found the stage more challenging than film. &quot;&quot;Old Times&quot; affected me in a lot of very complex ways. The play itself reminded me during a difficult point in my life that there are a million facets to life. There is never just one answer. Professionally, if I hadn&#x27;t taken that step to go back to the stage, in a serious way, I think I would have suffered for it.&quot; The following year, Dunaway portrayed Blanche DuBois in a Los Angeles stage production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. &quot;It was a fun performance for me, but hard, very draining. At the height of the madness each night, I would go from standing straight up to falling to my knees, in one swift move.&quot; Williams himself praised Dunaway for her performance, &quot;He told me later that he thought I was brave and adorable and reminded him of a precocious child, and that my performance ranked with the very best. It was high praise indeed coming from him.&quot; Also in 1973, Dunaway appeared as the villainous Milady de Winter in Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, based on Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel of the same name, co-starring Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Charlton Heston. Eventually, producers decided to split the film into two parts: &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (released in 1974). Critics and audiences alike praised the film for its action and its comic tone, and it was the first in a line of successful projects for Dunaway.

=== 1974–1981: Resurgence and acclaim ===
Director Roman Polanski offered Dunaway the lead role of Evelyn Mulwray in his mystery neo-noir &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974). Although its producer, Robert Evans, wanted Polanski to consider Jane Fonda for the role, arguing that Dunaway had a reputation for temperament, Polanski insisted on using Dunaway. She accepted the challenging and complex role of Mulwray, a shadowy &quot;femme fatale&quot; who knows more than she is willing to let Detective J.J. Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson) know. Dunaway got along well with Nicholson, describing him later as a &quot;soul mate&quot;, but she clashed with Polanski, who had a reputation for being dictatorial and controlling on a set. &quot;Roman was very much an autocrat, always forcing things. It ranged from the physical to the mental. He was very domineering and abrasive, and made it clear he wanted to manipulate the performance. That approach has never worked with me.&quot;

Two weeks after the filming started, the two had a confrontation that became notorious. Polanski pulled one of Dunaway&#x27;s hairs out of her head, without telling her, because it was catching the light. Dunaway was offended, describing his act as &quot;sadistic&quot; and left the set furious. &quot;It was not the hair, it was the incessant cruelty that I felt, the constant sarcasm, the never-ending need to humiliate me.&quot; Years later, both shared their admiration for each other, with Polanski saying that their feud was not important – &quot;It&#x27;s the result that counts. And she was formidable,&quot; while Dunaway admitted that &quot;it was way too much made out of it,&quot; added that she enjoyed working with Polanski, calling him &quot;a great director,&quot; and stated, &quot;Chinatown&quot; was &quot;possibly the best film I ever made.&quot;

Despite the complications on the set, the film was finished, released to glowing reviews, and ultimately became a classic. It made back its budget almost five times, and received 11 Academy Award nominations. Dunaway received a second Best Actress nomination, and also received a Golden Globe nomination and a BAFTA nomination. Upon the release of the film, producer Robert Evans was full of praise for Dunaway. &quot;She has everything—beauty, talent, neurosis. She&#x27;s one of the great strange ones. When the lights go out and that face comes out of the dark and she looks at you with those big mysterious eyes, I tell you, it&#x27;s a very compelling thing. She has something we haven&#x27;t seen on the screen for a long time. She has witchery. She&#x27;s a &quot;femme fatale&quot;.&quot;

That same year, Dunaway appeared in a television adaptation of &quot;After the Fall&quot; with Christopher Plummer. She played the lead role, which was for her &quot;like a dream come true. As with Bonnie, I knew the territory well. Maggie (her character) was a completely wounded soul, a girl who had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks.&quot; She next played Paul Newman&#x27;s fiancée, who is trapped in a burning skyscraper along with several hundred other people in the all-star disaster epic, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). The film became the highest-grossing film of the year, further cementing Dunaway as a top actress in Hollywood. Also in 1974, Dunaway married Peter Wolf, the lead singer of the rock group The J. Geils Band. At this time, she felt &quot;exhausted from the constant and intense pressures of the work,&quot; and at the last moment pulled out of &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), in which she was to costar with Sean Connery, to concentrate on her married life.

Her next feature was Sydney Pollack&#x27;s political thriller, &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975). Her character was to be held hostage by a CIA analyst, played by Robert Redford, and Dunaway was required to display fear that she might be raped, but she had difficulty not breaking into laughter during the shoot, as &quot;the idea of being kidnapped and ravaged by Robert Redford was anything but frightening.&quot; The film was a critical and commercial success, and Dunaway&#x27;s performance, which was praised by the critics, earned her a fifth Golden Globe nomination. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert called her character &quot;the very embodiment of pluck,&quot; and said that, &quot;She has three lines of dialogue that brings the house down. They&#x27;re obscene and funny and poignant all at once, and Dunaway delivers them just marvelously.&quot; Dunaway took a break from acting and spent almost a year turning down projects. She passed on a role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s final film, the comic thriller &quot;Family Plot&quot;, which she later lamented. She returned to the screen in 1976 with the Holocaust drama &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;. The story was inspired by true events concerning the fate of the ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Germany to Cuba in 1939.

That same year, Dunaway appeared in the Paddy Chayefsky-scripted satire &quot;Network&quot; as the scheming TV executive Diana Christensen, a ruthless woman who will do anything for higher ratings. She loved the script and later said this was &quot;the only film I ever did that you didn&#x27;t touch the script because it was almost as if it were written in verse.&quot; She pursued the role over the objections of her husband, Peter Wolf, and her confidant, William Alfred, who regarded Christensen as too heartless and were concerned that people would confuse her with the character. However, Dunaway believed it was &quot;one of the most important female roles to come along in years&quot; and went along with Chayevsky&#x27;s conception and director Sidney Lumet&#x27;s warning that she would not be allowed to sneak in any weeping or softness, and that it would remain on the cutting room floor if she did.

The film, a success in its own day, is frequently discussed today due to its almost prophetic take on the television industry. Dunaway&#x27;s performance was lauded, with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying that she &quot;in particular, is successful in making touching and funny a woman of psychopathic ambition and lack of feeling.&quot; Dunaway&#x27;s performance in &quot;Network&quot; earned her many awards. She was named Best Actress in the Kansas City Film Critics Awards, and she received her sixth Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Network&quot; and was awarded Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In early 1977, the Academy Awards nominated &quot;Network&quot; for ten awards, with Dunaway winning the Best Actress award.

Also in 1976, Dunaway appeared as the lead in the made-for-television movie, &quot;The Disappearance of Aimee&quot;, in which she co-starred with Bette Davis. Following her Oscar win, Dunaway took another break from acting to figure out her personal life. As her marriage was falling apart, she began a relationship with English photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill, who took one of his most famous pictures, &quot;The Morning After&quot;, showing Dunaway poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel with her Oscar the morning after the ceremony. In 1978, Dunaway returned to the screen in Irvin Kershner&#x27;s thriller &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot;, about a fashion photographer who sees visions of a killer murdering people. The film was a success at the box office, and Dunaway received positive reviews for her performance, with Janet Maslin writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she was &quot;perfect for her role.&quot; She played supporting roles in &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979), as the film offered her the chance to play the role of a mother, &quot;which was emotionally where I wanted to be in my life,&quot; and &quot;The First Deadly Sin&quot; (1980); she wanted to work with Frank Sinatra. In 1981, Dunaway played the title role in &quot;Evita Perón&quot;, a television miniseries based on the life of the famed First Lady of Argentina.


That same year, Dunaway portrayed actress Joan Crawford in the adaptation of her daughter Christina&#x27;s controversial memoir, &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, in which she had depicted her adoptive mother as an abusive tyrant who only adopted her four children to promote her acting career, making quite a stir as the first celebrity tell-all book. Anne Bancroft had been initially cast as Crawford, but Dunaway accepted the role after meeting producer Frank Yablans and director Frank Perry, who both assured her that they wanted to tell the real story of Joan Crawford, and not just a tabloid version of her life. &quot;Though Christina&#x27;s book was obviously an exploitation book, the first one of its kind, my task was to portray a woman, a full woman who she was in all her facets, not just one. I tried to illuminate who this woman was. But it was more than just about being angry, it was about trying to examine and explore the forces that undermined her.&quot; To play the role, Dunaway researched Crawford&#x27;s films and met with many of her friends and co-workers, including director George Cukor. Filming proved difficult for her, as she was almost never out of character. &quot;If your mind is on a woman who is dead and you&#x27;re trying to find out who she was and do right by her, you do feel a presence. I felt it at home at night sometimes. It wasn&#x27;t pleasant. I felt Joan was not at rest.&quot; After the infamous &quot;wire hangers&quot; tantrum scene, Dunaway was so hoarse from screaming that she lost her voice. Frank Sinatra drove her to see a throat specialist and shared his own tips on how to preserve her voice.

The film opened in 1981, and was a moderate commercial success despite negative reviews. Dunaway&#x27;s uncanny performance earned her two Best Actress award nominations by the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and the National Society of Film Critics Awards, and was lauded by critics. Janet Maslin, while dismissing the film as incoherent, wrote that Dunaway&#x27;s performance was &quot;a small miracle&quot; and praised her energy and commitment to the role. The frequently harsh Pauline Kael raved about Dunaway&#x27;s performance, stating that she had reached new heights as an actress and surmised that it would be difficult for Dunaway to top her performance as Crawford. Vincent Canby also praised Dunaway, writing that &quot;&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; doesn&#x27;t work very well, but the ferocious intensity of Faye Dunaway&#x27;s impersonation does, as does the film&#x27;s point of view, which succeeds in making Joan Crawford into a woman far more complicated, more self-aware and more profoundly disturbed than the mother remembered in Christina Crawford&#x27;s book.&quot; Director Sidney Lumet stated that it was &quot;a brilliant, an extraordinary performance. The courage of that evil that she brings to it, I think that&#x27;s just major acting.&quot; Although the film became a cult classic as well as one of her most famous characters, Dunaway expressed her regrets for playing Crawford, as she felt &quot;it was meant to be a window into a tortured soul. But it was made into camp.&quot; She also blamed the film for hurting her career and almost never agreed to discuss it in interviews afterwards, typically saying that only God will ever know what passed between Joan and Christina.

=== 1982–1999: Film, television, and theatre work ===
In 1982, Dunaway appeared in a television adaptation of Clifford Odets&#x27;s dramatic play &quot;The Country Girl&quot; as the wife of a washed-up alcoholic singer played by Dick Van Dyke, whom she later described as &quot;one of the sweetest and funniest men in the world&quot;, but admitted &quot;Though it was a valiant effort on all our parts, and there were moments I thought were good and true, the remake fell short of our hopes and certainly of the original. But doing it helped remind of that I do love this business of acting, something the Crawford movie had come close to making me forget.&quot; That same year, she returned to the New York stage with William Alfred&#x27;s second theatre project for her, &quot;The Curse of an Aching Heart&quot;. In her role, she later felt she had been miscast, &quot;It was a little bit too star-heavy with me in it. The play would have been better with just the simplest of women.&quot; Despite her mixed feelings about it, her performance earned her good reviews from the critics, with Frank Rich writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;Miss Dunaway&#x27;s absence from the theater has not dimmed her stage technique. She&#x27;s usually in command.&quot;
During this time, Dunaway moved to England with her partner Terry O&#x27;Neill, whom she married in 1982; being more interested in her married life, she only took on work that was convenient for her. That same year, she returned to the screen in Michael Winner&#x27;s period melodrama &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, in which she played an 18th-century highway robber. The film proved to be a critical and commercial failure. &quot;Though I loved making &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, in the end, it just didn&#x27;t have the juice it needed to be a hit. It seemed to never quite decide whether to be a farce or a drama, and so it failed by being neither.&quot;

In 1984, Dunaway played the lead villain in the superhero movie &quot;Supergirl&quot;. She felt that &quot;the film was really just a send-up, a spoof, and I had a lot of fun with Selena (her character)&quot;, but later admitted she was furious with the director Jeannot Szwarc, &quot;Every time I tried to do something funny, he wouldn&#x27;t let me. He said, &quot;you have to be the straight person&quot;. I always wanted to do comedy, but it&#x27;s daunting when you&#x27;ve not done it before.&quot; Also in 1984, Dunaway appeared in a television miniseries, &quot;Ellis Island&quot;, which earned her a second Golden Globe Award, for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. The following year, she starred in the miniseries, &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;. She also appeared in two Agatha Christie adaptations, &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; and &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot; (which was made for television). Though the work was involving, Dunaway struggled to find artistically fulfilling roles during this period in England. &quot;I missed doing movies. The television scripts I was getting were thin. There is no comparison between those and a &quot;Chinatown&quot; script.&quot; &quot;Though I had worked steadily in England, it felt as if I had disappeared completely. I was rapidly becoming invisible. I felt increasingly that my career was being limited to, and limited by, the projects that were being mounted there.&quot; Following her divorce from O&#x27;Neill in 1987, Dunaway returned to the United States and attempted to rebuild her career by appearing in several independent dramas.

Dunaway was widely praised for her performance as an alcoholic opposite Mickey Rourke in Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s drama &quot;Barfly&quot; (1987). Based on a novel by Charles Bukowski, the film was very important to her, as she later explained, &quot;This character, who has given over her days and nights to a bottle, is my way back to the light. This is a role that I care deeply about. I haven&#x27;t felt this passion for a character since &quot;Network&quot;. I saw the promise of a comeback for me in the deglamorized face of Wanda, a woman of sweet vulnerability.&quot; The film was a small success at the box office but received excellent reviews from critics, with Pauline Kael writing that &quot;Dunaway plays the self-destructive Wanda with a minimum of fuss... she wins your admiration by the simplicity of her effects&quot;, and Roger Ebert felt that both Rourke and Dunaway &quot;take their characters as opportunities to stretch as actors, to take changes and do extreme things&quot;. Dunaway earned her sixth Golden Globe Award nomination. After &quot;Barfly&quot;, which remained one of her favorite films, Dunaway tried to be careful about the roles she chose, but was also faced with the reality she had to work to support herself and her child.
In 1988, she appeared in the period drama &quot;The Gamble&quot;, but felt that the best part of this experience turned out to be meeting her co-star Matthew Modine. The following year, she produced and starred in an adaptation for television of Olive Ann Burns&#x27; historical novel &quot;Cold Sassy Tree&quot;. Dunaway co-starred with Richard Widmark and Neil Patrick Harris as an enchanting dressmaker who lightens up the lives of a young boy and his grandfather, whom she marries, to the town&#x27;s disapproval. The film aired on TNT to great success and became one of Dunaway&#x27;s favorite experiences. &quot;What gave &quot;Cold Sassy&quot; its heart were the people who were involved. It was an incredible collaboration, and I treasure the experience as much as the result, of which I am extremely proud.&quot; That same year, she agreed to take part in &quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini&quot; with Joe Mantegna as a favor to Tom Luddy, who had produced &quot;Barfly&quot;. Also in 1989, she appeared in the Italian drama &quot;Crystal or Ash, Fire or Wind, as Long as It&#x27;s Love&quot;, as she wanted to work with director Lina Wertmüller. In 1990, she was reunited with Robert Duvall, with whom she had co-starred in &quot;Network&quot;, in Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s adaptation of the Margaret Atwood novel, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The film did not do well at the box office, but Dunaway&#x27;s performance earned her good reviews. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Duvall and Dunaway provide the best moments in the movie, he by showing the unconscious egotism of the male libido, she by showing that in all times and all weathers, some kinds of women will gauge their happiness by the degree to which their family&#x27;s exterior appearance matches the accepted values of society.&quot;

&quot;Double Edge&quot; (1992) by Israeli director, writer, and actor Amos Kollek offered her a role she wanted to play, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter who has been sent to Jerusalem for three weeks to cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. All of these were smaller movies that never manage to draw the attention of a mass audience. The following year, Dunaway accepted a supporting role in the thriller &quot;The Temp&quot;, as she felt the project had the potential to be a mainstream hit, and was a chance for her to reconnect with a larger audience. The film proved to be a critical and commercial failure. Four weeks before its release, Paramount decided to reshoot the final scene, much to Dunaway&#x27;s displeasure, as her character was going to be turned into the murderer. &quot;Once again, I could see myself being thrown into playing the extreme —‌ what was initially conceived as a character in the tradition of Diana in &quot;Network&quot; was being turned into a high-gloss female executive/slasher. The new ending wasn&#x27;t enough to salvage the film, though. By the final scene, it didn&#x27;t matter who was the killer, the film had been dead for an hour at least.&quot; Also in 1993, Dunaway was cast as Johnny Depp&#x27;s love interest in Emir Kusturica&#x27;s surrealist comedy-drama &quot;Arizona Dream&quot;. The film, in which she played a woman who dreams of building a flying machine, premiered in Europe to great acclaim, and received the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival. Dunaway was very proud of the film, and believed that her role could bring her career to greater heights than ever. However, Warner Bros. elected to re-edit Kusturica&#x27;s film, cutting and changing it. Dunaway was dismayed to find that some of her best scenes were left out of the American version. Warner Bros. released the film in United States in 1994 to positive reviews, but little box-office attendance.

That same year, Dunaway was cast in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;. Both the show and Dunaway&#x27;s performance were widely panned, and the series was cancelled after only four episodes. Around that time, she was contacted by NBC, who wanted her to take on the role of a female sleuth, more in the vein of &quot;Columbo&quot; than &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. As the prospective series was being developed, Dunaway contacted &quot;Columbo&quot; star Peter Falk, wanting his advice on how to approach playing the sleuth character. While discussing the role, Falk told Dunaway about a &quot;Columbo&quot; script that he had written himself. &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot; featured a seductive woman who plays a game of cat-and-mouse with Lt. Columbo in the midst of a murder. Falk had written the script some years prior, saying that he could not find the right actress to take on the role. He offered it to her, and Dunaway accepted immediately. The 1993 TV movie proved a success and was nominated for several Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. Dunaway was recognized with the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, saying it was at that moment when she felt like she was truly home. &quot;I was overwhelmed by the generosity of spirit my colleagues extended me that night. It was like being wrapped up in a warm embrace. Though this is more often than not a town of grand illusions and transitory friendships, the moment seemed heartfelt, and touched me deeply.&quot;

With the prospective detective show not working out, Dunaway became interested in returning to the stage. She auditioned to replace Glenn Close in the musical &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, a stage version of 1950 film of the same name. Composer and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber cast Dunaway in the famed role of Norma Desmond, and Dunaway began rehearsing to take over the LA engagement when Close moved the show to Broadway. Tickets went on sale for Dunaway&#x27;s engagement, but shortly after the rehearsals started, Webber and his associates announced that Dunaway was unable to sing to their desired standards. They announced that when Close finished her engagement, the show would shut down completely. Dunaway filed a lawsuit, claiming that Webber had damaged her reputation with his claims. The case went to court and a settlement was later reached, but Dunaway and the producers have not discussed it. In 1995, Dunaway reunited with Johnny Depp in the romantic comedy &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot;, in which she played Marlon Brando&#x27;s wife. A hit at the box office, the film was praised for its romance and the performances of the three main characters. That same year, Dunaway published &quot;Looking for Gatsby&quot;, a memoir she co-wrote with Betsy Sharkey, which earned her great reviews. Mark Harris of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote in his review of the book that &quot;to read her accounts of her Oscar-nominated performances as the taut, sexy, neurotic &quot;femmes fatales&quot; of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and &quot;Network&quot; is to learn from an expert about the instincts, collaborations, and compromises that go into great film acting&quot;.

The following year, Dunaway was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She starred in the family comedy &quot;Dunston Checks In&quot;, the crime thriller &quot;The Chamber&quot;, which reunited her with her &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; co-star Gene Hackman, and in the directorial debut of actor Kevin Spacey, &quot;Albino Alligator&quot;. Also in 1996, Dunaway returned to the stage, playing famed opera singer Maria Callas in the U.S. national tour of the Tony Award-winning play &quot;Master Class&quot; by Terrence McNally. Callas was one of Dunaway&#x27;s favorite characters she ever played. &quot;That woman changed an art form, and not many people can say that. Callas is to opera what Fellini is to cinema.&quot; Similarities were made by the press between the career and personalities of Callas and Dunaway, as both were seen as perfectionists whose run-ins with directors had them castigated as prima donnas. &quot;I think the play is really about what it takes to do something in life, and it&#x27;s original in that, because there&#x27;s not a play I know of that has been written about that. This is about an uncompromising artist and a professional who will stop at almost nothing to serve the art that she loves. She said it over and over again in many of her interviews: &quot;It&#x27;s not a question of discipline, it&#x27;s a question of love, of what you do out of the passion for your art.&quot; And she&#x27;s right. She was all about feeling —‌ that&#x27;s why I love this role so much.&quot; The tour was a great success and earned Dunaway rave reviews for her performance, as well as the Sarah Siddons Award.

Her performance as the matron of a wealthy Jewish family in turmoil in the drama &quot;The Twilight of the Golds&quot; (1997) earned her a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries. In 1998, she starred with Angelina Jolie in &quot;Gia&quot;, a biographical film about the rise and fall of supermodel Gia Carangi. Playing the small but key role of Carangi&#x27;s agent, Dunaway&#x27;s performance was well reviewed and won her third Golden Globe Award. The following year, Dunaway appeared in the remake of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, and Roger Ebert argued in his review of the film that she &quot;had more electricity in 1968 and still does&quot; compared to actress Rene Russo, who was cast in her original role. Also in 1999, Dunaway portrayed Yolande of Aragon in Luc Besson&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot;.

=== 2000–2015: Independent films and hiatus ===

In 2000, Dunaway appeared in the James Gray-directed crime film &quot;The Yards&quot; as Charlize Theron&#x27;s mother. Although failing to do well at the box office, the film was received with positive reviews. That same year, she turned down an opportunity to play a drug addict in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; and the role went to Ellen Burstyn, who received an Academy Award nomination for her performance. In 2001, Dunaway&#x27;s role in &quot;Running Mates&quot; earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. In 2002, she played Ian Somerhalder&#x27;s rich Xanax-popping mother in Roger Avary&#x27;s adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27; novel, &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. She served as a judge on the 2005 reality show &quot;The Starlet&quot;, which sought, &quot;American Idol&quot;-style, to find the next young actress with the potential to become a major star. In 2006, Dunaway guest-starred in &quot;Kiss Kiss, Bye Bye&quot;, an episode of the crime drama &quot;&quot; because she was a huge fan of the show. She also appeared on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Alias&quot;, and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. In 2008, Dunaway agreed to star in a low-budget Welsh horror film, &quot;Flick&quot;, for a fraction of her usual $1 million fee after falling in love with the script. She called the writer and director David Howard personally to accept the part of a one-armed American detective, saying it was &quot;a really original story&quot;. The film premiered at the Raindance Film Festival. That same year, she criticized Hollywood&#x27;s treatment of older women, saying: &quot;I am furious that they think I&#x27;m too old to play the love interest of guys like Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. Why should I play sisters and mothers while guys like Jack and Clint, who are older than me, have on-screen lovers half their age?&quot;

In 2009, Dunaway began shooting a film version of the McNally play &quot;Master Class&quot; as Maria Callas, also starring Al Pacino (as Aristotle Onassis), Val Kilmer, Alan Cumming, her son Liam Dunaway O&#x27;Neill, and lyric soprano Danielle de Niese (the latter two as opera students). As film roles became more difficult to find, Dunaway bought the rights to the play after the 1997 tour, and announced her intention of writing, directing, and starring in the film. The production, however, was a disaster and financing the project was one of the many obstacles. &quot;I want to do it my way. I&#x27;m not going to sell it out to a studio. You have to raise money. You have to get private investors, and it takes a long time to get it right. It takes 10 years. People hear Faye Dunaway and think she has a lot of money, but I don&#x27;t because I&#x27;ve spent a lot. Not tonnes. I spent what I want to spend on this movie and you have to have skin in this game. You have to take risks.&quot; In 2013, she confirmed that she had completed the first half of the film and planned to shoot the rest soon after. However, it was announced in June 2014 that after nearly 20 years of owning the film rights, Dunaway had decided to withdraw from the project.

In 2011, a photo of Dunaway taken by Jerry Schatzberg in 1970 was chosen as the 64th annual Cannes Film Festival poster backdrop. The festival organizers described it as a &quot;Model of sophistication and timeless elegance, it is an embodiment of the cinematic dream that the Festival de Cannes seeks to maintain&quot;. During the festival, Dunaway and Schatzberg appeared at a special screening of &quot;Puzzle of a Downfall Child&quot;, earning a standing ovation upon their entrance. In 2013, Dunaway was the first recipient of the Leopard Club Award and made a rare personal appearance at the Locarno International Film Festival to accept it. In 2014, Dunaway was recognized as the guest of honor by the Lumière Film Festival. Organizers praised the &quot;immense contribution she has made to the emergence of the independent American films of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, and the contribution is of the highest caliber&quot;. Her attendance at the festival was described as an &quot;exceptional event&quot;. Dunaway received a standing ovation by a crowd of 5,000, and declared in an emotional speech following the tribute she received, &quot;My fans and my friends have supported me in this search for all these years, and I thank you from all of my heart, and without you, I would not be the same Faye Dunaway.&quot; In 2014, Dunaway had to pull out of a French drama called &quot;Macadam Stories&quot;, in which she was going to play the lead, due to health issues, and was replaced by Isabelle Huppert. The following year, it was announced that Dunaway was writing a book about her experiences making &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, but the project never materialized.

=== 2016–present: Return to film and theatre ===
In 2016, Dunaway made a rare public appearance at the TCM Classic Film Festival, in which she hosted a screening of &quot;Network&quot; and also joined in conversation with Ben Mankiewicz for a Q&amp;A session in which she discussed her decades-spanning career. Although she stated in a 2013 interview she felt her acting career was &quot;pretty much over&quot;, Dunaway told Mankiewicz she had no intention to retire: &quot;We live for work. We live for what we do. I just want to keep working. It&#x27;s where I&#x27;m happiest.&quot; That same year, she was cast in a supporting role in the second season of &quot;Hand of God,&quot; but was ultimately replaced by Linda Gray due to &quot;some scheduling conflicts and some other issues&quot; according to Ben Watkins, creator of the show. Also in 2016, Dunaway guest-starred as herself in the season-two finale of the mockumentary series &quot;Documentary Now!&quot;. In 2017, Dunaway returned to acting with a cameo role in the horror-thriller &quot;The Bye Bye Man&quot;, a small part in the Christian drama &quot;The Case for Christ&quot;, and a supporting role in the psychological thriller &quot;Inconceivable&quot;, which also starred Nicolas Cage and Gina Gershon. Critic Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found it &quot;distressing that Dunaway can&#x27;t find more dignified projects at this point in her estimable career&quot;.
Also in 2017, Dunaway reunited with her &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; co-star Warren Beatty at the 89th Academy Awards, in celebration of the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary. After being introduced by Jimmy Kimmel, they were given a standing ovation as they walked out onto the stage to present the Best Picture Award. They were given the wrong envelope and Dunaway incorrectly announced &quot;La La Land&quot; as Best Picture, instead of the actual winner, &quot;Moonlight&quot;. This became a social-media sensation, trending all over the world. Dunaway was left &quot;completely stunned&quot; when Oscars crew members came on stage to explain that there had been a mistake and later said she felt &quot;very guilty&quot; about the incident, describing it as &quot;one of the worst moments I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. That same year, Dunaway was honored at the Dallas International Film Festival where she was presented with the Dallas Star Award. In 2018, Dunaway and Beatty returned to present Best Picture at the 90th Academy Awards, earning a standing ovation upon their entrance, making jokes about the previous year&#x27;s flub.

In 2019, more than 30 years since her performance in &quot;The Curse of the Aching Heart&quot;, Dunaway planned to return to Broadway with an updated version of Matthew Lombardo&#x27;s one-woman play &quot;Tea at Five&quot;, which was first performed at Hartford Stage in 2002. She would portray Katharine Hepburn, being particularly drawn to the complexities of the play and the character, saying, &quot;Hepburn was a brilliant actress. Her aura on screen was unique. That, coupled with the wide array of roles she played, made her an inspiration to me and many others. She had a lot of class, too, and the innate ability to project intelligence, both on and off screen. You can&#x27;t help but want to explore that and learn more about her.&quot; The three week try-out in Boston met with critical appreciation. Patti Hartigan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; felt that Dunaway gave a &quot;bravura performance&quot; and wrote that she &quot;inhabits the role and goes beyond mere mimicry. Of course, she captures the Voice – waspy, reedy, patrician – but she also brings a mix of fragility and strength to the role, maintaining the straight spine, but also letting that stiff upper lip quiver ever so slightly when grief overtakes her.&quot; Christopher Caggiano of &quot;The Arts Fuse&quot; gave the play a mixed review, but praised Dunaway, writing that she &quot;does manage to remind us why, despite her relative absence from the stage and the screen in the last 30 years, she remains a Hollywood legend. She has a palpable emotional intensity, and gives you the sense that entire scenes are playing out behind her eyes as part of her backstory. She&#x27;s a legend for a reason.&quot;
&quot;Tea at Five&quot; was pitched to be her triumphant return to Broadway, but following three weeks at the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, Dunaway was released from the play, reportedly due to altercations between crewmembers and her. An assistant fired by Dunaway filed a lawsuit against the actress in August 2019 alleging homophobic verbal harassment.

Dunaway reunited with Kevin Spacey in 2022&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Drew God&quot;, co-starring and directed by Franco Nero. &quot;Faye&quot;, a documentary about Dunaway, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and can be seen on HBO and Max. She was to next appear in the supernatural love story, &quot;Fate&quot;, opposite Harvey Keitel. On October 3, 2024, Dunaway was announced as starring in the coming-of-age supernatural thriller, &quot;The Evilry&quot;.

==Legacy and reputation==

Dunaway is regarded as one of the greatest and most beautiful actresses of her generation, as well as a powerful emblem of the New Hollywood. Director John Huston, who played Dunaway&#x27;s father in &quot;Chinatown&quot;, stated in a 1985 interview that he found her to be &quot;quite extraordinary&quot;. Robert Evans, who produced &quot;Chinatown&quot;, also described her as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, and affirmed that &quot;no one could&#x27;ve played her part as well&quot;. Stephen Rebello of &quot;Movieline&quot; wrote in a 2002 article, &quot;Though fiercely modern, an ideal female analog for screen machos like Steve McQueen and the young Jack Nicholson, she also radiated the stuff vintage movie stars are made of. Any actress today would be lucky to have a fraction of her films on her resume.&quot;

Cannes Film Festival artistic director Thierry Fremaux said, &quot;She has one of the most wonderful filmographies of any actress. Look at her movies from the &#x27;70s for example – she only made good choices. She&#x27;s had an incredible career.&quot; Through her career, Dunaway worked with many of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest directors—Elia Kazan, Sidney Lumet, Arthur Penn, Roman Polanski, Sydney Pollack, and Emir Kusturica among them, and several of the films she starred in became classics. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and &quot;Network&quot; on their list of the 100 best American movies ever made. Her roles as Bonnie Parker and Joan Crawford were respectively named 32nd and 41st on the AFI&#x27;s list of the fifty greatest screen characters in the villain category. Elizabeth Snead wrote in her review for &quot;USA Today&quot; of Dunaway&#x27;s memoirs that she was &quot;the epitome of a modern, mature, sexy woman&quot; and Mark Harris of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;Faye Dunaway is a rarity in the land of stars (and star bios) – a tough, smart, committed pro&quot;. In 1994, Dunaway was ranked 27th by &quot;People&quot; magazine on a list of the 50 most beautiful people and in 1997 she was ranked 65th by &quot;Empire&quot; on a list of the 100 top stars in film history.

Famously demanding, with an attention to detail that sometimes drove costars and directors mad, Dunaway believed that she was often mistaken as being as cold and calculating as some of the women she portrayed. Her clashes with Roman Polanski on the set of &quot;Chinatown&quot; earned her a reputation for being difficult to work with. Upon the release of the film, Polanski told a reporter for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he considered Dunaway &quot;a gigantic pain in the ass&quot;, but added that he had &quot;never known an actress to take work as seriously as she does. I tell you, she is a maniac.&quot; Bette Davis described Dunaway as the worst person she had ever worked with in an interview with Johnny Carson in 1988, calling her &quot;totally impossible&quot;, &quot;uncooperative&quot;, and &quot;very unprofessional&quot;. Dunaway denied Davis&#x27; claims in her autobiography, writing &quot;Watching her, all I could think of was that she seemed like someone caught in a death throe, a final scream against a fate over which no one has control. I was just the target of her blind rage at the one sin Hollywood never forgives in its leading ladies: growing old.&quot;

In his 1996 book &quot;Making Movies&quot;, Sidney Lumet slammed Dunaway&#x27;s reputation for being difficult as &quot;totally untrue&quot;, and called her a &quot;selfless, devoted, and wonderful actress&quot;. Director Elia Kazan described Dunaway as &quot;a supremely endowed, hungry, curious, bright young talent&quot;, and added, &quot;Faye is a brilliant actress and a shy, highly-strung woman. She is intelligent, and she is strong-willed.&quot; Like Lumet, Kazan felt she was not difficult, but a perfectionist who was never satisfied. &quot;The artist is rarely, if ever, satisfied. The artist is frequently grateful and intermittently amazed, but he or she is never satisfied. That Faye is unlikely to be satisfied with her efforts—or those with whom she works—is not a caprice; it is not the willful misbehavior of a spoiled actress: This is how artists operate.&quot; Johnny Depp, who co-starred with Dunaway in &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; and &quot;Don Juan deMarco&quot;, called her a misunderstood artist. &quot;She&#x27;s just uncompromising as an actress, and I think that&#x27;s a positive thing.&quot; Maria Elena Fernandez of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in a 2005 article about Dunaway that &quot;in her case, the behavior many call &#x27;difficult&#x27; seems clearly linked more to passions than to ego&quot;. In her autobiography &quot;Looking for Gatsby&quot;, Dunaway confronted this reputation and described herself as a &quot;perfectionist&quot;:

==Personal life==

In 1962, Dunaway started a romance with stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce that lasted for a year. She was engaged to photographer Jerry Schatzberg from 1967 to 1968. The two remain friends and Dunaway later starred in his directorial debut, &quot;Puzzle of a Downfall Child&quot; (1970). During the filming of &quot;A Place for Lovers&quot; (1968), Dunaway fell in love with her co-star Marcello Mastroianni. The couple had a two-year, live-in relationship. Dunaway wanted to marry and have children, but Mastroianni, still legally married, could not bear to hurt his estranged wife and refused, despite protests from his teenaged daughter Barbara and his close friend Federico Fellini. Dunaway decided to leave him and told a reporter at the time that she &quot;gave too much. I gave things I have to save for my work.&quot; She later recalled in her 1995 autobiography:

Mastroianni told &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1987 that he never got over the breakup. &quot;She was the woman I loved the most,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ll always be sorry to have lost her. I was whole with her for the first time in my life.&quot;

Dunaway dated her &quot;Doc&quot; co-star Harris Yulin from 1970 to 1972. In 1974, she married Peter Wolf, the lead singer of the rock group The J. Geils Band. Their career commitments caused frequent separations and the two divorced in 1979. She met her second husband, British photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill, when he was assigned by &quot;People&quot; magazine to take pictures of Peter Wolf and of her in 1977. They married in 1982 and Dunaway credited O&#x27;Neill with being &quot;the one person responsible for helping me grow up to womanhood and a healthy sense of myself&quot;. Their child, Liam Dunaway O&#x27;Neill, was born in 1980. In 2003, despite Dunaway&#x27;s earlier indications that she had given birth to Liam, Terry O&#x27;Neill revealed that their son was adopted.

After the divorce from O&#x27;Neill in 1987, Dunaway was linked to author Frederick Forsyth. She then had a three-year relationship with Warren Lieberfarb, Home Video president of Warner Bros., before going on to date Hook Herrera, a blues harpist with the band Hook and the Hitchhikers. Her most recent publicized romantic attachment was with French TV host in the mid-1990s. In a rare interview for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 2016, Dunaway said she felt that &quot;it&#x27;s important to have a partner, probably,&quot; but she described herself as &quot;a loner&quot; and added, &quot;I kind of like to be alone and do my work and, you know, be focused on my own things.&quot;

Dunaway is a devout Catholic and has said that she attends morning Mass regularly. She converted in 1996, having been a lifelong Protestant until then.

Dunaway revealed her bipolar disorder diagnosis and history of alcoholism in her 2024 documentary, &quot;Faye&quot;.

<text>Susan Abigail Sarandon (; née Tomalin; born October 4, 1946) is an American actor. She is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award and a British Academy Film Award, in addition to nominations for six Primetime Emmy Awards, and nine Golden Globe Awards.

Sarandon made her film debut in &quot;Joe&quot; (1970) and appeared on the soap operas &quot;A World Apart&quot; (1970–1971) and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1972). She gained prominence for her role in the musical horror film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975). After Oscar nominations for &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1980), &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991), &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), Sarandon won the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing Helen Prejean in &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995). Her other notable films include &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978), &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983), &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987), &quot;Bull Durham&quot; (1988), &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007), &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; (2009), &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Meddler&quot; (2015).

Sarandon made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;An Evening with Richard Nixon&quot; (1972). She returned to Broadway in the 2009 revival of &quot;Exit the King&quot;. On television, she had guest roles on the sitcoms &quot;Friends&quot; (2001) and &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (2002) as well as starring roles as an advocate in the HBO film &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; (2010), Doris Duke in the HBO film &quot;Bernard and Doris&quot; (2008), and Bette Davis in the FX miniseries &quot;Feud&quot; (2017). 

Also known for her social and political activism, Sarandon was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1999 and received the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award in 2006.

==Early life==
Sarandon was born in Jackson Heights, Queens in New York City. She is the eldest of nine children of Lenora Marie (née Criscione 1923–2020) and Phillip Leslie Tomalin, an advertising executive, television producer, and one-time nightclub singer. She has four brothers: Phillip Leslie Jr., Terry (an outdoorsman, journalist, and community leader), Timothy, and O&#x27;Brian (owner of Building 8 Brewery in Northampton, Mass.); and four sisters: Meredith (or &quot;Merry&quot;), Bonnie Priscilla, Amanda, and Melissa (or &quot;Missy&quot;). Her father was of English, Irish, and Welsh ancestry. His English ancestors came from Hackney in London and his Welsh ancestors from Bridgend. On her mother&#x27;s side, she is of Italian descent, with ancestors from the regions of Tuscany and Sicily. Her father worked for WOR-TV in New York City.

When she was four years old, the Tomalin family moved from New York City to the newly developed Stephenville community, located in the northern area of Raritan (now Edison) Township, New Jersey. The family was raised Roman Catholic and she and her sisters attended the all-girls Saint Francis Grammar School in nearby Metuchen, while her brothers attended the all-boys Saint Matthews Grammar School in Edison Township. Her mother was a member and board director of the Stephenville Women&#x27;s Club and the Terra Nova Garden Club. The family was also member to the Woodside Swim Club, a private swimming club and park in the Stephenville community, where Sarandon and her sisters won many swimming competitions. Sarandon graduated from Saint Francis Grammar School in 1960.

Sarandon attended Edison High School, a public school located in Edison Township. In 1962, while still in high school, she joined a band and dance group to entertain sick children at a nearby rehabilitation hospital. As a high school junior, she performed the lead in the play &quot;Lady Precious Stream&quot;. As a senior, she played the title character in the comedy &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, earning mentions in the local newspapers. In 1964, Sarandon was inducted into the National Honor Society.

In May 1964, the Tomalin family moved to the newly developed Chandler Hill community, east of Stephenville in Edison. Sarandon graduated from Edison High School in 1964. She attended the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. from 1964 to 1968, earning a Bachelor of Arts in drama, and studying under the drama coach Gilbert V. Hartke. During and shortly after college, she supported herself by emptying bedpans in a hospital, cutting hair, cleaning houses and working as a switchboard operator.

==Career==

In 1968, Sarandon and her then-husband Chris appeared on stage at the Wayside Theatre in Middletown, Virginia. The following year, the couple went to a casting call for the motion-picture &quot;Joe&quot; (1970). Although he did not get a part, she was cast in a major role of a disaffected teen who disappears into the seedy underworld. Between 1970 and 1972, she appeared in the soap operas &quot;A World Apart&quot; and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, playing Patrice Kahlman and Sarah Fairbanks, respectively. Her career gained momentum in 1974, when she starred in &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald and &#x27;The Last of the Belles&#x27;&quot;, a highly rated made-for-television film, and Billy Wilder&#x27;s screen adaptation of &quot;The Front Page&quot;. In 1975, Sarandon appeared in the cult favorite &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and had the female lead in &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot;, opposite Robert Redford. She was twice directed by Louis Malle, in &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978) and &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1980). The latter earned Sarandon her first Academy Award nomination.

Her most controversial film appearance was in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983), a modern vampire story in which she had a sex scene with Catherine Deneuve. It was the first mainstream American film to feature such a scene between two star actresses. She appeared in the comedy-fantasy &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987) alongside Jack Nicholson, Cher, and Michelle Pfeiffer. However, Sarandon did not become a &quot;household name&quot; until she appeared with Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins in the film &quot;Bull Durham&quot; (1988), a commercial and critical success. Roger Ebert praised Sarandon&#x27;s performance in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, but I doubt if the character would have worked without Sarandon&#x27;s wonderful performance&quot;.

Sarandon was nominated for an Academy Award four more times in the 1990s, as Best Actress as Louise Sawyer in &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991), Michaela Odone in &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992), and Reggie Love in &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), finally winning for &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995) in which she played Sister Helen Prejean who regularly visits a convicted murderer on death row. Janet Maslin, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote of her performance in the last film: &quot;Ms. Sarandon takes the kind of risk she took playing a stubbornly obsessed mother in &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil.&quot; She&#x27;s commandingly blunt, and she avoids cheapening her performance with the wrong kind of compassion. Her Sister Helen is repelled and alarmed by this man, but she&#x27;s determined to help him anyway. That&#x27;s what makes the film so unrelenting.&quot; Sarandon was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award in 1994. Additionally, she has received eight Golden Globe nominations, including for the films &quot;White Palace&quot; (1990), &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; (2002), and &quot;Bernard and Doris&quot; (2007).

Her other movies include &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; (1992), &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996), &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot; (1999), &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999), &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot; (2000), &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (2001), &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot; (2002), &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (2004), &quot;Alfie&quot; (2004), &quot;Romance &amp; Cigarettes&quot; (2005), &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (2005), &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007), and &quot;&quot;Speed Racer&quot;&quot; (2008). Sarandon has appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, once as herself (&quot;Bart Has Two Mommies&quot;) and as a ballet teacher, &quot;Homer vs. Patty and Selma&quot;. She appeared on &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me,&quot; and &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;.

Sarandon has contributed the narration to two dozen documentary films, many of which dealt with social and political issues. In addition, she has served as the presenter on many installments of the PBS documentary series, &quot;Independent Lens&quot;. In 1999 and 2000, she hosted and presented &quot;Mythos&quot;, a series of lectures by the late American mythology professor Joseph Campbell. Sarandon also participates as a member of the Jury for the NYICFF, a local New York City Film Festival dedicated to screening films made for children between the ages of 3 and 18.

Sarandon appeared with an all-star cast in &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; (2009), directed by Peter Jackson, and worked with daughter Eva Amurri in &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; (2008), &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe&quot; (2015). In 2012, Sarandon&#x27;s audiobook performance of Carson McCullers&#x27; &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; was released at Audible.com. She appeared in the films &quot;Arbitrage&quot; (2012), &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2012), &quot;Tammy&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Meddler&quot; (2015). In 2017, Sarandon portrayed Bette Davis in the first season of FX&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Feud&quot;, where she earned her ninth Golden Globe nomination. She also appeared in &quot;A Bad Moms Christmas&quot; (2017)—the sequel to the 2016 film &quot;Bad Moms&quot;—as the mother of Carla Dunkler.

In 2018, she joined the &quot;Social Impact Advisory Board&quot; of the San Diego International Film Festival. In 2019, she connected with Justin Willman on &quot;Magic for Humans&quot; as a special guest on the Christmas episode. In Fall 2022, Sarandon starred in the FOX TV drama &quot;Monarch&quot;. In 2023, she starred in the DC Extended Universe superhero film &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;.

==Political views and activism==

Sarandon is known for her active support of progressive and left-wing political causes, ranging from donations to organizations such as EMILY&#x27;s List to participating in a 1983 delegation to Nicaragua sponsored by MADRE, an organization that promotes &quot;social, environmental, and economic justice&quot;. In 1999, she was appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In that capacity, she has actively supported the organization&#x27;s global advocacy, as well as the work of the Canadian UNICEF Committee. In 2006, she was one of eight women selected to carry in the Olympic flag at the Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Olympic Winter Games, in Turin, Italy. The same year, Sarandon received the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award. Sarandon was appointed an FAO Goodwill Ambassador in 2010. She donated fruit trees to the New York City Housing Authority&#x27;s Jamaica Houses in 2018 in the borough of Queens. Sarandon visited the housing complex in person to help plant the trees. In 2022, she joined as an ambassador to the HALO Trust, a mine clearance organization.

===Anti-war activism===
Sarandon and Robbins both took an early stance against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Sarandon stating that she was firmly against war as a pre-emptive strike. Prior to a 2003 protest sponsored by the United for Peace and Justice coalition, she said that many Americans &quot;do not want to risk their children or the children of Iraq&quot;. Sarandon was one of the first to appear in a series of political ads sponsored by TrueMajority, an organization established by Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Ice Cream founder Ben Cohen. Along with anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Sarandon took part in a 2006 Mother&#x27;s Day protest, which was sponsored by Code Pink. In January 2007, she appeared with Robbins and Jane Fonda at an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. in support of a Congressional measure to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.

===Presidential politics===
During the 2000 election, Sarandon supported Ralph Nader&#x27;s run for president, serving as a co-chair of the National Steering Committee of Nader 2000. During the 2004 election campaign, she withheld support for Nader&#x27;s bid, being among several &quot;Nader Raiders&quot; who urged Nader to drop out and his voters offer their support for Democratic Party candidate John Kerry. After the 2004 election, Sarandon called for US elections to be monitored by international entities.

In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Sarandon and Tim Robbins campaigned for John Edwards in the New Hampshire communities of Hampton, Bedford, and Dover. When asked at We Vote &#x27;08 Kickoff Party &quot;What would Jesus do this primary season&quot;, Sarandon said, &quot;I think Jesus would be very supportive of John Edwards.&quot; She later endorsed Barack Obama.

In the 2012 U.S. presidential election Sarandon, along with film director Michael Moore, said that they were not thrilled with Obama&#x27;s performance but hoped he would be re-elected. She said she and the administration haven&#x27;t been allies. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say the White House has taken me under its wing and made me one of its best buddies,&quot; Sarandon said.

In the 2016 United States presidential election, she made public her support for Senator Bernie Sanders. On March 28, 2016, in an interview on &quot;All In with Chris Hayes&quot;, Sarandon indicated that she and other Sanders supporters might not support Hillary Clinton if Clinton were to be the Democratic nominee for president. She stated: &quot;You know, some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately. If he gets in, then things will really explode.&quot; Hayes inquired as to whether it would be dangerous to allow Trump to become president, to which she replied: &quot;If you think that it&#x27;s pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you&#x27;re not in touch with the status quo&quot;. On October 30, 2016, she endorsed Green Party of the United States presidential candidate Jill Stein.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; published on November 26, 2017, Sarandon said about Hillary Clinton: &quot;I did think she was very, very dangerous. We would still be fracking, we would be at war [if she were president]&quot;.

===Civil rights===
In 1995, Sarandon was one of many Hollywood actors, directors and writers interviewed for the documentary &quot;The Celluloid Closet,&quot; which explores how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality.

Sarandon and Robbins appeared at the 2000 Shadow Convention in Los Angeles to speak about drug offenders being unduly punished. In 2004, she served on the advisory committee for 2004 Racism Watch, an activist group.

Sarandon has become an advocate to end the death penalty and mass incarceration. She has joined the team of people fighting to save the life of Richard Glossip, a man on death row in Oklahoma. In May 2015, Sarandon launched a campaign with fundraising platform Represent.com to sell T-shirts to help finance the documentary &quot;Deep Run&quot;, the story of a poor North Carolina teen undergoing a gender transition.

===Since 2011===
On March 12, 2011, Sarandon spoke before a crowd in Madison, Wisconsin protesting Governor Scott Walker and his Budget Repair Bill. On September 27, 2011, Sarandon spoke to reporters and interested parties at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City. Her use of the word &quot;Nazi&quot; to describe Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2011 generated complaints from Roman Catholic authorities and from the Anti-Defamation League, which called on Sarandon to apologize. Sarandon brought activist Rosa Clemente to the 75th Golden Globe Awards and participated in a rally against gun violence in June 2018.

On June 28, 2018, Sarandon was arrested during the Women Disobey protests, along with 575 other people, for protesting at the Hart Senate Office Building where a sit-in was being held against Donald Trump&#x27;s migrant separation policy.

On May 27, 2021, Sarandon tweeted in support of the Palestinian people, in her words, &quot;fighting against the apartheid government of Netanyahu&quot;, and of the Israeli people &quot;that they too, will enjoy peace&quot;. She expressed support for Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid &quot;for having the bravery to stand in solidarity with her people&quot;. She also co-signed an open letter criticizing Israel for labeling six Palestinian human rights groups as terror organizations, and quoted Desmond Tutu on the conflict saying that &quot;true peace can ultimately be built only on justice&quot;. Sarandon was the executive producer for &quot;Soufra&quot;, a documentary that covered the development of a food truck in the Bourj el Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon.

In February 2022, some law enforcement organizations criticized Sarandon for sharing a tweet that described a photo of police officers honoring a killed officer as fascism. She later deleted the tweet and posted a message on Twitter to apologize.

====Israel–Gaza war====
In November 2023, Sarandon spoke out against the Israeli government&#x27;s actions during the Gaza war. At a pro-Palestinian rally in Union Square on November 17, Sarandon said: &quot;There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.&quot; Four days later, she was dropped as a client by United Talent Agency. On December 1, Sarandon issued an apology for the phrasing of her comment, saying that &quot;it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true&quot;.

==Personal life==
While in college, she met fellow student Chris Sarandon; they married on September 16, 1967. They announced a trial separation in 1975 and divorced in 1979, but she retained his surname. From 1977 until 1980, Sarandon had a live-in relationship with director Louis Malle, after which she was sporadically involved with musician David Bowie and, briefly, actor Sean Penn.

In the mid-1980s, Sarandon dated Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri, with whom she had a daughter, Eva Amurri (born March 15, 1985). They met on the set of &quot;Tempest&quot; in 1981, but didn&#x27;t get together until she returned to Italy to shoot &quot;Mussolini and I&quot; three years later. In 2017, Sarandon revealed that she had had an affair with British actor Philip Sayer, who she further revealed had been gay.

Beginning in 1988, Sarandon lived with actor Tim Robbins, whom she met while they were filming &quot;Bull Durham&quot;. They have two sons: John &quot;Jack&quot; Henry (born May 15, 1989) and Miles (born May 4, 1992). Sarandon, like Robbins, is a lapsed Catholic, and they share liberal political views. They broke up in 2009.

Following the end of her relationship with Robbins, Sarandon soon began a new one with Jonathan Bricklin, son of Malcolm Bricklin. They helped establish a chain of table tennis lounges named SPiN. Sarandon is the co-owner of its New York and Toronto locations. Sarandon and Bricklin broke up in 2015.

In 2006, Sarandon and ten relatives, including her son Miles, traveled to the United Kingdom to trace her family&#x27;s Welsh genealogy. Their journey was documented by the BBC Wales programme, &quot;Coming Home: Susan Sarandon&quot;. Much of the same research and content was featured in the American version of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; She also received the Ragusani Nel Mondo prize in 2006; her Sicilian roots are in Ragusa, Italy.

Sarandon is bisexual, seemingly coming out during a September 2022 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. She also previously told &quot;Pride Source&quot; in 2017 that her sexuality was &quot;open&quot; and &quot;up for grabs&quot;, and on a 2021 episode of the &quot;Divorced Not Dead&quot; podcast said of her dating interests, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a man or a woman. I mean, I&#x27;m open to all age, all color. And those for me, those things are just details.&quot;

Sarandon received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Stockholm International Film Festival, was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2010, and received the Outstanding Artistic Life Award for her Outstanding Contribution to World Cinema at the 2011 Shanghai International Film Festival.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1957 was the second edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (HR) on behalf of ARD, the contest, originally known as the  () was held on Sunday 3 March 1957 and was hosted at the in Frankfurt, West Germany by German actress Anaid Iplicjian.

Ten countries took part, with , , and the competing for the first time and joining the original seven participating countries from the first contest in . A number of changes to the rules from the previous year&#x27;s event were enacted, with each country now represented by only one song, which could be performed by up to two performers on stage. The voting system received an overhaul, with each country&#x27;s jury now comprising ten individuals which awarded one vote each to their favourite song. The results of the voting were now conducted in public, with a scoreboard introduced to allow the process to be followed by viewers and listeners at home. Jurors were also for the first time not allowed to vote for the song from their own country.

The winner of the contest was the , with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Corry Brokken. This was Brokken&#x27;s second appearance as a participant, after previously representing the Netherlands in 1956; her victory marked the first of five Dutch wins in the contest .

==Location==

The 1957 contest took place in Frankfurt, West Germany. The selected venue was the , a music hall and former broadcasting studio located in the Dornbusch district, and part of the wider Broadcasting House Dornbusch which serves as the headquarters and main broadcasting facility of the German public broadcaster for the state of Hesse, (HR). The contest was held in front of an audience of around 400 people.

A new plan for staging the event was invoked ahead of the 1957 contest, with a different broadcaster organising the contest each year, after Switzerland&#x27;s SRG SSR, which had both hosted the contest and provided the winning entry in , declined to stage it for a second time. Germany was subsequently selected to host the second edition, after Hans-Otto Grünefeldt, TV program director at HR, offered to organise it on behalf of ARD. Frankfurt was selected as host city as early as June 1956 during an EBU meeting in Italy.

==Participating countries==

Ten countries participated in the 1957 contest, with the seven countries which took part in the first contest being joined by , and the in their first appearances. Austria and Denmark had originally planned to compete in 1956, but missed the cut-off date for entry.

Two of the participating artists, Switzerland&#x27;s Lys Assia and the Netherlands&#x27; Corry Brokken, had previously competed at the 1956 contest. Brokken was one of the two Dutch participants in that year&#x27;s contest, competing with the song &quot;, while Assia had performed both of Switzerland&#x27;s entries, &quot; and &quot;&quot;, the latter of which had won the contest.


==Format==
The contest was organised and broadcast by HR on behalf of ARD, with Michael Kehlmann serving as director and Willy Berking serving as musical director, leading the during the event. Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.

The stage built in the featured a wooden staircase for the artists and conductors to make their entrance, and a lyre-shaped background for the singers, which should symbolize the history of popular songs since the Middle Ages. The centre of the background contained a removable background, allowing for a different graphic to be used for each nation&#x27;s performance. The background of the orchestra featured photographs from different European landmarks, such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Colosseum and the Arc de Triomphe. Curtains were used extensively as backgrounds and decorative elements. The entire contest, including the performances and voting, lasted around one hour in total. Held just over nine months after the inaugural contest, the contest date of 3 March remains the earliest date in the calendar year in which the contest has been held.

A number of changes from the rules of the previous year&#x27;s contest were enacted in 1957. Each country was now permitted to send only one song to compete, as opposed to the maximum of two in 1956. Up to two people were now allowed on stage during the performance, however no other vocal backing was allowed.

A new voting system was introduced, with ten individuals in each country giving one vote to their favourite song, with no abstentions allowed. In an additional change to the 1956 rules, jurors were not allowed to vote for the song from their own country. A scoreboard was introduced for the first time, and the voting process was now included as part of the broadcast, rather than conducted in secret as in 1956. This new aspect of the contest was inspired by the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs&quot;, which included voting by regional juries and the points received shown on a scoreboard, a telerecording of which was viewed by EBU organisers. Each jury assembled in their own country to follow the contest on television and were then contacted by telephone by the contest&#x27;s presenter in order to receive their votes, in a change from 1956 when the jurors were co-located to the contest venue.

Each song, as in 1956, was required to last no longer than three minutes and 30 seconds, however several of the competing entries went beyond this limit. Italy&#x27;s song, which lasted for five minutes and nine seconds, remains the longest song in the contest&#x27;s history and, despite heavy protest, was not disqualified. Conversely, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first entry lasted for one minute and 53 seconds in total, and remained the shortest song to compete in the contest until . Subsequently the restriction on song length was more strictly monitored from onwards.

The draw that determined the running order was held on 2 March 1957.

== Contest overview ==

The contest was held on 3 March 1957 at 21:00 (CET) and lasted 1 hour. The event was hosted by German actress Anaid Iplicjian.

The winner was the represented by the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Guus Jansen, written by Willy van Hemert and performed by Corry Brokken. Notable among this year&#x27;s participants were Denmark&#x27;s Birthe Wilke and Gustav Winckler, the first duo to compete in the contest, who made an impact with a passionate on-screen kiss at the end of their performance; and Germany&#x27;s Margot Hielscher, the first Eurovision act to use a prop during their performance, in this instance a telephone.

An award was presented to the winning composer for the first time, taking the form of a medallion, which was awarded at the end of the broadcast by , director of . The medallion had been commissioned by Deutsches Fernsehen and designed by sculptor . It featured the Eurovision logo and the words &quot;Grand Prix 1957&quot; on one side, and the mythological figure Europa on a bull on the other side.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1957 contest are listed below.

== Detailed voting results ==

The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to the order in which each country performed.
== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. In total, the contest was broadcast in 12 countries. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

The 1957 contest is the earliest edition to exist in full in the EBU&#x27;s archives, as the 1956 edition has survived solely through audio recordings, with some missing segments, and limited video footage of the winning reprise performance through newsreel and other recordings. Although the number of households which had access to a television in Europe continued to grow, this edition, as in the case of the 1956 contest, was still mainly accessed by spectators via radio. Contemporary reports estimated that about eight million viewers had watched the show.

<doc id="68326" wikidata="Q428887" url="?curid=68326" title="Extended periodic table">
<text>An extended periodic table theorizes about chemical elements beyond those currently known and proven. The element with the highest atomic number known is oganesson (&quot;Z&quot; = 118), which completes the seventh period (row) in the periodic table. All elements in the eighth period and beyond thus remain purely hypothetical.

Elements beyond 118 will be placed in additional periods when discovered, laid out (as with the existing periods) to illustrate periodically recurring trends in the properties of the elements. Any additional periods are expected to contain more elements than the seventh period, as they are calculated to have an additional so-called &quot;g-block&quot;, containing at least 18 elements with partially filled g-orbitals in each period. An &quot;eight-period table&quot; containing this block was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the systematic name unbiunium. Despite many searches, no elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature.

According to the orbital approximation in quantum mechanical descriptions of atomic structure, the g-block would correspond to elements with partially filled g-orbitals, but spin–orbit coupling effects reduce the validity of the orbital approximation substantially for elements of high atomic number. Seaborg&#x27;s version of the extended period had the heavier elements following the pattern set by lighter elements, as it did not take into account relativistic effects. Models that take relativistic effects into account predict that the pattern will be broken. Pekka Pyykkö and Burkhard Fricke used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to &quot;Z&quot; = 172, and found that several were displaced from the Madelung rule. As a result of uncertainty and variability in predictions of chemical and physical properties of elements beyond 120, there is currently no consensus on their placement in the extended periodic table.

Elements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay and undergo alpha decay or spontaneous fission with extremely short half-lives, though element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant to fission but not to alpha decay. Other islands of stability beyond the known elements may also be possible, including one theorised around element 164, though the extent of stabilizing effects from closed nuclear shells is uncertain. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10−14 seconds (0.01 picoseconds, or 10 femtoseconds), which is the time it takes for the nucleus to form an electron cloud.

As early as 1940, it was noted that a simplistic interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 1/α ≈ 137, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond element 137, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals therefore breaks down at this point. On the other hand, a more rigorous analysis calculates the analogous limit to be &quot;Z&quot; ≈ 168–172 where the 1s subshell dives into the Dirac sea, and that it is instead not neutral atoms that cannot exist beyond this point, but bare nuclei, thus posing no obstacle to the further extension of the periodic system. Atoms beyond this critical atomic number are called &quot;supercritical&quot; atoms.

==History==
Elements beyond the actinides were first proposed to exist as early as 1895, when Danish chemist Hans Peter Jørgen Julius Thomsen predicted that thorium and uranium formed part of a 32-element period which would end at a chemically inactive element with atomic weight 292 (not far from the 294 for the only known isotope of oganesson). In 1913, Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg similarly predicted that the next noble gas after radon would have atomic number 118, and purely formally derived even heavier congeners of radon at &quot;Z&quot; = 168, 218, 290, 362, and 460, exactly where the Aufbau principle would predict them to be. In 1922, Niels Bohr predicted the electronic structure of this next noble gas at &quot;Z&quot; = 118, and suggested that the reason why elements beyond uranium were not seen in nature was because they were too unstable. The German physicist and engineer Richard Swinne published a review paper in 1926 containing predictions on the transuranic elements (he may have coined the term) in which he anticipated modern predictions of an island of stability: he first hypothesised in 1914 that half-lives should not decrease strictly with atomic number, but suggested instead that there might be some longer-lived elements at &quot;Z&quot; = 98–102 and &quot;Z&quot; = 108–110, and speculated that such elements might exist in the Earth&#x27;s core, in iron meteorites, or in the ice caps of Greenland where they had been locked up from their supposed cosmic origin. By 1955, these elements were called &quot;superheavy&quot; elements.

The first predictions on properties of undiscovered superheavy elements were made in 1957, when the concept of nuclear shells was first explored and an island of stability was theorized to exist around element 126. In 1967, more rigorous calculations were performed, and the island of stability was theorized to be centered at the then-undiscovered flerovium (element 114); this and other subsequent studies motivated many researchers to search for superheavy elements in nature or attempt to synthesize them at accelerators. Many searches for superheavy elements were conducted in the 1970s, all with negative results. , synthesis has been attempted for every element up to and including unbiseptium (&quot;Z&quot; = 127), except unbitrium (&quot;Z&quot; = 123), with the heaviest successfully synthesized element being oganesson in 2002 and the most recent discovery being that of tennessine in 2010.

As some superheavy elements were predicted to lie beyond the seven-period periodic table, an additional eighth period containing these elements was first proposed by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. This model continued the pattern in established elements and introduced a new g-block and superactinide series beginning at element 121, raising the number of elements in period 8 compared to known periods. These early calculations failed to consider relativistic effects that break down periodic trends and render simple extrapolation impossible, however. In 1971, Fricke calculated the periodic table up to &quot;Z&quot; = 172, and discovered that some elements indeed had different properties that break the established pattern, and a 2010 calculation by Pekka Pyykkö also noted that several elements might behave differently than expected. It is unknown how far the periodic table might extend beyond the known 118 elements, as heavier elements are predicted to be increasingly unstable. Glenn T. Seaborg suggested that practically speaking, the end of the periodic table might come as early as around &quot;Z&quot; = 120 due to nuclear instability.

==Predicted structures of an extended periodic table==
There is currently no consensus on the placement of elements beyond atomic number 120 in the periodic table.

All hypothetical elements are given an International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) systematic element name, for use until the element has been discovered, confirmed, and an official name is approved. These names are typically not used in the literature, and the elements are instead referred to by their atomic numbers; hence, element 164 is usually not called &quot;unhexquadium&quot; or &quot;Uhq&quot; (the systematic name and symbol), but rather &quot;element 164&quot; with symbol &quot;164&quot;, &quot;(164)&quot;, or &quot;E164&quot;.

===Aufbau principle===
At element 118, the orbitals 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 5f, 6s, 6p, 6d, 7s and 7p are assumed to be filled, with the remaining orbitals unfilled. A simple extrapolation from the Aufbau principle would predict the eighth row to fill orbitals in the order 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, 8p; but after element 120, the proximity of the electron shells makes placement in a simple table problematic.
===Fricke===
Not all models show the higher elements following the pattern established by lighter elements. Burkhard Fricke et al., who carried out calculations up to element 184 in an article published in 1971, also found some elements to be displaced from the Madelung energy-ordering rule as a result of overlapping orbitals; this is caused by the increasing role of relativistic effects in heavy elements (They describe chemical properties up to element 184, but only draw a table to element 172.)
Fricke et al.&#x27;s format is more focused on formal electron configurations than likely chemical behaviour. They place elements 156–164 in groups 4–12 because formally their configurations should be 7d2 through 7d10. However, they differ from the previous d-elements in that the 8s shell is not available for chemical bonding: instead, the 9s shell is. Thus element 164 with 7d109s0 is noted by Fricke et al. to be analogous to palladium with 4d105s0, and they consider elements 157–172 to have chemical analogies to groups 3–18 (though they are ambivalent on whether elements 165 and 166 are more like group 1 and 2 elements or more like group 11 and 12 elements, respectively). Thus, elements 157–164 are placed in their table in a group that the authors do not think is chemically most analogous.

===Nefedov===
, Trzhaskovskaya, and Yarzhemskii carried out calculations up to 164 (results published in 2006). They considered elements 158 through 164 to be homologues of groups 4 through 10, and not 6 through 12, noting similarities of electron configurations to the period 5 transition metals (e.g. element 159 7d49s1 vs Nb 4d45s1, element 160 7d59s1 vs Mo 4d55s1, element 162 7d79s1 vs Ru 4d75s1, element 163 7d89s1 vs Rh 4d85s1, element 164 7d109s0 vs Pd 4d105s0). They thus agree with Fricke et al. on the chemically most analogous groups, but differ from them in that Nefedov et al. actually place elements in the chemically most analogous groups. Rg and Cn are given an asterisk to reflect differing configurations from Au and Hg (in the original publication they are drawn as being displaced in the third dimension). In fact Cn probably has an analogous configuration to Hg, and the difference in configuration between Pt and Ds is not marked.
===Pyykkö===
Pekka Pyykkö used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to &quot;Z&quot; = 172 and their possible chemical properties in an article published in 2011. He reproduced the orbital order of Fricke et al., and proposed a refinement of their table by formally assigning slots to elements 121–164 based on ionic configurations.

In order to bookkeep the electrons, Pyykkö places some elements out of order: thus 139 and 140 are placed in groups 13 and 14 to reflect that the 8p1/2 shell needs to fill, and he distinguishes separate , 8p1/2, and 6f series. Fricke et al. and Nefedov et al. do not attempt to break up these series.

===Kulsha===
Computational chemist Andrey Kulsha has suggested two forms of the extended periodic table up to 172 that build on and refine Nefedov et al.&#x27;s versions up to 164 with reference to Pyykkö&#x27;s calculations. Based on their likely chemical properties, elements 157–172 are placed by both forms as eighth-period congeners of yttrium through xenon in the fifth period; this extends Nefedov et al.&#x27;s placement of 157–164 under yttrium through palladium, and agrees with the chemical analogies given by Fricke et al.

Kulsha suggested two ways to deal with elements 121–156, that lack precise analogues among earlier elements. In his first form (2011, after Pyykkö&#x27;s paper was published), elements 121–138 and 139–156 are placed as two separate rows (together called &quot;ultransition elements&quot;), related by the addition of a 5g18 subshell into the core, as according to Pyykkö&#x27;s calculations of oxidation states, they should, respectively, mimic lanthanides and actinides. In his second suggestion (2016), elements 121–142 form a g-block (as they have 5g activity), while elements 143–156 form an f-block placed under actinium through nobelium.
Thus, period 8 emerges with 54 elements, and the next noble element after 118 is 172.

===Smits et al.===
In 2023 Smits, Düllmann, Indelicato, Nazarewicz, and Schwerdtfeger made another attempt to place elements from 119 to 170 in the periodic table based on their electron configurations. The configurations of a few elements (121–124 and 168) did not allow them to be placed unambiguously. Element 145 appears twice, some places have double occupancy, and others are empty.

==Searches for undiscovered elements==
===Synthesis attempts===
Attempts have been made to synthesise the period 8 elements up to unbiseptium, except unbitrium. All such attempts have been unsuccessful. An attempt to synthesise ununennium, the first period 8 element, is ongoing .

==== Ununennium (E119) ====

The synthesis of element 119 (ununennium) was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California:

: + → 119* → no atoms

No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting cross section of 300 nb. Later calculations suggest that the cross section of the 3n reaction (which would result in 119 and three neutrons as products) would actually be six hundred thousand times lower than this upper bound, at 0.5 pb.

From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 119 and 119 was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Based on the theoretically predicted cross section, it was expected that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment. Moreover, as berkelium-249 decays to californium-249 (the next element) with a short half-life of 327 days, this allowed elements 119 and 120 to be searched for simultaneously.

: + → 119* → no atoms

The experiment was originally planned to continue to November 2012, but was stopped early to make use of the Bk target to confirm the synthesis of tennessine (thus changing the projectiles to Ca). This reaction of Bk + Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for formation of element 119, as it is rather asymmetrical, though also somewhat cold. (Es + Ca would be superior, but preparing milligram quantities of Es for a target is difficult.) Nevertheless, the necessary change from the &quot;silver bullet&quot; Ca to Ti divides the expected yield of element 119 by about twenty, as the yield is strongly dependent on the asymmetry of the fusion reaction.

Due to the predicted short half-lives, the GSI team used new &quot;fast&quot; electronics capable of registering decay events within microseconds. No atoms of element 119 were identified, implying a limiting cross section of 70 fb. The predicted actual cross section is around 40 fb, which is at the limits of current technology.

The team at RIKEN in Wakō, Japan began bombarding curium-248 targets with a vanadium-51 beam in January 2018 to search for element 119. Curium was chosen as a target, rather than heavier berkelium or californium, as these heavier targets are difficult to prepare. The Cm targets were provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. RIKEN developed a high-intensity vanadium beam. The experiment began at a cyclotron while RIKEN upgraded its linear accelerators; the upgrade was completed in 2020. Bombardment may be continued with both machines until the first event is observed; the experiment is currently running intermittently for at least 100 days a year. The RIKEN team&#x27;s efforts are being financed by the Emperor of Japan. The team at the JINR plans to attempt synthesis of element 119 in the future, probably via the Am + Cr reaction, but a precise timeframe has not been publicly released.

==== Unbinilium (E120) ====
Following their success in obtaining oganesson by the reaction between 249Cf and 48Ca in 2006, the team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna started similar experiments in March–April 2007, in hope of creating element 120 (unbinilium) from nuclei of 58Fe and 244Pu. Isotopes of unbinilium are predicted to have alpha decay half-lives of the order of microseconds. Initial analysis revealed that no atoms of element 120 were produced, providing a limit of 400 fb for the cross section at the energy studied.

: + → 302120* → no atoms

The Russian team planned to upgrade their facilities before attempting the reaction again.

In April 2007, the team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, attempted to create element 120 using uranium-238 and nickel-64:

: + → 302120* → no atoms

No atoms were detected, providing a limit of 1.6 pb for the cross section at the energy provided. The GSI repeated the experiment with higher sensitivity in three separate runs in April–May 2007, January–March 2008, and September–October 2008, all with negative results, reaching a cross section limit of 90 fb.

In June–July 2010, and again in 2011, after upgrading their equipment to allow the use of more radioactive targets, scientists at the GSI attempted the more asymmetrical fusion reaction:

: + → 302120 → no atoms

It was expected that the change in reaction would quintuple the probability of synthesizing element 120, as the yield of such reactions is strongly dependent on their asymmetry. Three correlated signals were observed that matched the predicted alpha decay energies of 299120 and its daughter 295Og, as well as the experimentally known decay energy of its granddaughter 291Lv. However, the lifetimes of these possible decays were much longer than expected, and the results could not be confirmed.

In August–October 2011, a different team at the GSI using the TASCA facility tried a new, even more asymmetrical reaction:

: + → 299120* → no atoms

This was also tried unsuccessfully the next year during the aforementioned attempt to make element 119 in the 249Bk+50Ti reaction, as 249Bk decays to 249Cf. Because of its asymmetry, the reaction between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 200 fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum cross-section for producing element 120 by any of these reactions to be around 0.1 fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30 fb for the reaction 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum cross-section of 20 fb for producing the neighbouring element 119. If these predictions are accurate, then synthesizing element 119 would be at the limits of current technology, and synthesizing element 120 would require new methods.

In May 2021, the JINR announced plans to investigate the 249Cf+50Ti reaction in their new facility. However, the 249Cf target would have had to be made by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, collaboration between the JINR and other institutes completely ceased due to sanctions. Consequently, the JINR now plans to try the 248Cm+54Cr reaction instead. A preparatory experiment for the use of 54Cr projectiles was conducted in late 2023, successfully synthesising 288Lv in the 238U+54Cr reaction, and the hope is for experiments to synthesise element 120 to begin by 2025.

Starting from 2022, plans have also been made to use 88-inch cyclotron in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California, United States to attempt to make new elements using 50Ti projectiles. First, the 244Pu+50Ti reaction was tested, successfully creating two atoms of 290Lv in 2024. Since this was successful, an attempt to make element 120 in the 249Cf+50Ti reaction is planned to begin in 2025. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), which previously collaborated with the JINR, will collaborate with the LBNL on this project.

==== Unbiunium (E121) ====
The synthesis of element 121 (unbiunium) was first attempted in 1977 by bombarding a target of uranium-238 with copper-65 ions at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany:
: + → 303121* → no atoms
No atoms were identified.

==== Unbibium (E122) ====
The first attempts to synthesize element 122 (unbibium) were performed in 1972 by Flerov et al. at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), using the heavy-ion induced hot fusion reactions:

: + → 304, 306122* → no atoms

These experiments were motivated by early predictions on the existence of an island of stability at &quot;N&quot; = 184 and &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 120. No atoms were detected and a yield limit of 5 nb (5,000 pb) was measured. Current results (see flerovium) have shown that the sensitivity of these experiments were too low by at least 3 orders of magnitude.

In 2000, the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research performed a very similar experiment with much higher sensitivity:

: + → 308122* → no atoms

These results indicate that the synthesis of such heavier elements remains a significant challenge and further improvements of beam intensity and experimental efficiency is required. The sensitivity should be increased to 1 fb in the future for better quality results.

Another unsuccessful attempt to synthesize element 122 was carried out in 1978 at the GSI Helmholtz Center, where a natural erbium target was bombarded with xenon-136 ions:

: + → 298, 300, 302, 303, 304, 306122* → no atoms

In particular, the reaction between 170Er and 136Xe was expected to yield alpha-emitters with half-lives of microseconds that would decay down to isotopes of flerovium with half-lives perhaps increasing up to several hours, as flerovium is predicted to lie near the center of the island of stability. After twelve hours of irradiation, nothing was found in this reaction. Following a similar unsuccessful attempt to synthesize element 121 from 238U and 65Cu, it was concluded that half-lives of superheavy nuclei must be less than one microsecond or the cross sections are very small. More recent research into synthesis of superheavy elements suggests that both conclusions are true. The two attempts in the 1970s to synthesize element 122 were both propelled by the research investigating whether superheavy elements could potentially be naturally occurring.

Several experiments studying the fission characteristics of various superheavy compound nuclei such as 306122* were performed between 2000 and 2004 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions. Two nuclear reactions were used, namely 248Cm + 58Fe and 242Pu + 64Ni. The results reveal how superheavy nuclei fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (&quot;Z&quot; = 50, &quot;N&quot; = 82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, suggesting a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.

==== Unbiquadium (E124) ====

Scientists at GANIL (Grand Accélérateur National d&#x27;Ions Lourds) attempted to measure the direct and delayed fission of compound nuclei of elements with &quot;Z&quot; = 114, 120, and 124 in order to probe shell effects in this region and to pinpoint the next spherical proton shell. This is because having complete nuclear shells (or, equivalently, having a magic number of protons or neutrons) would confer more stability on the nuclei of such superheavy elements, thus moving closer to the island of stability. In 2006, with full results published in 2008, the team provided results from a reaction involving the bombardment of a natural germanium target with uranium ions:

: + → 308, 310, 311, 312, 314124* → &quot;fission&quot;

The team reported that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives &gt; 10−18 s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at &quot;Z&quot; = 124 and points to the next proton shell at &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 120, not at &quot;Z&quot; = 114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10−14 s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes a nuclide, and this number is used by IUPAC as the minimum half-life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124.

The fission of the compound nucleus 312124 was also studied in 2006 at the tandem ALPI heavy-ion accelerator at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (Legnaro National Laboratories) in Italy:

: + → 312124* → &quot;fission&quot;

Similarly to previous experiments conducted at the JINR (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research), fission fragments clustered around doubly magic nuclei such as 132Sn (&quot;Z&quot; = 50, &quot;N&quot; = 82), revealing a tendency for superheavy nuclei to expel such doubly magic nuclei in fission. The average number of neutrons per fission from the 312124 compound nucleus (relative to lighter systems) was also found to increase, confirming that the trend of heavier nuclei emitting more neutrons during fission continues into the superheavy mass region.

==== Unbipentium (E125) ====
The first and only attempt to synthesize element 125 (unbipentium) was conducted in Dubna in 19701971 using zinc ions and an americium-243 target:

: + → 309, 311125* → no atoms

No atoms were detected, and a cross section limit of 5 nb was determined. This experiment was motivated by the possibility of greater stability for nuclei around &quot;Z&quot; ~ 126 and &quot;N&quot; ~ 184, though more recent research suggests the island of stability may instead lie at a lower atomic number (such as copernicium, &quot;Z&quot; = 112), and the synthesis of heavier elements such as element 125 will require more sensitive experiments.

==== Unbihexium (E126) ====

The first and only attempt to synthesize element 126 (unbihexium), which was unsuccessful, was performed in 1971 at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) by René Bimbot and John M. Alexander using the hot fusion reaction:

: + → 316126* → no atoms

High-energy (13–15 MeV) alpha particles were observed and taken as possible evidence for the synthesis of element 126. Subsequent unsuccessful experiments with higher sensitivity suggest that the 10 mb sensitivity of this experiment was too low; hence, the formation of element 126 nuclei in this reaction is highly unlikely.

==== Unbiseptium (E127) ====
The first and only attempt to synthesize element 127 (unbiseptium), which was unsuccessful, was performed in 1978 at the UNILAC accelerator at the GSI Helmholtz Center, where a natural tantalum target was bombarded with xenon-136 ions:

: + → 316, 317127* → no atoms

===Searches in nature===
A study in 1976 by a group of American researchers from several universities proposed that primordial superheavy elements, mainly livermorium, elements 124, 126, and 127, could be a cause of unexplained radiation damage (particularly radiohalos) in minerals. This prompted many researchers to search for them in nature from 1976 to 1983. A group led by Tom Cahill, a professor at the University of California at Davis, claimed in 1976 that they had detected alpha particles and X-rays with the right energies to cause the damage observed, supporting the presence of these elements. In particular, the presence of long-lived (on the order of 109 years) nuclei of elements 124 and 126, along with their decay products, at an abundance of 10−11 relative to their possible congeners uranium and plutonium, was conjectured. Others claimed that none had been detected, and questioned the proposed characteristics of primordial superheavy nuclei. In particular, they cited that any such superheavy nuclei must have a closed neutron shell at &quot;N&quot; = 184 or &quot;N&quot; = 228, and this necessary condition for enhanced stability only exists in neutron deficient isotopes of livermorium or neutron rich isotopes of the other elements that would not be beta-stable unlike most naturally occurring isotopes. This activity was also proposed to be caused by nuclear transmutations in natural cerium, raising further ambiguity upon this claimed observation of superheavy elements.

On April 24, 2008, a group led by Amnon Marinov at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem claimed to have found single atoms of 292122 in naturally occurring thorium deposits at an abundance of between 10−11 and 10−12 relative to thorium. The claim of Marinov et al. was criticized by a part of the scientific community. Marinov claimed that he had submitted the article to the journals &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Nature Physics&quot; but both turned it down without sending it for peer review. The 292122 atoms were claimed to be superdeformed or hyperdeformed isomers, with a half-life of at least 100 million years.

A criticism of the technique, previously used in purportedly identifying lighter thorium isotopes by mass spectrometry, was published in &quot;Physical Review C&quot; in 2008. A rebuttal by the Marinov group was published in &quot;Physical Review C&quot; after the published comment.

A repeat of the thorium experiment using the superior method of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) failed to confirm the results, despite a 100-fold better sensitivity. This result throws considerable doubt on the results of the Marinov collaboration with regard to their claims of long-lived isotopes of thorium, roentgenium and element 122. It is still possible that traces of unbibium might only exist in some thorium samples, although this is unlikely.

The possible extent of primordial superheavy elements on Earth today is uncertain. Even if they are confirmed to have caused the radiation damage long ago, they might now have decayed to mere traces, or even be completely gone. It is also uncertain if such superheavy nuclei may be produced naturally at all, as spontaneous fission is expected to terminate the r-process responsible for heavy element formation between mass number 270 and 290, well before elements beyond 120 may be formed.

A recent hypothesis tries to explain the spectrum of Przybylski&#x27;s Star by naturally occurring flerovium and element 120.

==Predicted properties of eighth-period elements==
Element 118, oganesson, is the heaviest element that has been synthesized. The next two elements, elements 119 and 120, should form an 8s series and be an alkali and alkaline earth metal, respectively. Beyond element 120, the superactinide series is expected to begin, when the 8s electrons and the filling of the 8p1/2, 7d3/2, 6f, and 5g subshells determine the chemistry of these elements. Complete and accurate CCSD calculations are not available for elements beyond 122 because of the extreme complexity of the situation: the 5g, 6f, and 7d orbitals should have about the same energy level, and in the region of element 160, the 9s, 8p3/2, and 9p1/2 orbitals should also be about equal in energy. This will cause the electron shells to mix so that the block concept no longer applies very well, and will also result in novel chemical properties that will make positioning some of these elements in a periodic table very difficult.

===Chemical and physical properties===

====Elements 119 and 120====
:

The first two elements of period 8 will be ununennium and unbinilium, elements 119 and 120. Their electron configurations should have the 8s orbital being filled. This orbital is relativistically stabilized and contracted; thus, elements 119 and 120 should be more like rubidium and strontium than their immediate neighbours above, francium and radium. Another effect of the relativistic contraction of the 8s orbital is that the atomic radii of these two elements should be about the same as those of francium and radium. They should behave like normal alkali and alkaline earth metals (albeit less reactive than their immediate vertical neighbours), normally forming +1 and +2 oxidation states, respectively, but the relativistic destabilization of the 7p3/2 subshell and the relatively low ionization energies of the 7p3/2 electrons should make higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 (respectively) possible as well.

====Superactinides====
The superactinides may range from elements 121 through 157, which can be classified as the 5g and 6f elements of the eighth period, together with the first 7d element. In the superactinide series, the 7d, 8p, 6f and 5g shells should all fill simultaneously. This creates very complicated situations, so much so that complete and accurate CCSD calculations have been done only for elements 121 and 122. The first superactinide, unbiunium or eka-actinium (element 121), should be similar to lanthanum and actinium: its main oxidation state should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells&#x27; energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just as in elements 119 and 120. Relativistic stabilization of the 8p subshell should result in a ground-state 8s8p valence electron configuration for element 121, in contrast to the ds configurations of lanthanum and actinium; nevertheless, this anomalous configuration does not appear to affect its calculated chemistry, which remains similar to that of actinium. Its first ionization energy is predicted to be 429.4 kJ/mol, which would be lower than those of all known elements except for the alkali metals potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium: this value is even lower than that of the period 8 alkali metal ununennium (463.1 kJ/mol). Similarly, the next superactinide, unbibium or eka-thorium (element 122), may be similar to cerium and thorium, with a main oxidation state of +4, but would have a ground-state 7d8s8p or 8s8p valence electron configuration, unlike thorium&#x27;s 6d7s configuration. Hence, its first ionization energy would be smaller than thorium&#x27;s (Th: 6.3 eV; element 122: 5.6 eV) because of the greater ease of ionizing unbibium&#x27;s 8p electron than thorium&#x27;s 6d electron. The collapse of the 5g orbital itself is delayed until around element 125 ( or eka-neptunium); the electron configurations of the 119-electron isoelectronic series are expected to be [Og]8s for elements 119 through 122, [Og]6f for elements 123 and 124, and [Og]5g for element 125 onwards.

In the first few superactinides, the binding energies of the added electrons are predicted to be small enough that they can lose all their valence electrons; for example, unbihexium (element 126) could easily form a +8 oxidation state, and even higher oxidation states for the next few elements may be possible. Element 126 is also predicted to display a variety of other oxidation states: recent calculations have suggested a stable monofluoride 126F may be possible, resulting from a bonding interaction between the 5g orbital on element 126 and the 2p orbital on fluorine. Other predicted oxidation states include +2, +4, and +6; +4 is expected to be the most usual oxidation state of unbihexium. The superactinides from unbipentium (element 125) to unbiennium (element 129) are predicted to exhibit a +6 oxidation state and form hexafluorides, though 125F and 126F are predicted to be relatively weakly bound. The bond dissociation energies are expected to greatly increase at element 127 and even more so at element 129. This suggests a shift from strong ionic character in fluorides of element 125 to more covalent character, involving the 8p orbital, in fluorides of element 129. The bonding in these superactinide hexafluorides is mostly between the highest 8p subshell of the superactinide and the 2p subshell of fluorine, unlike how uranium uses its 5f and 6d orbitals for bonding in uranium hexafluoride.

Despite the ability of early superactinides to reach high oxidation states, it has been calculated that the 5g electrons will be most difficult to ionize; the 125 and 126 ions are expected to bear a 5g configuration, similar to the 5f configuration of the Np ion. Similar behavior is observed in the low chemical activity of the 4f electrons in lanthanides; this is a consequence of the 5g orbitals being small and deeply buried in the electron cloud. The presence of electrons in g-orbitals, which do not exist in the ground state electron configuration of any currently known element, should allow presently unknown hybrid orbitals to form and influence the chemistry of the superactinides in new ways, although the absence of &quot;g&quot; electrons in known elements makes predicting superactinide chemistry more difficult.

In the later superactinides, the oxidation states should become lower. By element 132, the predominant most stable oxidation state will be only +6; this is further reduced to +3 and +4 by element 144, and at the end of the superactinide series it will be only +2 (and possibly even 0) because the 6f shell, which is being filled at that point, is deep inside the electron cloud and the 8s and 8p electrons are bound too strongly to be chemically active. The 5g shell should be filled at element 144 and the 6f shell at around element 154, and at this region of the superactinides the 8p electrons are bound so strongly that they are no longer active chemically, so that only a few electrons can participate in chemical reactions. Calculations by Fricke et al. predict that at element 154, the 6f shell is full and there are no d- or other electron wave functions outside the chemically inactive 8s and 8p1/2 shells. This may cause element 154 to be rather unreactive with noble gas-like properties. Calculations by Pyykkö nonetheless expect that at element 155, the 6f shell is still chemically ionizable: 155 should have a full 6f shell, and the fourth ionization potential should be between those of terbium and dysprosium, both of which are known in the +4 state.

Similarly to the lanthanide and actinide contractions, there should be a superactinide contraction in the superactinide series where the ionic radii of the superactinides are smaller than expected. In the lanthanides, the contraction is about 4.4 pm per element; in the actinides, it is about 3 pm per element. The contraction is larger in the lanthanides than in the actinides due to the greater localization of the 4f wave function as compared to the 5f wave function. Comparisons with the wave functions of the outer electrons of the lanthanides, actinides, and superactinides lead to a prediction of a contraction of about 2 pm per element in the superactinides; although this is smaller than the contractions in the lanthanides and actinides, its total effect is larger due to the fact that 32 electrons are filled in the deeply buried 5g and 6f shells, instead of just 14 electrons being filled in the 4f and 5f shells in the lanthanides and actinides, respectively.

Pekka Pyykkö divides these superactinides into three series: a 5g series (elements 121 to 138), an 8p1/2 series (elements 139 to 140), and a 6f series (elements 141 to 155), also noting that there would be a great deal of overlapping between energy levels and that the 6f, 7d, or 8p1/2 orbitals could well also be occupied in the early superactinide atoms or ions. He also expects that they would behave more like &quot;superlanthanides&quot;, in the sense that the 5g electrons would mostly be chemically inactive, similarly to how only one or two 4f electrons in each lanthanide are ever ionized in chemical compounds. He also predicted that the possible oxidation states of the superactinides might rise very high in the 6f series, to values such as +12 in element 148.

Andrey Kulsha has called the elements 121 to 156 &quot;ultransition&quot; elements and has proposed to split them into two series of eighteen each, one from elements 121 to 138 and another from elements 139 to 156. The first would be analogous to the lanthanides, with oxidation states mainly ranging from +4 to +6, as the filling of the 5g shell dominates and neighbouring elements are very similar to each other, creating an analogy to uranium, neptunium, and plutonium. The second would be analogous to the actinides: at the beginning (around elements in the 140s) very high oxidation states would be expected as the 6f shell rises above the 7d one, but after that the typical oxidation states would lower and in elements in the 150s onwards the 8p electrons would stop being chemically active. Because the two rows are separated by the addition of a complete 5g subshell, they could be considered analogues of each other as well.

As an example from the late superactinides, element 156 is expected to exhibit mainly the +2 oxidation state, on account of its electron configuration with easily removed 7d electrons over a stable [Og]5g6f8s8p core. It can thus be considered a heavier congener of nobelium, which likewise has a pair of easily removed 7s electrons over a stable [Rn]5f core, and is usually in the +2 state (strong oxidisers are required to obtain nobelium in the +3 state). Its first ionization energy should be about 400 kJ/mol and its metallic radius approximately 170 picometers. With a relative atomic mass of around 445 u, it should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 26 g/cm3.

====Elements 157 to 166====
The 7d transition metals in period 8 are expected to be elements 157 to 166. Although the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are bound so strongly in these elements that they should not be able to take part in any chemical reactions, the 9s and 9p1/2 levels are expected to be readily available for hybridization. These 7d elements should be similar to the 4d elements yttrium through cadmium. In particular, element 164 with a 7d109s0 electron configuration shows clear analogies with palladium with its 4d105s0 electron configuration.

The noble metals of this series of transition metals are not expected to be as noble as their lighter homologues, due to the absence of an outer &quot;s&quot; shell for shielding and also because the 7d shell is strongly split into two subshells due to relativistic effects. This causes the first ionization energies of the 7d transition metals to be smaller than those of their lighter congeners.

Theoretical interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotopes 472164 and 482164 (with 164 protons and 308 or 318 neutrons), would be at the center of a hypothetical second island of stability (the first being centered on copernicium, particularly the isotopes 291Cn, 293Cn, and 296Cn which are expected to have half-lives of centuries or millennia).

Calculations predict that the 7d electrons of element 164 (unhexquadium) should participate very readily in chemical reactions, so that it should be able to show stable +6 and +4 oxidation states in addition to the normal +2 state in aqueous solutions with strong ligands. Element 164 should thus be able to form compounds like 164(CO)4, 164(PF3)4 (both tetrahedral like the corresponding palladium compounds), and (linear), which is very different behavior from that of lead, which element 164 would be a heavier homologue of if not for relativistic effects. Nevertheless, the divalent state would be the main one in aqueous solution (although the +4 and +6 states would be possible with stronger ligands), and unhexquadium(II) should behave more similarly to lead than unhexquadium(IV) and unhexquadium(VI).

Element 164 is expected to be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4 eV. It should be at most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685 kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, element 164 should have a metallic radius of only 158 pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its expected atomic weight of around 474 u which is about 19.5 times the atomic weight of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46 g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61 g·cm−3; element 164 should be the second most dense element in the first 172 elements in the periodic table, with only its neighbor unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47 g·cm−3). Metallic element 164 should have a very large cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point. In the metallic state, element 164 should be quite noble and analogous to palladium and platinum. Fricke et al. suggested some formal similarities to oganesson, as both elements have closed-shell configurations and similar ionisation energies, although they note that while oganesson would be a very bad noble gas, element 164 would be a good noble metal.

Elements 165 (unhexpentium) and 166 (unhexhexium), the last two 7d metals, should behave similarly to alkali and alkaline earth metals when in the +1 and +2 oxidation states, respectively. The 9s electrons should have ionization energies comparable to those of the 3s electrons of sodium and magnesium, due to relativistic effects causing the 9s electrons to be much more strongly bound than non-relativistic calculations would predict. Elements 165 and 166 should normally exhibit the +1 and +2 oxidation states, respectively, although the ionization energies of the 7d electrons are low enough to allow higher oxidation states like +3 for element 165. The oxidation state +4 for element 166 is less likely, creating a situation similar to the lighter elements in groups 11 and 12 (particularly gold and mercury). As with mercury but not copernicium, ionization of element 166 to 1662+ is expected to result in a 7d10 configuration corresponding to the loss of the s-electrons but not the d-electrons, making it more analogous to the lighter &quot;less relativistic&quot; group 12 elements zinc, cadmium, and mercury.
:
====Elements 167 to 172====
The next six elements on the periodic table are expected to be the last main-group elements in their period, and are likely to be similar to the 5p elements indium through xenon. In elements 167 to 172, the 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 shells will be filled. Their energy eigenvalues are so close together that they behave as one combined p-subshell, similar to the non-relativistic 2p and 3p subshells. Thus, the inert-pair effect does not occur and the most common oxidation states of elements 167 to 170 are expected to be +3, +4, +5, and +6, respectively. Element 171 (unseptunium) is expected to show some similarities to the halogens, showing various oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7, although its physical properties are expected to be closer to that of a metal. Its electron affinity is expected to be 3.0 eV, allowing it to form H171, analogous to a hydrogen halide. The 171− ion is expected to be a soft base, comparable to iodide (I−). Element 172 (unseptbium) is expected to be a noble gas with chemical behaviour similar to that of xenon, as their ionization energies should be very similar (Xe, 1170.4 kJ/mol; element 172, 1090 kJ/mol). The only main difference between them is that element 172, unlike xenon, is expected to be a liquid or a solid at standard temperature and pressure due to its much higher atomic weight. Unseptbium is expected to be a strong Lewis acid, forming fluorides and oxides, similarly to its lighter congener xenon.

Because of some analogy of elements 165–172 to periods 2 and 3, Fricke et al. considered them to form a ninth period of the periodic table, while the eighth period was taken by them to end at the noble metal element 164. This ninth period would be similar to the second and third period in having no transition metals. That being said, the analogy is incomplete for elements 165 and 166; although they do start a new s-shell (9s), this is above a d-shell, making them chemically more similar to groups 11 and 12.
:
====Beyond element 172====
Beyond element 172, there is the potential to fill the 6g, 7f, 8d, 10s, 10p1/2, and perhaps 6h11/2 shells. These electrons would be very loosely bound, potentially rendering extremely high oxidation states reachable, though the electrons would become more tightly bound as the ionic charge rises. Thus, there will probably be another very long transition series, like the superactinides.

In element 173 (unsepttrium), the outermost electron might enter the 6g7/2, 9p3/2, or 10s subshells. Because spin–orbit interactions would create a very large energy gap between these and the 8p3/2 subshell, this outermost electron is expected to be very loosely bound and very easily lost to form a 173+ cation. As a result, element 173 is expected to behave chemically like an alkali metal, and one that might be far more reactive than even caesium (francium and element 119 being less reactive than caesium due to relativistic effects): the calculated ionisation energy for element 173 is 3.070 eV, compared to the experimentally known 3.894 eV for caesium. Element 174 (unseptquadium) may add an 8d electron and form a closed-shell 1742+ cation; its calculated ionisation energy is 3.614 eV.

Element 184 (unoctquadium) was significantly targeted in early predictions, as it was originally speculated that 184 would be a proton magic number: it is predicted to have an electron configuration of [172] 6g5 7f4 8d3, with at least the 7f and 8d electrons chemically active. Its chemical behaviour is expected to be similar to uranium and neptunium, as further ionisation past the +6 state (corresponding to removal of the 6g electrons) is likely to be unprofitable; the +4 state should be most common in aqueous solution, with +5 and +6 reachable in solid compounds.

===End of the periodic table===
The number of physically possible elements is unknown. A low estimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to center on &quot;Z&quot; = 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclide tables is restricted by the proton and the neutron drip lines and stability toward alpha decay and spontaneous fission. One calculation by Y. Gambhir &quot;et al.&quot;, analyzing nuclear binding energy and stability in various decay channels, suggests a limit to the existence of bound nuclei at &quot;Z&quot; = 146. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include &quot;Z&quot; = 128 (John Emsley) and &quot;Z&quot; = 155 (Albert Khazan).

====Elements above the atomic number 137====
It is a &quot;folk legend&quot; among physicists that Richard Feynman suggested that neutral atoms could not exist for atomic numbers greater than &quot;Z&quot; = 137, on the grounds that the relativistic Dirac equation predicts that the ground-state energy of the innermost electron in such an atom would be an imaginary number. Here, the number 137 arises as the inverse of the fine-structure constant. By this argument, neutral atoms cannot exist beyond atomic number 137, and therefore a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals breaks down at this point. However, this argument presumes that the atomic nucleus is pointlike. A more accurate calculation must take into account the small, but nonzero, size of the nucleus, which is predicted to push the limit further to &quot;Z&quot; ≈ 173.

=====Bohr model=====
The Bohr model exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, for the speed of an electron in a 1s electron orbital, &quot;v&quot;, is given by

:formula_1

where &quot;Z&quot; is the atomic number, and &quot;α&quot; is the fine-structure constant, a measure of the strength of electromagnetic interactions. Under this approximation, any element with an atomic number of greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light. Hence, the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.

=====Relativistic Dirac equation=====

The relativistic Dirac equation gives the ground state energy as

:formula_2

where &quot;m&quot; is the rest mass of the electron. For &quot;Z&quot; &gt; 137, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory, rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds 2&quot;mc&quot;2 for &quot;Z&quot; &gt; &quot;Z&quot;cr probably between 168 and 172. For &quot;Z&quot; &gt; &quot;Z&quot;cr, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron. This diving of the 1s subshell into the negative continuum has often been taken to constitute an &quot;end&quot; to the periodic table, but in fact it does not impose such a limit, as such resonances can be interpreted as Gamow states. Nonetheless, the accurate description of such states in a multi-electron system, needed to extend calculations and the periodic table past &quot;Z&quot;cr ≈ 172, are still open problems.

Atoms with atomic numbers above &quot;Z&quot;cr ≈ 172 have been termed &quot;supercritical&quot; atoms. Supercritical atoms cannot be totally ionised because their 1s subshell would be filled by spontaneous pair creation in which an electron-positron pair is created from the negative continuum, with the electron being bound and the positron escaping. However, the strong field around the atomic nucleus is restricted to a very small region of space, so that the Pauli exclusion principle forbids further spontaneous pair creation once the subshells that have dived into the negative continuum are filled. Elements 173–184 have been termed &quot;weakly supercritical&quot; atoms as for them only the 1s shell has dived into the negative continuum; the 2p1/2 shell is expected to join around element 185 and the 2s shell around element 245. Experiments have so far not succeeded in detecting spontaneous pair creation from assembling supercritical charges through the collision of heavy nuclei (e.g. colliding lead with uranium to momentarily give an effective &quot;Z&quot; of 174; uranium with uranium gives effective &quot;Z&quot; = 184 and uranium with californium gives effective &quot;Z&quot; = 190).

Even though passing &quot;Z&quot;cr does not mean elements can no longer exist, the increasing concentration of the 1s density close to the nucleus would likely make these electrons more vulnerable to &quot;K&quot; electron capture as &quot;Z&quot;cr is approached. For such heavy elements, these 1s electrons would likely spend a significant fraction of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it. This may pose another limit to the periodic table.

Because of the factor of &quot;m&quot;, muonic atoms become supercritical at a much larger atomic number of around 2200, as muons are about 207 times as heavy as electrons.

=====Quark matter=====

It has also been posited that in the region beyond &quot;A&quot; &gt; 300, an entire &quot;continent of stability&quot; consisting of a hypothetical phase of stable quark matter, comprising freely flowing up and down quarks rather than quarks bound into protons and neutrons, may exist. Such a form of matter is theorized to be a ground state of baryonic matter with a greater binding energy per baryon than nuclear matter, favoring the decay of nuclear matter beyond this mass threshold into quark matter. If this state of matter exists, it could possibly be synthesized in the same fusion reactions leading to normal superheavy nuclei, and would be stabilized against fission as a consequence of its stronger binding that is enough to overcome Coulomb repulsion.

Calculations published in 2020 suggest stability of up-down quark matter (udQM) nuggets against conventional nuclei beyond &quot;A&quot; ~ 266, and also show that udQM nuggets become supercritical earlier (&quot;Z&quot;cr ~ 163, &quot;A&quot; ~ 609) than conventional nuclei (&quot;Z&quot;cr ~ 177, &quot;A&quot; ~ 480).

===Nuclear properties===
====Magic numbers and the island of stability====
The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after curium, element 96, so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half-life under a day. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. Nevertheless, because of reasons not very well understood yet, there is a slight increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110–114, which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the &quot;island of stability&quot;. This concept, proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted.

Calculations according to the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov method using the non-relativistic Skyrme interaction have proposed &quot;Z&quot; = 126 as a closed proton shell. In this region of the periodic table, &quot;N&quot; = 184, &quot;N&quot; = 196, and &quot;N&quot; = 228 have been suggested as closed neutron shells. Therefore, the isotopes of most interest are 310126, 322126, and 354126, for these might be considerably longer-lived than other isotopes. Element 126, having a magic number of protons, is predicted to be more stable than other elements in this region, and may have nuclear isomers with very long half-lives. It is also possible that the island of stability is instead centered at 306122, which may be spherical and doubly magic. Probably, the island of stability occurs around &quot;Z&quot; = 114–126 and &quot;N&quot; = 184, with lifetimes probably around hours to days. Beyond the shell closure at &quot;N&quot; = 184, spontaneous fission lifetimes should drastically drop below 10−15 seconds – too short for a nucleus to obtain an electron cloud and participate in any chemistry. That being said, such lifetimes are very model-dependent, and predictions range across many orders of magnitude.

Taking nuclear deformation and relativistic effects into account, an analysis of single-particle levels predicts new magic numbers for superheavy nuclei at &quot;Z&quot; = 126, 138, 154, and 164 and &quot;N&quot; = 228, 308, and 318. Therefore, in addition to the island of stability centered at 291Cn, 293Cn, and 298Fl, further islands of stability may exist around the doubly magic 354126 as well as 472164 or 482164. These nuclei are predicted to be beta-stable and decay by alpha emission or spontaneous fission with relatively long half-lives, and confer additional stability on neighboring &quot;N&quot; = 228 isotones and elements 152–168, respectively. On the other hand, the same analysis suggests that proton shell closures may be relatively weak or even nonexistent in some cases such as 354126, meaning that such nuclei might not be doubly magic and stability will instead be primarily determined by strong neutron shell closures. Additionally, due to the enormously greater forces of electromagnetic repulsion that must be overcome by the strong force at the second island (&quot;Z&quot; = 164), it is possible that nuclei around this region only exist as resonances and cannot stay together for a meaningful amount of time. It is also possible that some of the superactinides between these series may not actually exist because they are too far from both islands, in which case the periodic table might end around &quot;Z&quot; = 130. The area of elements 121–156 where periodicity is in abeyance is quite similar to the gap between the two islands.

Beyond element 164, the fissility line defining the limit of stability with respect to spontaneous fission may converge with the neutron drip line, posing a limit to the existence of heavier elements. Nevertheless, further magic numbers have been predicted at &quot;Z&quot; = 210, 274, and 354 and &quot;N&quot; = 308, 406, 524, 644, and 772, with two beta-stable doubly magic nuclei found at 616210 and 798274; the same calculation method reproduced the predictions for 298Fl and 472164. (The doubly magic nuclei predicted for &quot;Z&quot; = 354 are beta-unstable, with 998354 being neutron-deficient and 1126354 being neutron-rich.) Although additional stability toward alpha decay and fission are predicted for 616210 and 798274, with half-lives up to hundreds of microseconds for 616210, there will not exist islands of stability as significant as those predicted at &quot;Z&quot; = 114 and 164. As the existence of superheavy elements is very strongly dependent on stabilizing effects from closed shells, nuclear instability and fission will likely determine the end of the periodic table beyond these islands of stability.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10−14 seconds, which is the time it takes for the nucleus to form an electron cloud. However, a nuclide is generally considered to exist if its lifetime is longer than about 10−22 seconds, which is the time it takes for nuclear structure to form. Consequently, it is possible that some &quot;Z&quot; values can only be realised in nuclides and that the corresponding elements do not exist.

It is also possible that no further islands actually exist beyond 126, as the nuclear shell structure gets smeared out (as the electron shell structure already is expected to be around oganesson) and low-energy decay modes become readily available.

In some regions of the table of nuclides, there are expected to be additional regions of stability due to non-spherical nuclei that have different magic numbers than spherical nuclei do; the egg-shaped 270Hs is one such deformed doubly magic nucleus. In the superheavy region, the strong Coulomb repulsion of protons may cause some nuclei, including isotopes of oganesson, to assume a bubble shape in the ground state with a reduced central density of protons, unlike the roughly uniform distribution inside most smaller nuclei. Such a shape would have a very low fission barrier, however. Even heavier nuclei in some regions, such as 342136 and 466156, may instead become toroidal or red blood cell-like in shape, with their own magic numbers and islands of stability, but they would also fragment easily.

====Predicted decay properties of undiscovered elements====
As the main island of stability is thought to lie around 291Cn and 293Cn, undiscovered elements beyond oganesson may be very unstable and undergo alpha decay or spontaneous fission in microseconds or less. The exact region in which half-lives exceed one microsecond is unknown, though various models suggest that isotopes of elements heavier than unbinilium that may be produced in fusion reactions with available targets and projectiles will have half-lives under one microsecond and therefore may not be detected. It is consistently predicted that there will exist regions of stability at &quot;N&quot; = 184 and &quot;N&quot; = 228, and possibly also at &quot;Z&quot; ~ 124 and &quot;N&quot; ~ 198. These nuclei may have half-lives of a few seconds and undergo predominantly alpha decay and spontaneous fission, though minor beta-plus decay (or electron capture) branches may also exist. Outside these regions of enhanced stability, fission barriers are expected to drop significantly due to loss of stabilization effects, resulting in fission half-lives below 10−18 seconds, especially in even–even nuclei for which hindrance is even lower due to nucleon pairing. In general, alpha decay half-lives are expected to increase with neutron number, from nanoseconds in the most neutron-deficient isotopes to seconds closer to the beta-stability line. For nuclei with only a few neutrons more than a magic number, binding energy substantially drops, resulting in a break in the trend and shorter half-lives. The most neutron deficient isotopes of these elements may also be unbound and undergo proton emission. Cluster decay (heavy particle emission) has also been proposed as an alternative decay mode for some isotopes, posing yet another hurdle to identification of these elements.

===Electron configurations===
The following are expected electron configurations of elements 119–174 and 184. The symbol [Og] indicates the probable electron configuration of oganesson (Z = 118), which is currently the last known element. The configurations of the elements in this table are written starting with [Og] because oganesson is expected to be the last prior element with a closed-shell (inert gas) configuration, 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 4d10 4f14 5s2 5p6 5d10 5f14 6s2 6p6 6d10 7s2 7p6. Similarly, the [172] in the configurations for elements 173, 174, and 184 denotes the likely closed-shell configuration of element 172.

Beyond element 123, no complete calculations are available and hence the data in this table must be taken as . In the case of element 123, and perhaps also heavier elements, several possible electron configurations are predicted to have very similar energy levels, such that it is very difficult to predict the ground state. All configurations that have been proposed (since it was understood that the Madelung rule probably stops working here) are included.

The predicted block assignments up to 172 are Kulsha&#x27;s, following the expected available valence orbitals. There is, however, not a consensus in the literature as to how the blocks should work after element 138.
