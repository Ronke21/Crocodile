<text>Louis Aragon (; 3 October 1897 – 24 December 1982) was a French poet who was one of the leading voices of the surrealist movement in France. He co-founded with André Breton and Philippe Soupault the surrealist review &quot;Littérature&quot;. He was also a novelist and editor, a long-time member of the Communist Party and a member of the Académie Goncourt. After 1959, he was a frequent nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== Early life (1897–1939) ==

Louis Aragon was born in Paris. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, believing them to be his sister and foster mother, respectively. His biological father, Louis Andrieux, a former senator for Forcalquier, was married and thirty years older than Aragon&#x27;s mother, whom he seduced when she was seventeen. Aragon&#x27;s mother passed Andrieux off to her son as his godfather. Aragon was only told the truth at the age of 19, as he was leaving to serve in the First World War, from which neither he nor his parents believed he would return. Andrieux&#x27;s refusal or inability to recognize his son would influence Aragon&#x27;s poetry later on.

Having been involved in Dadaism from 1919 to 1924, he became a founding member of Surrealism in 1924, with André Breton and Philippe Soupault, under the pen-name &quot;Aragon&quot;. In 1923, during the trial of Germaine Berton, Aragon released a 29 portrait piece in &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot; in support of her stating Berton &quot;“use terrorist means, in particular murder, to safeguard, at the risk of losing everything, what seems to her— rightly or wrongly — precious beyond anything in the world”.

In the 1920s, Aragon became a fellow traveller of the French Communist Party (PCF) along with several other surrealists, and joined the Party in January 1927.

In 1933, he began to write for the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, in the &quot;news in brief&quot; section. He would remain a member for the rest of his life, writing several political poems including one to Maurice Thorez, the general secretary of the PCF. During the First International Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture (1935), Aragon opposed his former friend André Breton, who wanted to use the opportunity as a tribune to defend the writer Victor Serge, associated with Leon Trotsky&#x27;s Left Opposition.

Aragon was also critical of the USSR, particularly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1956) during which Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personality cult was denounced by Nikita Khrushchev.

The French surrealists had long claimed Lewis Carroll as one of their own, and Aragon published his translation of &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; in 1929, &quot;shortly before he completed his transition from Snarxism to Marxism&quot;, as Martin Gardner puts it. Witness the key stanza of the poem in Aragon&#x27;s translation:

Gardner, who calls the translation &quot;pedestrian&quot; and deems the rest of Aragon&#x27;s writings on Carroll&#x27;s nonsense poetry full of factual errors, says that there is no evidence that Aragon intended any of it as a joke.

=== The &quot;Commune&quot; (1933–1939) ===

Apart from working as a journalist for &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, Louis Aragon also became, along with Paul Nizan, editor secretary of the journal &quot;Commune&quot;, published by the &quot;Association des Écrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires&quot; (Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists), which aimed at gathering intellectuals and artists in a common front against fascism. Aragon became a member of the directing committee of the &quot;Commune&quot; journal in January 1937, along with André Gide, Romain Rolland and Paul Vaillant-Couturier. The journal then took the name of &quot;French literary review for the defence of culture&quot; (&quot;« revue littéraire française pour la défense de la culture »&quot;). 

With Gide&#x27;s withdrawal in August 1937, Vaillant-Couturier&#x27;s death in the autumn of 1937 and Romain Rolland&#x27;s old age, Aragon became its effective director. In December 1938, he called as chief editor the young writer Jacques Decour. The &quot;Commune&quot; journal was strongly involved in the mobilization of French intellectuals in favour of the Spanish Republic.

=== Director of &quot;Ce soir&quot; (1937–1953) ===

In March 1937, Aragon was called on by the PCF to head the new evening daily &quot;Ce soir&quot;, which he was charged with launching, along with the writer Jean-Richard Bloch. &quot;Ce soir&quot; attempted to compete with &quot;Paris-soir&quot;. Outlawed in August 1939, &quot;Ce soir&quot; was re-opened after the Liberation, and Aragon again became its lead, first with Bloch then alone after Bloch&#x27;s death in 1947. The newspaper, which counted Émile Danoën among its collaborators, closed in March 1953.

== World War II (1939–1945) ==

In 1939, he married Russian-born author Elsa Triolet, the sister of Lilya Brik, a mistress and then partner of Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. He had met her in 1928, and she became his muse starting in the 1940s. Aragon and Triolet collaborated in the left-wing French media before and during World War II, going underground for most of the German occupation.

Aragon was mobilized in 1939, and awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; (War Cross) and the military medal for acts of bravery. After the May 1940 defeat, he took refuge in the southern zone. He was one of several poets, along with René Char, Francis Ponge, Robert Desnos, Paul Éluard, Jean Prévost, Jean-Pierre Rosnay, etc., to join the Resistance, both through literary activities and as an actual organizer of Resistance acts.

Otto Abetz was the German governor, and produced a series of &quot;black lists&quot; of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Aragon and André Malraux were both on these &quot;Otto Lists&quot; of forbidden authors.

During the war, Aragon wrote for the underground press &quot;Les Éditions de Minuit&quot; and was a member of the National Front Resistance movement. His poetry was published along texts by Vercors (Jean Bruller), Pierre Seghers or Paul Éluard in Switzerland in 1943 after being smuggled out of occupied France by his friend and publisher François Lachenal.

He participated with his wife in the setting up of the National Front of Writers in the southern zone. This activism led him to break his friendly relationship with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who had chosen collaborationism.

Along with Paul Éluard, Pierre Seghers and René Char, Aragon would maintain the memory of the Resistance in his post-war poems. He thus wrote, in 1954, &quot;Strophes pour se souvenir&quot; in commemoration of the role of foreigners in the Resistance, which celebrated the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d&#x27;Oeuvre Immigrée (FTP-MOI).

The theme of the poem was the Red Poster affair, mainly the last letter that Missak Manouchian, an Armenian-French poet and Resistant, wrote to his wife Mélinée before his execution on 21 February 1944. This poem was then set to music by Léo Ferré.

== After the war ==

At the liberation of France, Aragon became one of the leading Communist intellectuals, assuming political responsibilities in the &quot;Comité national des écrivains&quot; (National Committee of Writers). He celebrated the role of the general secretary of the PCF, Maurice Thorez, and defended the Kominform&#x27;s condemnation of the Titoist regime in Yugoslavia.

Sponsored by Thorez, Aragon was elected, in 1950, to the central committee of the PCF. His post, however, did not protect him from all forms of criticism. Thus, when his journal &quot;Les Lettres françaises&quot; published a drawing by Pablo Picasso on the occasion of Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, Aragon was forced to make excuses to his critics, who judged the drawing iconoclastic. Through the years, he had been kept informed of Stalinist repression by his Russian-born wife, and so his political line evolved.

=== &quot;Les Lettres françaises&quot; (1953–1972) ===
In the days following the disappearance of &quot;Ce soir&quot;, in March 1953, Aragon became the director of &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;″s literary supplement, &quot;Les Lettres françaises&quot;. After Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot; about Stalin delivered in 1956, Aragon suffered a deep personal crisis, but it was not until the 1960s when he started openly criticizing the Soviet regime. In 1956, Aragon didn&#x27;t support the Hungarian Revolution, provoking the dissolution of the &quot;Comité national des écrivains&quot;, which Vercors quit, and was granted the Lenin Peace Prize, but later he condemned Soviet totalitarianism and authoritarianism, opened his magazines to dissidents, and condemned show trials against intellectuals (in particular the 1966 Sinyavsky–Daniel trial). 

Assisted by Pierre Daix, Aragon started in the 1960s a struggle against Stalinism and its consequences in Eastern Europe. He published the writings of dissidents such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Milan Kundera. He strongly supported the student movement of May 68, although the PCF was sceptical about it. The crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 led him to a critical preface published in a translation of one of Milan Kundera&#x27;s books (&quot;La Plaisanterie&quot;). Despite his criticisms, Aragon remained an official member of the PCF&#x27;s central committee until his death. In 1970, he supported the Nobel Prize awarded to Solzhenitsyn. The monetary loss caused by &quot;Les Lettres françaises&quot; led to its ceasing publication in 1972. It was later re-founded.

=== The publisher ===

Beside his journalistic activities, Louis Aragon was also CEO of the &quot;Editeurs français réunis&quot; (EFR) publishing house, heir of two publishing houses founded by the Resistance, &quot;La Bibliothèque française&quot; and &quot;Hier et Aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;. He directed the EFR along with Madeleine Braun, and in the 1950s published French and Soviet writers commonly related to the &quot;Socialist Realism&quot; current. Among other works, the EFR published André Stil&#x27;s &quot;Premier choc&quot;, which owed to the future Goncourt Academician the Stalin Prize in 1953. They also published other writers, such as Julius Fučík, Vítězslav Nezval, Rafael Alberti, Yiannis Ritsos and Vladimir Mayakovsky. 

At the beginning of the 1960s, the EFR brought to public knowledge the works of non-Russian Soviet writers, such as Chinghiz Aitmatov, or Russian writers belonging to the Khrushchev Thaw, such as Galina Nikolaeva, Yevgeny Yevtushenko&#x27;s &quot;Babi Iar&quot; in 1967, etc. The EFR also published the first novel of Christa Wolf in 1964, and launched the poetic collection &quot;Petite sirène&quot;, which collected works by Pablo Neruda, Eugène Guillevic, Nicolás Guillén, but also less known poets such as Dominique Grandmont, Alain Lance or Jean Ristat.

=== Return to surrealism and death===

Free from both his marital and editorial responsibilities (having ended publication of &quot;Les Lettres Françaises&quot; – &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;″s literary supplement – in 1972), Aragon was free to return to his surrealist roots. During the last ten years of his life, he published at least two further novels: &quot;Henri Matisse Roman&quot; and &quot;Les Adieux&quot;.

Aragon died on 24 December 1982, his friend Jean Ristat sitting up with him. He was buried in the garden of Moulin de Villeneuve, in his property of Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines, alongside his wife Elsa Triolet.

He was and still is a popular poet in France because many of his poems have been set to music and sung by various composers and singers: Lino Léonardi, Hélène Martin, Léo Ferré (the first one to dedicate an entire LP to Aragon, with his 1961 breakthrough &quot;Les Chansons d&#x27;Aragon&quot; album), Jean Ferrat, Georges Brassens, Alain Barrière, Isabelle Aubret, Nicole Rieu, Monique Morelli, Marc Ogeret, Marjo Tal, &quot;et al.&quot; Many of his poems set to music by Jean Ferrat have been translated into German by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser) and are sung by his Duo.

<text>Ejea de los Caballeros (; ), commonly known simply as Ejea, is a town and municipality in the province of Zaragoza, part of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It is one of the five main towns in the (), along with Sos del Rey Católico, Uncastillo, Sádaba, and Tauste.

The town became part of the medieval Kingdom of Aragon in 1105 during the Spanish Reconquista, as Muslim rule in the region was receding.

==Main sights==
The town retains many medieval buildings, including:
*The Romanesque church of . It was renewed in 1649–1650.
*The church of , of the Romanesque-Gothic transition style. It has a 16th-century portal with Romanesque sculptures.
*The church of our Lady the Virgin of the Olive (), renovated in 1765 over a pre-existing medieval building.

==Villages==
The municipality of Ejea de los Caballeros comprises nine different centres of population:
* Ejea de los Caballeros
* Bardenas
* El Bayo
* 
* Pinsoro
* Rivas
* Santa Anastasia
* Valareña

Rivas and Farasdués are two historic villages that have been dependencies of Ejea for decades. The other six centres were built in the 1950s and 1960s in order to settle inhabitants and farmers to grow irrigation crops, following the construction of the Yesa Reservoir and Bardenas irrigation channel that brought water to these villages, among others (Sádaba, Tauste, and others).

==Culture==
The main local festival honours the Virgin of the Olive, the local saint. In June, there is also a medieval celebration for the patron saint, Saint John the Baptist.

Another local festival commemorates The Vote Day (January 14), an event during the Black Plague in which the townsfolk voted for the bringing of the Virgin of the Olive across the town to worship her. The plague is purported to have ended in the town that day.

<doc id="72308" wikidata="Q29372" url="?curid=72308" title="Grendel">
<text>Grendel is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; (700–1000 CE). He is one of the poem&#x27;s three antagonists (along with his mother and the dragon), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf. He is referred to as both an , types of beings from wider Germanic mythology. He is also described as a descendant of the Biblical Cain and &quot;a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, the destroyer and devourer of our human kind.&quot; He is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, although his status as a monster, giant, or other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. The character of Grendel and his role in the story of &quot;Beowulf&quot; have been subject to numerous reinterpretations and re-imaginings. Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf, who kills both him and his mother.

==Story==

Grendel is a figure in the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, preserved in the &quot;Nowell Codex&quot;. Grendel, being cursed as the descendant of the Biblical Cain, along with elves and other eotens, is &quot;harrowed&quot; by the sounds of singing that come every night from the mead hall of Heorot built by King Hroðgar. Unable to bear it any more, he attacks Heorot. Grendel continues to attack the Hall every night for twelve years, killing its inhabitants and making the mead hall unusable. The poet also details how Grendel consumes the men he kills, &quot;now that he could hope to eat his fill.&quot;

Beowulf hears of these attacks and leaves his native land of the Geats to destroy Grendel. He is warmly welcomed by King Hroðgar, who gives a banquet in celebration. Afterwards, Beowulf and his warriors bed down in the mead hall to await the inevitable attack. Grendel stalks outside the building for a time, spying the warriors inside. He then makes a sudden attack, bursting through the door with his fists. The first warrior Grendel finds is still asleep, so he seizes the man and devours him. Grendel grabs a second warrior, but is shocked when the warrior grabs back with fearsome strength. As Grendel attempts to disengage, the reader discovers that Beowulf is that second warrior. Beowulf uses neither weapon nor armour in this fight. He also places no reliance on his companions and has no need of them. He trusts that God has given him strength to defeat Grendel, whom he believes is God&#x27;s adversary. Beowulf tears off Grendel&#x27;s arm, mortally wounding the creature. Grendel flees but dies in his marsh den. There, Beowulf later engages in a fierce battle with Grendel&#x27;s mother in a mere, over whom he triumphs with a sword found there. Following her death, Beowulf finds Grendel&#x27;s corpse and removes his head, which he keeps as a trophy. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the &quot;ninth hour&quot;. He returns to Heorot, where a grateful Hroðgar showers him with gifts.

===Narrative role===
J. R. R. Tolkien (1936) argues for the importance of Grendel&#x27;s role in the poem as an &quot;eminently suitable beginning&quot; that sets the stage for Beowulf&#x27;s fight with the dragon: &quot;Triumph over the lesser and more nearly human is cancelled by defeat before the older and more elemental.&quot; Tolkien argues that &quot;the evil spirits took visible shape&quot; in the characters of Grendel and the dragon; however, the author&#x27;s concern is focused on Beowulf. Tolkien&#x27;s essay was the first work of scholarship in which Anglo-Saxon literature was seriously examined on its literary merits – not just for scholarship about the origins of the English language, or what historical information could be gleaned from the text, as was common in the 19th century.

==Identity and physical description==
===Description in the poem===
During the decades following Tolkien&#x27;s essay, the exact description of Grendel was debated by scholars. Indeed, because his exact appearance is never directly described in Old English by the original &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely his descent from the biblical Cain (the first murderer in the Bible). Grendel is called a &quot;sceadugenga&quot; – &quot;shadow walker&quot;, in other words &quot;night goer&quot; – given that the monster was repeatedly described to be in the shroud of darkness.

After Grendel&#x27;s death, Hroðgar describes him as vaguely human in shape, though much larger:

Grendel&#x27;s decapitated head is also so large that it takes four men to transport it. Furthermore, when Grendel&#x27;s torn arm is inspected it is described as being covered in impenetrable scales and horny growths.

===Relationship to Biblical traditions===
Some scholars have linked Grendel&#x27;s descent from Cain to the monsters and giants of the &quot;Cain tradition&quot;. Alfred Bammesgerber (2008) looks closely at line 1266 where Grendel&#x27;s ancestry is said to be the &quot;misbegotten spirits&quot; that sprang from Cain after he was cursed. He argues that the word in Old English should be translated &quot;the great former creation of spirits&quot;.

===Relationship to wider Germanic traditions===
====Identity as an eoten====
In 1936, J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;&quot; discussed Grendel and the dragon in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Tolkien points out that while Grendel is the descendant of the Biblical Cain, he &quot;cannot be dissociated from the creatures of northern myth&quot;. He notes that Cain is presented as the ancestor of beings such as and , which he equates with their Old Norse cognates of and . He further argues that this blending of traditions is intentional and seen throughout the poem more generally. Grendel specifically is described as both an and a , cognate with and respectively; it has been proposed that the poet and the audience of the poem would have seen Grendel as belonging to this same group of beings as the of Scandinavian tradition. While in Old Norse accounts are highly diverse, lacking a single physical appearance, and best thought of as a social grouping, some broadly shared traits have been identified such as living on the periphery of the world, outside society. In both Old Norse and Old English accounts, these borders between the realms of humanity and those of supernatural beings are often marked by water, such as rivers or the surface of lakes. This is notably consistent with Grendel&#x27;s depiction as living in marshes and Maxims II, which identifies fens as the characteristic living place for .

====Other====
Katherine O&#x27;Keefe (1981) has suggested that Grendel resembles a berserker, because of numerous associations that seem to point to this possibility.

Sonya R. Jensen (1998) argues for an identification between Grendel and Agnar, son of Ingeld, and suggests that the tale of the first two monsters is actually the tale of Ingeld, as mentioned by Alcuin in the 790s. The tale of Agnar tells how he was cut in half by the warrior Bödvar Bjarki (&quot;Warlike little Bear&quot;), and how he died &quot;with his lips separated into a smile&quot;. One major parallel between Agnar and Grendel would thus be that the monster of the poem has a name perhaps composed of a combination of the words &quot;gren&quot; and &quot;daelan&quot;. The poet may be stressing to his audience that Grendel &quot;died laughing&quot;, or that he was &quot;gren-dael[ed]&quot; or &quot;grin-divid[ed]&quot;, after having his arm torn off at the shoulder by Beowulf, whose name means &quot;bee-wolf&quot; or &quot;bear&quot;. 

==Other interpretations and discussions==
Peter Dickinson (1979) argued that seeing as the considered distinction between man and beast at the time the poem was written was simply man&#x27;s bipedalism, the given description of Grendel being man-like does not necessarily imply that Grendel is meant to be humanoid, going as far as stating that Grendel could easily have been a bipedal dragon.

Other scholars such as Sherman Kuhn (1979) have questioned Grendel&#x27;s description as a monster, stating:

==Place-names==
Grendel likely features in English place names dating to the Anglo-Saxon period such as (&quot;Grendel&#x27;s pit&quot;), (&quot;Grendel&#x27;s mere) and (&quot;Grendel&#x27;s bog&quot;). It has been further noted that these places are often nearby, or are, watery places, such as lakes and marshes, or other locations away from human habitation.

==Depictions==
Grendel appears in many other cultural works.

<doc id="72309" wikidata="Q147545" url="?curid=72309" title="Accessory fruit">
<text>An accessory fruit is a fruit that contains tissue derived from plant parts other than the ovary. In other words, the flesh of the fruit develops not from the floral ovary, but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel (for example, from receptacles or sepal). As a general rule, the accessory fruit is a combination of several floral organs, including the ovary. In contrast, true fruit forms exclusively from the ovary of the flower.

Accessory fruits are usually indehiscent, meaning that they do not split open to release seeds when they have reached maturity.

==Incorporated organs==
The following are examples of accessory fruits listed by the plant organ from which the accessory tissue is derived:
Fruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruits.

== Examples ==
=== Apples and pears ===
The part of apples and pears that is consumed is, in fact, the hypanthium. The ovary is the papery core that surrounds the apple seeds. As the hypanthium ripens it forms the edible tissues.

=== Roses ===
For roses, the hypanthium is the tissue that composes the edible part of rosehips. Roses and apples are both members of the Rosaceae family; the fact that they have similar fruit morphology is a major consideration in placing them in the same taxonomic family.

=== Strawberries ===
The edible part of the strawberry is formed, as part of the ripening process, from the receptacle of the strawberry flower. The true fruits (hence, containing the seeds) are the roughly 200 pips (which are, technically, achenes, a true fruit that contains a single seed from a single ovary). These pips dot the exterior of the strawberry.

=== Cashew apple ===
The cashew apple is an oval- or pear-shaped structure that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower and is technically called a hypocarpium. It ripens into a yellow or red structure about long. The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney–shaped drupe that grows at the end of the cashew apple; the seed inside this drupe is the cashew nut of commerce.

=== Pineapple ===
The pineapple is formed when 50 to 200 unpollinated flowers coalesce in a spiral arrangement— the flowers form individually and then fuse as a single &#x27;multiple fruit&#x27;. The ovaries develop into berries and the fruit forms around an intercalary spike. The intercalary inflorescence (cluster of flowers) results when the terminal cluster of flowers are left behind by the growth of the main axis of the plant. Each polygonal area on the pineapple&#x27;s surface is an individual flower.

== Research ==
Current research has proposed that a single class of genes may be responsible for regulating accessory fruit formation and ripening. A study using strawberries concluded that hormone signaling pathways involving gibberellic acid and auxin affect gene expression, and contribute to the initiation of accessory fruit development. Metabolic modifications in different developing accessory fruit tissues are due to the varied distributions of compounds such as triterpenoids and steroids.

<text>The 1996 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, also known as Atlanta 1996 and commonly referred to as the Centennial Olympic Games) were an international multi-sport event held from July 19 to August 4, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. These were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States, making it the first country to have three different cities host the Summer Olympics. It also marked the 100th anniversary of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games. These were also the first Summer Olympics to be held in a different year than the Winter Olympics since the same time practice commenced in 1924, as part of a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating, even-numbered years. The 1996 Games were the first of the two consecutive Summer Olympics to be held in a predominantly English-speaking country, preceding the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. These were also the last Summer Olympics to be held in North America until 2028, when Los Angeles will host the games for the third time, and that will also mark the second time the United States hosts the Summer Olympics before Australia does with how the Brisbane 2032 games will come after Los Angeles 2028.

10,318 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports, including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball, mountain biking and softball, as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing, women&#x27;s swimming 4 x 200 freestyle relay, women&#x27;s fencing, team rhythmic gymnastics, and women&#x27;s association football. A total of 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debuts in Atlanta, including 11 former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations. With a total of 101 medals, the United States topped both the gold and overall medal count for the first time since 1984 (and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics), also winning the most gold (44) and silver (32) medals out of all the participating nations. Notable performances during the competition included those of Andre Agassi, whose gold medal in these Games would be followed up with the French Open title in 1999, making him the first men&#x27;s singles tennis player to complete the Golden Slam; Donovan Bailey, who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men&#x27;s 100 meters; Lilia Podkopayeva, who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold medal after winning the all-around title in the same Olympics; and the Magnificent Seven, who dramatically won the first ever U.S. gold medal in the women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics team all-around.

The Games were marred by violence on July 27, 1996, when a pipe bomb was detonated at Centennial Olympic Park (which had been built to serve as a public focal point for the festivities), killing two and injuring 111. Years later, Eric Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related terrorist attacks, and was sentenced to life in prison. Nonetheless, the 1996 Olympics turned a profit, helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights, and a reliance on private funding, among other factors. There were 8.3 million tickets sold for events at this Olympics, a record broken only in 2024. There was some criticism of the perceived over-commercialization of the Games, with other issues raised by European officials, such as the availability of food and transport. The event had a lasting impact on the city; Centennial Olympic Park led a revitalization of Atlanta&#x27;s downtown area, and has served as a symbol of the legacy of the 1996 Games; the Olympic Village buildings have since been used as residential housing for area universities; and Centennial Olympic Stadium has since been redeveloped twice, first as the Turner Field baseball stadium, then as the Center Parc American football stadium.

==Bidding process==

Atlanta was selected on September 18, 1990, in Tokyo, Japan, over Athens, Belgrade, Manchester, Melbourne, and Toronto at the 96th IOC Session. The city entered the competition as a dark horse, being up against stiff competition. The US media also criticized Atlanta as a second-tier city and complained of Georgia&#x27;s Confederate history. However, the IOC Evaluation Commission ranked Atlanta&#x27;s infrastructure and facilities the highest, while IOC members said that it could guarantee large television revenues similar to the success of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the most recent Olympics in the United States. Additionally, former US ambassador to the UN and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young touted Atlanta&#x27;s civil rights history and reputation for racial harmony. Young also wanted to showcase a reformed American South. The strong economy of Atlanta and improved race relations in the South helped to impress the IOC officials. Coca-Cola, a long-standing partner of the Olympics, was also a strong advocate to bring the Games to its hometown. The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) also proposed a substantial revenue-sharing with the IOC, USOC, and other NOCs. Atlanta&#x27;s main rivals were Toronto, whose front-running bid that began in 1986 had chances to succeed after Canada had held a successful 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and Melbourne, Australia, who hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics and after Brisbane, Australia&#x27;s failed bid for the 1992 games (which were awarded to Barcelona) and prior to Sydney, Australia&#x27;s successful 2000 Summer Olympics bid. This would be Toronto&#x27;s fourth failed attempt since 1960 (tried in 1960, 1964, and 1976, but was defeated by Rome, Tokyo and Montreal).

Greece, the home of the ancient and first modern Olympics, was considered by many observers the &quot;natural choice&quot; for the Centennial Games, due to its &quot;divine right&quot; in history. Athens bid chairman Spyros Metaxas gave repeated warnings to the IOC and demanded to give them the games to mark the centennial, saying &quot;You don&#x27;t hold a 100th birthday in someone else&#x27;s home. The Centenary Games should be held in Athens.&quot; He also warned that &quot;if we don&#x27;t get the Olympics in 1996 we will never bid again to host them.&quot;

However, the Athens bid was described as &quot;arrogant and poorly prepared,&quot; being regarded as &quot;not being up to the task of coping with the modern and risk-prone extravaganza&quot; of the current Games. Athens faced numerous obstacles, including &quot;political instability, potential security problems, air pollution, traffic congestion and the fact that it would have to spend about US$3 billion to improve its infrastructure of airports, roads, rail lines and other amenities.&quot; Athens would later be selected to host the 2004 Summer Olympics seven years later on September 5, 1997.

==Development and preparation==
===Budget===
The total cost of the 1996 Summer Olympics was estimated to be around US$1.7 billion. The venues and the Games themselves were funded entirely via private investment, and the only public funding came from the U.S. government for security, and around $500 million of public money used on physical public infrastructure including streetscaping, road improvements, Centennial Olympic Park (alongside $75 million in private funding), expansion of the airport, improvements in public transportation, and redevelopment of public housing projects. $420 million worth of tickets were sold, sale of sponsorship rights accounted for $540 million, and sale of the domestic broadcast rights to NBC accounted for $456 million. In total, the Games turned a profit of $19 million.

The cost for Atlanta 1996 compares with costs of $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics (the most expensive Olympic Games without differentiating between summer and winter in history). The average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is $5.2 billion. Using the 1984 Summer Olympics financing model,this edition was organized 100% privately without any cent of public money. Beijing 2008 and Sochi 2014 were financed entirely by the governments of their respective countries.

===Venues and infrastructure===



Events of the 1996 Games were heldin a completely decentralized way using mostly existing facilities that were not built for the Games.Most of the events were held in the so-calles Olympic Ring, a circle from the center of Atlanta. Others were held at Stone Mountain, about outside of the city.In many cases, it was decided to remove events from the Atlanta Metropolitan Region to save money, while in others the calendar was a difficulty, as was the case with association football which ended up having its host cities spread across the Southeastern United States region.

===Marketing===
The Olympiad&#x27;s official theme, &quot;Summon the Heroes&quot;, was written by John Williams, making it the third Olympiad at that point for which he had composed (official composer in 1984, NBC&#x27;s coverage composer in 1988). The opening ceremony featured Céline Dion singing &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot;, the theme song of the 1996 Olympics. The closing ceremony featured Gloria Estefan singing &quot;Reach&quot;, the official theme song of the 1996 Olympics. The mascot for the Olympiad was an abstract, animated character named Izzy. In contrast to the standing tradition of mascots of national or regional significance in the city hosting the Olympiad, Izzy was an amorphous, fantasy figure. A video game featuring the Games&#x27; mascot, &quot;Izzy&#x27;s Quest for the Olympic Rings&quot;, was also released.

Atlanta&#x27;s Olympic slogan &quot;Come Celebrate Our Dream&quot; was written by Jack Arogeti, a managing director at McCann-Erickson in Atlanta at the time. The slogan was selected from more than 5,000 submitted by the public to the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. Billy Payne noted that Jack &quot;captured the spirit and our true motivation for the Olympic games.&quot;

The city of Savannah, Georgia, host of the yachting events, held its own local festivities, including a local cauldron lighting event on the first day of the Games (headlined by a performance by country musician Trisha Yearwood).

In 1994, African-American artist Kevin Cole was commissioned to create the Coca-Cola Centennial Olympic Mural, and the 15-story mural took two years to complete.

===Opening ceremony===

The ceremony began with a 60-second countdown, which included footage from all of the previous Olympic Games at twenty-two seconds. There was then a flashback to the closing ceremony of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, showing the then president of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, inviting the athletes to compete in Atlanta in 1996. Then, spirits ascended in the northwest corner of the stadium, each representing one of the colors in the Olympic rings. The spirits called the tribes of the world which, after mixed percussion, formed the Olympic rings while the youth of Atlanta formed the number 100. Famed film score composer John Williams wrote the official overture for the 1996 Olympics, called &quot;Summon the Heroes&quot;; this was his second overture for Olympic games, the first being &quot;Olympic Fanfare and Theme&quot; written for the 1984 Summer Olympics. Céline Dion performed David Foster&#x27;s official 1996 Olympics song &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot;, accompanied by Foster on the piano, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Centennial Choir (comprising Morehouse College Glee Club, Spelman College Glee Club and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus). Gladys Knight sang Georgia&#x27;s official state song, &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;.

There was a showcase entitled &quot;Welcome To The World&quot;, featuring cheerleaders, Chevrolet pick-up trucks, marching bands, and steppers, which highlighted the American youth and a typical Saturday college football game in the South, including the wave commonly produced by spectators in sporting events around the world. There was another showcase entitled &quot;Summertime&quot; which focused on Atlanta and the Old South, emphasizing its beauty, spirit, music, history, culture, and rebirth after the American Civil War. The ceremony also featured a memorable dance tribute to the athletes and to the goddesses of victory of the ancient Greek Olympics, using silhouette imagery. The accompanying music, &quot;The Tradition of the Games&quot;, was composed by Basil Poledouris.

Muhammad Ali lit the Olympic cauldron and later received a replacement gold medal for his boxing victory in the 1960 Summer Olympics. For the torch ceremony, more than 10,000 Olympic torches were manufactured by the American Meter Company and electroplated by Erie Plating Company. Each torch weighed about and was made primarily of aluminum, with a Georgia pecan wood handle and gold ornamentation.

===Closing ceremony===
===Sports===

The 1996 Summer Olympic program featured 271 events in 26 sports. Softball, beach volleyball and mountain biking debuted on the Olympic program, together with women&#x27;s football, lightweight rowing, women&#x27;s swimming, women&#x27;s fencing, and a team rhythmic gymnastics event.

In women&#x27;s gymnastics, Ukrainian Lilia Podkopayeva became the all-around Olympic champion. Podkopayeva also won a second gold medal in the floor exercise final and a silver on the beam – becoming the only female gymnast since Nadia Comăneci to win an individual event gold after winning the all-around title in the same Olympics. Kerri Strug of the United States women&#x27;s gymnastics team vaulted with an injured ankle and landed on one foot, winning the first women&#x27;s team gold medal for the US. Shannon Miller won the gold medal on the balance beam event, the first time an American gymnast had won an individual gold medal in non-boycotted Olympic games. The Spanish team won the first gold medal in the new competition of women&#x27;s rhythmic group all-around. The team was formed by Estela Giménez, Marta Baldó, Nuria Cabanillas, Lorena Guréndez, Estíbaliz Martínez and Tania Lamarca.

Amy Van Dyken won four gold medals in the Olympic swimming pool, the first American woman to win four titles in a single Olympiad. Penny Heyns, swimmer of South Africa, won the gold medals in both the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke events. Michelle Smith of Ireland won three gold medals and a bronze in swimming. She remains her nation&#x27;s most decorated Olympian. However, her victories were overshadowed by doping allegations even though she did not test positive in 1996. She received a four-year suspension in 1998 for tampering with a urine sample, though her medals and records were allowed to stand.
In track and field, Donovan Bailey of Canada won the men&#x27;s 100 m, setting a new world record of 9.84 seconds at that time. He also anchored his team&#x27;s gold in the 4 × 100 m relay.
Michael Johnson won gold in both the 200 m and 400 m, setting a new world record of 19.32 seconds in the 200 m. Marie-José Pérec equaled Johnson&#x27;s performance, although without a world record, by winning the rare 200 m/400 m double. Carl Lewis won his 4th long jump gold medal at the age of 35.

In tennis, Andre Agassi won the gold medal, which would eventually make him the first man and second singles player overall (after his eventual wife, Steffi Graf) to win the career Golden Slam, which consists of an Olympic gold medal and victories in the singles tournaments held at professional tennis&#x27; four major events (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open).

There were a series of national firsts realized during the Games. Deon Hemmings became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal for Jamaica and the English-speaking West Indies. Lee Lai Shan won a gold medal in sailing, the only Olympic medal that Hong Kong ever won as a British colony (1842–1997). This meant that for the only time, the colonial flag of Hong Kong was raised to the accompaniment of the British national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, as Hong Kong&#x27;s sovereignty was later transferred to China in 1997. The U.S. women&#x27;s soccer team won the gold medal in the first-ever women&#x27;s football event. For the first time, Olympic medals were won by athletes from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burundi, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mozambique, Slovakia, Tonga, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Another first in Atlanta was that this was the first Summer Olympics ever that not a single nation swept all three medals in a single event.

==Records==
==Medal table==
These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1996 Games.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
A total of 197 nations, all of the then-existing and recognized National Olympic Committees, were represented at the 1996 Games, and the combined total of athletes was about 10,318. Twenty-four countries made their Olympic debut this year, including eleven of the ex-Soviet countries that competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992. Russia participated in the Summer Olympics separately from the other countries of the former Soviet Union for the first time since 1912 (when it was the Russian Empire). Russia had been a member of the Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics together with 11 post-Soviet states. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia competed as &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;. After missing the 1992 Summer Games Afghanistan and Cambodia returned to send delegations to Atlanta.

The 14 countries making their Olympic debut were: Azerbaijan, Burundi, Cape Verde, Comoros, Dominica, Guinea-Bissau, Macedonia, Nauru, Palestinian Authority, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The ten countries making their Summer Olympic debut (after competing at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer) were: Armenia, Belarus, Czech Republic, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Slovakia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The Czech Republic and Slovakia attended the games as independent nations for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia, while the rest of the nations that made their Summer Olympic debut were formerly part of the Soviet Union.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee===
10,339 athletes from 197 NOCs participated in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

==Centennial Olympic Park bombing==
The 1996 Olympics were marred by the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, which occurred on July 27. Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the pipe bomb and immediately notified law enforcement, helping to evacuate as many people as possible from the area before it exploded. Although Jewell&#x27;s quick actions are credited for saving many lives, the bombing killed spectator Alice Hawthorne, wounded 111 others, and caused the death of Melih Uzunyol by a heart attack. Jewell was later considered a suspect in the bombing but was never charged, and he was cleared in October 1996.

Fugitive Eric Rudolph was arrested in May 2003 and charged with the Olympic Park bombing as well as the bombings of two abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. At his trial two years later, he confessed to all charges and afterwards released a statement, saying: &quot;the purpose of the attack on July 27th was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.&quot; He received four life sentences without parole, to be served at USP Florence ADMAX near Florence, Colorado.

==Legacy==

Preparations for the Olympics lasted more than seven years and had an economic impact of at least US$5.14 billion. Over two million visitors came to Atlanta, and approximately 3.5 billion people around the world watched at least some of the events on television. Although marred by the tragedy of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, the Games were a financial success, due in part to TV rights contracts and sponsorships at record levels. Atlanta also set a new record for the most tickets sold at a single Games (8.3 million), and held it until 2024.

Beyond international recognition, the Games resulted in many modern infrastructure improvements. The mid-rise dormitories built for the Olympic Village, which became the first residential housing for Georgia State University (Georgia State Village), are now used by the Georgia Institute of Technology (North Avenue Apartments). As designed, the Centennial Olympic Stadium was converted into Turner Field after the Paralympics, which became the home of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team from 1997 to 2016. The Braves&#x27; former home, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, was demolished in 1997 and the site became a parking lot for Turner Field; the Omni Coliseum was demolished the same year to make way for State Farm Arena. The city&#x27;s permanent memorial to the 1996 Olympics is Centennial Olympic Park, which was built as a focal point for the Games. The park initiated a revitalization of the surrounding area and now serves as the hub for Atlanta&#x27;s tourism district.

In November 2016, a commemorative plaque was unveiled for Centennial Olympic Park to honor the 20th anniversary of the Games.

Following the Braves&#x27; departure from Turner Field to Truist Park in 2017, Georgia State University acquired the former Olympic Stadium and surrounding parking lots. It reconfigured the stadium for a second time into Center Parc Stadium for its college football team.

The 1996 Olympic cauldron was originally built and placed at the intersection of Fulton Street and Capitol Avenue, near the Centennial Olympic Stadium. After the Paralympics, in order to make room for the stadium conversion, the Olympic cauldron was moved (except its ramp, which was demolished) to the intersection of Capitol Avenue and Fulton Street in 1997, where it has stayed since. Since Georgia State University&#x27;s acquisition of the former Olympic Stadium and surrounding lots, there has been proposals and growing calls to move the Olympic cauldron to Centennial Olympic Park.

The Olympic cauldron was re-lit in February 2020 for the 2020 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials.

The 1996 Olympics are the most recent edition of the Summer Olympics to be held in the United States. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics, 32 years after the Games were held in Atlanta.

==Sponsors==
The 1996 Summer Olympics relied heavily on commercial sponsorship. The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company was the exclusive provider of soft drinks at Olympics venues, and built an attraction known as Coca-Cola Olympic City for the Games. As part of a sponsorship agreement with Columbia TriStar Television, the syndicated game shows &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; both produced episodes with Olympics tie-ins (including branded memorabilia and contests) for broadcast between April and July 1996. These included a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; international tournament, and three weeks of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; episodes filmed on-location at Atlanta&#x27;s Fox Theatre.

The Games were affected by several instances of ambush marketing—in which companies attempt to use the Games as a means to promote their brand, in competition with the exclusive, category-based sponsorship rights issued by the Atlanta organizing committee and the IOC (which grants the rights to use Olympics-related terms and emblems in marketing). The Atlanta organizing committee threatened legal actions against advertisers whose marketing implied an official association with the Games. Several non-sponsors set up marketing activities in areas near venues, such as Samsung (competing with Motorola), which ambushed the Games with its &quot;96 Expo&quot;. The city of Atlanta had also licensed street vendors to sell products from competitors to Olympic sponsors.

The most controversial ambush campaign was undertaken by Nike, Inc., which had begun an advertising campaign with aggressive slogans that mocked the Games&#x27; values, such as &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger, Badder&quot;, &quot;If you&#x27;re not here to win, you&#x27;re a tourist&quot;, and &quot;You don&#x27;t win silver, you lose gold.&quot; The slogans were featured on magazine ads and billboards it purchased in Atlanta. Nike also opened a pop-up store known as the Nike Center near the Athletes&#x27; Village, which distributed Nike-branded flags to visitors (presumably to be used at events). IOC marketing director Michael Payne expressed concern for the campaign, believing that athletes could perceive them as being an insult to their accomplishments. Payne and the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s marketing director, John Krimsky, met with Howard Slusher, a subordinate of Nike co-founder Phil Knight. The meeting quickly turned aggressive, with Payne warning that the IOC could pull accreditation for Nike employees and ban the display of its logos on equipment; he also threatened to organize a press conference where silver medallists from the Games, as well as prominent Nike-sponsored athlete Michael Johnson (who attracted attention during the Games for wearing custom, gold-colored Nike shoes), would denounce the company. Faced with these threats, Nike agreed to retract most of its negative advertising and public relations stunts.

==Reception==
At the closing ceremony, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said in his closing speech, &quot;Well done, Atlanta&quot; and simply called the Games &quot;most exceptional.&quot; This broke precedent for Samaranch, who had traditionally labeled each Games &quot;the best Olympics ever&quot; at each closing ceremony, a practice he resumed at the subsequent Winter Games in Nagano in 1998.

A report prepared after the Games by European Olympic officials was critical of Atlanta&#x27;s performance in several key areas, including the level of crowding in the Olympic Village, the quality of available food, the accessibility and convenience of transportation, and the Games&#x27; general atmosphere of commercialism. IOC vice-president Dick Pound responded to criticism of the commercialization of these Games, stating that they still adhered to a historic policy barring the display of advertising within venues, and that &quot;you have to look to the private sector for at least a portion of the funding, and unless you&#x27;re looking for handouts, you&#x27;re dealing with people who are investing business assets, and they have to get a return.&quot;

In 1997, Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics. Along with addressing the shortcomings of its 1996 bid, it was lauded for its efforts to promote the traditional values of the Olympic Games, which some IOC observers felt had been lost due to the over-commercialization of the 1996 Games. However, the 2004 Games heavily relied on public funding and eventually failed to make a profit, which some have claimed contributed to the financial crisis in Greece.

The financial struggles faced by many later Games, such as the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, have caused some to offer more positive reappraisals of the management of the 1996 Summer Games. Former JPMorgan Chase president (and torchbearer) Kabir Sehgal noted that in contrast to many later Olympics, those of 1996 were financially viable, had a positive economic impact on the city, and most of the facilities constructed continued to be used after the Games. Sehgal contrasted the 1996 Games&#x27; &quot;grassroots&quot; effort backed almost entirely by private funding, with the only significant public spending coming from infrastructure associated with the Games, to modern &quot;top-down&quot; bids, instigated by local governments and reliant on taxpayer funding, making them unpopular among citizens who may not necessarily be interested. The 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles will rely almost entirely on private funding, with the city of Los Angeles and state of California each intending to provide up to $250 million in funding in the event of shortfalls, and the U.S. federal government providing funding solely for security.

<text>Salisbury Cathedral, formally the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is an Anglican cathedral in the city of Salisbury, England. The cathedral is regarded as one of the leading examples of Early English Gothic design. Built over a relatively short period, some 38 years between 1220 and 1258, it has a unity and coherence that is unusual in medieval English cathedrals. The tower and spire were completed by 1330. The cathedral&#x27;s spire, at , is the tallest in the United Kingdom.

The original cathedral in the district was located at Old Sarum, about north of the present city. In 1197 bishop Herbert Poore determined on a relocation but this was not taken forward until the episcopate of his brother, Richard Poore in the early 13th century. Foundation stones for the new building were laid on 28 April 1220 by the Earl and Countess of Salisbury. By 1258 the nave, transepts and choir were complete. The only major additions were the cloisters, added 1240, the chapter house in 1263, and the tower and spire, which was constructed by 1330. At its completion it was the third highest in England, but the collapse of those at Lincoln Cathedral and Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the 16th century saw Salisbury become England&#x27;s tallest.

The cathedral close is Britain&#x27;s largest, and has many buildings of architectural and/or historical significance. Pevsner describes it as &quot;the most beautiful of England&#x27;s closes&quot;. The cathedral contains a clock which is among the oldest working examples in the world. It also holds one of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta. In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration. In 2023, the completion of a programme of external restoration begun in 1985, saw the removal of scaffolding that had stood around the building for some 37 years.

==History==


Salisbury became the seat of a bishop in 1075. At the time, the city was at the now-abandoned site of Old Sarum, on a hill about north of the present-day cathedral. Old Sarum Cathedral was built in the years after and was consecrated in 1092.

In 1197, bishop Herbert Poore sought permission to re-site the cathedral, possibly due to deteriorating relations between the clergy and the military at Old Sarum. Permission was granted but the move was delayed repeatedly until the tenure of his successor and brother Richard Poore. A legend tells that Bishop Poore shot an arrow in the direction he would build the cathedral; the arrow hit a deer, which died in the place where Salisbury Cathedral is now.

Construction was paid for by donations, principally from the canons and vicars of southeast England, who were asked to contribute a fixed annual sum until the building was completed. The foundation stones were laid on 28 April 1220 by William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, and by Ela of Salisbury, 3rd Countess of Salisbury. Much of the freestone for the cathedral came from the Teffont Evias Quarry. As a result of the high water table on the new site, the cathedral was built on foundations only deep. By 1258, the nave, transepts, and choir were complete. As a result of being mostly built in only 38 years, Salisbury has by far the most consistent architectural style of any medieval English cathedral. The style used is known as Early English Gothic or Lancet Gothic, the latter referring to the use of lancet windows which are not divided by tracery.

The only major sections begun later were the cloisters, added in 1240, the chapter house in 1263, the tower and spire, which at dominated the skyline from 1330. In total, 70,000 tons of stone, 3,000 tons of timber and 450 tons of lead were used in the construction of the cathedral. Upon completion, it had the highest masonry spire in England and the third highest overall, after Lincoln and St Paul&#x27;s. The collapse of the latter two spires in the mid-16th century left Salisbury&#x27;s as the highest overall.

In the 17th century, Christopher Wren designed restoration measures to strengthen the central pillars, which by then had visibly deformed under the weight of the tower and spire. Significant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including the replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of a bell tower which stood about northwest of the main building.

=== 21st century ===
In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration. In 2023, the completion of a programme of external restoration begun in 1985 saw the removal of scaffolding that had stood around the building for some 37 years.

The cathedral previously employed five cathedral constables (known as &quot;Close Constables&quot;), whose duties mainly concerned the maintenance of law and order in the cathedral close. They were made redundant in 2010 as part of cost-cutting measures. The constables were first appointed when the cathedral became a liberty in 1611 and survived until the introduction of municipal police forces in 1835 with the Municipal Corporations Act. In 1800 they were given the power, along with the city constables, to execute any justices&#x27; or court orders requiring the conveyance of prisoners to or from the county jail (at Fisherton Anger, then outside the city of Salisbury) as if it were the city jail (and, in so doing, they were made immune from any legal action for acting outside their respective jurisdictions). The right of the cathedral, as a liberty, to maintain a separate police force was conclusively terminated by the Local Government Act 1888.

Between 1864 and 1953 there were records of peregrine falcons being present at the cathedral. More arrived in 2013 and have been hatching every year since with their nests on the cathedral&#x27;s tower.

In 2016, the cathedral chapter placed Sophie Ryder&#x27;s sculpture &quot;The Kiss&quot; (of a pair of hands) straddling a path in the grounds. It was moved shortly thereafter, due to pedestrians colliding with it while texting. In 2018 there was an attempted theft of the cathedral&#x27;s copy of Magna Carta; the alarms were triggered and a 45-year-old man was later detained on suspicion of attempted theft, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon. The outer layer of a double-layered glass case containing the document was broken, but the document suffered no damage. In January 2020 Mark Royden, from Kent, was found guilty of the attempted theft, which caused £14,466 of damage, and of criminal damage.

From 16 January 2021, while closed to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the cathedral was used to accommodate the vaccination programme in the United Kingdom, a day after Lichfield Cathedral became the first place of worship to become part of the immunisation plan against the pandemic in England. A selection of music was played on the organ as people received their vaccinations. In February 2024, the full exterior of the cathedral could be seen for the first time in 38 years after the removal of scaffolding that had been erected for extensive renovation works.

==Building and architecture==
The cathedral is described in Pevsner as the &quot;beau idéal&quot; of Early English Gothic design with a unity and coherence unique among English cathedrals.

===West front===

The west front is of the screen-type, clearly deriving from that at Wells. It is composed of a stair turret at each extremity, with two niched buttresses nearer the centre line supporting the large central triple window. The stair turrets are topped with spirelets, and the central section is topped by a gable which contains four lancet windows topped by two round quatrefoil windows surmounted by a mandorla containing Christ in Majesty. At ground level there is a principal door flanked by two smaller doors. The whole is highly decorated with quatrefoil motifs, columns, trefoil motifs and bands of diapering.

The west front was almost certainly constructed at the same time as the cathedral. This is apparent from the way in which the windows coincide with the interior spaces. The entire facade is about high and wide. It lacks full-scale towers and/or spires as can be seen, for example at Wells, Lincoln, Lichfield, etc. The facade was disparaged by Alec Clifton-Taylor, who considered it the least successful of the English screen facades and a travesty of its prototype (Wells). He found the composition to be uncoordinated, and the Victorian statuary &quot;poor and insipid&quot;.

The front accommodates over 130 shallow niches of varying sizes, 73 of which contain a statue. The line of niches extends round the turrets to the north, south and east faces. There are five levels of niches (not including the mandorla) which show, from the top, angels and archangels, Old Testament patriarchs, apostles and evangelists, martyrs, doctors and philosophers and, on the lower level, royalty, priests and worthy people connected with the cathedral. The majority of the statues were placed during the middle of the 19th century, however seven are from the 14th century and several have been installed within the last decade.

===Nave===

Salisbury Cathedral is unusual for its tall and narrow nave, which has visual accentuation from the use of light grey Chilmark stone for the walls and dark polished Purbeck marble for the columns. It has three levels: a tall pointed arcade, an open gallery and a small clerestory. Lined up between the pillars are notable tombs such as that of William Longespée, half brother of King John and the illegitimate son of Henry II, who was the first person to be buried in the cathedral.

Another unusual feature of the nave is an unconventional modern font, installed in September 2008. Designed by the water sculptor William Pye, it is the largest working font in any British cathedral, and replaced an earlier portable neo-Gothic Victorian font. The font is cruciform in shape, and has a 10-foot-wide vessel filled to its brim with water, designed so that the water overflows in filaments through each corner into bronze gratings embedded in the cathedral&#x27;s stone floor. The project cost £180,000 and was funded entirely by donations. Some parishioners reportedly objected to the new font, considering it &#x27;change for change&#x27;s sake&#x27;, although Pye argued that the majority opinion was in favour: &quot;I would say 90 per cent are in happy anticipation, five per cent are nervously expectant and five per cent are probably apoplectic&quot;.

===Tower and spire===

Although the spire is the cathedral&#x27;s most impressive feature, it has proved troublesome. Together with the tower, it added 6,397 tons (6,500 tonnes) to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches and anchor irons over the succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on other great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey, 1180 to 1500; Lincoln Cathedral, 1311 to 1548; Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, 1314 to 1561; and Chichester Cathedral, 1402 to 1861) and fallen down; instead, Salisbury became the tallest church spire in the country on the collapse at St Paul&#x27;s (as the result of a fire) in 1561. The large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are seen to bend inwards under the stress. The addition of reinforcing tie-beams above the crossing, designed by Christopher Wren in 1668, halted further deformation. The beams were hidden by a false ceiling installed below the lantern stage of the tower.

The bell chamber is in the middle level of the tower. The bells strike the hour and quarters and are now operated by a Victorian clock, which is not to be confused with the better-known medieval clock that is on display downstairs. Salisbury is one of only three English cathedrals to lack a ring of bells, the others being Norwich Cathedral and Ely Cathedral.

Visitors can access the tower by taking the &quot;Tower Tour&quot;, allowing them to climb as high as the base of the spire. From this level, there is a view of the interior of the hollow spire and the ancient wooden scaffolding inside it. There are 332 steps from ground level to the base of the spire, ascending a height of .

Maintenance workers have sometimes climbed the spire, including to service the aircraft warning light and weather station at the summit. The first of the spire can be climbed by internal ladders. The remaining requires climbing out of a small door and up the exterior. In 2010, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Helen Skelton climbed the spire to assist the changing of the lights.

===Chapter house and Magna Carta===

The chapter house is notable for its octagonal shape, slender central pillar and decorative medieval frieze. It was redecorated in 1855–9 by William Burges. The frieze, which circles the interior above the stalls, depicts scenes and stories from the books of Genesis and Exodus, including Adam and Eve, Noah, the Tower of Babel, and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

The chapter house displays the best-preserved of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta. This copy came to Salisbury because Elias of Dereham, who was present at Runnymede in 1215, was given the task of distributing some of the original copies. Elias later became a canon of Salisbury and supervised the construction of the cathedral.

=== Clock ===
The Salisbury Cathedral clock, which dates from about AD 1386, is supposedly the oldest working modern clock in the world. The clock has no face; all clocks of that date rang out the hours on a bell. It was originally in a bell tower that was demolished in 1792. Following this demolition, the clock was moved to the Cathedral Tower, where it was in operation until 1884. The clock was then placed in storage and forgotten until it was discovered in an attic of the cathedral in 1928. It was repaired and restored to working order in 1956, and is now displayed in the nave. In 2007, remedial work and repairs were carried out.

===Cathedral Close===
The cathedral close surrounds the cathedral, with the largest area to its western side. The close itself is bounded by Broad Walk and the West Walk, with the larger boundaries comprising North Walk, Bishops Walk, with Exeter Street to its east, and De Vaux Place to the south. The close contains a large number of listed buildings. The size of the close, Britain&#x27;s largest, and the range of historic buildings within it, make it &quot;unrivalled in Britain in terms of scale and beauty&quot;. Pevsner describes it as &quot;the most beautiful of England&#x27;s closes&quot;. The close has a preservation society dedicated to its protection. The close is entered via the High Street through the North Gate, listed at Grade I. The High Street ends at Choristers Square which has seven buildings listed at Grade I: Mompesson House, now owned by the National Trust and operated as a museum, and its fronting wall and gates; the College of Matrons; the walls, gates and piers to No.s 39 to 46; Hemingsby House; Wren Hall; and Braybrooke House. Grade II* listed buildings on the High Street and in Choristers Square include: No.s 48, 48A, 50 and 50A, which flank the North Gate; 51, 52 and 53A; No.s 55 and 55A; a former stable block; and the Hungerford Chantry. Grade II listed buildings on the square include: the walls and gates to No. 54; No. 55; No.s 56A, B, and C; No.s 57, 57A and 57B; and No. 58; and a K6 telephone kiosk.

The close proper is bounded by the West Walk and the Broad Walk. It contains six Grade I listed buildings; The King&#x27;s House, which is now home of Salisbury Museum; Myles Place, No. 68, and its fronting walls; the Walton Canonry; the Leaden Hall and the South Gate. There are also six buildings listed Grade II*: The Wardrobe, which houses a military museum; Arundells, the former home of Edward Heath; the North Canonry and Gatehouse; the Old Deanery; No.s 68A and 73; and De Vaux House. There are 19 Grade II listed buildings in the close. These include: the gates and stables to Arundells; the gates and garden house at The North Canonry, No. 60; the College of Sarum St Michael, and its gates; urns in the garden of No. 68; the gates and walling to No. 69; the lodges, gates and walls to No. 70; No.s 71, 71A and 71B and their boundary walls; the South Canonry; No. 72 The Close; and No.s 1-7 De Vaux Place.
Between De Vaux Place and the cathedral stands Salisbury Cathedral School, the main building of which, originally the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, is listed at Grade I. The school lodge, and its adjoining wall, as well as a wall opposite surrounding the cathedral lawn, are all listed at Grade II. Continuing north along Bishop&#x27;s Walk are five more listed structures; No. 5, The Close, listed II*, and its garden wall and bollards, both listed at Grade II; and the Diocesan Registry, and The Deanery, both listed at Grade II*. The eastern boundary of the close follows Exeter Street, and contains four listed structures, all at Grade I. These are: the boundary wall itself; Bishops Gate and St Anne&#x27;s Gate; and Malmesbury House.
The northern end of the close terminates with the North Walk. This has one Grade I listed building, Sarum College, at No. 19, The Close. There are 23 Grade II* buildings: Nos. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14 and 14A, 16 to 18 inclusive, 20 and 21, 23 to 27 inclusive, 29, 30, 31, 33 to 36 inclusive, and 38. Buildings listed Grade II include: No. 10; the stableyard surface and gates to No. 11; No. 13; the forecourt walls to Malmesbury House; the garden walls and gateway to No. 16, two sets of walls at No. 17, the walls at No.s 18 and 19, railings and gates at; the stables to No.s 21 and 21A, its gate piers, its garden wall, and a commemorative arch set into the wall; No. 22; the railings to No.s 25 and 26; No. 28; the railings to No. 31 and the wall to No.s 32 and 33; the railings to Nos. 36A and 36B and 37.

==Depictions in art, literature and television==

The cathedral is the subject of a famous painting by John Constable. As a gesture of appreciation for John Fisher, Bishop of Salisbury, who commissioned this painting, Constable included the bishop and his wife in the canvas (bottom left). The view depicted in the paintings has changed very little in almost two centuries.

The cathedral is apparently the inspiration for William Golding&#x27;s novel &quot;The Spire&quot;, in which the fictional Dean Jocelin makes the building of a cathedral spire his life&#x27;s work. The construction of the cathedral is an important plot point in Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Sarum&quot;, which explores the historical settlement of the Salisbury area. The cathedral has been mentioned by the author Ken Follett as one of two models for the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral in his historical novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. It was also used for some external shots in the 2010 miniseries based on Follett&#x27;s book and was shown as it is today in the final scene. Another mention of this cathedral was made by Jonathan Swift in The Travels of Gulliver, part II, chapter IV, making a comparison between its spire and the tower of the main temple of Lorbrulgrud, Brobdingnag&#x27;s capital.

In 1990, Channel 4 marked the official launch of its NICAM stereo service with a live broadcast of Mahler&#x27;s 9th Symphony from the cathedral. The cathedral was the setting for the 2005 BBC television drama &quot;Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle&quot;, written by Rhidian Brook and directed by Susanna White. Kevin McCloud climbed the cathedral in his programme called &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down!&quot; in which he climbed high structures to conquer his fear of heights. The cathedral was the subject of a Channel 4 &quot;Time Team&quot; programme which was first broadcast on 8 February 2009.

==Diocese, dean and chapter==
The cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Salisbury and is the seat of the Bishop of Salisbury. The Right Reverend Stephen Lake was installed as bishop in 2022. The Dean is Nicholas Papadopulos, installed in 2018. The Canon Precentor is Anna Macham, installed in 2019, the Canon Chancellor is Ed Probert, installed in 2004 and the Canon Treasurer is Kenneth Padley, installed in 2022.

==Music==
===Organ===
Throughout its history, there have been several organs in the cathedral. Of particular interest are the two fine four-manual instruments, the first by Renatus Harris (–1724), which was replaced at the end of the 18th century, and the current organ, whose present fame has eclipsed the reputation of the former.

The four-manual instrument by Harris had been installed in 1710. The abundance of reed stops was typical of Harris&#x27; instruments and bears witness to the influence of the classical French organ. The instrument, not only spectacular in style but also of good quality, had remained practically unaltered (beyond occasional repairs) for nearly 80 years, until it was replaced at the same time as the cathedral was &quot;restored&quot; by James Wyatt between 1789 and 1792: the Bishop had convinced George III to furnish the cathedral with a new instrument once the work was complete.

This organ, by Samuel Green, was presented by the king in 1792 and was installed on top of the stone screen, which, unusually, did not divide the choir from the nave, but rather came from an unknown location in the cathedral. The organ was later taken out and moved to St Thomas&#x27;s Church. When the new Willis organ was installed, its distinct sound from 55 powerfully-voiced stops, directly in the choir with little casework, was quite a contrast to Green&#x27;s more gentle 23-stop instrument.

The present-day instrument was built in 1877 by Henry Willis &amp; Sons. Walter Alcock, who was organist of the cathedral from 1916, oversaw a strictly faithful restoration of the famous Father Willis organ, completed in 1934, even going to such lengths as to refuse to allow parts of the instrument to leave the cathedral in case any unauthorised tonal alterations were made without his knowledge, while allowing some discrete additions in the original style of the organ (as well as modernisation of the organ&#x27;s actions) by Henry Willis III, the grandson of Father Willis. The instrument was extensively restored between 2019 and 2020.

===Organists===

It is recorded that in 1463 John Kegewyn was organist of Salisbury Cathedral. Among the notable organists of more recent times have been a number of composers and well-known performers including Bertram Luard-Selby, Charles Frederick South, Walter Alcock, David Valentine Willcocks, Douglas Albert Guest, Christopher Dearnley, Richard Godfrey Seal and the BBC presenter Simon Lole.

===Choir===
Salisbury Cathedral Choir holds annual auditions for boys and girls aged 7–9 years old for scholarships to Salisbury Cathedral School, which housed in the former Bishop&#x27;s Palace. The boys&#x27; choir and the girls&#x27; choir (each 16 strong) sing alternate daily Evensong and Sunday Matins and Eucharist services throughout the school year. There are also many additional services during the Christian year particularly during Advent, Christmas, Holy Week, and Easter. The Advent &quot;From Darkness to Light&quot; services are the best known. Choristers come from across the country and some board. Six lay vicars (adult men) comprise the rest of the choir, singing tenor, alto and bass parts. In 1993, the cathedral was the venue for the first broadcast of Choral Evensong (the long-running BBC Radio 3 programme) to be sung by a girls&#x27; cathedral choir.

<doc id="72317" wikidata="Q124612" url="?curid=72317" title="Creature from the Black Lagoon">
<text>Creature from the Black Lagoon is a 1954 American black-and-white 3D monster horror film produced by William Alland and directed by Jack Arnold, from a screenplay by Harry Essex and Arthur Ross and a story by Maurice Zimm. It stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, Nestor Paiva, and Whit Bissell. The film&#x27;s plot follows a group of scientists who encounter a piscine amphibious humanoid in the waters of the Amazon; the Creature, also known as the Gill-man, was played by Ben Chapman on land and by Ricou Browning underwater. Produced and distributed by Universal-International, &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; premiered in Detroit on February 12, 1954, and was released on a regional basis, opening on various dates.

&quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; was filmed in three dimensions (3D) and originally projected by the polarized light method. The audience wore viewers with gray polarizing filters, similar to the viewers most commonly used today. Because the brief 1950s 3D film fad had peaked in mid-1953 and was fading fast in early 1954, many audiences actually saw the film &quot;flat&quot;, in two dimensions (2D). Typically, the film was shown in 3D in large downtown theaters and flat in smaller neighborhood theaters. In 1975, &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; was released to theaters in the red-and-blue-glasses anaglyph 3D format, which was also used for a 1980 home video release on Beta and VHS videocassettes.
==Plot==

A geology expedition in the Amazon uncovers fossilized evidence (a skeletal hand with webbed fingers) from the Devonian period that provides a direct link between land and sea animals. Expedition leader Dr. Carl Maia orders his two assistants to stay in camp while he visits the marine biology institute.

Carl reunites with his friend and former student, ichthyologist Dr. David Reed. David works at an aquarium in California, but more recently, he has been a guest at Carl&#x27;s institute in Brazil to study lungfish. David persuades his boss, the financially minded Dr. Mark Williams, to fund a return expedition to the Amazon to look for the remainder of the skeleton.

Soon after Carl leaves camp, a piscine amphibious humanoid, a living member of the same species from which the fossil originated, becomes curious about the expedition&#x27;s camp. When its sudden appearance frightens the assistants, they panic and attack, and in response, the enraged Creature kills them both. 
The group goes aboard the tramp steamer &quot;Rita&quot;, captained by crusty Lucas. The expedition consists of David, Carl, Mark, David&#x27;s girlfriend and colleague Kay Lawrence, and another scientist, Dr. Edwin Thompson. When they arrive at the camp, they discover Carl&#x27;s assistants have been killed while he was away. Lucas suggests it was likely done by a jaguar, but the others are unsure.

A further excavation of the area where Carl found the fossil turns up nothing. Mark is ready to give up the search, but David suggests that perhaps thousands of years ago, the part of the embankment containing the rest of the skeleton fell into the water and was washed downriver, broken up by the current. Carl says the tributary empties into a lagoon. Lucas calls it the &quot;Black Lagoon&quot;, a paradise from which no one has ever returned. The scientists decide to risk it, unaware that the Creature - the amphibious &quot;Gill-man&quot; - that killed Carl&#x27;s assistants has been watching them.

Taking notice of the beautiful Kay, the Creature follows the &quot;Rita&quot; all the way downriver to the Black Lagoon. Once the expedition arrives, David and Mark go diving to collect rock samples from the lagoon floor. After they return, Kay goes swimming and is stalked underwater by the Creature, who then gets briefly caught in one of the ship&#x27;s drag lines. Although it escapes, the Creature leaves a claw behind in the net, revealing its existence.

After subsequent encounters with the Creature claim the lives of Lucas&#x27;s crew members, it attacks Kay and attempts to abduct her, but it is captured and locked in a cage aboard the &quot;Rita&quot;. During the night, it escapes and attacks Edwin, who was guarding it. Edwin smashes the Creature with a lantern, driving it off, but he is severely injured. Following this incident, David decides they should return to civilization. Mark, who is obsessed with capturing (or killing) the Creature, objects. As the &quot;Rita&quot; tries to leave, they find the Creature has blocked the lagoon&#x27;s entrance with fallen logs. While the others attempt to remove the logs, Mark is mauled to death while trying to capture the Creature single-handed underwater. The Creature then climbs aboard the &quot;Rita&quot; and approaches Kay from behind. She screams as the Creature grabs her, taking her away to its cavern lair. David, Lucas, and Carl pursue them, rescuing Kay and riddling the Creature with bullets. It retreats to the lagoon, where its body sinks into the watery depths.

==Production==

Producer William Alland was attending a 1941 dinner party during the filming of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (in which he played the reporter Thompson) when Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa told him about the myth of a race of half-fish, half-human creatures in the Amazon River. Alland wrote story notes titled &quot;The Sea Monster&quot; 10 years later, using &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as inspiration. In December 1952, Maurice Zimm expanded this into a treatment, which Harry Essex and Arthur Ross rewrote as &quot;The Black Lagoon&quot;. Following the success of the 3D film &quot;House of Wax&quot; in 1953, Jack Arnold was hired to direct the film in the same format.

The designer of the approved Gill-man was Disney animator Milicent Patrick, though her role was deliberately downplayed by make-up artist Bud Westmore, who for half a century received sole credit for the creature&#x27;s conception. Jack Kevan, who worked on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) and made prosthetics for amputees during World War II, created the bodysuit, while Chris Mueller Jr. sculpted the head.

Ben Chapman portrayed the Gill-man for the majority of the scenes shot at Universal City, California. The on-water scenes were filmed at Park Lake on the Universal back lot. The costume made sitting impossible for Chapman for the 14 hours of each day that he wore it, and it overheated easily. Due to these difficulties, Chapman often stayed in the studio&#x27;s back-lot lake, frequently requesting to be hosed down. He also could not see very well while wearing the headpiece, which caused him to scrape Julie Adams&#x27; head against the wall when carrying her in the grotto scenes.

Ricou Browning played the Gill-man in the underwater shots, which were filmed by the second unit in Wakulla Springs, Florida. While filming underwater, Browning reportedly held his breath for up to four minutes at a time. In a 2013 interview, Browning clarified: &quot;If you&#x27;re not doing anything at all, four minutes is possible, but not if you&#x27;re moving in the water. If you&#x27;re swimming fast or fighting, you use up a lot of oxygen, and it cuts it down to, at the most, two minutes&quot;.

==Reception and analysis==
Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: &quot;Archetypal &#x27;50s monster movie has been copied so often that some of the edge is gone, but ... is still entertaining, with juicy atmosphere and luminous underwater photography sequences&quot;. Film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 80%, based on , with an overall rating average of 7.10/10. The consensus calls it &quot;a solid, atmospheric creature feature that entertains without attempting to be deeper than it needs&quot;. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Gill-man – Nominated Villain

Psychoanalyst Barbara Creed provided a feminist reading of classical movie monsters like the Creature or the Phantom of the Opera, arguing that despite their superficially masculine characterizations, their antagonization of a powerful male hero instead positions them as opponents of the patriarchal social order, thus imbuing them with feminine traits and creating a sympathetic connection between them and the women they victimize.

==Sequels and remakes==
===Sequels===
&quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; spawned two sequels: &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot; (1955), which was also filmed and released in 3D in hopes of reviving the format, and &quot;The Creature Walks Among Us&quot; (1956), filmed in 2D. A comedic appearance with Abbott and Costello on an episode of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; aired prior to the first film&#x27;s release. The appearance is commonly known as &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;.

===Cancelled remakes===

In 1982, John Landis wanted Jack Arnold to direct a remake of the film, and Nigel Kneale was commissioned to write the screenplay. Kneale completed the script, which involved a pair of creatures, one destructive and the other calm and sensitive, being persecuted by the United States Navy. A decision to make the film in 3D led to the remake being canceled by producers at Universal, both for budgetary concerns and to avoid a clash with &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;.

In 1992, John Carpenter was developing the remake at Universal. He originally hired Bill Phillips to write the script, while Rick Baker was hired to create the 3D model of the Creature, but the project never got the green light. Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris wrote a new script, and Universal offered Peter Jackson the director&#x27;s chair in 1995, but he chose to work instead on &quot;King Kong&quot;.

In February 1996, Ivan Reitman was planning to direct the remake, but it never materialized. With the financial success of &quot;The Mummy&quot; remake in May 1999, the development of the &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; remake was revived. In December 2001, Gary Ross signed on to write and produce the remake with his father, Arthur A. Ross, one of the original&#x27;s writers. He told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;: &quot;The story my father wrote embodies the clash between primitive men and civilized men, and that obviously makes it a fertile area for re-examination&quot;.

In August 2002, Guillermo del Toro, a fan of the original feature, was attached to direct a remake. He had hoped to do a story focused more on the Creature&#x27;s viewpoint while also letting him have a successful romantic liaison. He later went on to turn this idea into the 2017 film &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; after Universal rejected the concept. Because of these creative clashes and his commitments to many other projects, Universal dropped del Toro and hired Tedi Sarafian (credited on &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;) to write a script in March 2003.

In October 2005, Breck Eisner signed on as director. He said to be a fan of the film: &quot;As a kid, I remember loving Jack Arnold&#x27;s original version of this film. What I really want to do is update an iconic image from the &#x27;50s and bring in more of the sci-fi sensibility of &quot;Alien&quot; or John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982)&quot;. Ross said in March 2007 the Gill-man&#x27;s origin would be reinvented, with him being the result of a pharmaceutical corporation polluting the Amazon.

However, the production was delayed by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike; as a result, Eisner instead made &quot;The Crazies&quot; (2010), the number-one project on his priority list. His new goal was to finish &quot;The Crazies&quot; and then begin filming &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; in Manaus, Brazil, and on the Amazon River in Peru. Eisner was inspired to shoot on location by the film &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, and the boat set had been built. Eisner continued to rewrite the script, which was to be a summer blockbuster full of &quot;action and excitement, but [still] scary&quot;. Eisner spent six months designing the new incarnation of the Gill-man with Mark McCreery (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and Davy Jones&#x27; designer). The director said the new design was &quot;very faithful to the original, but updated&quot; and that the Gill-man would still remain sympathetic. In 2009, it was reported that Carl Erik Rinsch might direct a remake that would be produced by Marc Abraham, Eric Newman, and Gary Ross; however, a project featuring the ensemble had been abandoned by 2011.

In March 2012, Universal announced that a remake was in production and would simply be titled &quot;The Black Lagoon&quot; rather than &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; to distinguish between the two versions. In October, the studio hired Dave Kajganich to write the film. The film was expected to hit theaters by May 2014 but was ultimately canceled. In 2020, Universal was considering Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans
for a remake.

===Reboot===
Universal Pictures, beginning as early as 2014, began developing a shared universe of rebooted modern-day versions of their classic Universal Monsters, with the studio having various films in different stages of development. The series began with &quot;The Mummy&quot; (2017) and was intended to be followed by the remake of &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; in 2019 prior to the critical and commercial failure of &quot;The Mummy&quot;. &quot;The Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; was a remake also intended to be developed within the reboot with a story written by Jeff Pinkner and a script written by Will Beall. In June, Kurtzman revealed that the Gill-man in this film would be from the Amazon, but on November 8, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the &quot;Dark Universe&quot; even further in doubt. In January 2019, the &quot;Dark Universe&quot; film series was officially scrapped.

In August 2024, it was announced that James Wan was in talks to direct a remake of &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. Sean Tretta was reported to be set to write the screenplay based on a treatment by Wan, Rafael Jordan, and Bryan Coyne.

===Legacy===
* The 2017 film &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; was partly inspired by Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s childhood memories of &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;; he wished to see the Gill-man and the film&#x27;s co-star succeed in their &quot;romance&quot;.
* The fossil species &quot;Eucritta melanolimnetes&quot; (&quot;true creature&quot; + &quot;from the black lagoon&quot;) is named after the film.

<text>The Olympic Oath (distinct from the Olympic creed) is a solemn promise made by one athlete, judge or official, and one coach at the Opening Ceremony of each Olympic Games. Each oath taker is from the host nation and takes the oath on behalf of all athletes, officials, or coaches at the Games. The athletes&#x27; oath was first introduced for the 1920 Summer Olympic Games, with oaths for the officials and coaches added in 1972 and 2010. The oath is usually said in the language of the nation which is hosting the games; however, in 1994 both the athletes&#x27; and officials&#x27; oaths were said in English. Until the 1984 games the oath takers swore upon their nation&#x27;s flag; since then all have taken the oath whilst holding the Olympic Flag. All three of the oaths were combined into one beginning at the 2018 Winter Games.

The inspiration for an oath came from the Ancient Olympic Games where competitors swore on a statue of Zeus. An oath for the athletes was first thought of in 1906, following unsportsmanlike incidents. An athletes&#x27; oath was introduced for the 1920 games and Victor Boin was the first person to take the oath on behalf of all athletes. Giuliana Minuzzo was the first woman to take the athletes&#x27; oath at the winter games in 1956, while Heidi Schuller did likewise at the Summer Olympics in 1972. The first Olympic Champion to take the oath was Rudolf Ismayr, who took it at the 1936 Games. The only occasion where more than one person has said an oath occurred at the 1988 Summer Olympics when Hur Jae and Shon Mi-Na took the athletes&#x27; oath together, until 2021 when rules around gender equality decreed that each oath would be taken by a man and a woman. The oath has changed over the years to remove nationalism and to reflect drugs in sport and equality.

An oath for the officials was first discussed in the 1950s. It was not, however, until 1970 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to include an oath of the officials as well as athletes at the Olympic Games. The first oath for the officials was taken by Fumio Asaki at the 1972 Winter Olympic Games. When the Youth Olympics were created the IOC decided to have an oath for coaches as they realised that young athletes look to them particularly. This was introduced into the adult games for the 2012 edition.

==History==
An oath was an idea taken from the Ancient Olympic Games where competitors swore an oath beside a statue of Zeus. A call for an oath was announced as early as 1906 by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president and founder Pierre de Coubertin in the &quot;Revue Olympique&quot; (&quot;Olympic Review&quot; in French). This was done in an effort to ensure fairness and impartiality. 
The Olympic Oath was first taken at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp by the fencer Victor Boin. 
Boin&#x27;s oath in 1920 was:

:&quot;We swear. We will take part in the Olympic Games in a spirit of chivalry, for the honour of our country and for the glory of sport.&quot;

At a winter sports week in Chamonix in 1924, which were retrospectively call the Olympic Games in 1926, all the competitors took an Olympic style oath and were led by Camille Mandrillon. Rudolf Ismayr was the first Olympic Champion to take the oath, doing so at the 1936 Games in Berlin. In 1956 Giuliana Chenal-Minuzzo became the first woman to recite the oath.

In 1961, &quot;swear&quot; was replaced by &quot;promise&quot; and &quot;the honour of our countries&quot; by &quot;the honour of our teams&quot; in an effort to eliminate nationalism at the Olympic Games. Therefore the oath was as follows:

:&quot;In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams.&quot;

An oath for the officials had been discussed since the 1950s when the International Amateur Boxing Association asked all its officials to undertake an oath. In 1970 the IOC amended rule 57 of the charter and decreed that a judge from the host nation would also take an oath. The first judges&#x27; oath was taken at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo by Fumio Asaki and Heinz Pollay performed the task at that year&#x27;s summer games in Munich.

The Munich games saw Heidi Schüller become the first female athlete to take the oath at the Summer Games; women had been competing at the games since 1900. At the 1988 Games the athletes&#x27; oath for the first time was undertaken by more than one person, when Hur Jae and Shon Mi-Na took the oath in unison.

All persons up until the 1980 Games swore the oath on their country&#x27;s flag. However, in an attempt to eliminate nationalism from the oath ceremony, all have sworn on the Olympic Flag since the 1984 games. The oaths are usually spoken in the language of the host nation (or athlete&#x27;s mother tongue – Bojan Krizaj represented Yugoslavia but spoke Slovenian), but in 1994 both of the oaths were conducted in English rather than Norwegian.

In 1999, the IOC created the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in an effort to form a more organized battle against doping. Thus, the Athletes Oath was amended to include references to doping and drugs. In 2010 the IOC recognised that younger athletes, in particular, are influenced by their coaches. At the first Youth Olympic Games, coaches were also required to undertake an oath for this reason. With effect from the 2018 Winter Olympics, the three oaths were combined into one, led by an athlete, although representatives of judges and coaches are still involved in the taking of the oath. In July 2021 the oath was further refined to highlight inclusion and equality. The changes to the wording came from the IOC Athletes’ Commission. In addition the number of oath takers at each games were expanded from three to six, to ensure a member of each gender was represented in each oath as part of a commitment to promote women in sport at all levels and in all structures, as stated in the Olympic Charter.

===Athletes&#x27; Oath===
The chosen athlete, a representative of all the participating Olympic competitors, recited the following from 2000 until 2016:

:&quot;In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, committing ourselves to a sport without doping and without drugs, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams.&quot;

===The Officials&#x27; Oath===
The judge/official, also from the host nation, likewise held a corner of the flag and said the following:

:&quot;In the name of all the judges and officials, I promise that we shall officiate in these Olympic Games with complete impartiality, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship.&quot;

===The Coaches&#x27; Oath===
At the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, an additional oath was taken by a coach; this was added to the protocol for the 2012 Games:

:&quot;In the name of all the coaches and other members of the athletes&#x27; entourage, I promise that we shall commit ourselves to ensuring that the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play is fully adhered to and upheld in accordance with the fundamental principles of Olympism.&quot;

===Unified Oath===
Beginning in PyeongChang at the 2018 Winter Olympics, there was only one oath.

A representative for the athletes, judges, and coaches each recites the following lines respectively:
:&quot;In the name of the athletes.&quot;
:&quot;In the name of all judges.&quot;
:&quot;In the name of all the coaches and officials.&quot;

The athletes&#x27; representative then completes the oath:
:&quot;We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play. We all commit ourselves to sport without doping and cheating. We do this, for the glory of sport, for the honour of our teams and in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism.&quot;

===Equality changes===
In July 2021 the oath was updated to include elements around inclusion and equality. The oath from now on would be said by a man and a woman of each discipline.

The representatives for the athletes, judges, and coaches each recites the following lines respectively:
:&quot;In the name of the athletes.&quot;
:&quot;In the name of all judges.&quot;
:&quot;In the name of all the coaches and officials.&quot;

The athletes&#x27; representative then completes the oath:
:&quot;We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality. Together we stand in solidarity and commit ourselves to sport without doping, without cheating, without any form of discrimination. We do this for the honour of our teams, in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, and to make the world a better place through sport.&quot;

<text>Miranda do Douro (; ; ) is a city and a municipality in the district of Bragança, northeastern Portugal. The population in 2011 was 7,482, in an area of 487.18 km2. The town proper had a population of 1,960 in 2001. Referred to as the &quot;Cidade Museu&quot; of the Trás-os-Montes region, it is located 86 kilometres from Bragança, preserving many of its medieval and Renaissance-era traditions and architecture. It has a language of its own, Mirandese, which enjoys official status in Portugal, in addition to cultural and historical discontinuity with the rest of the Portuguese state. The town is located on the border with Spain, with the Douro River separating the two countries. The nearest town in Spain is Zamora.

The present mayor is Artur Manuel Rodrigues Nunes (Socialist). The municipal holiday is on 10 July.

==History==
The origin of Miranda do Douro as a populated place is still discussed by historians, but archeologist discoveries give evidence that inhabitants had been living there during the Bronze Age. Around AD 716, the Moors defeated local Visigothic tribes, and occupied some of the lands, calling the area &quot;Mir-Hândul&quot;.

By the late 11th century, León possessed the region as a stepping-stone to Portugal. The settlement of the village of Miranda developed through the initiative of King Denis, in an area that lay between the lateral slopes of the Douro and Fresno Rivers. It was in Miranda that the Treaty of Alcanices was signed between Denis and Ferdinand IV of Castile, setting the border between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Crown of Castile.

Miranda was founded on 18 December 1286, and immediately elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; (), with one of its prerequisites declaring that the administrative division would be a Crown fief. From that period forward, Miranda became progressively one of the most important towns that skirted the Trás-os-Montes region.

The Castilians occupied Miranda do Douro during the late 14th century, and would remain there until they were expelled by John I of Portugal. On 10 July 1545, King John III elevated &quot;Miranda do Douro&quot; to the status of city, at the same time becoming the first diocese in Trás-os-Montes (in a papal bull on 22 May 1545 by Pope Paul III, which segmented a major part of the archdiocese of Braga. Miranda, therefore, became the capital of the Trás-os-Montes, seat of the bishopric (that included the residence of the bishop, canons and ecclesiastical authorities), military governorship and civil centre.

In 1762, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the army of Charles III of Spain invaded the Trás-os-Montes. During the course of his invasion, the gunpowder magazine (with over 500 barrels of powder) was hit by a cannon, destroying the four towers of the castle and many of the barrios in the vicinity. Approximately a third of the city&#x27;s population (about 400 residents) were killed, resulting in the ruin of the religious, demographic and urbanized portion of Miranda. It was almost two years later (1764) that friar Aleixo Miranda Henriques (then the twenty-third bishop) would abandon Miranda, moving to Bragança, which had become a rival episcopal seat in the northeast part of Portugal. By 1680, it was the only ecclesiastical seat in the region.

The area was served by a narrow gauge railway, the Sabor line &quot;(Linha do Sabor)&quot;, which ran over 100 km between Duas Igrejas-Miranda and the southern terminus at Pocinho, where connections could be made to the main line to Oporto. The Sabor line closed in 1988.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Miranda do Douro is located in a region that skirts the border between the Portuguese Trás-os-Montes region, and the Spanish autonomous community of Castile and León. The relief in this region is influenced by hard quartzite deposits near the border region, making erosion difficult, resulting in high escarpments and cliffs. The soils are composed of schists and granite bedrocks.

====Ecoregions/Protected areas====
The &quot;Parque Natural do Douro Internacional&quot; (), which encompasses the municipalities of Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, Freixo de Espada à Cinta, Miranda do Douro and Mogadouro, includes an area of , along the border portion of the Douro River. It was created on 11 May 1998 to encompass the constituent territories that encompass the Rivers Douro and Águeda, along the Spain-Portugal border that include similar geological and climatic conditions, and to help support flora and fauna in the region, while allowing appropriate human activities. The creation of the complementary &quot;Parque Natural de Arribes&quot; in Spain, allowed the systematic protection of an area that encompassed the larger ecosystem and biome.

===Climate===
Miranda do Douro has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;). Due to its inland location in the &quot;Nordeste Transmontano&quot;, the area experiences extreme weather fluctuations. A common saying of the region goes: &quot;Em Miranda há nove meses de Inverno e três de Inferno (&quot;In Miranda there are nine months of winter and three months of Hell&quot;)&quot;. Summers tend to be dry and warm; while winters are rigorously cold with some snowfall, having average minimum temperatures hovering around in January, and frequently falling negative, with 70 days of frost per year on average. The summer is completely opposite: hot and dry with maximum temperatures hovering around .

===Human geography===
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Constantim e Cicouro
* Duas Igrejas ()
* Genísio ()
* Ifanes e Paradela
* Malhadas
* Miranda do Douro ()
* Palaçoulo ()
* Picote ()
* Póvoa ()
* São Martinho de Angueira ()
* Sendim e Atenor
* Silva e Águas Vivas
* Vila Chã de Braciosa ()

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Miranda do Douro is twinned with:
* Aranda de Duero, Spain
* Bimenes, Spain
==Culture==
The city has been isolated from the rest of the country for many centuries, so the ancestral way of life is still vivid in the traditions and even in the language (see below). Apart from the distance, the weather conditions are also an adversary, as it is very cold and snowy in winter, and very dry and hot in summer.

Gastronomy is one of the local hallmarks, well within the tradition of Trás-os Montes. &quot;Posta à Mirandesa&quot;, a heavy, thick steak, is the traditional dish, known and imitated through the rest of the country. The wine from the region has a high alcoholic graduation (17–18°) and matches the regional cuisine well.

The city&#x27;s old quarter, with the cathedral, dates back to the Middle Ages. Most houses are small and one story high. Inside the old city proper lie the town hall and museum, the &quot;Museu da Terra de Miranda&quot; (museum of the lands of Miranda), which has displays of archaeological findings, farm life, local clothing, and traditional masks.

The city has no industries but depends on commercial activity, mainly the sale of house textiles and cutlery from the village of Palaçoulo. Spaniards come in great number on holidays and weekends. There are several hotels, among them the Pousada de Santa Catarina, which overlooks the Douro River.

===Mirandese language===
The surrounding area is home to the speakers of Mirandese (&quot;Mirandês&quot;), a language of the Astur-Leonese family, related to Asturian and Leonese. Mirandese was recognised in 1999 by the Portuguese state as co-official with Portuguese for local matters, and an estimate of between 10,000 and 15,000 people speak the language.

==Tourism==
Miranda do Douro is in the middle of Douro International Natural Park, also known as Parque Natural do Douro Internacional in Portuguese, which is a protected natural area located in northeastern Portugal and northwestern Spain. The natural park promotes the unique ecological and cultural heritage of the region.

The park is situated along the Douro River, which forms the border between Portugal and Spain for a significant portion of its course. It covers an area of approximately 85,000 hectares (210,000 acres), with about two-thirds of the park located in Portugal and the remaining third in Spain.

The walking trail from Miranda do Douro to São João das Arribas is a beautiful route in Portugal that offers stunning views of the Douro River and the surrounding landscapes. The trail starts in Miranda do Douro and leads to São João das Arribas, which is known for its impressive cliffs overlooking the Douro River.

<doc id="72325" wikidata="Q191632" url="?curid=72325" title="Decay energy">
<text>The decay energy is the energy change of a nucleus having undergone a radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is the process in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting ionizing particles and radiation. This decay, or loss of energy, results in an atom of one type (called the parent nuclide) transforming to an atom of a different type (called the daughter nuclide).

==Decay calculation==
The energy difference of the reactants is often written as &quot;Q&quot;:

:formula_1
:formula_2

Decay energy is usually quoted in terms of the energy units MeV (million electronvolts) or keV (thousand electronvolts):

: formula_3

Types of radioactive decay include
* gamma ray
* beta decay (decay energy is divided between the emitted electron and the neutrino which is emitted at the same time)
* alpha decay

The decay energy is the mass difference &quot;Δm&quot; between the parent and the daughter atom and particles. It is equal to the energy of radiation &quot;E&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; is the radioactive activity, i.e. the number of transforming atoms per time, &quot;M&quot; the molar mass, then the radiation power &quot;P&quot; is:
:formula_4
or
:formula_5
or
:formula_6

Example: 60Co decays into 60Ni. The mass difference &quot;Δm&quot; is 0.003u. The radiated energy is approximately 2.8MeV. The molar weight is 59.93. The half life &quot;T&quot; of 5.27 year corresponds to the activity , where N is the number of atoms per mol, and T is the half-life. Taking care of the units the radiation power for 60Co is 17.9W/g

Radiation power in &quot;W/g&quot; for several isotopes:
: 60Co: 17.9
: 238Pu: 0.57
: 137Cs: 0.6
: 241Am: 0.1
: 210Po: 140 (T = 136d)
: 90Sr: 0.9
: 226Ra: 0.02

For use in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) high decay energy combined with a long half life is desirable. To reduce the cost and weight of radiation shielding, sources that do not emit strong gamma radiation are preferred. This table gives an indication why - despite its enormous cost - with its roughly eighty year half life and low gamma emissions has become the RTG nuclide of choice. performs worse than on almost all measures, being shorter lived, a beta emitter rather than an easily shielded alpha emitter and releasing significant gamma radiation when its daughter nuclide decays, but as it is a high yield product of nuclear fission and easy to chemically extract from other fission products, Strontium titanate based RTGs were in widespread use for remote locations during much of the 20th century. Cobalt-60 while widely used for purposes such as food irradiation is not a practicable RTG isotope as most of its decay energy is released by gamma rays, requiring substantial shielding. Furthermore, its five-year half life is too short for many applications.

<doc id="72326" wikidata="Q602875" url="?curid=72326" title="Federalisation of the European Union">
<text>There is ongoing discussion about the extent to which the European Union (EU) has already turned from a confederation (a union of sovereign states) into a federation (a single federal state with a central government, consisting of a number of partially self-governing federated states) over the course of decades, and more importantly, to what degree it should continue to evolve in a federalist direction. , the EU has no formal plans to become a federation.

Since the 1950s, European integration has seen the development of a supranational system of governance, as its institutions move further from the concept of simple intergovernmentalism and more towards a federalised system. However, with the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, new intergovernmental elements have been introduced alongside the more federal systems, making it more difficult to define the EU. The European Union, which operates through a hybrid system of intergovernmentalism and supranationalism, is not officially a federation or even a confederation – though most contemporary scholars of federalism view it as a federal system.

==History==
A Pan-European movement gained some momentum from the 1920s with the creation of the Paneuropean Union, based on Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi&#x27;s 1923 manifesto &quot;Paneuropa&quot;, which presented the idea of a unified European State. This movement, led by Coudenhove-Kalergi and subsequently by Otto von Habsburg, is the oldest European unification movement. His ideas influenced Aristide Briand, who gave a speech in favour of a European Union in the League of Nations on 8 September 1929, and in 1930, who wrote his &quot;Memorandum on the Organization of a Regime of European Federal Union&quot; for the Government of France.

At the end of World War II, the political climate favoured unity in Western Europe, seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of nationalism which had devastated the continent. 
One of the first practical and successful proposals for European cooperation came in 1951 with the European Coal and Steel Community. Since then, the European Community has gradually evolved to Union in which a whole range of policy areas where its member states hope to benefit from working together.

The process of intergovernmentally pooling powers, harmonising national policies and creating and enforcing supranational institutions, is called European integration. Other than the vague aim of &quot;ever closer union&quot; in the 1983 Solemn Declaration on European Union, the Union (meaning its member governments) has no current policy to create a federal state.

Debate on European unity is often vague as to the boundaries of &#x27;Europe&#x27;. The word &#x27;Europe&#x27; is widely used as a synonym for the European Union, although most of the European continent&#x27;s geographical area is not in the EU, and some of the EU is outside of Europe (e.g. French Guiana). Most of Europe&#x27;s people do, however, live in the EU.

===Multi-speed integration===

The multi-speed Europe thesis envisions an alternative type of European integration, where the EU countries that want a more integrated EU can accelerate their own integration, whereas other countries may go at a slower pace or cease further integration altogether. Specific current examples include the Eurozone and the Schengen Area, which not all members have joined.

== Present situation ==

The European Union (EU) is not legally (&quot;de jure&quot;) a federation, although various academics have argued that it contains some federal characteristics. About how various scholars approach the issue, R. Daniel Kelemen of Rutgers University said: &quot;Unencumbered by the prejudice that the EU is &quot;sui generis&quot; and incomparable, federalism scholars now regularly treat the EU as a case in their comparative studies (Friedman-Goldstein, 2001; Filippov, Ordeshook, Shevtsova, 2004; Roden, 2005; Bednar, 2006). For the purposes of the present analysis, the EU has the necessary minimal attributes of a federal system and crucially the EU is riven with many of the same tensions that afflict federal systems.&quot;

According to Joseph H. H. Weiler, &quot;Europe has charted its own brand of constitutional federalism&quot;. Jean-Michel Josselin and Alain Marciano see the European Court of Justice as being a primary force behind building a federal legal order in the Union with Josselin stating that &quot;A complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straightforwardly replace the principality of the member states vis-à-vis the Union by that of the European citizens. … As a consequence, both confederate and federate features coexist in the judicial landscape.&quot;

Thomas Risse and Tanja A. Börzel wrote: &quot;The EU only lacks two significant features of a federation. First, the Member States remain the &#x27;masters&#x27; of the treaties, i.e., they have the exclusive power to amend or change the constitutive treaties of the EU. Second, the EU lacks a real &#x27;tax and spend&#x27; capacity, in other words, there is no fiscal federalism.&quot;

Other academics have argued that the EU is unlikely to evolve into a unified federal state. Kelemen has taken this view himself in a paper co-written with Andy Tarrant, arguing that limits placed on the bureaucratic capacity of the European institutions – such as the relatively small size of the European Commission – form a barrier to the creation of a federal European state. In their words: &quot;widespread political opposition to the creation of anything approximating a large, unified executive bureaucracy in Brussels has long-since ended hopes, for the few who harboured them, of creating a European superstate.&quot; Some common points in this context are that the European budget is very small and does not finance a lot of the economic activity of the European Union; that each member state of the European Union has its own foreign relations and its own military; that it is often the case that European Union member states decide to opt out of agreements which they oppose; and that member states still retain sovereignty over a large number of areas which might be expected to be transferred to a federal authority under a federal system. One important fact is that treaties must be agreed by all member states even if a particular treaty has support among the vast majority of the population of the European Union. Member states may also want legally binding guarantees that a particular treaty will not affect a nation&#x27;s position on certain issues.

Use of the word &#x27;federal&#x27; is itself the cause of some disagreement. Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing found opposition from the United Kingdom towards including the word &quot;federal&quot; in the proposed European Constitution, and hence replaced the word with &quot;Community&quot;.

In November 2021, the incoming German government, the Scholz cabinet, called for European federalism in the coalition agreement and wanted to help achieve this.

It is located at the confluence of the Segre and the Valira rivers. The city is in the local region of Urgellet, a Pyrenean region formed by 16 municipalities of Alt Urgell. Urgellet and Andorra were the originary County of Urgell with capital in la Seu d&#x27;Urgell before the county expansion to the south.

Alt Urgell is the gateway to the state of Andorra and the proximity to this important population center and economic activity is one of the main reasons for the current vigour of the city of la Seu d&#x27;Urgell within Alt Pirineu.

The town&#x27;s patron saints are Saint Ot of Urgell, Saint Sebastian, and the Virgin of Urgell. While the Virgin of Núria and Sant Ermengol are the main patrons of the diocese of Urgell, Sant Ermengol is the most prominent in the city than other patrons. Probably that is why there are various events throughout the year dedicated to Sant Ermengol, such as the Sant Ermengol Fair, one of the oldest in Catalonia, and the altarpiece of Sant Ermengol.

The Segre Olympic Park, built in 1992 for the Barcelona Summer Olympic Games, is a pump-driven canoe and kayak sports venue located adjacent to the historical centre of la Seu d&#x27;Urgell.

==Name origins==
The name &quot;la Seu d&#x27;Urgell&quot;, in Latin &quot;Sedes Urgelli&quot;, is formed by two different words: &quot;Seu&quot; from the Latin &quot;Sedes&quot;, or seat, and &quot;Urgell&quot; a pre-Roman name. Catalan linguist Joan Coromines interpreted that the name is related to the presence of water.

The Iberian settlement of Arse-durgui (or Arse d&#x27;Urgui) was on the hill of Castellciutat. At that time the hill was called &quot;Puiolo Urgelli&quot;. Where there was the village of Arse-durgui they built the city of Urgell (in Latin &quot;civitas Orgellia&quot; and in Catalan &quot;ciutat d&#x27;Urgell&quot;) and here lies the origin of the name Castellciutat. Until the eighteenth century the town was known simply as &quot;Ciutat&quot; (City in English) and &quot;Castell&quot; (Castle) was added because the existence of an ancient castle that was home of the Counts of Urgell.

Shortly after the destruction of the former Orgellia new neighborhood arose, which became the new home of the Diocese of Urgell. Its name &quot;vicus Sedes Urgelli&quot; indicates that the town is the episcopal see of the Bishop of Urgell.

Over time, &quot;Sedes Urgelli&quot; took importance and lost the word &quot;vicus&quot; (denotes that it was a district) while &quot;civitas Orgellia&quot; lost the word &quot;Orgellia&quot; and becomes simply &quot;Civitas&quot; until the 18th century.

==Location==
The city is at the confluence of two rivers, the Segre and Gran Valira, located in a plain 7 km long and 691 meters high surrounded by high mountains, such as the Cadí mountain range. The plain is called plana de la Seu and was formed by the Segre river.

Because it is located at one of the major crossroads of communication in the Catalan Pyrenees, la Seu d&#x27;Urgell has had a unique and historic role in the county of Urgell. The roads to Andorra, Cerdanya and the low Segre all converge on la Seu d&#x27;Urgell.

Parallel to the Valira river rises a mountain range, where stand the remains of two great fortresses, the Ciutadella and Ciutat Castle (in Castellciutat), both of historic importance in the town. Small banks or open plains around the Segre are separated by gorges.

In the north, La Seu d&#x27;Urgell has borders with the municipality of les Valls de Valira, to the west with Montferrer i Castellbò where there is La Seu d&#x27;Urgell Airport (also known as Andorra-Pirineus airport), to the south-west with Ribera d&#x27;Urgellet, to the south-east with Alàs i Cerc, and to the north-east with Estamariu.

The municipality includes a small exclave to the east.

<text>Ricou Ren Browning (February 16, 1930 – February 27, 2023) was an American stunt performer, filmmaker and actor. A skilled swimmer, he was known for his innovative underwater stunt work, notably in the 1954 film &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, in which he portrayed the titular Gill-man during the film&#x27;s underwater scenes, and in the 1965 James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, for which he was the underwater sequences director. He was also the co-creator of the &quot;Flipper&quot; media franchise.

==Early life==
Ricou Ren Browning was born in Fort Pierce, Florida, on February 16, 1930. He majored in physical education at Florida State University.

==Career==

Browning started a career in water shows, moving on to produce shows. Browning worked at Wakulla Springs in the 1940s and learned to perform in underwater newsreels conceived by Newt Perry, who later took Browning along when he opened Weeki Wachee Springs.

While working at Wakulla Springs in 1953, Browning was asked to show around a film crew scouting for shooting locations. According to Browning, &quot;Their cameraman asked if I could swim in front of the cameras so they could get the perspective of the size of a human being against the fish and the grass. So I did.&quot; Days later, the crew offered Browning the role of the titular Gill-man in the film &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; (1954). Browning accepted, and played the Gill-man in the film&#x27;s underwater scenes, while actor Ben Chapman played the monster on land. During filming, Browning reportedly held his breath underwater for up to four minutes at a time. Browning reprised his role as the underwater Gill-man in two sequels, &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Creature Walks Among Us&quot; (1956).

Browning continued in movie production and joined Ivan Tors&#x27; studios in Florida, where he co-wrote and co-produced the 1963 film &quot;Flipper&quot; (about an intelligent bottlenose dolphin) together with Jack Cowden; Browning also directed the second unit underwater scenes for the film. Browning continued writing and directing for the subsequent &quot;Flipper&quot; television series that debuted in 1964.

He made his feature film directorial debut with &quot;Salty&quot; (1973), which he also co-wrote with Cowden, and directed the cult film &quot;Mr. No Legs&quot; (1978).

He worked as second unit director, stunt coordinator and underwater sequence director on a number of features, including the James Bond films &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), &quot;Around the World Under the Sea&quot; (1966), &quot;Island of the Lost&quot; (1967), &quot;Hello Down There&quot; (1969), and &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980).

A Florida native, Browning was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards&#x27; Monster Kid Hall of Fame.

Prior to his death, Browning was considered the last surviving original actor to portray any of the Universal Classic Monsters.

==Personal life and death==
Browning had two sons and two daughters. His wife, Fran, died in March 2020.

Browning died at home in Southwest Ranches, Florida, on February 27, 2023, at age 93.

<text>, which can be translated into &quot;overwork death&quot;, is a Japanese term relating to occupation-related sudden death.

The most common medical causes of karoshi deaths are heart attacks and strokes due to stress and malnourishment or fasting. Mental stress from the workplace can also cause workers to commit suicide in a phenomenon known as &quot;karōjisatsu&quot; ().

Karoshi is also widespread in other parts of Asia. Generally, deaths from overwork are a worldwide occurrence. For example, over 770 wage labourers die of overwork annually in Sweden, a country with robust labour regulations. The death toll is, however, expected to increase in the future.

==History==
The first case of karoshi was reported in 1969 with the stroke-related death of a 29-year-old male worker in the shipping department of Japan&#x27;s largest newspaper company.

In 1988, the Labor Force Survey reported that almost one fourth of the male working employees worked over 60 hours per week (equivalent of two-and-a-half days), which is 50% longer than a typical 40-hour (equivalent of over one-day-and-a-half) weekly working schedule. Realizing the seriousness and widespread nature of this emerging problem, a group of lawyers and doctors set up &quot;karoshi hotlines&quot; that are nationally available, dedicating to help those who seek consultation on karoshi-related issues.

Japan&#x27;s rise from the devastation of World War II to economic prominence and the huge war reparations they have paid in the post-war decades have been regarded as the trigger for what has been called a new epidemic. It was recognized that employees cannot work for 12 or more hours a day, 6–7 days a week, year after year, without suffering physically as well as mentally.

In an April 2013 International Labour Organization article about karoshi, the following four typical cases of karoshi were mentioned:

# Mr. A worked at a major snack food processing company for as long as 110 hours a week (equivalent of four and a half days) and died from a heart attack at the age of 34. His death was recognized as work-related by the Labour Standards Office.
# Mr. B, a bus driver, whose death was also recognized as work-related, worked 3,000 hours a year (equivalent of four months). He did not have a day off in the 15 days before he had a stroke at the age of 37.
# Mr. C worked in a large printing company in Tokyo for 4,320 hours a year including night work (equivalent of nearly six months, thus half a year) and died from a stroke at the age of 58. His widow received workers&#x27; compensation 14 years after her husband&#x27;s death.
# Ms. D, a 22-year-old nurse, died from a heart attack after 34 hours of continuous duty five times a month.
As well as physical pressure, mental stress from the workplace can cause karoshi. People who die by suicide due to mental stress are called &quot;karōjisatsu&quot; (). The ILO also lists some causes of overwork or occupational stress that include the following:
# All-night, late-night or holiday work, both long and excessive hours. During the long-term economic recession after the collapse of the bubble economy in the 1980s and 1990s, many companies reduced the number of employees. The total amount of work, however, did not decrease, forcing each employee to work harder.
# Stress accumulated due to frustration at not being able to achieve the goals set by the company. Even in economic recession, companies tended to demand excessive sales efforts from their employees and require them to achieve better results. This increased the psychological burden placed on the employees at work.
# Forced resignation, dismissal, and bullying. For example, employees who worked for a company for many years and saw themselves as loyal to the company were suddenly asked to resign because of the need for staff cutbacks.
# Suffering of middle management. They were often in a position to lay off workers and torn between implementing a corporate restructuring policy and protecting their staff.

==Karoshi Hotline==
In a 1988 report published by the Karoshi Hotline Network, the majority of the clients who consulted were not workers, but the wives of the workers who had either died because of karoshi or were at high risk of doing so. This indicated that those who were stressed out by work either did not realize the cause was overwork or were under social pressure to not express it explicitly or to seek help.

The Karoshi Hotline received the highest number of calls when it was first established in 1988. From 1988 to 1990, there were a total number of 1806 calls received. From 1990 to 2007, the number of calls received per year was lower, but has not shown a clear trend of further decrease.

==Effects on society==
Suicide can be induced by overwork-related stress or when people are dismissed. The deceased person&#x27;s families demand damages when such deaths occur. Life insurance companies started putting one-year exemption clauses in their contracts. They did this so that the person must wait one year to commit suicide in order for the family to receive the money.

There is a new movement of Japanese workers, formed as a result of karoshi. Compared to older Japanese people who often work overtime, young Japanese people are preferring part-time work. This is a new style of career choice for the young Japanese people who want to try out different jobs in order to figure out their own potential. These individuals work for &quot;hourly wages rather than regular salaries,&quot; and are called &quot;freeters.&quot; The number of freeters has increased throughout the years, from 200,000 in the 1980s to about 400,000 in 1997.

Freeters undergo a special kind of employment, defined by Atsuko Kanai as those who are currently employed and referred to as &quot;part-time workers or arbeit (temporary workers), who are currently employed but wish to be employed as part time workers, or who are currently not in the labor force and neither doing housework nor attending school but wish to be employed only as part-time workers.&quot;

==Government policies==
To provide a strategic plan to decrease the rate of karoshi, the National Institute of Health proposed the establishment of a comprehensive industrial health service program to reduce karoshi and other diseases caused by work-related stress in its 2005 annual report. The program requires communal efforts from the following groups:

#The government, as the policy maker, should promote shorter working hours, make health services readily accessible, encourage voluntary health examination and enhance the effectiveness of medical care.
#As the group that is more closely involved with the everyday health of employees, labor unions and employers should strive to implement and comply with government policies that focus on reducing work overtime and creating a better work environment.
#The employees themselves should recognize the need to take rests regularly and take preventive measures as needed.

As a formal response to this proposal, the Industry Safety and Health Act was revised in 2006. The Act established various terms that focus on work-related health issues, including mandatory health checks and consultations with professional medical personnel for employees who work long hours and have a higher probability of having work related illnesses.

==Corporate response==
Many companies have been making an effort to find a better work–life balance for their employees. Toyota Motor Company generally limits overtime to 360 hours a year (an average of 30 hours monthly), and, at some offices, issues public address announcements every hour after 7 p.m. pointing out the importance of rest and urging workers to go home. Nissan allows for remote work to make it easier to care for children or elderly parents. Dozens of large corporations have also implemented &quot;no overtime days&quot;, which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30 p.m. In 2007, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust &amp; Banking, a division of Japan&#x27;s largest banking group, started to allow employees to go home up to 3 hours early to care for children or elderly relatives. As of January 5, 2009, just 34 of the company&#x27;s 7,000 employees had signed up for the plan.

In February 2017, the Japanese government launched a campaign called &quot;Premium Friday&quot; asking companies to allow their workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of the month. The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm Dentsu who was doing more than 100 hours&#x27; overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as Honda, the drink maker Suntory and the confectioner Morinaga &amp; Company, have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the Nikkei business newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of Premium Friday or had plans to do so.

==Media attention==
The French-German TV channel Arte showed a documentary titled &quot;Alt in Japan&quot; (literal translation: &quot;Old in Japan&quot;) on 6 November 2006 dealing with older workers in Japan. In 2008, karoshi again made headlines: a death back in 2006 of a key Toyota engineer who averaged over 80 hours overtime each month was ruled the result of overwork. His family was awarded benefits after his case was reviewed.

Taiwanese media have reported a case of karoshi. An engineer had worked for Nanya Technology for 3 years from 2006 to 2009. It was found that he died in front of his computer surrounded by company documents. The prosecution found that the engineer had died of cardiogenic shock. The engineer&#x27;s parents said that he worked for 16–19 hours a day. CNN shows another reported case of karoshi in Taiwan. This short clip called &quot;The Dangers of Overwork&quot; shows a man who suffered a stroke and was left for three hours before being taken to the hospital. It was made known that physicians are starting to make people more aware of these health deficits due to overwork. More people have been visiting their doctor, recognizing signs and symptoms of overwork.

==In other countries==
The phenomenon of death by overwork is also widespread in other parts of Asia. 745,194 deaths worldwide were attributable to long working hours in 2016, based on WHO/ILO data.

===China===
In China, the analogous &quot;death by overwork&quot; concept is guolaosi (), which in 2014 was reported to be a problem in the country.
In Eastern Asian countries, like China, many businessmen work long hours and then feel the pressures of expanding and pleasing their networks. Making these connections is called building guanxi. Connections are a big part of the Chinese business world, and throughout different parts of China, businessmen would meet up in teahouses to take their job outside of the work atmosphere. It was important for businessmen to broaden their guanxi relationships, especially with powerful officials or bosses.

There is a lot of pressure to go to these nightclubs almost every night to drink heavily to move up in the business world. It has been shown that this kind of work could lead to health related problems down the line. For example, a businessman named Mr. Pan discussed with John Osburg, an anthropologist who wrote &quot;Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China&#x27;s New Rich,&quot; about his health and the need to continue working. Mr. Pan, the &#x27;biggest boss in Chengdu,&#x27; was in the hospital for &#x27;excessive drinking.&#x27; This has happened to him before. Mr. Pan said, &quot;I can&#x27;t stop or slow down. I have many people whose livelihoods depend on me (literally &#x27;depend on me to eat&#x27;). I&#x27;ve got about fifty employees and even more brothers. Their livelihoods depend on my success. I have to keep going.&quot;

===India===
Indian labour law has, in theory, offered protection to labour rights. However, the average office worker, women and the IT sector are unofficially forced to work overtime without overtime pay. In 2023, Narayana Murthy, co-founder and former CEO of Infosys, stated, “Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not-so-desirable habits from the West. My request is that our youngsters must say – ‘This is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week’. This is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War”. This sparked a national debate with many male CEO&#x27;s strongly supporting 70-hour workweeks to boost productivity and cover losses due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. A 70-hour workweek translates to working approximately 12 hours a day, for six days a week, a phenomenon unofficially occurring in the IT industry.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the term gwarosa (; alternatively romanised as kwarosa) is also used to refer to death by overworking. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world, even more so than Japan with the average being 42. This has caused many workers to feel the pressure of their jobs which has taken a toll on both their physical and mental health. Many have died from being overworked and the issue has only begun to gain more national attention due to many government workers having died from &quot;gwarosa&quot;. In 2018, the South Korean government enacted a law cutting working hours from 68 to 52.

===Sweden===
In Sweden the deaths due to excessive stress at work is expected to increase from the current level in the future.
A study conducted with researchers in cooperation with The Swedish work environment authority in 2019 concluded that 720 workers in Sweden already die every year due to stress from engaging in wage labour. This study sparked an increased amount of public debate.

<text>John IV Doukas Laskaris (or Ducas Lascaris) (, &quot;Iōannēs Doukas Laskaris&quot;; December 25, 1250 – 1305) was the fourth emperor of the Nicaean Empire from August 16, 1258 to December 25, 1261, one of the Greek successor states formed after the Sack of Constantinople by the Roman Catholics during the Fourth Crusade. He was the last emperor from the prominent Laskarid dynasty and the last to only rule Nicaea before the Reconquest of Constantinople by his successor in 1261.

==Biography==
John was a son of Theodore II Doukas Laskaris, the 3rd Emperor of Nicaea, and Elena of Bulgaria. His maternal grandparents were Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and his second wife Anna Maria of Hungary. Anna was originally named Mária and was the eldest daughter of Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania.

John IV was only seven years old when he inherited the throne on the death of his father. The young monarch was the last member of the Laskarid dynasty, which had done much to restore the Byzantine Empire. His regent was originally the bureaucrat George Mouzalon, but Mouzalon was murdered by the nobility, and the nobles&#x27; leader Michael Palaiologos usurped the post. Soon, on January 1, 1259, Palaiologos made himself co-emperor as Michael VIII. Michael was, in fact, John&#x27;s second cousin once removed, since they were both descended from Empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera.
After Michael&#x27;s conquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire on July 25, 1261, John IV was left behind at Nicaea, and was later blinded on Michael&#x27;s orders on his eleventh birthday, December 25, 1261. This made him ineligible for the throne, and he was exiled and imprisoned in a fortress in Bithynia. This action led to the excommunication of Michael VIII Palaiologos by the Patriarch Arsenius Autoreianus, and a later revolt led by a Pseudo-John IV near Nicaea.

John IV spent the remainder of his life as a monk in Dacibyza. There is a rescript of Charles of Anjou, dated 9 May 1273, which refers to a report that John escaped from his imprisonment and invites him to come to his court. Further documents attest to his arrival and receiving a pension from the Angevin arch-enemy of Michael Palaiologos. However, this contradicts the evidence of the historians George Pachymeres and Nikephoros Gregoras, who record that John remained in Dacibyza until long after Michael&#x27;s death. In his study of Michael VIII&#x27;s reign, historian Deno John Geanakoplos discusses the contradictory evidence and comes to the conclusion that the documents of Charles of Anjou were intended to serve as propaganda, &quot;to attract the support of the legitimist, pro-Lascarid Greeks of the Byzantine Empire, as well as to sway the anti-Angevin sentiment of the still surviving Greek population of Charles&#x27; own territories of southern Italy and Sicily.&quot;

In 1290 John was visited by Michael VIII&#x27;s son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos, who sought forgiveness for his father&#x27;s blinding three decades earlier. As Donald Nicol notes, &quot;The occasion must have been embarrassing for both parties, but especially for Andronikos who, after all, was the beneficiary of his father&#x27;s crimes against John Laskaris.&quot; The deposed emperor died about 1305 and was eventually recognized as a saint, whose memory was revered in Constantinople in the 14th century.

<doc id="72335" wikidata="Q661074" url="?curid=72335" title="Onan">
<text>Onan was a figure detailed in the Book of Genesis chapter 38, as the second son of Judah who married the daughter of Shuah the Canaanite. Onan had an older brother Er and a younger brother, Shelah as well. 

After being commanded by his father, Judah, to perform his duty as a husband&#x27;s brother according to the custom of levirate marriage with the late Er&#x27;s wife Tamar, Onan instead refused to perform his duty as a levirate and &quot;spilled his seed on the ground whenever he went in&quot; because &quot;the offspring would not be his&quot;, and was thus put to death by Yahweh. This act is detailed as retribution for being &quot;displeasing in the sight of Lord&quot;. Onan&#x27;s crime is often misinterpreted to be masturbation but it is universally agreed among biblical scholars that Onan&#x27;s death is attributed to his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate marriage with Tamar by committing coitus interruptus.

==Biblical account==

After Yahweh slew Onan&#x27;s oldest brother Er, Onan&#x27;s father Judah told him to fulfill his duty as a brother-in-law to his brother Er by entering into a levirate marriage with his brother&#x27;s widow Tamar to give her offspring. Religion professor Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out the economic repercussions of a levirate marriage: any son born to Tamar would be deemed the heir of the deceased Er and could claim the firstborn&#x27;s double share of an inheritance. However, if Er were childless or only had daughters, Onan would have inherited as the oldest surviving son.

When Onan had sex with Tamar, he withdrew before he ejaculated and &quot;spilled his seed on the ground&quot; thus committing &quot;coitus interuptus&quot;, since any child born would not legally be considered his heir. The next statement in the Bible says that Onan displeased Yahweh, so the Lord slew him. Onan&#x27;s crime is often misinterpreted to be masturbation but it is universally agreed among biblical scholars that Onan&#x27;s death is attributed to his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate marriage with Tamar by committing &quot;coitus interruptus.&quot;

However, Onan‘s reluctance to give a child to his sister-in-law may reflect a rejection of this custom already present in society. The regulation of levirate marriage in Deut 25:5–10 shows that the custom had encountered some opposition. The law in Deuteronomy allowing a man to refuse his duty was a concession to the reluctance to comply with the custom. Because of Onan&#x27;s unwillingness to bear a child for his deceased brother, Yahweh was displeased with Onan and slew him also (Gen 38:10).

=== Family tree ===
==Interpretation==
The implication from the narrative is that Onan&#x27;s act as described is what gave rise to divine displeasure.

===Early Jewish views===
One opinion expressed in the Talmud argues that this was where the death penalty&#x27;s imposition originated. The Talmud also likens emitting semen in vain to shedding blood.

However, the regulations concerning ejaculation in the book of Leviticus, whether as a result of sexual intercourse or not, merely prescribe a ritual washing and becoming ritually impure until the following evening.

===Classical Christian views===
Early Christian writers have sometimes focused on the &quot;spilling seed&quot;, and the sexual act being used for non-procreational purposes. This interpretation was held by several early Christian apologists. Jerome, for example, argued:

Epiphanius of Salamis wrote against heretics who used &quot;coitus interruptus&quot;, calling it the sin of Οnan:

Clement of Alexandria, while not making explicit reference to Onan, similarly reflects an early Christian view of the abhorrence of &quot;spilling seed&quot;:

===Roman Catholic views===

The papal encyclical &quot;Casti connubii&quot; (1930) invokes this Biblical text in support of the teaching of the Catholic Church against contracepted sex by quoting St. Augustine, &quot;Intercourse even with one&#x27;s legitimate wife is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the offspring is prevented. Onan, the son of Juda [&quot;sic&quot;], did this and the Lord killed him for it.&quot;

===Early Protestant views===
Making reference to Onan&#x27;s offense to identify masturbation as sinful, in his &quot;Commentary on Genesis&quot;, John Calvin wrote that &quot;the voluntary spilling of semen outside of intercourse between a man and a woman is a monstrous thing. Deliberately to withdraw from coitus in order that semen may fall on the ground is double monstrous.&quot;

Methodism founder John Wesley, according to Bryan C. Hodge, &quot;believed that any waste of the semen in an unproductive sexual act, whether that should be in the form of masturbation or &quot;coitus interruptus&quot;, as in the case of Onan, destroyed the souls of the individuals who practice it&quot;. He wrote his &quot;Thoughts on the Sin of Onan&quot; (1767), which was reproduced as &quot;A Word to Whom it May Concern&quot; on 1779, as an attempt to censor a work by Samuel-Auguste Tissot. In that writing, Wesley warned about &quot;the dangers of self pollution&quot;, the bad physical and mental effects of masturbation, writes many such cases along with the treatment recommendations.

===Disputes===
According to some Bible critics who contextually read this passage, the description of Onan is an origin myth concerning fluctuations in the constituency of the tribe of Judah, with the death of Onan reflecting the dying out of a clan; &quot;Er&quot; and &quot;Onan&quot; are hence viewed as each being representative of a clan, with Onan possibly representing an Edomite clan named Onam, mentioned by an Edomite genealogy in Genesis.

Biblical scholars universally agree that the biblical story of Onan is not about masturbation nor about contraception per se or the &quot;wasting of semen&quot; but his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate-marriage with Tamar by committing &quot;coitus interruptus&quot;.

The text emphasizes the social and legal situation, with Judah explaining what Onan must do and why. A plain reading of the text is that Onan was killed because he refused to follow instructions. Scholars have argued that the secondary purpose of the narrative about Onan and Tamar, of which the description of Onan is a part, was to either assert the institution of levirate marriage or present a myth for its origin; Onan&#x27;s role in the narrative is, thus, as the brother abusing his obligations by agreeing to sexual intercourse with his dead brother&#x27;s wife, but refusing to allow her to become pregnant as a result. Emerton regards the evidence for this to be inconclusive, although classical rabbinical writers argued that this narrative describes the origin of levirate marriage.

John M. Riddle argues that &quot;Epiphanius (fourth century) construed the sin of Onan as &quot;coitus interruptus&quot;&quot;. John T. Noonan Jr. says that &quot;St. Epiphanius gave a plain interpretation of the text as a condemnation of contraception, and he did so only in the context of his anti-Gnostic polemic&quot;.

Bible scholars maintained that the story does not refer to masturbation, but to &quot;coitus interruptus&quot;. Bible scholars even maintain that the Bible does not claim that masturbation would be sinful.

Although the story of Onan does not involve masturbation, according to Peter Lewis Allen, some theologians found &quot;a common element&quot; in both &quot;coitus interruptus&quot; (also known as onanism) and masturbation, as well as anal intercourse and other forms of nonmarital and nonvaginal sexual acts, which are considered wrongful acts.

==Onanism==
The term &quot;&quot; has come to refer to &quot;masturbation&quot; in many modern languages – for example Hebrew (אוננות, &quot;onanút&quot;), German (&quot;Onanie&quot;), Greek (αυνανισμός, &quot;avnanismós&quot;), Japanese (オナニー, &quot;onanī&quot;), and Swedish (&quot;onani&quot;) – based on an interpretation of the Onan story.

The word &quot;onanism&quot; is not based on the biblical story of Onan itself but on an interpretation of that biblical story, nor is the word &quot;onanism&quot; found in any form in the biblical texts. Thus the etymological connection of onanism (in the sense of masturbation) with Onan&#x27;s name is misleading.

The &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; online dictionary defines onanism as:
#masturbation 
#coitus interruptus
#self-gratification

<text>Barbara Joan &quot;Barbra&quot; Streisand ( ; born April 24, 1942) is an American singer, actress, songwriter, producer, and director. With a career spanning over six decades, she has achieved success across multiple fields of entertainment, being the first performer awarded Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards.

Streisand&#x27;s career began in the early 1960s performing in nightclubs and Broadway theaters. Following guest appearances on various television shows, she signed to Columbia Records—retaining full artistic control in exchange for accepting lower pay, an arrangement that continued throughout her career. Her studio debut &quot;The Barbra Streisand Album&quot; (1963) won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Throughout her recording career, Streisand has topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with 11 albums (the record for a woman until 2023), including &quot;People&quot; (1964), &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1974), &quot;Guilty&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Broadway Album&quot; (1985). She also topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with five singles: &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, &quot;Evergreen&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot; (with Neil Diamond), &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot; (with Donna Summer), and &quot;Woman in Love&quot;.

Following her established recording success, Streisand ventured into film by the end of the 1960s. She starred in the critically acclaimed &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), winning the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 41st Academy Awards. Additional fame on the big screen followed with the extravagant musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969), the screwball comedy &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972), and the romantic drama &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973). Streisand won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for writing the love theme from &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976), the first woman to be honored as a composer. With the release of &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983), Streisand became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. The film won an Oscar for Best Original Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical. Streisand also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, becoming the first (and for 37 years, the only) woman to win that award. Streisand later produced and directed &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996).

With sales exceeding 150 million records worldwide, Streisand is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the second-highest certified female artist in the United States, with 68.5 million certified album units. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Streisand as the greatest solo artist on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the top Adult Contemporary female artist of all time.

Her accolades span ten Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award; nine Golden Globe Awards; five Emmy Awards; four Peabody Awards; two Academy Awards; the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

== Early life ==
=== Family ===
Streisand was born April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Diana Ida ( Rosen; 1908–2002) and Emanuel Streisand (1908–1943). Her mother had been a soprano in her youth and considered a career in music, but later became a school secretary. Her father was a high school teacher at the same school, where they first met. Streisand&#x27;s family is Jewish. Her paternal grandparents emigrated from Galicia (modern-day Poland and Ukraine) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and her maternal grandparents from the Russian Empire, where her grandfather had been a cantor.

In August 1943, a few months after Streisand&#x27;s first birthday, her father died at age 34 from complications from an epileptic seizure, possibly the result of a head injury years earlier. The family fell into near poverty, with her mother working as a low-paid bookkeeper. As an adult, Streisand remembered those early years as always feeling like an &quot;outcast&quot;, explaining, &quot;Everybody else&#x27;s father came home from work at the end of the day. Mine didn&#x27;t.&quot; Her mother tried to pay their bills but could not give her daughter the attention she craved: &quot;When I wanted love from my mother, she gave me food,&quot; Streisand says.

Streisand recalled that her mother had a &quot;great voice&quot; and sang semi-professionally on occasion. In a 2016 interview with Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Streisand recounted that when she was 13, she and her mother recorded some songs on tape during a visit to the Catskills. That session was the first time Streisand ever asserted herself as an artist, which also became her &quot;first moment of inspiration.&quot;

She has an older brother, Sheldon, and a younger half-sister, singer Roslyn Kind, from her mother&#x27;s remarriage to Louis Kind in 1950.

=== Education ===
Streisand began her education at the Jewish Orthodox Yeshiva of Brooklyn when she was five. She was considered bright and inquisitive; however, she lacked discipline, often shouting answers to questions out of turn. She next attended Public School 89 in Brooklyn, and during those early school years began watching television and going to movies. &quot;I always wanted to be somebody, to be famous... You know, get out of Brooklyn.&quot;

Streisand became known by others in the neighborhood for her voice. She remembers sitting on the stoop in front of their apartment building with the other kids and singing: &quot;I was considered the girl on the block with the good voice.&quot; That talent became a way for her to gain attention. She would often practice her singing in the hallway of her apartment building, which gave her voice an echoing quality.

She made her singing debut at a PTA assembly, where she became a hit to everyone but her mother, who was mostly critical of her daughter. Streisand was invited to sing at weddings and summer camp, along with having an unsuccessful audition at MGM records when she was nine. By the time she was 13, her mother began supporting her talent, helping her make a four-song demo tape, including &quot;Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;.

Becoming an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when she saw her first Broadway play, &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, when she was 14. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate. Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays and studying the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.

In 1956, she attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, where she became an honor student in modern history, English, and Spanish. She also joined the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, where she sang with another choir member and classmate, Neil Diamond. Diamond recalls, &quot;We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.&quot; The school was near an art movie house, and he recalls that she was always aware of the films they were showing. She had a crush on 15-year-old US Chess Champion and fellow student Bobby Fischer, whom she found to be &quot;very sexy&quot;.

During the summer of 1957, she landed her first stage experience as a walk-on at the Playhouse, in Malden Bridge, New York. That small part was followed by a role as the kid sister in &quot;Picnic&quot; and as a vamp in &quot;Desk Set&quot;. In her second year, she took a night job at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village, helping backstage. When she was a senior, she rehearsed for a small part in &quot;Driftwood&quot;, a play staged in a midtown attic space.

She graduated from Erasmus Hall in January 1959 at age 16, and despite her mother&#x27;s pleas that she stay out of show business, she set out trying to get roles on the New York City stage. After renting a small apartment on 48th Street in the heart of the theater district, she accepted any job she could involving the stage, and at every opportunity, she &quot;made the rounds&quot; of the casting offices.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings ===

Living on her own at 16, Streisand took various menial jobs to have some income. During one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping at the home of friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around. When desperate, she returned to her mother&#x27;s flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother was horrified by her daughter&#x27;s &quot;gypsy-like lifestyle&quot;, wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business, but Streisand took her mother&#x27;s pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: &quot;My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I &quot;could&quot; be a star.&quot;

Streisand took a job as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; early in 1960. During the run of the play, she heard that the casting director was auditioning for more singers, and it marked the first time she sang in pursuit of a job. Although the director felt she was not right for the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her résumé when looking for other work.

Streisand asked her boyfriend, Barry Dennen, to tape her singing, copies of which she could then give out to possible employers. Dennen found a guitarist to accompany her:.

Dennen grew enthusiastic and he convinced her to enter a talent contest at the Lion, a gay nightclub in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village. She performed two songs, after which there was a &quot;stunned silence&quot; from the audience, followed by &quot;thunderous applause&quot; when she was pronounced the winner. She was invited back and sang at the club for several weeks. During this time, disliking her name, she changed it from &quot;Barbara&quot; to &quot;Barbra&quot;.
In early days of her career Streisand was repeatedly told she was too ugly to be a star and was advised to get a nose job—she did not.

==== Nightclub shows ====
Streisand was next asked to audition at the Bon Soir nightclub, after which she was signed up at $125 a week. It became her first professional engagement in September 1960, where she was the opening act for comedian Phyllis Diller. She recalls it was the first time she had been in that kind of upscale environment: &quot;I&#x27;d never been in a nightclub until I sang in one.&quot;

Dennen now wanted to expose Streisand to his vast record collection of female singers, including Billie Holiday, Mabel Mercer, Ethel Waters, and Édith Piaf. Streisand realized she could still become an actress by first gaining recognition as a singer. From his collection she drew the song that best defined her mission in singing: &quot;A Sleepin&#x27; Bee&quot;, with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by Truman Capote for the 1954 musical &quot;House of Flowers&quot;. &quot;The lyrics to that song gave me the three acts of a play that I longed for as an actress,&quot; Streisand said. &quot;And Harold was one of those writers who could write these magnificent melodies. That gave me what I needed.&quot; According to biographer Christopher Nickens, hearing other great female singers benefited her style, as she began creating different emotional characters when performing, which gave her singing a greater range.

Streisand improved her stage presence when speaking to the audience between songs. She discovered that her Brooklyn-bred style of humor was received favorably. During the next six months appearing at the club, some began comparing her singing voice to famous names such as Judy Garland, Lena Horne and Fanny Brice. Her conversational ability to charm an audience with spontaneous humor during performances became more sophisticated and professional. Theater critic Leonard Harris wrote: &quot;She&#x27;s twenty; by the time she&#x27;s thirty she will have rewritten the record books.&quot;

==== Early theatre roles and Broadway debut ====
Streisand accepted her first role on the New York stage in &quot;Another Evening with Harry Stoones&quot;, a satirical comedy play in which she acted and sang two solos. The show received terrible reviews and closed the next day. With the help of her new personal manager, Martin Erlichman, she had successful shows in Detroit and St. Louis. Erlichman then booked her at an even more upscale nightclub in Manhattan, the Blue Angel, where she became a bigger hit during the period from 1961 to 1962. Streisand once told Jimmy Fallon, with whom she sang a duet, on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, that Erlichman was a &quot;fantastic manager&quot; and still managed her career after 50 years.

While appearing at the Blue Angel, theater director and playwright Arthur Laurents asked her to audition for a new musical comedy he was directing, &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot;. She got the part of secretary to the lead actor businessman, played by then unknown Elliott Gould. They fell in love during rehearsals and eventually moved into a small apartment together. The show opened on March 22, 1962, at the Shubert Theater, and received rave reviews. Her performance &quot;stopped the show cold&quot;, wrote Nickens. Groucho Marx, while hosting the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, told her that 20 was an &quot;extremely young age to be a success on Broadway&quot;. Streisand received a Tony Award nomination and New York Drama Critic&#x27;s prize for Best Supporting Actress. The show was recorded and made into an album.

==== Early television appearances ====

Streisand&#x27;s first television appearance was on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, then credited to its regular host, Jack Paar. She was seen during an April 1961 episode on which Orson Bean substituted for Paar. She sang Harold Arlen&#x27;s &quot;A Sleepin&#x27; Bee&quot;. During her appearance, Phyllis Diller, also a guest on the show, called her &quot;one of the great singing talents in the world.&quot;

Later in 1961, before she was cast in &quot;Another Evening With Harry Stoones&quot;, Streisand became a semi-regular on &quot;PM East/PM West&quot;, a talk/variety series hosted by Mike Wallace and Joyce Davidson. Some of Streisand&#x27;s &quot;PM East&quot; segments survive as audio recordings, and still photos survive, but moving images do not.

In early 1962, she went into the Columbia Records studio for the cast recording of &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot;. Also that spring, she participated in a 25th anniversary studio recording of &quot;Pins and Needles,&quot; the classic popular front musical originated in 1937 by the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union. Reviews of both albums highlighted Streisand&#x27;s performances.

In May 1962, Streisand appeared on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, where she sang &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; for the first time. Her sad, slow version of the 1930s upbeat Democratic Party theme song became her signature song during this early phase of her career.

Johnny Carson had her on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; half a dozen times in 1962 and 1963, and she became a favorite of his television audience and himself personally. He described her as an &quot;exciting new singer&quot;. During one show, she joked with Groucho Marx, who liked her style of humor.

In December 1962, Streisand made the first of a number of appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. She was later a cohost on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and also made an impact on a number of Bob Hope specials. Performing with her on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was Liberace, who became an instant fan of the young singer. Liberace invited her to Las Vegas to perform as his opening act at the Riviera Hotel. He is credited with introducing Streisand to audiences on the West Coast. The following September, during her ongoing shows at Harrah&#x27;s Hotel in Lake Tahoe, she and Elliott Gould took time off to get married in Carson City, Nevada. With her career and popularity rising so quickly, she saw her marriage to Gould as a &quot;stabilizing influence&quot;.

==== First albums ====
When she was 21, Streisand signed a contract with Columbia Records that gave her full creative control, in exchange for less money.

Lieberson relented and agreed to sign her. Nearly three decades later, Streisand said:

She took advantage of this several times during her career.

Columbia wanted to call her first album, in early 1963, &quot;Sweet and Saucy Streisand&quot;; Streisand used her control to insist that it was called &quot;The Barbra Streisand Album&quot;, saying &quot;if you saw me on TV, you could just go [to the record shop] and ask for the Barbra Streisand album. It&#x27;s common sense&quot;. It reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and won three Grammy Awards. The album made her the best-selling female vocalist in the country. That summer she also released &quot;The Second Barbra Streisand Album&quot;, which established her as the &quot;most exciting new personality since Elvis Presley.&quot; She ended that breakthrough year of 1963 by performing one-night concerts in Indianapolis, San Jose, Chicago, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.

==== Return to the stage ====
Streisand returned to Broadway in 1964 with an acclaimed performance as entertainer Fanny Brice in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; at the Winter Garden Theatre. The show introduced two of her signature songs, &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade.&quot; Because of the musical&#x27;s overnight success, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. In 1964, Streisand was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical but lost to Carol Channing in &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; Streisand received an honorary &quot;Star of the Decade&quot; Tony Award in 1970.

In 1966, Streisand repeated her success with &quot;Funny Girl&quot; in London&#x27;s West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre. From 1965 to 1968 she appeared in her first four solo television specials, including the Emmy Award–winning &quot;My Name is Barbra&quot;.

=== Stardom ===

==== Singing ====
Streisand has recorded 50 studio albums, almost all with Columbia Records. Her early works in the 1960s (her debut &quot;The Barbra Streisand Album&quot;, &quot;The Second Barbra Streisand Album&quot;, &quot;The Third Album&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Barbra&quot;, etc.) are considered classic renditions of theatre and cabaret standards, including her pensive version of the normally uptempo &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;. She performed this in a duet with Judy Garland on &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;. Garland referred to her on the air as one of the last great belters. They also sang &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, with Ethel Merman joining them.
Beginning with &quot;My Name Is Barbra&quot;, her early albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, but like many talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album &quot;Stoney End&quot; in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.

During the 1970s, she was also highly prominent on the pop charts, with Top 10 recordings such as &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (US No. 1); &quot;Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)&quot; (US No. 1); &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot; (1979, with Donna Summer), which is reportedly still the most commercially successful duet, (US No. 1); &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot; (with Neil Diamond) (US No. 1); and &quot;The Main Event&quot; (US No. 3), some of which came from soundtrack recordings of her films. As the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S. — only Elvis Presley and The Beatles had sold more albums. In 1980, she released her best-selling effort to date, the Barry Gibb-produced &quot;Guilty&quot;. The album contained the hits &quot;Woman in Love&quot; (which spent several weeks on top of the pop charts in the fall of 1980), &quot;Guilty&quot;, and &quot;What Kind of Fool&quot;.

After years of largely ignoring Broadway and traditional pop music in favor of more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots. Columbia Records objected that the songs she wanted to sing were not pop songs, but Streisand asserted the full creative control her contract gave her—&#x27;I&#x27;ve always had the right to sing what I want&#x27;—with 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Broadway Album&quot;, which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Stephen Sondheim, who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. &quot;The Broadway Album&quot; was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year, and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album &quot;One Voice&quot; in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of Rupert Holmes, including &quot;On My Own&quot; (from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;), a medley of &quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&quot;, and &quot;Heather on the Hill&quot; (from &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, respectively), &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; (from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;), &quot;Warm All Over&quot; (from &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;), and an unusual solo version of &quot;Make Our Garden Grow&quot; (from &quot;Candide&quot;). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only &quot;Warm All Over&quot; and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand&#x27;s 1988 effort, &quot;Till I Loved You&quot;. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, &quot;Just for the Record&quot;, was released. A compilation spanning Streisand&#x27;s entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities, and previously unreleased material.
The following year, Streisand&#x27;s concert fundraising events helped propel President Bill Clinton into the spotlight and into office. Streisand later introduced Clinton at his inauguration in 1993. Streisand&#x27;s music career, however, was largely on hold. A 1992 appearance at an APLA benefit, as well as the aforementioned inaugural performance, hinted that Streisand was becoming more receptive to the idea of live performances. A tour was suggested, though Streisand would not immediately commit to it, citing her well-known stage fright as well as security concerns. During this time, Streisand finally returned to the recording studio and released &quot;Back to Broadway&quot; in June 1993. The album was not as universally lauded as its predecessor, but it did debut at No. 1 on the pop charts (a rare feat for an artist of Streisand&#x27;s age, especially given that it relegated Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Janet&quot; to the No. 2 spot). One of the album&#x27;s highlights was a medley of &quot;I Have A Love&quot; / &quot;One Hand, One Heart&quot;, a duet with Johnny Mathis, who Streisand said is one of her favorite singers.

In 1993, &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Stephen Holden wrote that Streisand &quot;enjoys a cultural status that only one other American entertainer, Frank Sinatra, has achieved in the last half century&quot;. In September 1993, Streisand announced her first public concert appearances in 27 years (discounting her Las Vegas nightclub performances between 1969 and 1972). What began as a two-night New Year&#x27;s event at the MGM Grand Las Vegas led to a multi-city tour in the summer of 1994. Tickets for the tour sold out in under an hour. Streisand also appeared on the covers of major magazines in anticipation of what &quot;Time magazine&quot; named &quot;The Music Event of the Century&quot;. The tour was one of the biggest all-media merchandise parlays in history. Ticket prices ranged from US$50 to US$1,500, making Streisand the highest-paid concert performer in history at the time. &quot;Barbra Streisand: The Concert&quot; went on to be the top-grossing concert of the year and earned five Emmy Awards and the Peabody Award, while the taped broadcast on HBO was the highest-rated concert special in HBO&#x27;s 30-year history. Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Streisand once again kept a low profile musically, instead focusing her efforts on acting and directing duties as well as a burgeoning romance with actor James Brolin.

In 1996, Streisand released &quot;I Finally Found Someone&quot; as a duet with Canadian singer and songwriter Bryan Adams. The song was nominated for an Oscar, as it was part of the soundtrack of Streisand&#x27;s self-directed movie &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;. It reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was her first significant hit in almost a decade and her first top 10 hit on the Hot 100 (and first gold single) since 1981.

In 1997, she finally returned to the recording studio, releasing &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, a collection of songs of a loosely inspirational nature that also featured a duet with Céline Dion. The album received generally favorable reviews and once again debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts. Following her marriage to Brolin in 1998, Streisand recorded &quot;A Love Like Ours&quot; the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many critics complaining about the somewhat syrupy sentiments and overly lush arrangements; however, it did produce a modest hit for Streisand in the country-tinged &quot;If You Ever Leave Me&quot;, a duet with Vince Gill.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, Streisand returned to the concert stage, selling out in the first few hours, eight months before her return. At the end of the millennium, she was the number one female singer in the U.S., with at least two No. 1 albums in each decade since she began performing. A two-disc live album, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2000. Streisand performed versions of the &quot;Timeless&quot; concert in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in early 2000. In advance of four concerts (two each in Los Angeles and New York) in September 2000, Streisand announced that she was retiring from playing public concerts. Her performance of the song &quot;People&quot; was broadcast on the Internet via America Online.

Streisand&#x27;s subsequent albums included &quot;Christmas Memories&quot; (2001), a somewhat somber collection of holiday songs, and &quot;The Movie Album&quot; (2003), featuring famous film themes and backed by a large symphony orchestra. &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; (called &quot;Guilty Too&quot; in the UK), a collaboration with Barry Gibb and a sequel to their &quot;Guilty&quot;, was released worldwide in 2005.

In February 2006, Streisand recorded the song &quot;Smile&quot; alongside Tony Bennett at Streisand&#x27;s Malibu home. The song is included on Bennett&#x27;s 80th birthday album, &quot;Duets&quot;. In September 2006, the pair filmed a live performance of the song for &quot;Tony Bennett: An American Classic&quot;, directed by Rob Marshall. The special aired on NBC on November 21, 2006, and was released on DVD the same day. Streisand&#x27;s duet with Bennett opened the special.

That same year, Streisand announced her intent to tour again, in an effort to raise money and awareness for multiple issues. After four days of rehearsal at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, New Jersey, the 2006 Streisand concert tour began on October 4 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, continued with a featured stop in Sunrise, Florida, and concluded at Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006. Special guests Il Divo were interwoven throughout the show. Streisand&#x27;s 20-concert tour set box office records. At the age of 64, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross records in 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her show of October 9, 2006, at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records, of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at MGM Grand Garden Arena, with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand for price gouging, as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.

A collection of performances culled from different stops on this tour, &quot;Live in Concert 2006&quot;, debuted at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Streisand&#x27;s 29th Top 10 album. In the summer of 2007, Streisand gave concerts for the first time in continental Europe. The first concert took place in Zürich (June 18), then Vienna (June 22), Paris (June 26), Berlin (June 30), Stockholm (July 4, canceled), Manchester (July 10), and Celbridge, near Dublin (July 14), followed by three concerts in London (July 18, 22 and 25), the only European city where Streisand had performed before 2007. Tickets for the London dates cost between £100.00 and £1,500.00, and for Ireland, between €118 and €500. The Ireland date was marred by issues with serious parking and seating problems, leading to the event&#x27;s being dubbed a fiasco by &quot;Hot Press&quot;. The tour included a 58-piece orchestra.

In February 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Streisand as the No. 2-earning female musician between June 2006 and June 2007, with earnings of about $60 million. On November 17, 2008, Streisand returned to the studio to begin recording what would be her 63rd album and it was announced that Diana Krall was producing the album. Streisand is one of the recipients of the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors. On December 7, 2008, she visited the White House as part of the ceremonies.

On April 25, 2009, CBS aired Streisand&#x27;s latest television special, &quot;Streisand: Live in Concert&quot;, highlighting the featured stop from her 2006 North American tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On September 26, 2009, Streisand performed a one-night-only show at the Village Vanguard in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. This performance was later released on DVD as &quot;One Night Only: Barbra Streisand and Quartet at The Village Vanguard.&quot; On September 29, 2009, Streisand and Columbia Records released the studio album &quot;Love is the Answer&quot;, produced by Diana Krall. On October 2, 2009, Streisand made her British television performance debut with an interview on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; to promote the album. This album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and registered her biggest weekly sales since 1997, making Streisand the only artist in history to achieve No. 1 albums in five different decades.

On February 1, 2010, Streisand joined over 80 other artists in recording a new version of the 1985 charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot;. Quincy Jones and Lionel Richie planned to release the new version to mark the 25th anniversary of its original recording. These plans changed, however, in view of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010, and on February 12, the song, now called &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;, made its debut as a charity single to support relief aid for the island nation.

Streisand was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year on February 11, 2011, two days prior to the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. That same year, Streisand sang &quot;Somewhere&quot; from the Broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, with child prodigy Jackie Evancho, on Evancho&#x27;s album &quot;Dream with Me&quot;.

On October 11, 2012, Streisand gave a three-hour concert performance before a crowd of 18,000 as part of the ongoing inaugural events of Barclays Center (and part of her current &quot;Barbra Live&quot; tour) in Brooklyn (her first-ever public performance in her home borough). Streisand was joined onstage by trumpeter Chris Botti, Italian operatic trio Il Volo, and her son, Jason Gould. The concert included musical tributes by Streisand to Donna Summer and Marvin Hamlisch, both of whom had died earlier in 2012. Confirmed attendees included Barbara Walters, Jimmy Fallon, Sting, Katie Couric, Woody Allen, Michael Douglas, and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as designers Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, and Michael Kors. In June 2013, she gave two concerts in Bloomfield Stadium, Tel Aviv.

Streisand is one of many singers who use teleprompters during their live performances. Streisand has defended her choice in using teleprompters to display lyrics and, sometimes, banter.

In September 2014, she released &quot;Partners&quot;, a new album of duets that features collaborations with Elvis Presley, Andrea Bocelli, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Billy Joel, Babyface, Michael Bublé, Josh Groban, John Mayer, John Legend, Blake Shelton, and Jason Gould. This album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with sales of 196,000 copies in the first week, making Streisand the only recording artist to have a number-one album in each of the last six decades. It was also certified gold in November 2014 and platinum in January 2015, thus becoming Streisand&#x27;s 52nd gold and 31st Platinum album, more than any other female artist in history.

In May 2016, Streisand announced the upcoming album &quot;&quot;, to be released in August following a nine-city concert tour, &quot;&quot;, including performances in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, and a return to her hometown of Brooklyn. In June 2018, Streisand confirmed she was working on the new studio album &quot;Walls&quot;, released November 2, 2018, just prior to the U.S. midterm election. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie to Me&quot;, was written as a criticism of America&#x27;s political climate amid the presidency of Donald Trump, while the title track alludes to Trump&#x27;s frequent calls for a wall at the Mexico border.

Streisand released the single &quot;Love Will Survive&quot;, from the television series &quot;The Tattooist of Auschwitz&quot;, on April 25, 2024.

==== Acting ====

Streisand&#x27;s first film was a reprise of her Broadway hit &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), an artistic and commercial success directed by Hollywood veteran William Wyler. She won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, sharing it with Katharine Hepburn (&quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;), the only time there has been a tie in this Oscar category. Her next two movies were also based on musicals—Jerry Herman&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, directed by Gene Kelly (1969); and Alan Jay Lerner&#x27;s and Burton Lane&#x27;s &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, directed by Vincente Minnelli (1970)—while her fourth film was based on the Broadway play &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970).

During the 1970s, Streisand starred in several screwball comedies, including &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Main Event&quot; (1979), both co-starring Ryan O&#x27;Neal, and &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1974) with Michael Sarrazin. One of her most famous roles during this period was in the drama &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973) with Robert Redford, for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. She earned her second Academy Award for Best Original Song (with lyricist Paul Williams) for the song &quot;Evergreen&quot;, from &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; in 1976, in which she also starred.

Along with Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, and later Steve McQueen, Streisand formed First Artists Production Company in 1969 so that actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves. Streisand&#x27;s initial outing with First Artists was &quot;Up the Sandbox&quot; (1972).

From 1969 to 1980, Streisand appeared in Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, the annual motion picture exhibitors poll of Top 10 Box Office attractions a total of 10 times, often as the only woman on the list. After the commercially disappointing &quot;All Night Long&quot; in 1981, Streisand&#x27;s film output decreased considerably. She has acted in only eight films since.

Streisand produced a number of her own films, setting up Barwood Films in 1972. &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983) was turned down by every Hollywood studio at least once when she proposed both directing and starring in the film, until Orion Pictures took on the project and gave the film a budget of $14 million. For &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983), she was producer, director, and star, an experience she repeated for &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996). There was controversy when &quot;Yentl&quot; received five Academy Award nominations but none for the major categories of Best Picture, Actress, or Director. &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; received even more Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay, although not for director. Upon completion of the film, its screenwriter, Pat Conroy, who also authored the novel, called Streisand &quot;a goddess who walks upon the earth.&quot;

Streisand also co-scripted &quot;Yentl&quot; (with Jack Rosenthal), something for which she is not always given credit. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; editor Andrew Rosenthal, in an interview with Allan Wolper, &quot;The one thing that makes Barbra Streisand crazy is when nobody gives her the credit for having written &quot;Yentl&quot;.&quot;

After an eight-year hiatus of screen roles, Streisand returned to film acting for the comedy &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; (2004, a sequel to &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;), playing opposite Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner, and Robert De Niro.
In 2005, Streisand&#x27;s Barwood Films, Gary Smith, and Sonny Murray purchased the rights to Simon Mawer&#x27;s book &quot;Mendel&#x27;s Dwarf&quot;. In December 2008, she stated that she was considering directing an adaptation of Larry Kramer&#x27;s play &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, a project she has worked on since the mid-1990s.

Streisand reprised the role of Roz Focker in &quot;Little Fockers&quot; (2010, alongside Dustin Hoffman), the third film from the &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; trilogy.

Paramount Pictures gave the green light to begin shooting the road trip comedy &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Curse&quot; in early 2011, with Seth Rogen playing Streisand&#x27;s character&#x27;s son. Anne Fletcher directed the project, with a script by Dan Fogelman, produced by Lorne Michaels, John Goldwyn, and Evan Goldberg. Executive producers included Streisand, Rogen, Fogelman, and David Ellison, whose Skydance Productions co-financed the road movie. Shooting began in spring 2011 and wrapped in July; the film&#x27;s title was eventually altered to &quot;The Guilt Trip&quot;, and the movie was released in December 2012.

Plans emerged in 2015 for Streisand to direct a feature biopic about the 18th-century Russian empress Catherine the Great, based on the top 2014 Black List script produced by Gil Netter, with Keira Knightley starring. Streisand was also set to star in a film adaptation of the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot; featuring music by Jules Styne, book by Arthur Laurents, and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim with Richard LaGravenese attached to the project as screenwriter. Streisand was in advanced negotiations to star and produce the film in April 2016, to be directed by Barry Levinson and distributed by STX Entertainment. Two months later, the film&#x27;s script had been completed and production was scheduled to begin in early 2017. Streisand reportedly exited the project, and both failed to move into production.

== Artistry ==
Streisand possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, which Howard Cohen of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; described as &quot;peerless&quot;. Whitney Balliett wrote, &quot;Streisand wows her listeners with her shrewd dynamics (in-your-ear soft here, elbowing-loud there), her bravura climbs, her rolling vibrato, and the singular Streisand-from-Brooklyn nasal quality of her voice – a voice as immediately recognizable in its way as Louis Armstrong&#x27;s.&quot; Music writer Allegra Rossi adds that Streisand creates complete compositions in her head:

While she is predominantly a pop singer, Streisand&#x27;s voice has been described as &quot;semi-operatic&quot; due to its strength and quality of tone. According to Adam Feldman of &quot;Time Out&quot;, Streisand&#x27;s &quot;signature vocal style&quot; is &quot;a suspension bridge between old-school belting and microphone pop.&quot; She is known for her ability to hold relatively high notes, both loud and soft, with great intensity—which led classical pianist Glenn Gould to call himself &quot;a Streisand freak&quot;—as well as for her ability to make slight but unobtrusive embellishments on a melodic line.

Since about 2010 critics and audiences noted that her voice had &quot;lowered and acquired an occasionally husky edge&quot;. However, &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Stephen Holden noted that her distinctive tone and musical instincts remained, and that she still had &quot;the gift of conveying a primal human longing in a beautiful sound&quot;. Paul Taylor of &quot;The Independent &quot;wrote that Streisand &quot;has sounded a little scratchy and frayed, though the stout resolve and superb technique with which Streisand manages to hoist it over these difficulties has come to seem morally as well aesthetically impressive.&quot; Reviewing Streisand&#x27;s 2014 studio album &quot;Partners&quot;, Gil Naveh of &quot;Haaretz &quot;described Streisand&#x27;s voice as &quot;velvety, clear and powerful ... and the passing years have given it a fascinating depth and roughness.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
Streisand has been married twice. Her first husband was actor Elliott Gould, whom she married on September 13, 1963. They announced their separation on February 12, 1969, and divorced on July 6, 1971. They had one child, Jason Gould, who appeared as her on-screen son in &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;.

In 1969 and 1970, Streisand dated Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

She started a relationship with hairdresser/producer Jon Peters in 1973. He went on to be her manager and producer. They broke up in 1982 during the making of &quot;Yentl&quot;, but remain friends. She is the godmother of his daughters, Caleigh Peters and Skye Peters.

Streisand briefly dated film director Michael Cimino in early 1983, though they kept their relationship secret. Cimino had considered her for a role in his planned adaptation of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; by Ayn Rand, which was not made.

From November 1983 to October 1987, Streisand lived with Baskin-Robbins ice cream heir Richard Baskin, who composed the lyrics to &quot;Here We Are At Last&quot; on her 1984 album &quot;Emotion&quot;. They remained friends after the split, and Baskin would accompany Streisand to public events in between her subsequent romances.

She dated actor Don Johnson from December 1987 until at least September 1988; they recorded a duet of &quot;Till I Loved You&quot;.

In 1983 and 1989 respectively, Streisand briefly dated actors Richard Gere and Clint Eastwood.

From 1989 to 1991, she was involved with composer James Newton Howard.

Streisand dated tennis champion Andre Agassi from 1992 to 1993. Writing about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, Agassi said: &quot;We agree that we&#x27;re good for each other, and so what if she&#x27;s twenty-eight years older? We&#x27;re , and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection. It makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo – another piece of my overall rebellion. Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava.&quot;

During the early-to-mid-1990s, Streisand was in romantic relationships with several high-profile men, including newscaster Peter Jennings, and actors Liam Neeson, Jon Voight and Peter Weller.

Her second husband is actor James Brolin, whom she married on July 1, 1998. They have no children together. Brolin has two sons from his first marriage, including actor Josh Brolin, and one daughter from his second marriage.

Streisand has several dogs; she loved her dog Samantha so much that she had her cloned.

In March 2019, Streisand apologized for her controversial statements about Michael Jackson&#x27;s accusers.

=== Name ===
Streisand changed her name from &quot;Barbara&quot; to &quot;Barbra&quot; because, she said, &quot;I hated the name, but I refused to change it.&quot; Streisand further explained, &quot;Well, I was 18 and I wanted to be unique, but I didn&#x27;t want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or something like that. (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, &#x27;No, let&#x27;s see, if I take out the &#x27;a,&#x27; it&#x27;s still &#x27;Barbara,&#x27; but it&#x27;s unique.&quot; A 1967 biography with a concert program said, &quot;the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an &quot;a&quot; from the first instead.&quot;

According to Streisand, her surname is pronounced with an &quot;s&quot; sound &quot;like sand on the beach,&quot; not the &quot;z&quot; sound often used. The Apple voice digital assistant Siri originally pronounced her surname wrong, prompting Streisand to personally contact Apple CEO Tim Cook to complain about the pronunciation, which Apple soon corrected.

=== Politics ===
In the early years of her career, Streisand&#x27;s interest in politics was limited, with the exception of her participation in activities of the anti-nuclear group Women Strike for Peace in 1961 and 1962. In 1968, her political activism increased, and she helped promote the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy who held an anti–Vietnam War stance. In July 1968, with Harry Belafonte and others, she performed at the Hollywood Bowl in a fundraising concert sponsored by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to benefit the poor.

Streisand has been an active supporter of the Democratic Party and many of its causes. She was among the celebrities on President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1971 list of political enemies. In 1972, she assisted the presidential campaign of anti-war candidate George McGovern by headlining the benefit concert Four for McGovern, organized by actor Warren Beatty and record producer Lou Adler; her concert recording was released as &quot;Live Concert at the Forum&quot;. The next year, in association with liberal activist Stanley Sheinbaum and the American Civil Liberties Union, Streisand performed a benefit at the mansion of film mogul Jennings Lang to pay for the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame. Accompanied by a small combo including Marvin Hamlisch on piano, Streisand took paid song requests from the star-studded audience and by telephone to bring the night&#x27;s total to $50,000.

In 1984, Streisand joined Jane Fonda and ten other television and film industry notables to establish the activist group Hollywood Women&#x27;s Political Committee (HWPC), the membership eventually growing to 300. The HWPC fought for liberal causes for more than a decade, contributing to the Democratic Party taking majority control in the 1986 U.S. Senate elections, and in 1992 funding Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidential election as well as helping to usher in the Year of the Woman by electing more women senators. In 1995 Streisand spoke at Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government about the role of the artist as citizen, in support of arts programs and funding.

Streisand is a supporter of LGBT rights and backed the &quot;No on 8&quot; campaign in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat California Proposition 8 of 2008.

In 2012, Streisand stated, &quot;The new laws requiring U.S. citizens to produce photo IDs at the poll are designed to deprive elderly and minority citizens of the precious right to cast their vote. These regressive laws are themselves the most dangerous voter fraud threatening American democracy.&quot; Streisand continued her voter rights advocacy in 2020, tweeting a link to VoteRiders, a nonprofit that assists citizens with obtaining voter ID.

A longtime supporter of Israel, Streisand helped celebrate the 90th birthday of Shimon Peres at Jerusalem&#x27;s international convention center in June 2013. She also performed at two other concerts in Tel Aviv that same week, part of her first concert tour of Israel.

In January 2017, she participated in 2017 Women&#x27;s March in Los Angeles. Introduced by Rufus Wainwright, Streisand appeared on stage and made a speech.

In an October 2018 interview with Emma Brockes of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Streisand discussed the theme of her new album &quot;Walls&quot;: the danger she believed President Donald Trump posed towards the United States. She said, &quot;This is a dangerous time in this nation, this republic: a man who is corrupt and indecent and is assaulting our institutions. It&#x27;s really, really frightening. And I just pray that people who are compassionate and respect the truth will come out and vote. I&#x27;m saying more than just vote. Vote for Democrats!&quot; In November 2023, she praised President Joe Biden, saying &quot;I like Biden. I think he has done a good job. I think he is compassionate, smart, supports the right things.&quot;

== Philanthropy ==

In 1984, Streisand donated the Emanuel Streisand Building for Jewish Studies to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the Mount Scopus campus, in memory of her father, an educator and scholar who died when she was young.

Streisand has personally raised $25 million for organizations through her live performances. The Streisand Foundation, established in 1986, has contributed over $16 million through nearly 1,000 grants to &quot;national organizations working on preservation of the environment, voter education, the protection of civil liberties and civil rights, women&#x27;s issues and nuclear disarmament&quot;.

In September that year, &quot;Parade&quot; magazine included Streisand on its Giving Back Fund&#x27;s second annual Giving Back 30 survey, &quot;a ranking of the celebrities who have made the largest donations to charity in 2007 according to public records&quot;, as the third most generous celebrity. The Giving Back Fund claimed Streisand donated $11 million, which The Streisand Foundation distributed. In 2012 she raised $22 million to support her women&#x27;s cardiovascular center, bringing her own personal contribution to $10 million. The program was officially named the Barbra Streisand Women&#x27;s Heart Center.

At Julien&#x27;s Auctions in October 2009, Streisand, a longtime collector of art and furniture, sold 526 items, with all the proceeds going to her foundation. Items included a costume from &quot;Funny Lady&quot; and a vintage dental cabinet purchased by the performer at 18 years old. The sale&#x27;s most valuable lot was a painting by Kees van Dongen.

In December 2011, she appeared at a fundraising gala for Israel Defense Forces charities.

In June 2020, she gifted George Floyd&#x27;s daughter, Gianna Floyd, Disney shares.

<text>Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (; 1224 – 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine emperor from 1261 until his death in 1282, and previously as the co-emperor of the Empire of Nicaea from 1259 to 1261. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. His reign saw considerable recovery of Byzantine power, including the enlargement of the Byzantine army and navy. It also included the reconstruction of the city of Constantinople, and the increase of its population. His re-establishment of the University of Constantinople contributed to the Palaeologan Renaissance, a cultural flowering between the 13th and 15th centuries.

It was also at this time that the focus of the Byzantine military shifted to the Balkans, against the Bulgarians, leaving the Anatolian frontier neglected. His successors could not compensate for this change of focus, and both the Arsenite schism and two civil wars which occurred from 1321–1328 and 1341–1347 undermined further efforts toward territorial consolidation and recovery, draining the empire&#x27;s strength, economy, and resources. Regular conflict between Byzantine successor states such as Trebizond, Epirus, Bulgaria and Serbia resulted in permanent fragmentation of former Byzantine territory and opportunity for increasingly successful conquests of expansive territories by post-Seljuk Anatolian beyliks, most notably that of Osman, later called the Ottoman Empire.

== Early life ==

Michael VIII Palaiologos was the son of the &quot;megas domestikos&quot; Andronikos Palaiologos by Theodora Angelina Palaiologina, the granddaughter of Emperor Alexios III Angelos and Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamaterina. According to Deno John Geanakoplos, Michael&#x27;s ancestry could be traced back to all three imperial houses that ruled the empire in the centuries before the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade. His mother does not appear to have played a significant role in his early life; at least for a time, he was brought up by his elder sister Martha, the wife of &quot;megas domestikos&quot; Nikephoros Tarchaneiotes, although she was only ten years older than he.

== Rise to power ==

Michael rose to distinction at an early age, serving as the governor of the Thracian towns of Melnik and Serres under the command of his father Andronikos. However, in the autumn of 1253, Michael was accused before the Emperor John III Vatatzes of plotting against the throne. The only way Michael was allowed to prove his innocence was through trial by ordeal, holding a red-hot iron. When the Emperor ordered him to take hold of the red-hot metal, the young Michael answered (to use Geanakoplos&#x27; words) &quot;with the astuteness that was to characterize his later career as Emperor&quot;: if the Metropolitan Phokas of Philadelphia, who evidently supported this proposal, could take the iron from the altar with his own hands and place it in Michael&#x27;s, he would gladly receive it in faith that the truth would be revealed.

Although Michael avoided punishment, and afterwards was married to the Emperor&#x27;s grandniece and appointed &quot;megas konostaulos&quot; of the Latin mercenaries in the employment of the emperors of Nicaea, he was still mistrusted. Following the death of John Vatatzes, Michael crossed the Sangarios River with a few close friends and took service with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. From late 1256 to 1258, he served as commander of the Christian mercenaries fighting for Sultan Kaykaus II; in that later year the Emperor Theodore II Doukas Laskaris recalled Michael, and after both exchanged oaths of loyalty and guarantees of safety, Michael returned to the service of the Emperor.

A few days after the death of Emperor Theodore Laskaris in 1258, Michael Palaiologos instigated a coup against the influential bureaucrat George Mouzalon, seizing from him the guardianship of the eight-year-old Emperor John IV Doukas Laskaris. Michael was invested with the titles of &quot;megas doux&quot; and, on 13 November 1258, of &quot;despotes&quot;. On 1 January 1259, Michael was formally proclaimed emperor (basileus), most likely without John IV, in Nymphaion.

==Constantinople==
In 1259, Michael VIII defeated the alliance of William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea, and Michael II Komnenos Doukas of Epirus at the Battle of Pelagonia. According to Geanakoplos, &quot;In the period immediately preceding the Nicene reconquest of Constantinople in 1261 no event was of greater importance than Michael Palaeologus&#x27; victory at Pelagonia.&quot; This not only neutralized, for the immediate time, the possibility of an attack from enemies on his Western borders, but also improved Michael&#x27;s legitimacy by showing him as a competent leader.

Despite this brilliant victory, only one event could remove the stigma of usurper completely from the eyes of his subjectsrecovery of Constantinople itself. In 1260 Michael personally led an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city. Rumors of reinforcements for the beleaguered city forced Michael to sign a one-year truce with the Latin Emperor Baldwin II that August. Realizing that he needed a navy to effectively besiege Constantinople, Michael concluded the Treaty of Nymphaeum with Genoa in March of the following year. Genoese help proved to be unneeded when Michael VIII&#x27;s general Alexios Strategopoulos captured Constantinople from Baldwin II through treachery on 25 July 1261.

News of the captured city first reached Michael&#x27;s sister Eulogia Palaiologina, who awoke her brother at dawn. He was not convinced until a messenger arrived from Strategopoulos bearing the crown and sword Baldwin had abandoned in his flight from his palace. Michael VIII entered the city on 15 August and had himself crowned emperor. Once in control of Constantinople, Michael abolished all Latin customs and reinstated most Byzantine ceremonies and institutions as they had existed before the Fourth Crusade. He repopulated the capital, building its population from when he took power to by the end of his reign, and restored damaged churches, monasteries, and public buildings. He was acutely aware of the danger posed by the possibility that the Latin West, particularly his neighbors in Italy, would unite against him and attempt the restoration of Latin rule in Constantinople.

John IV had remained at Nicaea, largely eclipsed by Michael. According to Akropolites, the public had never really viewed John as emperor - his name was virtually stricken from government business after the death of his father Theodore II, and he had not featured in Michael’s coronation ceremony as co-ruler. In December 1261, Michael VIII took the final step of having John blinded and relegated to a monastery, rendering him permanently ineligible for the throne. Michael quickly married off John&#x27;s sisters to two Italians and a Bulgarian noble, so their descendants could not threaten his own children&#x27;s claim to the imperial succession. Michael tried to keep the blinding of John a secret, keeping up a pretense that the boy’s formal coronation had merely been postponed. Eventually the news leaked out, and Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos excommunicated Michael VIII. This ban was not lifted until six years later (1268) on the appointment of patriarch Joseph I.

== Diplomacy and conquest ==
In the words of Geanaklopos, &quot;With the fall of Constantinople, the papacy suffered not only a loss of political prestige but severe damage to its spiritual authority as well. For the Greeks had now effectively reasserted their right to a church divorced from Rome. Thus it became the task of each of the six successive popes of Michael&#x27;s reign to accomplish the return of the schismatics to the Roman fold.&quot; Michael was aware of the immense influence the Curia had in the West, so he immediately dispatched an embassy to Pope Urban IV consisting of two envoys; upon reaching Italy, the men were seized and one was flayed alive, while the other succeeded in escaping back to friendlier territories.

Michael also approached Manfred of Sicily to achieve some kind of accord. In the summer of 1262, Michael offered to divorce his wife Theodora and marry Manfred&#x27;s sister Anna. This offer failed spectacularly: not only did Anna reject his proposal, Theodora turned to Patriarch Arsenios for help. The Patriarch confronted the emperor and pressured him to abandon his plans. Michael yielded and sent Anna back to her brother with gifts. This gesture helped to secure the release of his general Alexios Strategopoulos.

It was around this time that Michael was presented with a dangerous distraction: ʿIzz ad-Dīn Kaykāwūs, who had been deposed as Sultan of the Seljuk Turks by a coalition led by the Pervane Mu‘in al-Din Suleyman, arrived seeking help from his old friend. But as Claude Cahen notes, he &quot;was to be cruelly disappointed.&quot; Michael favored the Mongols of Iran, who supported ʿIzz ad-Dīn&#x27;s enemy the Pervane, against those of Russia. Further, he could not risk a war on his Asian frontier while Western Europe, infinitely more dangerous, was opposed to him. Cahen believes that either ʿIzz ad-Dīn became an embarrassment, or perhaps the former Sultan &quot;indulged in too open of criticism&quot;; in either case, ʿIzz ad-Dīn was imprisoned. Mongol troops from Russia eventually freed him, and carried him off to the Crimea where he lived out his life.

A series of military setbacks followed. In 1263 Michael sent men, including Seljuk mercenaries, to Morea with the goal of conquering the Principality of Achaea, but this expedition failed in a surprise rout at Prinitza. Later that year a mixed fleet of 48 imperial and Genoese ships was defeated by a smaller Venetian force at the Battle of Settepozzi. The following year, the imperial forces in Morea were again defeated at Makryplagi after the Seljuk mercenaries, who had not been paid, changed sides. The nadir of Michael&#x27;s disasters came in the spring of 1265, when an army of Tatars and Bulgars under Nogai Khan ravaging Thrace ambushed Michael Palaeologos when he was returning to Constantinople accompanied by only a few troops. Deserted by even his own officers, who fled to save their own lives, Michael was able to escape by crossing the Ganos Mountains and reaching the Marmora coast, where he happened upon two Latin ships. He quickly boarded the vessels, and two days later safely arrived at Constantinople. &quot;Thus did Michael survive one of the narrowest escapes of his career,&quot; notes Geanakoplos.

The military advantages Michael enjoyed after capturing Constantinople had evaporated, but he would demonstrate his diplomatic skills to successfully recover from these drawbacks. After Settepozzi, Michael VIII dismissed the 60 Genoese galleys that he had hired earlier and began a rapprochement with Venice. Michael secretly negotiated a treaty with the Venetians to grant terms similar to those in the case of Nymphaeum, but Doge Raniero Zeno failed to ratify the agreement. He also signed a treaty in 1263 with the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Baibars and Berke, the Mongol Khan of Kipchak Khanate.

==Michael and Charles of Anjou==
The Battle of Benevento on 26 February 1266 brought forth a new challenger to Michael, one with whom he would struggle for the rest of his life: Charles of Anjou. Michael, as Geanaklopos emphasizes, &quot;from 1266 until shortly before his death in 1282 ... was constrained to devote almost complete attention to the defeat of Charles, the fulfillment of whose ambition would have brought about the destruction of the Byzantine Empire and reimposition of Latin rule in Constantinople.&quot; Charles strengthened his hold on the kingdom of Sicily by defeating Conradin at the Battle of Tagliacozzo on 23 August 1268. And looking for help to restore the Latin Empire, on May 1267, Charles concluded the Treaty of Viterbo with the exiled Emperor Baldwin II and William II Villehardouin under the guidance of Pope Clement IV.

In many ways Michael and Charles were alike. Geanakoplos quotes Nicephorus Gregoras&#x27;s comparison of the two men at length:
Michael was also faced with a challenge on his Asian frontier. Although the peace treaty with the Seljuk Turks continued to be honored by both parties, nomadic Turkmen had begun to infiltrate the Byzantine territories, and because of Michael&#x27;s preoccupation with his Western foes, there was no organized response to this threat. Speros Vryonis also points out that due to his treatment of John IV Laskaris, &quot;there resulted an outright alienation from Constantinople of large segments of Greek society in Bithynia and elsewhere.&quot; In 1269 Michael sent his brother the &quot;despotes&quot; John Palaiologos into the southern part of Byzantine Anatolia to clear the Maeander and Cayster valleys of Turkmen; their response was to fall back before the Byzantine army, and when John was eventually recalled to face foes in Europe, the Turkmen pushed back and resumed their conquests and settlement. Thus by 1269, the cities of Trachia Studia and Strobilos on the Carian coast were firmly Turkish possessions.

Michael&#x27;s response to the Treaty of Viterbo was to attempt to weaken papal support for it; if the Pope was convinced Charles of Anjou&#x27;s invasion was a just and holy war, then the forces Michael could call on could not prevent its success. Michael returned to negotiating a union of the churches with Pope Clement IV, which he had agreed to, but the latter&#x27;s death in November 1268 put an end to this approach. According to Geanakoplos, only a lack of resources prevented Charles from immediately launching an attack against Michael. Looking for some restraint on Charles, Michael made a shrewd appeal to King Louis IX of France, the leading ruler of the West and the elder brother of Charles. Louis was more interested in a crusade against Muslims controlling the Holy Land than attacking a schismatic Christian. So he had Charles join his Tunisian crusade in 1270. When Louis died in Tunisia, Charles took command, negotiated a truce, and sailed to Sicily, planning to attack Byzantium. At this point a miracle saved Michael: a violent storm destroyed Charles&#x27; fleet. &quot;To the Greeks of Byzantium,&quot; writes Geanakoplos, &quot;it must have seemed as if the Virgin, their protector, had saved them from disaster.&quot;

After a three year interregnum, during which Charles of Anjou attempted to sway the election, a new pope was elected, Gregory X. When Michael restarted talks of union, Gregory proved to be less accommodating and negotiated from a position of strength. Michael attempted to reason with Patriarch Joseph and the synod of the importance of agreeing to this union, and that the principle of &quot;oikonomia&quot; (which Geanakoplos suggests is best translated here as &quot;considerations of self-interest&quot;) required them to accede to papal demands. But despite a propaganda campaign over the winter of 1274–1275, Michael was forced to depose Patriarch Joseph and replace him with his own supporter John Bekkos in order to obtain a grudging consent to the union.

==Council of Lyon and after==
Byzantine envoys presented themselves at the Second Council of Lyon 24 June 1274, where they presented a letter from the Emperor, sealed with the imperial golden bull, and two others from his son Andronikos and the Byzantine clergy. On the fourth session of the Council the formal act of union was performed. The letters were read, and for the first time in two centuries representatives of the major Eastern and Western branches of Christianity were again in communion.

Michael VIII achieved an important advantage by this union, for now he gained legitimacy both for possessing Constantinople and for his claims to the lands occupied by Western invaders. Further, his antagonist Charles could not rely on the power of the pope calling for a crusade against his realm. Lastly, Pope Gregory was very favorable to Michael&#x27;s proposal for a crusade against the Turks to restore the ancient Christian cities of Anatolia; however with Gregory&#x27;s death (January 1276), these plans remained nothing more than talk.

More disappointments followed as news of the Council filtered through the former Byzantine territories. While the union was opposed at all levels of society, it was especially opposed by the greater populace, led by the monks and the adherents of the deposed Patriarch Arsenios, known as the Arsenites. One of the chief anti-unionist leaders was Michael&#x27;s own sister Eulogia, who fled to the court of her daughter Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, Tsarina of the Bulgars, from where she intrigued unsuccessfully against Michael. More serious was the opposition of the sons of Michael of Epirus, Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas and his half-brother John I Doukas: they posed as the defenders of Orthodoxy and gave support to the anti-unionists fleeing Constantinople. Michael at first responded with comparative leniency, hoping to win the anti-unionists through persuasion, but eventually the virulence of the protests led him to resort to force. Many anti-unionists were blinded or exiled. Two prominent monks, Meletios and Ignatios, were punished: the first had his tongue cut out, the second was blinded. Even imperial officials were harshly treated, and the death penalty was decreed even for simply reading or possessing pamphlets directed against the Emperor. &quot;From the intensity of these disorders, tantamount almost to civil wars,&quot; concludes Geanakoplos, &quot;it might appear that too great a price had been paid for the sake of union.&quot;

The religious situation only worsened for Michael. The Arsenite party found widespread support amongst the discontented in the Anatolian provinces, and Michael responded there with similar viciousness: according to Vryonis, &quot;These elements were either removed from the armies or else, alienated, they deserted to the Turks&quot;. Another attempt to clear the encroaching Turkmen from the Meaender valley in 1278 found limited success, but Antioch on the Maeander was irretrievably lost as were Tralles and Nyssa four years later.

On 1 May 1277, John convoked a synod at Neopatras that anathematized the Emperor, Patriarch, and Pope as heretics. In response, a synod was convoked at the Hagia Sophia on 16 July where both Nikephoros and John were anathematized in return. John called a final synod at Neopatras in December 1277, where an anti-unionist council of eight bishops, a few abbots, and one hundred monks, again anathematized the Emperor, Patriarch, and Pope.

Michael&#x27;s achievements on the battlefield were more positive, although still mixed. He tried to take advantage of a civil war in Bulgaria in the late 1270s, but the Byzantine armies suffered several major defeats at the hands of the peasant Emperor Ivaylo. The Emperor managed to temporarily impose his son-in-law Ivan Asen III on the Bulgarian throne, but after the Byzantine defeat at Devina he had to flee. However, Michael VIII later managed to conquer the Bulgarian portion of Thrace, while the internal situation of the Bulgarian Empire remained unstable. In 1275, Michael VIII sent an army against Thessaly and fleet of 73 ships to harass the Latin states in Greece. The army was crushingly defeated at the Battle of Neopatras, but the fleet won a similarly comprehensive victory at the Battle of Demetrias.

Last was his victory over Charles of Anjou in western Greece. Charles&#x27; general Hugh of Sully with 8,000 men (including 2,000 cavalry) captured Butrinto in 1280 and besieged Berat. A Byzantine army of relief under Michael Tarchaneiotes arrived in March 1281: Hugh of Sully was ambushed and captured, and his army put to flight. Geanaklopos considers that most scholars do not appreciate fully the importance of this victory: &quot;this victory marked the complete failure of the attempt to launch a land expedition against the capital. Thus ... Charles had to shift his strategy to a sea attack against Constantinople&quot;.

== Sicilian Vespers ==

On 22 February 1281 a new Pope was selected, Pope Martin IV, a Frenchman Geanaklopos describes as &quot;blindly subservient&quot; to Charles of Anjou. Once again, Charles had no clear brake on his ambitions to conquer Constantinople, and he moved swiftly to prepare for this new offensive. One early move was taken by Pope Martin, who on 10 April 1281, excommunicated Michael without any warning or provocation, thus disrupting the union of Lyons.

Charles had prepared a military force far larger than Michael could muster. According to Marino Sanudo, Charles had 100 ships in Sicily, and 300 more in Naples, Provence, and his Greek territories, which were to carry no fewer than 8,000 cavalrymen. Geanakoplos cites surviving documents that attest to the supplies Charles had accumulated. One Angevin rescript, dated 28 October 1281, lists a collection of tools to be gathered for the expedition, which includes &quot;two thousand iron mattocks, three thousand iron stakes, sledges for smashing rocks, ropes, iron shovels, axes, and kettles for boiling pitch.&quot; Another orders the delivery of &quot;four thousand iron stakes that are under construction in Venice.&quot; A third consists of instructions to a Pisan merchant for 2,500 shields of various sizes, all to be emblazoned with his royal emblem of lilies. Allied with Charles were a long list of powers. Besides having ties of kinship with the Kings of France and Hungary, the rulers of the Serbs and Bulgars were his allies, as well as the rulers of Epirus and dissidents of the Byzantine Empire, and the leading naval power of Europe, Venice.

Obviously Michael sought allies against Charles of Anjou, but they were few. Donald Nicol lists the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, who would &quot;loan him ships&quot;, and the Tatars of the Golden Horde in South Russia who &quot;could keep an eye on the Bulgarians&quot;. His ambassadors visited the court of Roman-German King Rudolph I of Habsburg, but he was aloof. King Peter III of Aragon proved more welcoming, for he had his own reasons to hate Charles. According to Geanakoplos, Peter&#x27;s wife Constance was the daughter of Manfred, and for this reason Peter considered Charles a usurper and Sicily the rightful property of Constance. Peter welcomed refugees from Sicily, most notably John of Procida, whom he made secretary of the royal chancery. Yet Aragon was at the other end of the Mediterranean, far from Michael.

Before Charles of Anjou could start for Constantinople, however, the Sicilian Vespers rebellion struck, on 30 March 1282. Charles sent four ships to handle the revolt, but when the rebels took control of Messina, he ordered the men and materiel assembled for use against Michael to besiege that city; meanwhile seventy Angevin ships at the arsenal of Messina were destroyed. Eventually Charles lifted the siege, and Peter of Aragon landed in Sicily to reclaim the island for his wife. Beginning with Pope Martin&#x27;s bull dated 18 November 1282, wherein he again excommunicated Michael—as well as Peter of Aragon, John of Procida, and Michael&#x27;s emissary Benedetto Zaccaria—as the author of the conspiracy that led to the Sicilian Vespers, Michael has been seen as the instigator. Geanakoplos, while admitting that Michael was in contact with the leaders of the revolt beforehand, asserts &quot;that Michael Palaeologus, on his part, had nothing to do with the incident at the church of Santo Spirito is beyond question.&quot;

Furthermore, Michael VIII was instrumental in instigating revolts in Crete against the Venetians, the most famous of which was led by the Hortatzoi brothers Georgios and Theodore of Mesi in Rethymnon, with a duration of six years, causing most significant harm to the Venetian occupants and economic interests of Venice. Michael VIII had aimed to eventually bring Venice, an ally of Charles of Anjou, to the table of negotiations, as he did, at his court in Constantinople.

== Death and legacy ==
Michael VIII died in Pachomios village, Thrace on 11 December 1282. He was denied burial in Constantinople due to his persecution of the Church in support of union with Rome, so was instead laid to rest in a monastery called Nea Mone in the region of Rhaidestos (modern Tekirdağ). Three years later, in 1285, his remains were moved to the monastery of Christ in Selymbria, where in 1260 he had reburied the body of Basil II.

In reconstituting the Byzantine Empire Michael VIII restored the old administration without endeavouring to correct its failures. In recovering Constantinople and investing in the defence of his European provinces, Michael VIII began to denude the Anatolian frontier of its troops and was forced to lower their pay or cancel their tax exemptions. This policy led to the gradual collapse of the frontier, which was infiltrated by Turkish bands even before his death. The Palaiologan dynasty he established ruled the Byzantine Empire for almost two centuries, longer than any other in Roman history. Also, during his reign there was a temporary naval revival in which the Byzantine navy consisted of 80 ships.

== Family ==

In 1253, Michael VIII Palaiologos married Theodora Palaiologina, a grandniece of John III Doukas Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea. Orphaned in childhood, she was raised by her great-uncle John III, who was said to have &quot;loved her like a daughter&quot;, and who arranged for her marriage to Michael. Their children were:
* Manuel Palaiologos (c. 1255–before 1259)
* Irene Palaiologina (c. 1256–before 1328), who married emperor Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria
* Andronikos II Palaiologos (1259–1332), Byzantine emperor
* Anna Palaiologina (c. 1260–1299/1300), who married Demetrios/Michael Komnenos Doukas, third son of Michael II of Epirus
* Constantine Palaiologos (1261–1306), who married Eirene Raoulaina his second cousin
* Theodora Palaiologina, who married King David VI of Georgia
* Eudokia Palaiologina, who married Emperor John II of Trebizond
* Theodore Palaiologos (c. 1263 – after 1310)

By a mistress, a Diplovatatzina, Michael VIII also had two illegitimate daughters:
* Euphrosyne Palaiologina, who married Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde
* Maria Palaiologina, who married Abaqa Khan of Ilkhanid Persia

<doc id="72339" wikidata="Q19842373" url="?curid=72339" title="Blackberry">
<text>The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus &quot;Rubus&quot; in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus &quot;Rubus&quot;, and hybrids between the subgenera &quot;Rubus&quot; and &quot;Idaeobatus&quot;. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.

Blackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of per possible, making this plant commercially attractive.

&quot;Rubus armeniacus&quot; (&quot;Himalayan&quot; blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.

==Description==
What distinguishes the blackberry from its raspberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) &quot;picks with&quot; (i.e., stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus stays with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains on the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit.
The term &quot;bramble&quot;, a word referring to any impenetrable thicket, has in some circles traditionally been applied specifically to the blackberry or its products, though in the United States it applies to all members of the genus &quot;Rubus&quot;. In the western US, the term &quot;caneberry&quot; is used to refer to blackberries and raspberries as a group rather than the term bramble. &quot;Briar&quot; or &quot;brier&quot; may be used to refer to the dense vines of the plant, though this name is used for other thorny thickets (such as &quot;Smilax&quot;) as well.

The usually black fruit is not a berry in the botanical sense, as it is termed botanically as an aggregate fruit, composed of small drupelets. It is a widespread and well-known group of over 375 species, many of which are closely related apomictic microspecies native throughout Europe, northwestern Africa, temperate western and central Asia and North and South America.

=== Plants ===
Blackberries are perennial plants bearing biennial stems (called &quot;canes&quot;) from their roots.

In its first year, a new stem, the &quot;primocane&quot;, reaches a full length of about trailing on the ground and bearing large palmate compound leaves with 5–7 new leaves; it does not produce any flowers. In its second year, the cane is a &quot;floricane&quot; with a non-growing stem. The lateral buds open to produce flowering laterals. First- and second-year shoots produce short-curved, sharp thorns. Thornless cultivars have been developed during the early 21st century.

Unmanaged plants tend to aggregate in a dense tangle of stems and branches, which can be controlled in gardens or farms using trellises. Blackberry shrubs can tolerate poor soils, spreading readily in wasteland, ditches, and roadsides.

The flowers bloom in late spring and early summer on the tips of branches. Each flower is about in diameter, with five white-pink petals. The fruit only develops around ovules fertilized by the male gamete from a pollen grain. The most likely cause of undeveloped ovules is inadequate pollinator visits. Incomplete drupelet development can signal infection with raspberry bushy dwarf virus.
=== Genetics ===
The loci controlling the primocane fruiting was mapped in the F Locus, on LG7, whereas thorns/thornlessness was mapped on LG4. Better understanding of the genetics is useful for genetic screening of cross-breds, and for genetic engineering purposes.

== Ecology ==
Blackberry leaves are food for certain caterpillars; some grazing mammals, especially deer, are also very fond of the leaves. Caterpillars of the concealer moth &quot;Alabonia geoffrella&quot; have been found feeding inside dead blackberry shoots. When mature, the berries are eaten and their seeds dispersed by mammals, such as the red fox, American black bear, and the Eurasian badger, as well as by small birds.
Blackberries grow wild throughout most of Europe. They are an important element in the ecology of many countries, and harvesting the berries is a common pastime. However, their vigorous growth and tendency to grow unchecked if not managed correctly mean that the plants are also considered a weed, sending down roots from branches that touch the ground, and sending up suckers from the roots. In some parts of the world, such as in Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, some blackberry species, particularly &quot;Rubus armeniacus&quot; (Himalayan blackberry) and &quot;Rubus laciniatus&quot; (evergreen blackberry), are naturalized and considered an invasive species and a noxious weed.

Blackberry fruits are red when unripe, leading to an old expression that &quot;blackberries are red when they&#x27;re green&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
Worldwide, Mexico is the leading producer of blackberries, with nearly the entire crop being produced for export into the off-season fresh markets in North America and Europe. Until 2018, the Mexican market was almost entirely based on the cultivar &#x27;Tupy&#x27; (often spelled &#x27;Tupi&#x27;, but the EMBRAPA program in Brazil from which it was released prefers the &#x27;Tupy&#x27; spelling), but Tupy fell out of favor in some Mexican growing regions. In the US, Oregon is the leading commercial blackberry producer, producing on in 2017.

Numerous cultivars have been selected for commercial and amateur cultivation in Europe and the United States. Since the many species form hybrids easily, there are numerous cultivars with more than one species in their ancestry.

=== History ===
Modern hybridization and cultivar development took place mostly in the US. In 1880, a hybrid blackberry-raspberry named the loganberry was developed in Santa Cruz, California, by an American judge and horticulturalist, James Harvey Logan. One of the first thornless varieties was developed in 1921, but the berries lost much of their flavor. Common thornless cultivars developed from the 1990s to the early 21st century by the US Department of Agriculture enabled efficient machine-harvesting, higher yields, larger and firmer fruit, and improved flavor, including the &quot;Triple Crown&quot;, &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Nightfall&quot;, a marionberry.

=== Hybrids ===

&#x27;Marion&#x27; (marketed as &quot;marionberry&quot;) is an important cultivar that was selected from seedlings from a cross between &#x27;Chehalem&#x27; and &#x27;Olallie&#x27; (commonly called &quot;Olallieberry&quot;) berries. &#x27;Olallie&#x27; in turn is a cross between loganberry and youngberry. &#x27;Marion&#x27;, &#x27;Chehalem&#x27; and &#x27;Olallie&#x27; are just three of many trailing blackberry cultivars developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) blackberry breeding program at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.

The most recent cultivars released from this program are the thornless cultivars &#x27;Black Diamond&#x27;, &#x27;Black Pearl&#x27;, and &#x27;Nightfall&#x27; as well as the early-ripening &#x27;Obsidian&#x27; and &#x27;Metolius&#x27;. &#x27;Black Diamond&#x27; is now the leading cultivar being planted in the Pacific Northwest. Some of the other cultivars from this program are &#x27;Newberry&#x27;, &#x27;Waldo&#x27;, &#x27;Siskiyou&#x27;, &#x27;Black Butte&#x27;, &#x27;Kotata&#x27;, &#x27;Pacific&#x27;, and &#x27;Cascade&#x27;.

Varieties with good commercial characteristics developed in Arkansas are grown in nurseries in Oklahoma. Such blackberries are easy to grow, and may produce fruit for a decade or more. These varieties have diverse flavors varying from sweet to tart.

===Trailing===
Trailing blackberries are vigorous and crown-forming, require a trellis for support, and are less cold-hardy than erect or semi-erect blackberries. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, these types do well in similar climates, such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Chile, and the Mediterranean countries.

===Thornless===
Semi-erect, prickle-free blackberries were first developed at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, and subsequently by the USDA-ARS in Beltsville, Maryland. These are crown-forming and very vigorous and need a trellis for support. Cultivars include &#x27;Black Satin&#x27;, &#x27;Chester Thornless&#x27;, &#x27;Dirksen Thornless&#x27;, &#x27;Hull Thornless&#x27;, &#x27;Loch Maree&#x27;, &#x27;Loch Ness&#x27;, &#x27;Loch Tay&#x27;, &#x27;Merton Thornless&#x27;, &#x27;Smoothstem&#x27;, and &#x27;Triple Crown&#x27;. &#x27;Loch Ness&#x27; and &#x27;Loch Tay&#x27; have gained the RHS&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. The cultivar &#x27;Cacanska Bestrna&#x27; (also called &#x27;Cacak Thornless&#x27;) has been developed in Serbia and has been planted on many thousands of hectares there.

===Erect===
The University of Arkansas has developed cultivars of erect blackberries. These types are less vigorous than the semi-erect types and produce new canes from root initials (therefore they spread underground like raspberries). There are prickly and prickle-free cultivars from this program, including &#x27;Navaho&#x27;, &#x27;Ouachita&#x27;, &#x27;Cherokee&#x27;, &#x27;Apache&#x27;, &#x27;Arapaho&#x27;, and &#x27;Kiowa&#x27;. They are also responsible for developing the primocane fruiting blackberries such as &#x27;Prime-Jan&#x27; and &#x27;Prime-Jim&#x27;.

===Primocane===
In raspberries, these types are called primocane fruiting, fall fruiting, or everbearing. &#x27;Prime-Jim&#x27; and &#x27;Prime-Jan&#x27; were released in 2004 by the University of Arkansas and are the first cultivars of primocane fruiting blackberry. They grow much like the other erect cultivars described above; however, the canes that emerge in the spring will flower in midsummer and fruit in late summer or fall. The fall crop has its highest quality when it ripens in cool mild climates such as in California or the Pacific Northwest.

&#x27;Illini Hardy&#x27;, a semi-erect prickly cultivar introduced by the University of Illinois, is cane hardy in zone 5, where blackberry production has traditionally been problematic since canes often failed to survive the winter.

===Mexico and Chile===
Blackberry production in Mexico expanded considerably in the early 21st century. In 2017, Mexico had 97% of the market share for fresh blackberries imported into the United States, while Chile had 61% of the market share for American imports of frozen blackberries.

While once based on the cultivar &#x27;Brazos&#x27;, an old erect blackberry cultivar developed in Texas in 1959, the Mexican industry is now dominated by the Brazilian &#x27;Tupy&#x27; released in the 1990s. The &#x27;Tupy&#x27; has the erect blackberry &#x27;Comanche&#x27;, and a &quot;wild Uruguayan blackberry&quot; as parents. Since there are no native blackberries in Uruguay, the suspicion is that the widely grown &#x27;Boysenberry&#x27; is the male parent. To produce these blackberries in regions of Mexico where there is no winter chilling to stimulate flower bud development, chemical defoliation and application of growth regulators are used to bring the plants into bloom.

===Diseases and pests===
Because blackberries belong to the same genus as raspberries, they share the same diseases, including anthracnose (a type of canker), which can cause the berry to have uneven ripening. Sap flow may also be slowed. They also share the same remedies, including the Bordeaux mixture, a combination of lime, water and copper(II) sulfate. The rows between blackberry plants must be free of weeds, blackberry suckers and grasses, which may lead to pests or diseases. Fruit growers are selective when planting blackberry bushes because wild blackberries may be infected, and gardeners are recommended to purchase only certified disease-free plants.

The spotted-wing drosophila, &quot;Drosophila suzukii&quot;, is a serious pest of blackberries. Unlike its vinegar fly relatives, which are primarily attracted to rotting or fermented fruit, &quot;D. suzukii&quot; attacks fresh, ripe fruit by laying eggs under the soft skin. The larvae hatch and grow in the fruit, destroying the fruit&#x27;s commercial value.

Another pest is &quot;Amphorophora rubi&quot;, known as the blackberry aphid, which eats not just blackberries but raspberries as well.

&quot;Byturus tomentosus&quot; (raspberry beetle), &quot;Lampronia corticella&quot; (raspberry moth) and &quot;Anthonomus rubi&quot; (strawberry blossom weevil) are also known to infest blackberries.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrients ===
Raw blackberries are 88% water, 10% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and 0.5% fat (table). In a reference amount, raw cultivated blackberries supply 43 calories and rich contents (20% or more of the Daily Value (DV) of dietary fiber, manganese (31% DV), vitamin C (25% DV), and vitamin K (19% DV) (table).

====Seed composition====
Blackberries contain numerous large seeds that consumers do not always prefer. The seeds contain oil rich in omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) fats as well as protein, dietary fiber, carotenoids, ellagitannins, and ellagic acid.

===Culinary use===
The ripe fruit is commonly used in desserts, jams, jelly, wine, and liqueurs. It may be mixed with other berries and fruits for pies and crumbles.

===Phytochemical research===
Blackberries contain numerous phytochemicals including polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, salicylic acid, ellagic acid, and fiber. Anthocyanins in blackberries are responsible for their rich dark color. One report placed blackberries at the top of more than 1,000 polyphenol-rich foods consumed in the United States, but this concept of a health benefit from consuming dark-colored foods like blackberries remains scientifically unverified and not accepted for health claims on food labels.

=== Historical uses ===
One of the earliest known instances of blackberry consumption comes from the remains of the Haraldskær Woman, the naturally preserved bog body of a Danish woman dating from approximately 2,500 years ago. Forensic evidence found blackberries in her stomach contents, among other foods. The use of blackberries to make wines and cordials was documented in the London Pharmacopoeia in 1696. In the culinary world, blackberries have long been used alongside other fruits to make pies, jellies, and jams.

Blackberry plants were used for traditional medicine by Greeks, other European peoples, and aboriginal Americans. A 1771 document described brewing blackberry leaves, stem, and bark for stomach ulcers.

Blackberry fruit, leaves, and stems have been used to dye fabrics and hair. Native Americans have even been known to use the stems to make rope. The shrubs have also been used for barriers around buildings, crops, and livestock. The wild plants have sharp, thick prickles, which offer some protection against enemies and large animals.

==In culture==
Folklore in the United Kingdom and Ireland tells us that blackberries should not be picked after Old Michaelmas Day (11 October) as the devil (or a Púca) has made them unfit to eat by stepping, spitting or fouling on them. There is some value in this legend as autumn&#x27;s wetter and cooler weather often allows the fruit to become infected by various molds such as &quot;Botryotinia&quot; which give the fruit an unpleasant look and may be toxic. According to some traditions, a blackberry&#x27;s deep purple color represents Jesus&#x27;s blood and the crown of thorns was made of brambles, although other thorny plants, such as &quot;Crataegus&quot; (hawthorn) and &quot;Euphorbia milii&quot; (crown of thorns plant), have been proposed as the material for the crown.

<text>Metropolitan Manila ( ), commonly shortened to Metro Manila and formally the National Capital Region (NCR; ), is the capital region and largest metropolitan area of the Philippines. Located on the eastern shore of Manila Bay, the region lies between the Central Luzon and Calabarzon regions. Encompassing an area of and with a population of as of 2020, it consists of sixteen highly urbanized cities: Manila—the capital city—Caloocan, Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, along with one independent municipality, Pateros. As the second most populous and the most densely populated region in the Philippines, it ranks as the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Asia and the 6th most populous urban area in the world.

The region is the center of culture (including arts and entertainment), economy, education and government of the Philippines. Designated as a global power city, the region exerts a significant impact on commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, both locally and internationally. It is the home to all embassies in the Philippines, thereby making it an important center for international diplomacy in the country. Its economic power makes the region the country&#x27;s premier center for finance and commerce. The region accounts for 36% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines. Greater Manila is the fourth largest ASEAN country subdivision by GDP after Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok. 

In 1975, in response to the need to sustain and provide integrated services to the growing population, the built-up area centered on Manila was formally recognized as a metropolitan area through Presidential Decree No. 824. A year later, Presidential Decree No. 879 established Metro Manila as an administrative region, retaining its earlier status as a metropolis, and was designated as Region IV, with the remainder of the Southern Tagalog region being designated as Region IV-A. Finally, in 1978, Metro Manila became the National Capital Region (NCR) of the Philippines, discontinuing its numerical designation and reverting it to Southern Tagalog.

==History==

===Kingdom of Maynila===
Manila, to the extent that it has this placename, was likely founded in the Middle Ages, in the early 16th century due to the Sanskrit origin of the component &quot;nila&quot; in its name which refers to &quot;indigo&quot;, and the prevalence of the placename during the rule of Rajah Matanda, the old king of Maynila, who was born somewhere between the late 15th century to the early 16th century. The earliest evidence of Hinduism and Sanskrit influence in maritime Southeast Asia is in Sanskrit inscriptions from the late 300s in eastern Kalimantan (or Borneo). This analysis of the placename is supported by many other nearby placenames in the Tagalog region with the prefix &quot;may-&quot;.

Manila has historically been a global city due to its role for international trade. By the 15th and 16th centuries, Manila was a walled and fortified city and was the capital of the Kingdom of Luzon. Its institution, government, and economy were associated with the Tagalogs and the Kapampangans, and the Malay language was extensively used for foreign affairs as customary in much of Southeast Asia at the time. It was also well known by other Southeast Asian kingdoms such as Cebu, Brunei, Melaka, other Malay kingdoms, and Ternate, and may be known in East Asia as far as China and Japan.

In the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, there were several lordships that were either sovereign or tributary such as Tondo (&quot;Tundun&quot;), Navotas (&quot;Nabútas&quot;), Tambobong (&quot;Tambúbong&quot;), Taguig (&quot;Tagiig&quot;), Parañaque (&quot;Palanyág&quot;) and Cainta (&quot;Kaintâ&quot;).

Shortly after Rajah Matanda&#x27;s birth, sometime around the early 16th century while he was &quot;rajahmuda&quot; or heir apparent, his father, the King of Luzon, died, leaving his mother as the queen regent of Luzon. By 1511, Luzonians had been carrying out large-scale trade at least within maritime Southeast Asia with some Luzonians being hired as officials in Melaka and some Luzonian merchants gaining royal favors in Brunei. It was in Melaka that Luzonians met the Portuguese before the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511. In 1521, Rajah Matanda, then still a young man known as Ache, was known in maritime Southeast Asia as the son of the King of Luzon. He married a princess of Brunei and served as an admiral for his grandfather, the Sultan of Brunei, in an attack near Java in exchange for soldiers and a fleet of ships. On the way home, he met and had an encounter with a Castilian fleet.

Some Luzonians in the 1500s had also been taking part in mercenary work in other kingdoms. The Luzonians&#x27; commercial influence also reached as far as Butuan. By the 1570s, the ruling class of Manila together with the international Luzonian merchants were Muslim and Islam was spreading through the freemen and the slaves.

On May 24, 1570, the battle of Manila was fought between the Kingdom of Luzon, under the command of the heir apparent Prince Sulayman, and the Kingdom of Spain, under the command of field marshal Martin de Goiti who was aided by some foreign forces. This resulted in the arson and destruction of Manila.

===Spanish rule===


After destroying Manila, the Spanish set up a settlement to secure territory on the same site on the Luzon island for the Spanish ruler. Initially enclosed in wood, much later in stone, a new walled city of Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies. After setting up a settlement and consolidating some territorial holdings outwards, the Spanish instituted a province known as Manila.

Later on, the Manila galleon continually sailed the Pacific from end-to-end, bringing to Mexico Asian merchandise and cultural exchange.















Outside the Walled city of Manila has become the city&#x27;s suburbs known as Extramuros (Outside the wall) made up of several pueblos, altogether making up the province known as Tondo which was established in January 1571 and would later on, be renamed as the province of Manila in 1859 with the city of Manila (Intramuros) as its capital.

===First Philippine Republic===
In the First Philippine Republic, the province included the walled city of Manila and 23 other municipalities. Mariquina also served as the provincial capital of Manila from 1898 to 1899. However, despite almost the entirety of the territory being occupied by Philippine forces, the walled city of Manila was occupied by Spanish forces.

===American rule===
====Creation of the province of Rizal====
During American rule, the province was dissolved and most of it was incorporated into the newly created province of Rizal on June 11, 1901, by Act No. 137. In the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, the towns of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Mariquina (now Marikina), Pasig, Parañaque, Malabon, Navotas, San Juan del Monte (now San Juan), San Pedro de Macati (now Makati), San Felipe Neri (now Mandaluyong), Muntinlupa and the Taguig-Pateros area were designated to Rizal, with Pasig being the provincial capital. On the other hand, Polo (now Valenzuela) remained in Bulacan.

Manila in 1901 was composed of Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Manila, Pandacan, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Fernando de Dilao, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Ana de Sapa, Santa Cruz, and Tondo.

In the American rule, the American architect Daniel Burnham was commissioned to propose a Plan of Manila for the Philippine government. 

===Philippine Commonwealth===
In 1939, during the Philippine Commonwealth, President Manuel L. Quezon established Quezon City with the objective of replacing Manila as the capital city of the Philippines. A design for Quezon City was completed. The establishment of Quezon City meant the abandonment of Burnham&#x27;s design for Manila, with funds being diverted for the establishment of the new capital

===Japanese invasion and Second Philippine Republic===
====Creation of the city of Greater Manila====
In 1942, during the World War II, President Manuel L. Quezon created the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure, merging the cities of Manila and Quezon City, along with the municipalities of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Parañaque, Pasay, and San Juan. Furthermore, Manila was divided into the districts of Bagumbuhay, Bagumpanahon, Bagumbayan, and Bagungdiwa, while Quezon City was divided into the districts of Diliman and Balintawak. Jorge B. Vargas was appointed as its first mayor. Mayors in the municipalities and heads in the city districts included in the City of Greater Manila served as district chiefs. This was to ensure that Vargas, who was Quezon&#x27;s principal lieutenant for administrative matters, would have a position of authority recognized under international military law. The City of Greater Manila served as a model for the present-day Metro Manila and the administrative functions of the Governor of Metro Manila that was established during the Marcos administration. 

After World War II, in 1945, President Sergio Osmeña signed Executive Order No. 58, which dissolved the city of Greater Manila instituted by former President Quezon.

===Third Philippine Republic===
====Creation of the National Capital Region====
World War II resulted in the loss of more than 100,000 lives in the battle of Manila in 1945. Most of the developments in Burnham&#x27;s design were also destroyed. Later on, Quezon City was eventually declared as the national capital in 1948 and later expanded to the areas formerly under the jurisdiction of Caloocan, Marikina, and San Mateo, Rizal. 

====Reinstitution as Metropolitan Manila under martial law====
On February 27, 1975, a referendum was held wherein residents of Greater Manila approved granting President Ferdinand Marcos the authority to restructure the local governments into an integrated system like a manager-commission for under such terms and conditions as he may decide. On November 7, 1975, Metro Manila was formally established through Presidential Decree No. 824. The Metropolitan Manila Commission was also created to manage the region. On June 2, 1978, through Presidential Decree No. 1396, the metropolitan area was declared the National Capital Region of the Philippines. When Metro Manila was established, there were four cities, Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay and the thirteen municipalities of Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela. At present, all but one of these municipalities have become independent chartered cities; only Pateros still remains as a municipality.

President Marcos appointed his wife, First Lady Imelda Marcos, as the first governor of Metro Manila. She launched the City of Man campaign. The Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex, Metropolitan Folk Arts Theater, Philippine International Convention Center, Coconut Palace and healthcare facilities such as the Lung Center of the Philippines, Philippine Heart Center, and the Kidney Center of the Philippines are all constructed precisely for this purpose. 

The capital of the Philippines was re-designated to Manila in 1976 through Presidential Decree No. 940. The decree states that Manila has always been, to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world, the premier city of the Philippines, being the center of trade, commerce, education, and culture. While the then-newly formed region was designated as the seat of government.

===Fourth Philippine Republic===
President Marcos was overthrown in a non-violent revolution along EDSA, which lasted four days in late February 1986. The popular uprising, now known as the People Power Revolution, made international headlines as &quot;the revolution that surprised the world&quot;.

===Fifth Philippine Republic===
In 1986, President Corazon Aquino laid down the Executive Order No. 392, reorganizing and changing the structure of the Metropolitan Manila Commission and renamed it to the Metropolitan Manila Authority. Mayors in the metropolis chose from among themselves the chair of the agency. Later on, it was again reorganized in 1995 through Republic Act No. 7924, creating the present-day Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. The chairperson of the agency would be appointed by the President and should not have a concurrent elected position such as mayor. Elfren Cruz was the last to serve as the Officer-In-Charge governor of Metro Manila.

Throughout 1988, unemployment among the country&#x27;s regions was highest in Metro Manila, with 20.1% of the region&#x27;s workforce being jobless according to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the National Statistics Office.

In 2014, then-MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino proposed that San Pedro, Laguna be included in Metro Manila as its 18th member city. Tolentino said that in the first meeting of the MMDA Council of mayors in January 2015, he would push for the inclusion of the city to the MMDA. Senator Aquilino &quot;Koko&quot; Pimentel III filed Senate Bill No. 3029, which seeks to create San Pedro as a separate legislative district to commence in the next national and local elections if the bill was passed into law.

In April 2022, Makati lost the territorial dispute with Taguig regarding the Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation, which was ruled with finality a year later in April 2023. The entire military reservation which includes Bonifacio Global City, and the ten Enlisted Men&#x27;s Barrios (EMBO) barangays, were declared as part of Taguig. The ten EMBO barangays were reintegrated to Taguig in 2023.

==Geography==

Metro Manila is located in the southwestern portion of Luzon. The region lies along the flat alluvial lands extending from the mouth of the Pasig River in the west to the higher rugged lands of Marikina Valley in the east. The region is geographically divided into 4 zones: the Coastal Margin, Guadalupe Plateau, Marikina Valley, and the Laguna Lowlands.

The Coastal Margin or Lowland is a flat and low plain that faces Manila Bay. Located here is Manila, Navotas, parts of Malabon, and the western part and reclaimed areas of Pasay and Parañaque, where the ground elevation ranges from zero meters on Manila Bay to at the west side of the cities of Mandaluyong and Makati. The Coastal Lowland possesses resources for offshore fisheries and fishpond development, and various reclamation projects in the area are meant for mixed-use urban development.

The Central or Guadalupe Plateau is the most adaptable to urban development activities not only because of its solid geographical foundations but also because of its existing infrastructure links with the rest of Luzon. It is mainly residential and includes the densely populated areas of Metro Manila such San Juan, Makati and Quezon City, as well as most parts of Caloocan and Mandaluyong. The ground elevation ranges from and gradually becomes lower towards its western side, while ground elevation ranges from towards the northwestern side of the plateau. The area becomes narrower along the Pasig River.

The Marikina Valley is a floodplain along the Marikina River and a delta along Laguna de Bay. Its elevation ranges from on the Laguna de Bay side to on its north side towards Montalban. It is surrounded by the Central Plateau and mountains of Rizal. It has fertile land suitable for crop cultivation while the Marikina River provides water for industrial uses and discharge.

The Laguna Lowlands is not only suitable for agriculture and aquaculture but also for industrial activity.

===Natural hazards===
Metro Manila is exposed to multiple natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, and typhoons. It is surrounded by active faults including the Marikina Valley Fault System. Other distant faults such as the Philippine Faults, Lubang Faults, Manila Trench and Casiguran Faults, are a threat as well. Flooding is recurrent every year especially in low-lying areas of Valenzuela, Malabon, Caloocan, Navotas, Manila, Pasay, Parañaque, and Las Piñas, where flood are generally linked with the tidal movements in Manila Bay. Meanwhile, Marikina, Pasig, Taguig, and Pateros are areas inland that are also prone to flooding. These areas are located along the Marikina Valley where there is poor soil drainage and a shallow water table due to being in proximity to Laguna Bay&#x27;s shores. Flood risks are generally lower in cities along the Guadalupe Plateau, including Quezon City, San Juan, Makati, Mandaluyong and Muntinlupa, where volcanic rocks rise up to above sea level. Around five to seven typhoons hit Manila yearly. Manila was ranked as the second riskiest capital city after Tokyo to live in according to Swiss Re.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, there are two climates in Metro Manila. Most of the region has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) while the northeastern part of the region that lies on the foothills of Sierra Madre has a tropical monsoon climate. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that temperatures are hot year-round, rarely going below 15 °C or above 39 °C. Temperature extremes have ranged from 14.4 °C on January 11, 1914, to 38.8 °C on April 27, 2024.

Humidity levels are usually very high all year round. Manila has a distinct dry season from December through April, and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. Typhoons usually occur from June to September.


===Parks===


There are four national parks in Metro Manila. These are the Rizal Park, Paco Park, and Fort Santiago in the City of Manila and Quezon Memorial National Park in Quezon City. Rizal Park and Paco Park are managed by the National Parks and Development Committee (NPDC), while Fort Santiago is managed by the Intramuros Administration. A tripartite agreement between the Quezon City Government, the National Historical Institute and the NPDC transferred the management of Quezon Memorial National Park to the Quezon City Government. The region also has three protected areas, namely the Rizal Park, Ninoy Aquino Parks &amp; Wildlife Center and the Manila Bay Beach Resort.

Rizal Park, also known as Luneta Park, is considered the largest urban park in Asia with an area of . The park along with the historic walled area of Intramuros are designated as flagship destination to become a tourism enterprise zone according to the Tourism Act of 2009. Paco Park is a recreational garden which was once the city&#x27;s municipal cemetery built by the Dominicans during the Spanish colonial period. Filipino Landscape architect IP Santos, the &quot;Father of Philippine Landscape Architecture&quot;, was commissioned to do the design of converting the former cemetery into a park.

Manila Zoo is the oldest zoo in Asia, which was founded in 1959. It is the home to more than a thousand animals from 90 different species including the 40-year-old elephant, Mali. The zoo has an average of 4,000 visitors weekly. An estimated 40,000 tourists visit the zoo each month.

The Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA) was declared as a critical habitat by the Government of the Philippines in 2007 and was listed by the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Importance in 2013. LPPCHEA is composed of the Freedom Island in Parañaque and the Long Island in Las Piñas that covers 175 hectares and features a mangrove forest of eight species, tidal mudflats, secluded ponds with fringing salt-tolerant vegetation, a coastal lagoon, and a beach.

==Government and politics==


The framework of government and governance in Metro Manila is based on Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the &quot;Local Government Code of 1991&quot;. This law outlines the powers and responsibilities of all local government units (LGUS) in the Philippines and thus forms the basis of inter-local governmental relations among the area&#x27;s constituent local governments. The local government code grants these units significant political and administrative autonomy in accordance with the principles of decentralization and devolution of power. This situation presents a challenge to the coordination of policy and service delivery across the multiple autonomous local government units and is thus the underlying dilemma of metropolitan governance in Metro Manila.

The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is the agency responsible for the delivery of public services in Metro Manila. Its services are limited to traffic management and garbage collection. Previously Metro Manila was governed by a regional government authority, the Metro Manila Commission and was led by a governor.

A bill was introduced in 2014 proposing the creation of a new governing body in Metro Manila to be known as the Metropolitan Manila Regional Administration (MMRA). Unlike the MMDA which is limited to being an administrative coordinating body, the proposed MMRA will have police and other typical municipal powers and is more akin to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

Metro Manila, the National Capital Region, is the seat of the national government. All the main offices of the executive departments of the country are in Metro Manila. The Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Agriculture, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National Housing Authority and Philippine Coconut Authority has their main offices based around Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City.

Manila, the capital city of the country, is the home to Malacañan Palace, the official residence and office of the President of the Philippines. The city is also the home to the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Other key national institutions based in Manila are the Court of Appeals, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Departments of Budget and Management, Finance, Health, Justice, Labor and Employment and Public Works and Highways. Meanwhile, the Department of Science and Technology is based in Taguig while the Department of Tourism has its headquarters in Makati. Important economic and financial institutions headquartered in the region are the Asian Development Bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines and the National Economic and Development Authority.

The main office of the Government Service Insurance System in Pasay serves as home to the Senate of the Philippines. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives of the Philippines is based in the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City along with the Sandiganbayan. The Coconut Palace once served as the official office and residence of the Vice President of the Philippines in 2010–2016 and then the Quezon City Reception House for 2016-2022.

===Administrative divisions===
The political and administrative boundaries of the National Capital Region has not changed since its formation in 1975 as a public corporation under Presidential Decree No. 824. They are composed of sixteen independent cities, classified as &quot;highly urbanized cities&quot;, and one independent municipality: Pateros.




===Districts===
Unlike other administrative regions in the Philippines, Metro Manila is not composed of provinces. Instead, the region is divided into four geographic areas called &quot;districts&quot;. The districts have their district centers at the four original cities in the region: the city-district of Manila (Capital District), Quezon City (Eastern Manila), Caloocan (Northern Manila, also informally known as &quot;Camanava&quot;), and Pasay (Southern Manila). The districts serve mainly to organize the region&#x27;s local government units for fiscal and statistical purposes.

===Future expansion===
There is a high demand for the inclusion of San Pedro, Laguna in Metro Manila. Support groups from the local government and non-government organizations are striving to incorporate San Pedro into Metro Manila. San Pedro was looked at as the 18th member of Metro Manila during former MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino&#x27;s term. Tolentino pushed for the inclusion of San Pedro in the National Capital Region to become its 18th member city.

==Demographics==
Metro Manila has a population of according to the 2020 national census. Its total urban area, composed of the urban agglomeration which refers to the continuous urban expansion of Metro Manila into the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Batangas has an estimated population of as of 2015. It is the second most populous (after Calabarzon) and most densely populated region in the Philippines, the 7th most populous metropolitan area in Asia, and the 4th most populous urban area in the world.

Prior to the transfer of the Embo barangays from Makati to Taguig in 2023, the most populous cities in Metro Manila are Quezon City (2,960,048), Manila (1,846,513), Caloocan (1,661,584), Taguig (886,722), Pasig (803,159), Valenzuela (714,978), Parañaque (689,992), Las Piñas (606,293), Makati (629,616), and Muntinlupa (543,445).

===Poverty, housing and urban slums===


From the 1980s up to the present, informal settlers have accounted for roughly one-third of the Metro Manila population. A majority of informal settlers belong to the middle-class. In 2014, there are an estimated four million slum dwellers living in Metro Manila. Homelessness is also a major problem in Metro Manila. However, these are being addressed by creating in-city relocation housing, and by relocating informal settler families in low-density housing built in the nearby provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal.

During the American occupation, housing policies in Manila dealt the problem of sanitation and concentration of settlers around business areas. Among those implemented were business codes and sanitation laws in slum areas in the 1930s. During this period and until the 1950s, new communities were opened for relocation. Among these were Projects 1–8 in Quezon City and the Vitas tenement houses in Tondo. The government implemented the Public Housing Policy in 1947 that established the People&#x27;s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). A few years later, it put up the Slum Clearance Committee which, with the help of the PHHC, relocated thousands of families from Tondo and Quezon City to Sapang Palay in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan in the 1960s.

During the time of President Ferdinand Marcos, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank supported the programs for the &quot;development of relocation&quot; and &quot;on-site development&quot;. Carmona and Dasmariñas in Cavite and San Pedro in Laguna opened as relocation sites. Along with the establishment of the National Housing Authority (Philippines), Presidential Decree 772 made squatting a crime, making the Philippines one of only two countries (the other is South Africa) where squatting is a crime. The government formulated the National Shelter Program which became the over-all framework for dealing with housing needs of all income classes.

Imelda Marcos held both the position as Governor of Metro Manila and as Minister of Human Settlements and Ecology (MHSE) until the downfall of the dictatorship in 1986. The MHSE, through loans from the World Bank, initiated the Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and Services (BLISS) housing projects not only in Metro Manila but also in other provinces.

From 1960 to 1992, the government transferred some 328,000 families to resettlement sites from Metro Manila. According to the Asian Coalition on Housing Rights, during President Corazon C. Aquino&#x27;s time, the government would bring some 100,000 persons to relocation sites yearly. During the said period, Sapang Palay and Carmona had a 60% abandonment rate. Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) in 1992. The law gave a new name for the squatters: informal settlers. Essentially, UDHA gives protection for big private ownership of land in the urban areas, ensuring that these are protected from illegal occupants. The law also widened the scope of private sector participation in the National Shelter Program (NSP).

In the middle of the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, infrastructure projects of the government led to the demolition of hundreds of thousands of families (from along railways, C-4 Road, C-5 Road, and from Fort Bonifacio). During the same period, new relocation sites in Bulacan, Valenzuela and Caloocan opened.

=== Languages ===
The primary mainstream spoken casual vernacular language is Tagalog (Filipino), which is taught in all schools across Metro Manila under Filipino class. The main formal medium of instruction used in schools and the main language (at least primarily in most written contexts) for commerce, industry, and government is English, ever since the American colonial era. Meanwhile formerly, Spanish used to be the formal lingua franca since the Spanish colonial era till the 20th century and is now mostly moribund across Metro Manila, besides the rare few families who may privately use it and the Spanish taught in a few schools and universities as a foreign language elective. Among Chinese Filipinos, Philippine Hokkien may also occasionally be heard spoken amongst fellow speakers especially within households, schools, churches, temples, businesses who privately use it, while Mandarin (Standard Chinese) is taught in Chinese class in Chinese Filipino schools and as a foreign language elective in a few schools and universities. There are also the occasional speaker of other Philippine languages coming from the provinces working, studying, or living in Metro Manila, such as speakers of Cebuano Bisaya, Ilocano, Hiligaynon (Ilonggo), Central Bikolano, Chavacano, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, Waray, etc. There are also the rare Japanese Filipino that speaks Japanese, Korean Filipino that speaks Korean, Iranian Filipino that speaks Farsi (Persian), Indian Filipino that speaks Punjabi or etc. There are also a few Japanese schools teaching Japanese in Japanese class in Metro Manila, such as the Manila Japanese School and of course, a few schools and universities teaching it as a foreign language elective.

The region&#x27;s retail sector remains strong, bolstered by remittances abroad, BPOs, and its tourism sector.

Historically, the main business district of the metropolis was Binondo, where commercial trading flourished since the 15th century. By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to Makati.

Also there are five circumferential roads forming a series of concentric semi-circular arcs around Manila. The circumferential and radial roads are systems of interconnected roads, bridges and highways. A problem with the circumferential roads are the missing road links. These are the roads that are not yet constructed to give way for development due to Metro Manila&#x27;s rapid urbanization. The metropolis is resolving this problem through the completion of missing road links or through the construction of connector roads.

The radial and circumferential road system are being supplanted by a new numbered highway system implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways, and new signage are being placed with its implementation. Expressways are being assigned numbers with the E prefix. National roads are assigned 1 to 3 digit numbers, except for those classified as tertiary national roads.

An important circumferential road is the Circumferential Road 4, with the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue as its major component. It traverses the cities of Pasay, Makati, Mandaluyong, Quezon City and Caloocan. Line 3 follows the alignment of EDSA, from Taft Avenue in Pasay up to TriNoma, terminating before it reaches Caloocan. Circumferential Road 5 serves the people near the regional limits of Metro Manila and also serves as an alternate route for Circumferential Road 4.

Prominent radial roads include the Radial Road 1, composed of Roxas Boulevard and the Manila–Cavite Expressway (Coastal Road) that connects Metro Manila to Cavite, Radial Road 3 or the South Luzon Expressway that connects Metro Manila to Laguna, Radial Road 6, composed of Aurora Boulevard and Marcos Highway that runs up to Rizal and Radial Road 8 or the North Luzon Expressway that serves as the gateway to the north.

The Skyway serves as the region&#x27;s main expressway, directly connecting the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway. It also enables access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport via the NAIA Expressway (NAIAX). The Skyway is the first fully grade-separated highway in the Philippines and one of the longest elevated highways in the world with a total length of approximately . Other expressways such as the Manila–Cavite Expressway and Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway also connect Metro Manila to its surrounding areas.

The development of roads, highways and expressways are based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan. Ongoing projects in the dream plan include the rehabilitation of EDSA, CAVITEX–C-5 Link, NLEX Connector, and the construction of the missing road links for the circumferential roads.

====Railway systems====

Rail transportation in the Greater Manila Area is a major part of the transportation system in Metro Manila and its surrounding areas. It consists of the Manila Light Rail Transit System, Manila Metro Rail Transit System, and the PNR Metro Commuter Line. As of 2021, the three systems and its four operational lines combined has 82 stations, covering a total of . The network makes up the majority of active railways in the country and bear the brunt of providing the metropolis with rail as a faster alternative mode of transport other than buses and jeepneys. However, these systems are currently insufficient for the rapidly expanding metropolis; to address this, new lines and line extensions are under construction, which will extend the system far out into neighboring regions.

Several new railway projects are being undertaken by the national government and the private sector. These include the North–South Commuter Railway, the Metro Manila Subway, and MRT Line 7, all of which are under construction. Line extensions such as the LRT Line 1 South extension and the LRT Line 2 West extension are in the pipeline. Other line extensions and railway lines are in the planning stage.

====Air====
Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) is the only airport and the premier gateway in Metro Manila. It is the busiest airport in the Philippines. NAIA has four terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2 (which is exclusively used by Philippine Airlines), Terminal 3 (the newest and largest airport terminal in NAIA) and Terminal 4 (also known as the Manila Domestic passenger Terminal). The other airport that serves Metro Manila is Clark International Airport in Angeles City which is located away.

====Buses====
Bus franchises in the region are regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service is the express bus system that runs from its dispatch terminal in Fairview up to the central business districts along EDSA. It aims to cut travel time substantially and provide a faster, safer and more convenient bus service to commuters, who are usually caught at the heavy traffic across the metropolis. A second express bus link from SM North EDSA, Trinoma and SM Megamall to Makati opened in December 2015, and by January 2016 was the line on which, for the first time in nearly three decades, a double-decker bus traveled on EDSA, to the delight of motorists, followed by a third link, this time from Robinsons Galleria to the Ayala Center complex in February 2016 and a fourth in March linking the Ayala Center to the Alabang Town Center in Muntinlupa via the Metro Manila Skyway (and later to Ayala Malls South Park). As of the present express buses also link the Market Market mall and Circuit Makati to both the Nuvali residential township and the Pacita Village complex in San Pedro, both in Laguna, in services launched in 2014 and 2017, respectively (plus additional services to the UP Town Mall in Quezon City and SM Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal), while intercity express buses have been in operation since 2015 to alleviate traffic on EDSA. In 2018, additional services from the Makati CBD and from San Lorenzo Place up to Cavite debuted.

Metro Manila has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, particularly the EDSA Carousel. Another BRT system will traverse for from Commonwealth Avenue up to the Manila City Hall. The planned BRT system costs ₱4.9 billion ($109.5 million) and will have a fleet of 300 buses and 32 stations.

====Ferry====
The Pasig River Ferry Service run by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is the principal ferry shuttle system of Metro Manila. It traverses the Pasig River from Barangay Pinagbuhatan in Pasig to Plaza Mexico in Intramuros. Although it was referred to as a ferry, it is more akin to a water bus. It has 17 stations, but only 14 are operational. Another ferry route called the Manila-Bataan Ferry was launched on May 10, 2017, and traverses Manila Bay from the Bay Terminal at CCP Complex in Manila to Orion, Bataan. A new ferry route known as the Cavite-Manila Ferry Service that runs between Noveleta, Cavite and Intramuros was launched in January 2018.

===Electricity and water===

Meralco is the sole electric distributor of Metro Manila. It generates its power from the National Power Corporation and other independent power producers in Luzon. The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) was responsible for the supply and delivery of potable water and the sewerage system in Metro Manila. It was privatized in 1997 and the region and its immediate surrounding areas were split into the east and west concession. The winning corporations provide the same function of MWSS.

The Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone, which is composed of Manila (excluding the southeastern part of the city), Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay and Valenzuela. It also operates in some parts of Makati and Quezon City. Manila Water operates on the east zone, comprising the cities of Mandaluyong, Marikina, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan and Taguig. It also operates in large areas of Makati and Quezon City and the southeastern part of Manila, which was excluded from the west zone.

For garbage hauling, the region spent ₱4.221 billion ($93.855 million) in 2013. Quezon City spent the most at ₱994.59 million ($22.115 million) while Pateros, the region&#x27;s only municipality, spent the least money on garbage at ₱9.478 million ($210,747).

<text>The Olivet Discourse or Olivet prophecy is a biblical passage found in the Synoptic Gospels in Matthew 24 and 25, Mark 13, and Luke 21. It is also known as the Little Apocalypse because it includes the use of apocalyptic language, and it includes Jesus&#x27;s warning to his followers that they will suffer tribulation and persecution before the ultimate triumph of the Kingdom of God. The Olivet discourse is the last of the Five Discourses of Matthew and occurs just before the narrative of Jesus&#x27;s passion beginning with the anointing of Jesus.

In all three synoptic Gospels this episode includes the Parable of the Budding Fig Tree.

It is unclear whether the tribulation Jesus describes is a now past, present, or future event. Preterists believe the passage largely refers to events surrounding the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and as such is used to date the Gospel of Mark around the year 70. Futurists believe the prophecy is broken into different parts, and partly “refers to events that are still yet to come”.

==Setting==
The discourse is widely believed by scholars to contain material delivered on a variety of occasions.

In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark, Jesus spoke this discourse to his disciples privately on the Mount of Olives, opposite Herod&#x27;s Temple. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus taught over a period of time in the Temple and stayed at night on the Mount of Olives.

==Biblical narrative==
According to the narrative of the synoptic Gospels, an anonymous disciple remarks on the greatness of Herod&#x27;s Temple. Jesus responds that not one of those stones would remain intact in the building, and the whole thing would be reduced to rubble.

The disciples asked Jesus, &quot;When will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?&quot; Jesus first warns them about things that would happen:
* Some would claim to be Christ (see also Antichrist);
* There would be wars and rumours of wars.

Then Jesus identifies &quot;the beginnings of birth pains&quot;:
* Nations rising up against nations, and kingdoms against kingdoms;
* Earthquakes;
* Famines;
* Pestilence;
* Fearful events.

Next he described more birth pains which would lead to the coming Kingdom:
* False prophets;
* Apostasy;
* Persecution of the followers of Jesus;
* The spread of Jesus&#x27; message (the Gospel) around the world.

Jesus then warned the disciples about the abomination of desolation &quot;standing where it does not belong&quot;.

After Jesus described the &quot;abomination that causes desolation&quot;, he warns that the people of Judea should flee to the mountains as a matter of such urgency that they shouldn&#x27;t even return to get things from their homes. Jesus also warned that if it happened in winter or on the Sabbath fleeing would be even more difficult. Jesus described this as a time of &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; worse than anything that had gone before.

Jesus then states that immediately after the time of tribulation people would see a sign, &quot;the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken&quot;.

The statements about the Sun and Moon turning dark sound quite apocalyptic, as it appears to be a quote from the Book of Isaiah. The description of the Sun, Moon and stars going dark is also used elsewhere in the Old Testament. Joel wrote that this would be a sign before the great and dreadful Day of the Lord. The Book of Revelation also mentions the Sun and Moon turning dark during the sixth seal of the seven seals, but the passage adds more detail than the previous verses mentioned.

Jesus states that after the time of tribulation and the sign of the Sun, Moon, and stars going dark the Son of Man would be seen arriving in the clouds with power and great glory. The Son of Man would be accompanied by the angels and at the trumpet call the angels would &quot;gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other&quot;.()

Those who subscribe to the doctrine of the &quot;rapture&quot; (a view popular in American Evangelicalism) find support in this verse, reading this as meaning that people would be gathered from Earth and taken &quot;to&quot; heaven. This directly relates to a quotation from the Book of Zechariah in which God (and the contents of heaven in general) will come to Earth and live among &quot;the elect&quot;, who by necessity are gathered together for this purpose.

==Imminence==

In the Olivet Discourse, Jesus was reported to have told his disciples,
There is considerable debate about the correct translation of the word &quot;genea&quot;. The most common English translation is currently &quot;generation&quot;, which seem to suggest that the author of the olivet discourse expected Jesus&#x27; second coming to be witnessed by Jesus&#x27; contemporaries. In most German Bibles however, &quot;genea&quot; is instead translated as &quot;family/lineage&quot; (). Likewise for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (, and , respectively). The Danish linguist Iver Larsen argues that the word &quot;generation&quot; as it was used in the English King James Version of the Bible (1611) had a much wider meaning than it has today, and that the correct &quot;current&quot; translation of &quot;genea&quot; (in the specific context of the second coming story) should be &quot;kind of people.&quot; (specifically the &quot;good&quot; kind of people; the disciple&#x27;s kind of people, who, like the words of Jesus, will endure through all the tribulations). In Psalm 14, the King James version clearly uses &quot;generation&quot; in this now outdated sense, when it declares that &quot;God is in the generation of the righteous.&quot; According to Larsen, the &quot;Oxford Universal Dictionary&quot; states that the latest attested use of &quot;genea&quot; in the sense of &quot;class, kind or set of persons&quot; took place in 1727. Larsen concludes that the meaning of &quot;generation&quot; in the English language has narrowed considerably since then.

Bible scholar Philip La Grange du Toit argues that &quot;genea&quot; is mostly used to describe a timeless and spiritual family/lineage of good or bad people in The New Testament, and that this is the case also for the second coming discourse in Matthew 24. In contrast to Larsen however, he argues that the word &quot;genea&quot; here denotes the &quot;bad&quot; kind of people,&quot; because Jesus had used the word in that pejorative sense in the preceding context (chapter 23.) He also lists the main competing translation alternatives, and some of the scholars that support the different views:

* &quot;This generation&quot; refers to Jesus&#x27; contemporaries who would witness &quot;all these things&quot; [πάντα ταῦτα] as outlined in verses 4–31, including Jesus&#x27; second coming (Davies &amp; Allison 1997:367–368; Hare 1993:281; Maddox 1982:111–115). Because Jesus&#x27; contemporaries did not witness his second coming, some contend that Jesus erred in his predictions (Luz 2005:209; cf. Schweitzer 1910:356–364).
* &quot;This generation&quot; refers to Jesus&#x27; contemporaries who would witness &quot;all these things&quot; as outlined in verses 4–22 or 4–28, pointing to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE and everything leading up to it. Jesus&#x27; second coming (vv. 29–31) is thus excluded from &quot;all these things&quot; (Blomberg 1992:364; Carson 1984:507; France 2007:930; Hagner 1995:715).
* &quot;This generation&quot; points to the Ἰουδαῖοι (Jews or Judaeans), implying that they as a race would last until the Parousia (Hendriksen 1973:868–869; Schweizer 1976:458).
* In patristic opinion, &quot;this generation&quot; points to the church against which the gates of Hades would not prevail (cf. Chrysostom, Hom. Matt. 77:1; Eusebius, Frag. in Lc. ad loc).
* &quot;This generation&quot; points to some future generation, from Matthew&#x27;s perspective, that sees &quot;all these things&quot; (Bock 1996:538–539; Conzelmann 1982:105).
* The words &quot;take place&quot; or &quot;have happened&quot; [γένηται] is interpreted as an ingressive aorist: &quot;to begin&quot; or &quot;to have a beginning&quot;. In other words, &quot;all these things&quot; would start to happen in the generation of Jesus&#x27; present disciples, but would not necessarily finish in their time (Cranfield 1954:291; Talbert 2010:270).
* &quot;This generation&quot; points to a certain kind of people in accordance with the pejorative connotations to &quot;generation&quot; [γενεά] elsewhere in the gospel (Morris 1992:613; Nelson 1996:385; Rieske 2008:225; see, e.g., Mt 11:16; 12:39, 41–42, 45; 16:4; 17:17; 23:36). While DeBruyn (2010:190) and Lenski (1943:953) interpret the expression in a similar way, they connect &quot;this generation&quot; to a certain kind of people from the Ἰουδαῖοι who resisted Jesus (cf. view 3 discussed earlier).

In the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul seems to envisage that he and the Christians to whom he was writing would see the resurrection of the dead within their own lifetimes: &quot;For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. (ESV)&quot; The Gospel of John however seems to downplay a rumor that one disciple (John) would live to see the second coming:

==Christian eschatology==
There are four quite different Christian eschatological views.
Preterism is the belief that all of these predictions were fulfilled by the time Jerusalem fell in 70 CE. Preterism considers that most, if not all, prophecy has been fulfilled already, usually in relation to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.

* Partial preterism says that most (but not all) Bible prophecy, including everything within Matthew 24, Daniel, and Revelation up to chapters 19 or 20, has already been fulfilled when Jerusalem was destroyed. Since it still includes belief in a future physical Second Coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment, partial preterism falls within the parameters of orthodoxy because it conforms to the early Christian creeds.
* Full preterism says all biblical prophecy was fulfilled by 70 CE. It does not hold to a future judgment, return of Christ, or resurrection of the dead (at least not for non-Christians). Due to the belief that all biblical prophecy has been fulfilled, it is sometimes considered &quot;radical&quot; and usually described as &quot;unorthodox&quot; because it goes against the ecumenical creeds of early Christianity.

Historicism considers that most prophecy has been or will be fulfilled during the present church age. It was the chief view of Protestants from the Reformation until the mid-19th century. Only among Seventh-day Adventists is historicism applied to current conservative Christian interpretation of Tribulation understanding.

Futurism is the belief that the future Jesus predicted is the unfolding of events from trends that are already at work in contemporary human society.

Futurism typically holds that all major unfulfilled prophecies will be fulfilled during a global time of catastrophe and war known as the Great Tribulation, in which many other prophecies will be fulfilled during or after the Millennium Reign of Jesus Christ. According to many futurists, many predictions are currently being fulfilled during the Church Age, in which lawlessness and apostasy are currently plaguing secular society. This is seen as a major sign of the approaching fulfillment of all other prophecies during the Tribulation. Within evangelical Christianity over the past 150 years, futurism has come to be the dominant view of prophecy. However, around the 1970s evangelical preterism—the polar opposite of futurism—was seen as a new challenge to the dominance of futurism, particularly within the Reformed tradition. Yet, futurism continues as the prevalent view for the time being.

Futurists anticipate many coming events that will fulfill all eschatological prophecy: the seven-year period of tribulation, the Antichrist&#x27;s global government the Battle of Armageddon, the Second Coming of Jesus, the millennial reign of Christ, the eternal state, and the two resurrections.

In his popular book, &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth, &quot;first published in 1970, evangelical Christian author Hal Lindsey argued that prophetical information in Matthew 24 indicates that the &quot;generation&quot; witnessing the &quot;rebirth of Israel&quot; is the same generation that will observe the fulfillment of the &quot;signs&quot; referred to in —and that would be consummated by the second coming of Christ in approximately 1988. He dated it from the &quot;rebirth of Israel&quot; in 1948, and took a generation to be &quot;something like forty years.&quot; Lindsey later stretched his forty-year timetable to as long as one hundred years, writing that he was no longer certain that the terminal &quot;generation&quot; commenced with the rebirth of Israel.

Another detailed analysis, one written by evangelical pastor Ray Stedman, calls it the &quot;Olivet Prophecy: The most detailed prediction in the Bible&quot;. According to Stedman: &quot;There are many predictive passages in both the Old and New Testaments, but none is clearer or more detailed than the message Jesus delivered from the Mount of Olives. This message was given during the turbulent events of the Lord&#x27;s last week before the cross&quot;.

The Idealist sees no evidence of timing of prophetic events in the Bible. Thus they conclude that their timing cannot be determined in advance. Idealists see prophetic passages as being of great value in teaching truths about God to be applied to present life. Idealism is primarily associated with liberal scholarship, and is not a major factor in current evangelical Christian deliberation over when prophecy will be fulfilled.

Within conservative, evangelical Christian thought, two opposite viewpoints of the Great Tribulation have been expressed in a debate between theologians Kenneth L. Gentry and Thomas Ice.

;&quot;Tribulation as a past event&quot; (Dr. Gentry)
*The Great Tribulation occurred during the 1st century.
*Those events marked the end of God&#x27;s focus on and exaltation of Israel.
*Jesus&#x27; prophecies marked the beginning of the Christian era in God&#x27;s plan.
*The Tribulation is God&#x27;s judgment on Israel for rejecting the Messiah.
*The Tribulation judgments will be centred on local events surrounding ancient Jerusalem, and also somewhat affecting other portions of the former Roman Empire.
*The Tribulation judgments are governed by Jesus as the Christ to reflect his judgment against Israel, thus showing that he is in heaven controlling those events.

;&quot;Tribulation as a future event&quot; (Dr. Ice)
*The Great Tribulation is still to come and is rapidly approaching prospect.
*Those events marked the beginning of God&#x27;s focus on and exaltation of Israel.
*The prophecy says the Christian era will be concluded just after the church is taken from the world.
*Rather than being God&#x27;s judgment on Israel, it is the preparation of Israel to receive her Messiah.
*The judgments involve catastrophes that literally will affect the stellar universe and impact the entire planet.
*The coming of Christ in the Tribulation requires his public, visible and physical presence to conclude those judgments.

<text>Kohen (, &quot;kōhēn&quot;, , &quot;priest&quot;, pl. , &quot;kōhănīm&quot;, , &quot;priests&quot;) is the Hebrew word for &quot;priest&quot;, used in reference to the Aaronic priesthood, also called Aaronites or Aaronides. They are traditionally believed, and halakhically required, to be of direct patrilineal descent from the biblical Aaron (also &quot;Aharon&quot;), brother of Moses, and thus belong to the Tribe of Levi.

During the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem (and previously the Tabernacle), &quot;kohanim&quot; performed the Temple sacrificial offerings, which were only permitted to be offered by them. Following its destruction, it seems that most of them joined the Synagogal Jewish movement before adopting gradually Rabbinic Judaism, other types of Judaism, Christianity or Islam. Today, &quot;kohanim&quot; retain a lesser though distinct status within Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism, including certain honors and restrictions.

In the Samaritan community, the kohanim have remained the primary religious leaders. Ethiopian Jewish religious leaders are called &quot;kahen,&quot; and do similar works to the kohanim.

== Name ==
The word &quot;kohen&quot; originally derives from a Semitic root common at least to the Central Semitic languages. In the ancient polytheistic religion of Phoenicia, the word for priest was &quot;khn&quot; (). The cognate Arabic word (&quot;kāhin&quot;) means &quot;priest&quot;.

The noun &quot;kohen&quot; is used in the Bible to refer to priests, whether Jewish or pagan (such as the &quot;kohanim&quot; of Baal or Dagon), although Christian priests are referred to in modern Hebrew by the term &quot;komer&quot; (). &quot;Kohanim&quot; can also refer to the Jewish nation as a whole, as in , where the whole of Israel is addressed as a &quot;priestly kingdom (or: kingdom of priests) and a holy nation&quot;.

In Targum Yonatan, interpretive translations of the word &quot;kohen&quot; include &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, and &quot;servant&quot;. Other interpretations include &quot;minister&quot; (Mechilta to Parshah Jethro, Exodus 18:1–20:23).

== Individuals and history ==
The early books of the Bible mention several pagan priests, such as Potipherah, the other priests of Egypt, and Jethro.

The non-Jewish priest Melchitzedek, however, is described as worshipping the same God as Abraham. Later Jewish sources even discuss the possibility that Melchitzedek&#x27;s family could have served as priests for the future Jewish nation, though in the end this did not happen.

Jewish priests are first mentioned in . Here God offered the entire Jewish people the opportunity to become a symbolic &quot;kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot;. More practically, though, in this chapter &quot;the priests who approach the Lord&quot; were warned to stay away from Mount Sinai during the revelation of the Ten Commandments. The identity of these priests is not specified. According to many later Jewish sources, the firstborn son in each family served as priests, starting in the period of the patriarchs.

Nevertheless, shortly after the Sinai revelation, Aaron and his sons were chosen to be the priests. The exclusive possession of the priesthood by Aaron&#x27;s descendants was known as the priestly covenant. Many commentators assert that the firstborns lost their status due to their participation in the golden calf sin. A number of reasons have been suggested for why Aaron and his descendants were chosen instead:
* Due to Aaron&#x27;s role in the Exodus, alongside Moses
* As reward for greeting Moses cheerfully (), willingly subordinating himself to Moses in the Exodus, even though he (Aaron) was the elder of the two brothers
* Because Aaron possessed a higher level of prophecy than anyone at the time except Moses himself
* The Tribe of Levi, and possibly even Aaron&#x27;s own family within that tribe, maybe have been chosen for Divine service even before the Exodus.
* Because Moses himself was unsuitable to serve as priest, either for general reasons (e.g., the priestly duties would not have left Moses enough time for leadership and Torah instruction) or as punishment for trying to avoid his Divine mission in 
* Because Moses had a non-Israelite wife (Tzipporah), while Aaron&#x27;s wife Elisheba was not only Israelite but noble (the sister of Nahshon prince of Judah), and thus more suitable to found the priestly family

Moses, too, performed sacrificial services before the completion of Aaron&#x27;s consecration, and arguably is once called a &quot;priest&quot; in the Bible, but his descendants were not priests.

Since Aaron was a descendant of the Tribe of Levi, priests are sometimes included in the term Levites, by direct patrilineal descent. However, not all Levites are priests.

During the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and until the Holy Temple was built in Jerusalem, the priests performed their priestly service in the portable Tabernacle.

==Ancient roles==
=== Laws and duties ===
Priestly duties involved offering the Temple sacrifices, and delivering the Priestly Blessing. When the Temple existed, most sacrifices and offerings could only be conducted by priests. Non-priest Levites (i.e. those who descended from Levi but not from Aaron) performed a variety of other Temple roles, including ritual slaughter of sacrificial animals, song service by use of voice and musical instruments, and various tasks in assisting the priests in performing their service.

The kohanim were not granted any ancestral land to own. Instead, they were compensated for their service to the nation and in the Temple through the twenty-four kohanic gifts. Most of these gifts are related to Temple sacrifices, or else the agricultural produce of the Land of Israel (such as terumah). A notable gift which is given even in the Jewish diaspora is the five shekels of the &quot;pidyon haben&quot; ceremony.

===Vestments===

The Torah provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the Tabernacle: &quot;And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty&quot;. These garments are described in , and . The high priest wore eight holy garments (&quot;bigdei kodesh&quot;). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests and four were unique to the high priest.

Those vestments which were common to all priests were:
* Priestly undergarments (Hebrew &quot;michnasayim&quot;, breeches): linen pants reaching from the waist to the knees &quot;to cover their nakedness&quot; ()
* Priestly tunic (Hebrew &quot;ketonet&quot;, tunic): made of pure linen, covering the entire body from the neck to the feet, with sleeves reaching to the wrists. That of the high priest was embroidered, those of the priests were plain.
* Priestly sash (Hebrew &quot;avnet&quot;, sash): that of the high priest was of fine linen with &quot;embroidered work&quot; in blue and purple and scarlet (, ); those worn by the priests were of white, twined linen.
* Priestly turban (Hebrew &quot;mitznefet&quot;): that of the high priest was much larger than that of the priests and wound so that it formed a broad, flat-topped turban; that for priests was wound so that it formed a cone-shaped turban, called a &quot;migbahat&quot;.

The vestments that were unique to the high priest were:
* Priestly robe (&quot;me&#x27;il&quot;): a sleeveless, blue robe, the lower hem of which was fringed with small golden bells alternating with pomegranate-shaped tassels in blue, purple, and scarlet—&quot;tekhelet&quot;, &quot;argaman&quot;, &quot;tolaat shani&quot;.
* Ephod: a richly embroidered vest or apron with two onyx engraved gemstones on the shoulders, on which were engraved the names of the tribes of Israel
* Priestly breastplate (Hebrew &quot;hoshen&quot;): with twelve precious and semi-precious stones, each engraved with the name of one of the tribes; a pouch in which he probably carried the Urim and Thummim (objects of unclear nature used for divination). The &quot;hoshen&quot; was fastened to the Ephod.
* Priestly headplate (Hebrew &quot;tzitz&quot;): worn on the front of the turban, and inscribed with the words: &quot;Holy unto YHWH&quot;.

In addition to the above &quot;golden garments&quot;, the high priest also had a set of white &quot;linen garments&quot; (&quot;bigdei ha-bad&quot;) which he wore only for the Yom Kippur Temple service. The linen garments were only four in number, corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.

A priest would serve barefoot in the Temple, and would immerse in a mikvah before vesting, and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The Talmud teaches that priests were only fit to perform their duties when wearing their priestly vestments, and that the vestments achieve atonement for sin, just as sacrifices do.

According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Priestly golden head plate atoned for the sin of arrogance on the part of the Children of Israel (B.Zevachim 88b) and she also symbolizes that the high priest bears the lack of all the offerings and gifts of the sons of Israel. And it must be constantly on his head for the good pleasure of God towards them ().
*According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Priestly turban atoned for the sin of haughtiness on the part of the Children of Israel (B. Zevachim 88b).
*According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Priestly ephod atoned for the sin of idolatry on the part of the Israelites.
*According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Priestly sash atoned for &quot;sins of the heart&quot; (impure thoughts) on the part of the Children of Israel.
*According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Priestly tunic and the rest of the priestly garments atoned for the sin of bloodshed on the part of the Children of Israel (B.Zevachim 88b).
*According to the Talmud, the Priestly undergarments atone for the sin of sexual transgressions on the part of the Children of Israel (B.Zevachim 88b).

=== Torah instruction ===

Numerous Biblical passages attest to the role of the priests in teaching Torah to the people and in issuing judgment. Later rabbinic statements elaborate on these roles. However, the priest&#x27;s religious authority is not automatic: even a bastard who is a scholar takes precedence over an ignorant high priest.

=== High Priest ===

In every generation when the Temple was standing, one kohen would be singled out to perform the functions of the High Priest (Hebrew &quot;kohen gadol&quot;). His primary task was the Day of Atonement service. Another unique task of the high priest was the offering of a daily meal sacrifice; he also held the prerogative to supersede any priest and offer any offering he chose. Although the Torah retains a procedure to select a High Priest when needed, in the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, there is no High Priest in Judaism today.

=== Twenty-four kohanic divisions ===

According to , King David divided the priests into 24 priestly divisions (Heb. משמרות, &quot;mishmarot&quot;). Each division would perform the Temple service for one week in a 24-week cycle, with all divisions eligible to serve on holidays. According to the Talmud, this was an expansion of a previous division, by Moses, into 8 (or 16) divisions.

Following the destruction of the Second Temple, and the displacement to the Galilee of the bulk of the remaining Jewish population after the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish tradition in the Talmud and poems from the period record that the descendants of each priestly watch established a separate residential seat in towns and villages of the Galilee, and maintained this residential pattern for at least several centuries in anticipation of the reconstruction of the Temple and reinstitution of the cycle of priestly courses. In subsequent years, there was a custom of publicly recalling every Shabbat in the synagogues the courses of the priests, a practice that reinforced the prestige of the priests&#x27; lineage. Following this destruction, it seems that most of them joined the Synagogal Jewish movement ; before being gradually converted towards Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity.

=== Qualifications and disqualifications ===

Although kohanim may assume their duties once they reached physical maturity, the fraternity of kohanim generally would not allow young kohanim to begin service until they reached the age of twenty or thirty. There was no mandatory retirement age. Only when a kohen became physically infirm could he no longer serve.

A kohen may become disqualified from performing his service for a host of reasons, including ritual impurity, prohibited marriages, and certain physical blemishes. The kohen is never permanently disqualified from service, but may return to his normal duties once the disqualification ceases.

== Modern practice ==
Since the destruction of the Second Temple, Jewish priests have not performed sacrificial services. However, they retain a formal and public ceremonial role in synagogue prayer services, as well as some other unique religious duties and privileges. These special roles have been maintained in Orthodox Judaism, and sometimes in Conservative Judaism. Reform Judaism does not afford any special status or recognition to kohanim.

=== Synagogue &quot;aliyah&quot; ===

When the Torah reading is performed in synagogue, it is divided into a number of sections. Traditionally, a kohen (if one is present) is called for the first section (&quot;aliyah&quot;), a Levite for the second reading, and an &quot;Israelite&quot; (non-kohen, non-levite) for all succeeding portions. If no Levite is present, the kohen is called for the second aliyah as well. The Maftir portion may be given to someone from any of the three groups.


=== Priestly blessing ===

The kohanim participating in an Orthodox and some other styles of traditional Jewish prayer service also deliver the priestly blessing during the repetition of the Amidah prayer. They perform this service by standing and facing the crowd in the front of the congregation, with their arms held outwards and their hands and fingers in a specific formation, with a Jewish prayer shawl or Talit covering their heads and outstretched hands so that their fingers cannot be seen. Kohanim living in Israel and many Sephardic Jews living in areas outside Israel deliver the priestly blessing daily; Ashkenazi Jews living outside Israel deliver it only on major Jewish holidays.

=== Pidyon haben (redemption of the firstborn) ===

Outside the synagogue, the kohen leads the &quot;pidyon haben&quot; ceremony. This redemption of the first born son is based on the Torah commandment, &quot;all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem&quot;.

=== Marital restrictions ===
 prohibits marriage between a kohen and certain classes of women. According to rabbinic law, these classes include divorcees, non-Jews, converts (who were previously non-Jews), and women who have previously engaged in certain forbidden sexual relationships (even if involuntary, i. e., rape). If a kohen did have relations with any of these women, the offspring are described as &quot;profaned&quot; (male: &quot;challal&quot;, female: &quot;challalah&quot;); their status is nearly identical to a normal Jew, while the &quot;challalah&quot; herself is one of the categories which a kohen may not marry.

Rape poses an especially poignant problem. The pain experienced by the families of kohanim who were required to divorce their wives as the result of the rapes accompanying the capture of Jerusalem is alluded to in this Mishnah:
If a woman were imprisoned by non-Jews concerning money affairs, she is permitted to her husband, but if for some capital offense, she is forbidden to her husband. If a town were overcome by besieging troops, all women of priestly stock found in it are ineligible [to be married to priests or to remain married to priests], but if they had witnesses, even a male or female slave, these may be believed. But no man may be believed for himself. Rabbi Zechariah ben Hakatsab said, &quot;By this Temple, her hand did not stir from my hand from the time the non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they went out.&quot; They said to him: No man may give evidence of himself.

Orthodox Judaism recognizes these rules as still binding, and Orthodox rabbis will not perform a marriage between a kohen and a divorced woman. This is the attitude of the Israeli rabbinate, with the result that a kohen cannot legally marry a divorced or converted woman in the State of Israel. (However, if such a marriage were performed outside Israel, it would be recognized as a valid marriage by the Israeli state.)

Conservative Judaism has issued an emergency &quot;takanah&quot; (rabbinical edict) temporarily suspending the application of the rules in their entirety, on the grounds that the high intermarriage rate threatens the survival of Judaism, and, hence, that any marriage between Jews is welcomed. The &quot;takanah&quot; declares that the offspring of such marriages are to be regarded as kohanim.

===Other laws===
To this day, kohanim keep the prohibition () against becoming ritually impure through proximity to a corpse (within the same room, at a cemetery, and elsewhere), except when the deceased is his immediate family member. Some Jewish cemeteries have special facilities to permit kohanim to participate in funerals or visit graves without becoming impure.

The presumption of priestly descent is used to help identify kohanim.

Other Jews are commanded to respect the priesthood in certain ways. One of these ways is that priests (and in their absence, occasionally Levites) are the first offered the opportunity to lead Birkat Hamazon. Unlike the general rule for aliyot, this offer - which is only a requirement according to some Rabbinic opinions - may be declined. There are other rules regarding the honoring of kohanim, even in the absence of the Temple, but generally these are waived (if they are even offered) by the kohen.

== Bat kohen ==

&quot;Kohen&quot; is a status that traditionally refers to men, passed from father to son. However, a &quot;bat kohen&quot; (the daughter of a priest) holds a special status in the Hebrew Bible and rabbinical texts. She is entitled to a number of rights and is encouraged to abide by specified requirements, for example, entitlement to consume some of the priestly gifts, and an increased value for her ketubah.

In modern times, Orthodox and many Conservative rabbis maintain the position that only a man can act as a kohen, and that a daughter of a kohen is recognized as a &quot;bat kohen&quot; only in those limited ways that have been identified in the past. Accordingly, in Orthodox Judaism only men can perform the Priestly Blessing and receive the first &quot;aliyah&quot; during the public Torah reading.

However, some Conservative rabbis give the kohen&#x27;s daughter equal priestly status to a (male) kohen. As a result, some Conservative synagogues permit a kohen&#x27;s daughter to perform the Priestly Blessing and the Pidyon HaBen ceremony, and to receive the first &quot;aliyah&quot; during the Torah reading.

Because most Reform and Reconstructionist temples have abolished traditional tribal distinctions, roles, and identities on grounds of egalitarianism, a special status for a &quot;bat kohen&quot; has very little significance in these movements.

== Genetics ==

Since the Y chromosome is inherited only from one&#x27;s father (biological females have no Y chromosome), all direct male lineages share a common haplotype. Thus, if &quot;kohanim&quot; share a direct male lineage to Aaron, one would expect to see a high level of commonality among their Y chromosomes.

Since 1997, a number of genetic studies have been done on this topic, using testing data from across sectors of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations. The results of these studies have been interpreted by various parties as either confirming or disproving the traditions of uniform descent.

== Surnames ==
As both kohen status and (in many societies) last names are patrilineal, there is often a relationship between the two. But this is not always the case: although descendants of kohanim often bear surnames that reflect their genealogy, many families with the surname Cohen (or a variation) are not kohanim, nor even Jewish. Conversely, many kohanim do not have Cohen as a surname.

Names often associated with kohanim include:
* Cohen, also spelled Kahn
* Katz (Hebrew abbreviation of Kohen Tzedeq, &quot;priest of justice&quot;/&quot;authentic priest&quot;)
* Maze, Mazo, Mazer (acronym of the Hebrew phrase &quot;mi zera Aharon hakohen,&quot; meaning &quot;from the seed of Aaron the priest&quot;)
* Azoulay (acronym of the Hebrew phrase &quot;ishah zonah ve&#x27;challelah lo yikachu,&quot; meaning &quot;a foreign [non-Israelite woman] or divorced [Israelite woman] shall not he take&quot;: a prohibition binding on kohanim, )
* Kahane (Aramaic for &quot;kohen&quot;)

In contemporary Israel, &quot;Moshe Cohen&quot; is the equivalent of &quot;John Smith&quot; in English-speaking countries – i.e., proverbially the most common of names.

== Outside Judaism ==
According to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, either &quot;literal descendants of Aaron&quot;, or worthy Melchizedek priesthood holders have the legal right to constitute the Presiding Bishopric under the authority of the First Presidency (). To date, all men who have served on the Presiding Bishopric have been Melchizedek priesthood holders, and none have been publicly identified as descendants of Aaron. See also Mormonism and Judaism.

== In popular culture ==
The positioning of the kohen&#x27;s hands during the Priestly Blessing was Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s inspiration for Mr. Spock&#x27;s Vulcan salute in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. Nimoy, raised an Orthodox Jew (but not a kohen), used the salute when saying, &quot;Live long and prosper.&quot;

The Priestly Blessing was used by Leonard Cohen in his farewell blessing during &quot;Whither Thou Goest&quot;, the closing song on his concerts. Leonard Cohen himself was from a kohen family. He also used the drawing of the Priestly Blessing as one of his logos.

<text>Columbia County is a county located in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 69,698, up from 67,531 at the 2010 census. Its county seat is Lake City. Columbia County comprises the Lake City, FL Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Gainesville-Lake City, FL Combined Statistical Area. Osceola National Forest is partially in Columbia County.

==History==
After Florida became a territory of the United States in 1821, pioneer and immigrant settlers from the United States formed their own settlement adjacent to a Seminole village called Alligator Village, and called it Alligator. Following the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the residents of Alligator village relocated to the banks of Peace Creek in the newly established Seminole reservation, leaving Alligator Town on its own.

When Columbia County was formed in 1832 from Duval and Alachua counties, Alligator Town was designated as the seat of the county government. It was renamed as Columbia, the poetic form for the United States. The county was developed for agriculture and the timber industry, with products such as turpentine, lumber, and plywood. From 1832 to 1839, the county seat was Newnansville, but that town and area were returned to Alachua County.

In November 1858 a railroad was completed connecting Jacksonville to Alligator, which opened the town to more commerce and passenger traffic. Alligator Town was incorporated and its name changed to Lake City in 1859; M. Whit Smith was elected as the town&#x27;s first mayor. According to an urban legend, the name was changed because the mayor&#x27;s wife Martha Jane, who had recently moved to the town, refused to hang her lace curtains in a town named Alligator.
During the American Civil War, the railroad between Lake City and Jacksonville was used to send beef and salt to Confederate soldiers. In February 1864 Union troops under Truman Seymour advanced west from Jacksonville. His objective was to disrupt Confederate supplies, and obtain African-American recruits and supplies. Confederate General Joseph Finnegan assembled troops and called for reinforcements from P. G. T. Beauregard in response to the Union threat. On February 11, 1864, Finnegan&#x27;s troops defeated a Union cavalry raid in Lake City. After the Union cavalry was repulsed, Finnegan moved his forces to Olustee Station about ten miles east of Lake City (in Baker County). The Confederate presence at Olustee Station was reinforced to prepare for the Union troops coming from Jacksonville.

Union forces engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Olustee on February 20, 1864, near the Olustee Station. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war. Union casualties were 1,861 men killed, wounded or missing; Confederate casualties were 946 killed, wounded or missing. The Confederate dead were buried in Lake City. In 1928 a memorial for the Battle of Olustee was established in downtown Lake City.

Lake City&#x27;s first newspaper was published in 1874, called the &quot;Lake City Reporter&quot;. Charles H. Thompson, an African American minister, represented Columbia County in the Florida House of Representatives and served as a county commissioner in 1874 and 1875. In 1876 the Bigelow Building was completed; it later was adapted for use as the City Hall. The first fire department was established in 1883 to complement the police department. In 1891 Lake City became the first city in Florida to have electric lights from a local power and light company.

White violence rose against blacks in the late 19th century in a regionwide effort to establish and maintain white supremacy as Southern states disenfranchised most blacks and imposed Jim Crow. Whites lynched 20 African Americans in Columbia County from 1877 to 1950, mostly in the decades near the turn of the 20th century. It was tied with Polk County for the second-highest total of lynchings of any county in the state.

Among these murders was the mass lynching on May 21, 1911, of six black men who were taken from the jail by a white mob in Lake City. They were being held on charges of murdering one white sawmill worker and wounding another in Leon County, after whites had attacked them at a private house following an earlier altercation between two men. A group of a dozen white men, reportedly from Tallahassee, tricked the white youth guarding the jail by posing as officials and gained release of the suspects. They took the men outside town and shot them repeatedly to death.

===Major roads===
* (Interstate 10) is the main west-to-east interstate highway in the county, and serves as the unofficial dividing line between northern and southern Columbia County. It contains three interchanges within the county; the first being I-75 in Springville (Exits 296 A-B), and the other two in Five Points, north of Lake City, US 41 (Exit 301), and US 441(Exit 303). Beyond this point I-10 runs through Osceola National Forest.
* (Interstate 75) is the southeast-to-northwest interstate highway in the county, which enters from Alachua County at bridges over the Santa Fe River. It has four interchanges in the county with US 41/441 in Ellisville (Exit 414), SR 47 (Exit 423), US 90 in Lake City (Exit 427) and I-10 in Springville (Exits 435 A-B).
* is another southeast-to-northwest road in southwestern Columbia County, that enters from a bridge over the Santa Fe River, runs through Fort White, and leaves at another bridge over the Ichetucknee River at Ichetucknee Springs State Park.
* runs north from High Springs in a concurrency with US 441 until just before it reaches Lake City, Then the two routes run parallel to each other until US 41 branches off to the northwest on its way to Hamilton County, Valdosta, Georgia, and points north.
* was the main west-to-east highway in the county, until it was surpassed by I-10. It enters the county from Wellborn in Suwannee County, and directly enters Lake City. East of the city, it runs along the southern edge of Osceola National Forest and serves as the address of two major prisons before crossing the Baker County Line and entering a portion of the forest itself.
* runs north from High Springs in a concurrency with US 41 until just before it reaches Lake City, Then the two routes run parallel to each other, but unlike US 41, US 441 stays in Columbia County and runs straight north and south until it crosses the Georgia State Line.
* is located on the far northeast corner of the county, and has no significant intersections in the county.
* is a northeast-to-southwest road that spans from Trenton in Gilchrist County to US 41 in Lake City. North of there it becomes a hidden state road along US 41 until it reaches US Truck Route 90, then turns east, only to turn north again onto US 441 where it remains for the duration until it crosses the Florida-Georgia State Line.
* runs northwest to southeast from Hamilton County in an overlap with southbound US 41, until it reaches US 90 in Lake City, where it runs east in an overlap with that route before branching off on its own in Watertown, then runs southeast towards the Union County Line. 
* runs west to east in Ellisville and only exists for one and a half miles in the county, but still serves as an important route to Lake Butler in Union County.
* is a northeast to southwest road that spans from Branford in Suwannee County, and terminates at US 90 in western Lake City, just east of US 90&#x27;s interchange with I-75.

===Railroads===
Columbia County has at least three existing railroad lines. The primary one is a Florida Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railroad line formerly owned by CSX, Seaboard System Railroad, Seaboard Coastline Industries and Seaboard Air Line Railroad that served Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; until it was truncated to New Orleans in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina.

Until 1971, Lake City was a stop on the Louisville and Nashville and Seaboard Coast Line&#x27;s &quot;Gulf Wind&quot; (New Orleans - Jacksonville). The Seaboard Air Line operated this and another passenger train in each direction through Lake City until 1966 or 1967.

<text>Deventer (; Sallands: ) is a city and municipality in the Salland historical region of the province of Overijssel, Netherlands. In 2020 the municipality of Deventer had a population of 100,913. The city is largely situated on the east bank of the river IJssel, but it also has a small part of its territory on the west bank. In 2005 the municipality of Bathmen (with a population of about 5,000 people) was merged with Deventer as part of a national effort to reduce bureaucracy in the country.

Deventer is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands. The place is mentioned in 9th-century sources from the Diocese of Utrecht. A charter from 877 AD mentions seven farmsteads in &quot;Daventre portu&quot; (the Deventer harbor). In 952 AD, Deventer is mentioned as a city in a gift certificate from King Otto I. After the place had acquired more and more rights and privileges over time, it received the municipal lands from Emperor Henry V in 1123. This is considered by historians to be the moment of Deventer obtaining the city rights by the inhabitants. The city has the oldest stone house, the oldest walking park and with the Athenaeum library also the oldest scientific library in the Netherlands.

==History==
=== Foundation and development in the Middle Ages ===
Deventer was probably founded around 768 AD by the English missionary Lebuinus, who built a wooden church on the east bank of the river IJssel. In January 772 AD the sack and burning of this church by a Saxon expedition was the cause for the first punitive war waged by Charlemagne to the Saxons, in which, in retribution, the Irminsul (the Saxon sacred tree, probably near modern Paderborn) was destroyed. This was not the first human settlement at the location; between 1981 and 2006, remains of a late Roman Iron Age settlement (dated to c.300 AD) were excavated at Colmschate, 4 km east of the current city.
The village of Deventer, already important because of a trading road crossing the river IJssel, was looted and burnt down by the Vikings in 882. It was immediately rebuilt and fortified with an earthen wall (in the street &quot;Stenen Wal&quot; remains of this wall have been excavated and restored).

Deventer received city rights in 956, after which fortifications were built or replaced by stone walls around the city for defense. Between 1000 and 1500, Deventer grew to be a flourishing trade city because of its harbour on the river IJssel, which was capable of accommodating large ships. The city eventually joined the Hanseatic League.

One of the commodities it traded in, dried haddock and cod from Norway, gave the citizens the nickname they carry to this day: &quot;Deventer Stokvis&quot;. In the 15th century, Deventer had a common mint, where coins for the three IJssel cities Deventer, Zwolle, and Kampen were made.

Deventer is the birthplace of Geert Groote and home to his Brethren of the Common Life, a school of religious thought that influenced Thomas a Kempis and Erasmus in later times. Together with Haarlem it was among the first cities to have printing presses, dating back to as early as 1477. From around 1300, it also housed a Latin School, which became internationally renowned, and remained in service in changing forms until 1971. Its most well-known student was the scholar Desiderius Erasmus, who was born in 1466 and attended the school from 1475 to 1484.

=== 16th–18th centuries ===

Between 1500 and 1800, the volume of water flowing through the IJssel decreased, decreasing the importance of Deventer&#x27;s harbour. The competition with trade centres in Holland, as well as the religious war between 1568 and 1648, brought a decline in the city&#x27;s economy.

In the 18th century, the iron industry came to Deventer. East of the town, so-called &quot;oer&quot;, river sand containing iron, was found as early as 900. From this material, ore was produced and brought to town. The main road of the villages Okkenbroek, Lettele and Schalkhaar is still named Oerdijk (Ore Dyke).

=== Modern times ===

In the 19th century, Deventer became an industrial town. Bicycles (Burgers), carpets (Koninklijke Deventer Tapijtfabriek), tins and cans for food and drinks (Thomassen &amp; Drijver), cigars (Horst &amp; Maas en Bijdendijk &amp; Ten Hove), foundry and heavy machinery (Nering Bögel), and textiles (Ankersmit) were produced until the mid to late 20th century. Some of these industries are still thriving today, such as beds and accessories (Auping) and publishing (Wolters Kluwer, now headquartered in Alphen aan den Rijn).

The city&#x27;s trade and industry are still of some importance. The city is host to a factory producing central heating systems, as well as Wolters Kluwer, a global information services and publishing company.

The Deventer honey cake (Bussink Deventer Koek), produced in Deventer for over 500 years, is still manufactured locally and sold all over the Netherlands and beyond.

==== World War II ====

Deventer has seen few military engagements throughout its long history, although it was a garrison city of the Dutch cavalry. The IJssel bridge area and harbour were bombed heavily during World War II. The city centre has been largely spared, but many Allied bombs, meant to shell the IJssel railway bridge, came down on buildings in the city centre. The Deventer railway bridge was considered strategically important, being a part of the main railway connection between Amsterdam and the German city of Osnabrück, leading from there to either Berlin, Hamburg or Bremen. The railway bridge, constructed of steel, was difficult to hit. Many bombs were bounced down into the river or its banks, exploding in the areas around the bridge or failing to explode at all. The three heaviest of about 15 attacks were on October 28, 1944 causing 35 fatalities; on December 15, 1944 killing 33 people; and on February 6, 1945 causing the death of 61 people. In the aftermath of this last bombardment, the German occupying forces committed a war crime. The German army used a cool warehouse in Deventer for its military food supplies. In the city centre, the retirement home of the &quot;United Foundations&quot;, originally dating back as far as the 13th century, caught fire by the shellings, as well as the army food warehouse. The Germans allowed local fire fighters only to extinguish the fire in the cool warehouse. The retirement home burnt down as good as totally. Over twenty of the elderly living there perished in the flames.

The Jewish poet and writer Etty Hillesum lived in Deventer during the war before being deported to Auschwitz.

In Schalkhaar, a village only 2 km northeast of the city centre, barracks were used by the German occupying forces to train Nazi policemen. The compound is now a centre for asylum seekers.

In a forested area between Lettele and Okkenbroek, about 10 kilometres east of Deventer, the Germans operated a V-1 flying bomb launching ramp. It was used from December, 1944, until March, 1945. Some of the 400 V-1 missiles launched there hit already liberated Belgium, including the city of Antwerp, killing many people. A war monument in the village of Lettele consists of concrete blocks from this launching site, that is a war monument itself as well.

Deventer has been somewhat popular with the film industry. During the production of the 1977 film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, all of the scenes taking place in nearby Arnhem were filmed in Deventer - as Arnhem itself had lost its historic centre.

By the end of the 1950s, the buildings had reached the boundaries of the municipality. In 1960, for further expansion, the part of the municipality of Diepenveen was annexed that now covers the Keizerslanden, Borgele and Platvoet districts, all three realized in the 1960s; all together roughly the area up to (west of) the Zandwetering.

After a plan to expand the city across the IJssel, the so-called Double City Plan, was deemed unfeasible at the end of the 1960s, Deventer turned its attention to the east again: in 1974 part of Diepenveen was once again annexed. On January 1, 1999, the municipality of Diepenveen was dissolved and added to Deventer. The same happened with the municipality of Bathmen on 1 January 2005.

=== Climate ===
Deventer is in the northern hemisphere. Summer here starts at the end of June and ends in September. Deventer experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the Netherlands.

=== Water ===

The Deventer settlement was founded on a river dune on the IJssel. This river has played a major role for the city over the centuries, because of the trade that this waterway brought with it. In 1241 the city had received the Katentol on long lease from the Elten stift. This toll, which is named after the Katerveer under Zwolle, had to be paid in the Deventer toll house near the Zandpoort, and generated a lot of money in the Middle Ages.

The IJssel has also caused many problems over the centuries, because it often overflowed its banks. Nowadays Deventer has a flood defence, but the Welle (&#x27;wal&#x27;, the name of the street over the quay) is still regularly under water during high water. Dike breaches of the IJssel have created many gullies in and around the city , such as the Douwelerkolk and the Klinkenbeltskolk.

In addition to the IJssel, Deventer has a large number of waters. The Schipbeek is a brook partly dug on behalf of the city that rises in Germany and flows into the IJssel near Deventer. In the past, the stream was navigable, so that wood and Bentheimer sandstone could be brought in, among other things. Another waterway that was built for shipping and which flows into the IJssel in Deventer is a branch of the Overijssels canal, through which Deventer was connected to a large system of canals through Overijssel. It was dug in the mid-19th century and opened in 1858.

==Culture==

===Sights===

* The Grote Kerkhof square (Grand Churchyard).
* The Saint Lebuïnuskerk (St. Lebuin&#x27;s Church) in Gothic style, with ceiling paintings and an organ. Its tower can be climbed in summer.

* The Brink (market square) with houses, shops, and cafes dating from 1575 to 1900. The market square is also the centre of Deventer nightlife. Alongside this square there is the Bussink &quot;Koekhuisje&quot;, where the honey-cake Deventer Koek is sold. Markets take place every Friday (including one on Good Friday, following a medieval tradition) and Saturday.
* The Waag (Weighing-house) on the edge of the Brink square, built in 1550 and restored in 2003. The Deventer City Museum is housed inside the Waag. The Museum&#x27;s collections include industrial and trading history, paintings by Gerard Terborch and Han van Meegeren, silver objects, and prehistoric findings). Thea Beckman&#x27;s novel &quot;Het wonder van Frieswijck&quot; (&quot;The Frieswijck Miracle&quot;) features the Waag.
** On the outer wall of the Waag hung until 2016 a large kettle that is over 500 years old, said to have been used for a public execution in the late Middle Ages; a man who had produced counterfeit coins was cooked to death in it. According to local tradition, there are holes in the kettle shot by footmen of Napoleon&#x27;s army around 1809. In 2017 the kettle has been placed inside the building, at the entrance of the museum.
* The Speelgoedmuseum (Toy Museum) behind the Waag, housed in an old house in the city called &quot;De Drie Haringen&quot; (&#x27;The Three Herrings&#x27;).

=== Sports ===

Deventer is the home of professional Football club Go Ahead Eagles, who are housed in stadium De Adelaarshorst. De Adelaarshorst is situated in a 1930s neighbourhood and one of the oldest stadiums still in use today. The club was founded in 1902 as Be Quick, although the name was soon changed to Go Ahead at the request of the Dutch Football Association. The suffix Eagles was added in 1971, following a suggestion from the then coach, Barry Hughes. Go Ahead Eagles has been the club of Marc Overmars, Paul Bosvelt, and Bert van Marwijk, whilst providing Henk ten Cate and Leo Beenhakker with their first experience of management.

The 1992 founded skating rink De Scheg, which is semi-indoor since 2011, is in the top 10 of fastest skating tracks of the Netherlands. It has been the training accommodation of skaters including Olympic champion Mark Tuitert and the retired former world champion sprint Erben Wennemars.

Deventer also houses a number of watersports clubs, due to its situation on the banks of the river IJssel.

===Events and festivals===
* In the first weekend of July, the city centre is the scene of the open air festival &quot;Deventer op stelten&quot; (Deventer on Stilts). Actors and artists give performances in the streets and on the Brink square. Originally all actors used stilts during their acts.
* In August, Deventer is home to Europe&#x27;s largest book fair, attracting 125,000 visitors.
* The Dickens Festival in December sees some of the oldest streets and alleys in the city dressed up in the style of the Victorian era. In 2018, the festival attracted 125,000 visitors.

== Government ==

=== City council ===

In the redivision elections of November 17, 2004 , a municipal executive was elected for the period 2005-2010. This municipal election was earlier than in the rest of the Netherlands, because the municipality of Deventer was merged with the then municipality of Bathmen. The March 2006 elections were therefore skipped.

An issue that has occupied the municipal council and public opinion in Deventer since 2006 was the housing of municipal officials and public services in a (new) municipal office adjacent to the old town hall of Deventer. In 2009, the college fell over it. At the end of January 2012, the Municipal Executive approved an adapted design for the new city office by architect Michiel Riedijk. However, a &#x27;popular poll&#x27; by telephone two weeks later would have shown that only 13% of the population of Deventer supported the plans. On March 21 that year, a large majority of the city council voted in favor of the municipal office. In October 2013, the Council of State ruled positive about the arrival of the municipal office, after objections were raised. On December 6 of that year, the official opening act for construction was performed. In December 2015, the complex was completed and municipal staff moved in. In November 2017, the architect received the Abe Bonnema Prize for the design.

== Economy ==
=== Business ===
*Girasolar, founded in 2003

== Education ==

Deventer is also home to one of the three campuses of Saxion University of Applied Sciences (&quot;Saxion Hogeschool&quot;), a polytechnical school offering internationally recognized Bachelor&#x27;s degrees and Master&#x27;s degrees in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, social work, investigations and health care. The other campuses are located in Enschede and Apeldoorn.

In 1912 the Secondary Colonial Agricultural School was founded, which grew out of the National Agricultural School Wageningen. After decolonization took effect, the name was changed into Tropical Agricultural School. In 1957 the school was transformed into the National Higher School for Tropical Agriculture. After a merger with study programs from Boskoop, Wageningen and Velp, it became the International Agricultural College Larenstein. The school was located at the Ceintuurbaan/Brinkgreverweg intersection. The building was given a residential destination in 2018.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===

Since 1989, Deventer has two train stations, Deventer railway station and Deventer Colmschate station. Previously, Deventer has known several so-called stopping points. Most of them closed around 1920. In addition to the current rail connections from Deventer train station, over the Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway, Apeldoorn–Deventer railway, and Deventer–Almelo railway lines, a train connection existed from 1910 to 1935 on the Deventer–Ommen railway line. This was operated by the Overijsselsche Lokaalspoorweg-Maatschappij Deventer - Ommen (OLDO), but had to stop the train service due to competition from the bus.

=== Public transport ===

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Deventer was connected to the extensive tram network of the Achterhoek. The tram line between Deventer and Borculo was operated from 1885 to 1944 by the Geldersch-Overijsselsche Stoomtram Maatschappij (GOSM) and its successors. Another tram company, the &quot;Tramweg Maatschappij Zutphen-Emmerik&quot;, operated the tram line between Deventer and Zutphen. The tram station of Deventer stood on the Pothoofd. It was not combined with Deventer train station because the trams were too heavy to drive over two intermediate bridges. It seemed unprofitable for the tram company to reinforce two bridges, so they used the Pothoofd as a terminal station. After the Second World War, the tram lines were dismantled.

Since the end of 2020, bus transport has been provided by Keolis Nederland under the name &quot;RRReis&quot;, with the exception of the lines from the Achterhoek, which are provided by Arriva.

<text>DeSoto County is a county located in the Florida Heartland region of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,976. Its county seat is Arcadia. DeSoto County comprises the Arcadia, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the North Port-Bradenton, Florida Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, what is now DeSoto County was within the territory of the Native American Calusa tribe.

In 1513, Ponce De Leon sailed into present-day Charlotte Harbor near the mouth of the Peace River to put in for repairs and maintenance on his ships. While there the Spanish encountered Calusa and soon after an argument broke out and several died on both sides. Then the Spanish kidnapped several Calusa and departed Charlotte Harbor and sailed S.W. away from the west coast of Florida. This occurred within the original boundaries of DeSoto County.

In 1521, Ponce De Leon attempted to establish a colony at or near Charlotte Harbor but again was turned away by the Calusa who wounded him. Shortly after, he died and was buried in Puerto Rico.

In 1528 the Spanish Conquistadors Panfilo De Narvaez and Cabeza De Vaca came to present-day Arcadia where they captured several Calusa Indians who told them of great quantities of gold located to the north and offered to guide them there.

In 1539 the Spanish Explorer Hernando DeSoto, for whom the county is named, anchored in Charlotte Harbor and set about to explore the region with mixed results. Eventually, he made his way up the coast to present-day Manatee County and went inland from there.

While Florida was claimed by Spain the moment it was discovered, the territory of La Florida was not formalized until 1565 with the founding of St. Augustine. At that point, what is now DeSoto County became part of La Florida. In 1763, the region became part of East Florida under British Rule. In 1783, East Florida was returned to Spain at which point today&#x27;s DeSoto county was once again Spanish territory. In 1821 it became U.S. Territory.

In 1841 Camp Ogden, later Fort Ogden was built as a staging area for the U.S. Army during the 2nd Seminole War, in the southwestern part of present-day DeSoto County.

In 1870, the Joshua Creek Church and neighboring cemetery was founded.

In the 1870s John W. Whidden, a Confederate veteran and former Manatee county clerk, settled along the Joshua Creek where he founded a cattle ranch raising thousands of head of cattle. Also in the 1870s, Union veteran Robert C. Hendry took up cattle ranching on the Joshua Creek in the now-defunct settlement of Davidson.

In 1876 the Fort Ogden Post Office was founded and remains the oldest post office in the county.

DeSoto County was created in 1887 from Manatee County. It was named for Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, whose name was also honored in Hernando County.

DeSoto County originally included several other present-day counties until 1921, when the Florida legislature created the following new counties: Charlotte, Glades, Hardee, and Highlands.

During World War II, DeSoto County operated the Carlstrom Field Air Base, which provided training for both American and British pilots. Twenty-three British pilots were killed while training at the base and are honored at DeSoto County&#x27;s Oak Ridge Cemetery, which is located in the town of Arcadia. In 1945, the base turned out its last cadets and was decommissioned. The base was then sold to the State of Florida for one dollar and later converted into a mental health facility known as G. Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital. The hospital has since been converted into a facility for juvenile offenders. The facility was closed and is now up for sale.

On August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley passed directly through DeSoto County. Hurricane-force winds persisted for an hour, damaging most of the structures in the county and causing some to be completely destroyed.

<text>Duval County ( ), officially the City of Jacksonville and Duval County, is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, its population was 995,567, making it the sixth-most populous county in Florida. Its county seat is Jacksonville, with which the Duval County government has been consolidated since 1968. Duval County was established in 1822 and is named for William Pope Duval, Governor of Florida Territory from 1822 to 1834. Duval County is the central county of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area was settled by varying cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European contact. Within the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, archeologists excavated remains of some of the oldest pottery in the United States, dating to 2500 BCE. Prior to European contact, the area was inhabited by the Mocama, a Timucuan-speaking group who lived throughout the coastal areas of northern Florida. At the time Europeans arrived, much of what is now Duval County was controlled by the Saturiwa, one of the region&#x27;s most powerful tribes. The area that became Duval County was home to the 16th-century French colony of Fort Caroline and saw increased European settlement in the 18th century with the establishment of Cowford, later renamed Jacksonville.

Duval County was created in 1822 from St. Johns County. It was named for William Pope Duval, Governor of Florida Territory from 1822 to 1834. When Duval County was created, it covered a massive area, from the Suwannee River on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, north of a line from the mouth of the Suwannee River to Jacksonville on the St. Johns River. Alachua and Nassau counties were created out of parts of Duval County in 1824. Clay County was created from part of Duval County in 1858. Part of St. Johns County south and east of the lower reaches of the St. Johns River was transferred to Duval County in the 1840s.

==Government==
On October 1, 1968, the government of Duval County was consolidated with the government of the city of Jacksonville. The Duval County cities of Atlantic Beach, Jacksonville Beach, and Neptune Beach, and the town of Baldwin are not included in the corporate limits of Jacksonville and maintain their own municipal governments. The city of Jacksonville provides all services that a county government would normally provide. The Mayor of Jacksonville serves as the chief administrator over all of Duval County.

==Politics==
===Voter registration===
According to the Secretary of State&#x27;s office, Democrats comprise a plurality of registered voters in Duval County.
===Statewide and national elections===
Duval County is somewhat conservative for an urban county, and it began moving away from the Democratic Party sooner than the majority of Florida counties. Despite the small Democratic plurality in registration, the county&#x27;s Democrats are nowhere near as liberal as their counterparts in other large Florida counties, such as Broward and Orange. The county has only supported a Democrat for president three times since 1952, in 1960, 1976, and 2020.

However, the Republican edge in Duval has lessened somewhat in recent years. It swung from a 16-point win for George W. Bush in 2004 to only a three-point win for John McCain in 2008. Mitt Romney won an equally narrow margin in 2012 and in 2016, Donald Trump only won the county by fewer than 6,000 votes even as he narrowly carried Florida. In 2020, Joe Biden, despite losing statewide, broke the 44-year Democratic drought in Duval County, winning by less than four points. In 2024, the county reverted back to the GOP and Trump won it by less than 2 points.

In 2018, Andrew Gillum, despite losing the election, won Duval by four points, the first time a Democrat had won the county in a gubernatorial election since Steve Pajcic&#x27;s losing bid in 1986. Four years later, however, Duval rebounded to vote for Ron DeSantis by over 10 points. In the Senate elections, Bill Nelson only failed to carry the county in his first bid in 2000, and Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham carried the county in all three of their respective bids. In 2022, Ron DeSantis won the county in his reelection bid by 12 points.

<text>The Michigan Shore-to-Shore Trail (also known as the Michigan Riding and Hiking Trail) is a trail that runs between Empire on Lake Michigan and Oscoda on Lake Huron across the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. It is open to horseback riders and hikers but not bicycles.

The trail&#x27;s western end is located within the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The trail, going from west to east, travels through the Boardman River valley and follows the Au Sable River for about . The trail was developed by trail riders in 1962 and travels through mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Public campgrounds are located throughout the route.

Michigan has many other important and scenic trails. Chief among them is the North Country National Scenic Trail.

<doc id="72356" wikidata="Q3057509" url="?curid=72356" title="Cathedral floorplan">
<text>In Western ecclesiastical architecture, a cathedral diagram is a floor plan showing the sections of walls and piers, giving an idea of the profiles of their columns and ribbing. Light double lines in perimeter walls indicate glazed windows. Dashed lines show the ribs of the vaulting overhead. By convention, ecclesiastical floorplans are shown map-fashion, with north to the top and the liturgical east end to the right.

Many abbey churches have floorplans that are comparable to cathedrals, though sometimes with more emphasis on the sanctuary and choir spaces that are reserved for the religious community. Smaller churches are similarly planned, with simplifications.

==Design ==
Cathedral floorplans are designed to provide for the liturgical rites of the church. Before the legalization of Christianity by Emperor Constantine, Christians worshiped in private homes or in secretive locations. Once legally able to publicly worship, the local congregations adapted the available Roman designs to their needs. Unlike the Roman and Greek religions, where priests performed rituals without public participation, Christian worship involved the believers. Thus, the limited spaces typically used in pagan temples were not suitable to Christian worship.
Roman civic buildings were designed for the participation of the citizens of the city, and thus the Roman Basilica was adopted for Christian purposes. This included an entry on one end of a long narrow, covered space with a raised dais at the other end. Upon the dais, public officials would hear legal cases, or expound on some matter of public interest.

==Glossary==
* Aisle: A pair of walkways that are parallel to the primary public spaces in the church, e.g. nave, choir and transept. The aisles are separated from the public areas by pillars supporting the upper walls, called an arcade.
* Ambulatory: A specific name for the curved aisle around the choir
* Apse: The end of the building opposite the main entry. Often circular, but it can be angular or flat. In medieval traditions, it was the east end of the building. 
* Buttress: Large stone pier holding the roof vaults in place. A buttress may be visible as in the Gothic flying buttress, or it may be hidden in the complex of aisles and galleries.
* Cathedral: The home church of a bishop, which contains the cathedra or bishop&#x27;s chair. The church may be of any size. 
* Chapel: A smaller spaces inside a church that has its own altar
** Lady chapel: a chapel dedicated to &quot;Our Lady&quot;, Mary, mother of Jesus
** Radiating Chapels: Located around the Apse of the church, accessible from the Ambulatory.
* Choir (or Quire): The part of the church usually beyond the transept and in line with the axis of the nave. The area may be higher than the level of the nave. The name choir is used because traditionally the clergy of the Cathedral stood here as a chorus, chanting or singing during the responsive portion of Divine Offices or Mass. 
* Crypt: Usually the below ground foundation. Used for burial or as a chapel. 
* Facade: The outside of the church, where the main doors are located. In traditional medieval design, this faced the west and is called the West End.
* Narthex: The entrance or lobby area, located at the west end of the nave.
* Nave: The primary area of public observance of the Mass. It is generally the largest space, and located between the narthex and sanctuary.
* Sanctuary: An elevated platform that contains the main altar and associated liturgical elements that is restricted for ceremonial use by the clergy, often fenced from adjoining spaces. It is centered on the main east–west axis within the east end and generally located within the choir or the apse. 
* Transept: Sometimes called the ‘Crossing’, the transept forms wings at right angles to the nave. In early Romanesque churches, it was often at the east end, creating a Tau Cross. Later designs placed the transept about two-thirds of the way from the West End to the East End. This created the Latin cross plan.

<text>Escambia County is the westernmost and oldest county in the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 321,905. The county seat and largest city is Pensacola. Escambia County is included within the Pensacola Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county population has steadily increased as the City of Pensacola and its surrounding bedroom communities continue to grow with residential and commercial development. The county is part of the Northwest Florida region of the state.

==History==
The area had been inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of varying cultures. Historic American Indian tribes at the time of European-American settlement were the Pensacola and Muscogee, known among the English as the Creek.

Escambia County had been part of Spanish colonial settlement before the United States acquired it in 1818. The county was organized by European-Americans on July 21, 1821; it was named for the Escambia River. The name &quot;Escambia&quot; may have been derived from the Creek name &quot;Shambia&quot;, meaning &quot;clear water&quot;, or the Choctaw word for &quot;cane-brake&quot; or &quot;reed-brake&quot;. The Choctaw were another major tribe in the Southeast.

Created on the same date, Escambia and St. Johns Counties were Florida&#x27;s two original counties, covering the entire territory within modern state boundaries. The Suwannee River was the border between them, following a winding path from the northern border of the state to the Gulf of Mexico. Essentially, the Escambia county government had jurisdiction over the &quot;panhandle&quot; and &quot;big bend&quot; areas, and St. Johns over the remainder of the entire state.

As population increased in the frontier territory, 21 counties were later organized from Escambia county directly or indirectly. They include Jackson (1821), Gadsden (created from Jackson)(1823), Leon (1824), Walton (1824), Washington (created from Jackson and Walton)(1825), Hamilton (1827), Jefferson (1827), Madison (created from Jefferson) (1827), Franklin (1832), Calhoun (1838), Santa Rosa (1842), Wakulla (created from Leon) (1843), Holmes (created from Jackson and Walton) (1848), Liberty (created from Gadsden) (1855), Lafayette and Taylor (created from Madison) (1856), Bay (created from Washington) (1913), Okaloosa (created from Santa Rosa and Walton) (1915), Dixie (created from Lafayette) (1921), and Gulf (created from Calhoun) (1925). The number of counties in Florida since 1925 has been stable at 67.

===County jail===
In 2011, the US Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division issued a letter detailing the results of its investigation into conditions at Escambia County Jail, which houses roughly 1,300 prisoners. The department found that, although Sheriff David Morgan had recently implemented a series of reforms, conditions at the jail still routinely violated prisoners&#x27; constitutional rights.

Specifically, the department concluded that known systemic deficiencies, stemming mainly from staffing shortages, subjected prisoners to excessive risk of assault by other prisoners and to inadequate mental health care. Additionally, the department found that, until recently, the jail had an informal policy and practice of segregating its housing units, reserving one for African-American prisoners. According to the Department of Justice, this race-based segregation stigmatized and discriminated against many of the prisoners, and aggravated racial tensions in the jail. Between April 2012 and March 2013, the prison recorded 176 inmate-on-inmate assaults, including 20 serious head wounds.

The investigation released a letter of findings:
* Prisoner-on-prisoner assaults are a common occurrence at the jail, making the Facility unsafe for prisoners. Assaults occur routinely primarily because of a shortage of correctional staff. The facility needs more staff to patrol jail pods, intervene when altercations or fights break out, and search cells for dangerous items that could be used as weapons against fellow prisoners;
* A staffing study released in March 2011 commissioned by county leadership has given Jail leadership good reason to know that staffing shortages pose a significant risk to prisoner safety. Among other findings, the study concluded that: the jail &quot;is operating with only about three-fourths of its needed staff; that &quot;the [j]ail has been understaffed for many years;&quot; that &quot;[d]eputies ... are routinely borrowed from other jobs which results in leaving their posts unmanned;&quot; that &quot;[t]he frequency of some important operations, such as cell searches, is reduced due to lack of staff to conduct the searches;&quot; that &quot;[p]osts are understaffed or not staffed at all;&quot; and that, &quot;[l]arge insufficiencies in jail staffing ... raise the likelihood that something serious could happen that would overwhelm the jail&#x27;s ability to respond;&quot;
* The Jail&#x27;s leadership fails to appropriately monitor and track prisoner-on-prisoner violence and staff-on-prisoner uses of force;
* The jail&#x27;s decades-long practice of housing some prisoners in housing units designated as only for black prisoners (&quot;black-only pods&quot;) racially discriminates against African-Americans, contributes to prisoner perceptions that the jail favors white prisoners over black prisoners, and reduces safety by exacerbating racial tensions among prisoners at the Facility;
* Prisoners are not given timely and adequate access to appropriately skilled mental health care professionals;
* The jail routinely fails to provide appropriate medications to prisoners with mental illness;
* The jail provides inadequate housing and observation for prisoners with serious mental illness and/or at risk of self-injury, including suicide; and
* On average, the jail sends roughly one prisoner per month to the hospital after an incident of self-injury, a rate judged indicative of an inadequate mental health program.

The Department of Justice concluded from these facts that Escambia County Jail&#x27;s practices violated the fourteenth amendment&#x27;s due process protections for pre-trial detainees, as well as the eighth amendment&#x27;s protections for those convicted of a criminal offense. Jail officials must refrain from showing deliberate indifference to conditions of confinement posing an excessive risk of harm to prisoners.

Roy L. Austin Jr., deputy assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, commended Sheriff Morgan for his willingness to remedy problems identified during the course of the investigation. The department conducted this investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) to enforce constitutional mandates. The department&#x27;s investigation was broad-based.

The investigation was conducted by Special Litigation Counsel Avner Shapiro and Senior Trial Attorney David Deutsch of the Civil Rights Division&#x27;s Special Litigation Section. The findings letter is available on the department&#x27;s website.

==Politics==

===Voter registration===
According to the secretary of state&#x27;s office, Republicans constitute a plurality of registered voters in Escambia County.

===Statewide elections===
Escambia County is very conservative for an urban county. Before 1994, the area traditionally voted Democratic in local elections and sent Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives and the state legislature, like most of the Western Panhandle. This was particularly the case in the decades of the 20th century when most African Americans were disenfranchised by the state constitution until the federal Voting Rights Act passed.

In 1994 incumbent representative Earl Hutto declined to run for reelection. That year, Republican Joe Scarborough was elected to the House of Representatives.

Voters of the county have not supported a Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy in 1960. In 1964, a majority of the county&#x27;s voters supported Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. In 1968, third-party candidate George Wallace won Escambia County with 54% of the vote. In 1972, Republican Richard Nixon received 80% of the vote. Since 1972, Republican nominees in every presidential election have won an absolute majority in Escambia County, but in recent years, the Democratic Party has increased its share of the presidential vote. In 2020, Joe Biden was the first Democratic presidential nominee to win over 40% of the county&#x27;s vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Growth in the Pensacola suburbs as well as the sizable black population has made Escambia County the least Republican-leaning of the Western Panhandle counties.

<text>The Oslo I Accord or Oslo I, officially called the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements or short Declaration of Principles (DOP), was an attempt in 1993 to set up a framework that would lead to the resolution of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It was the first face-to-face agreement between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

Negotiations concerning the agreement, an outgrowth of the Madrid Conference of 1991, were conducted secretly in Oslo, Norway, hosted by the Fafo institute, and completed on 20 August 1993; the Oslo Accords were subsequently officially signed at a public ceremony in Washington, D.C., on 13 September 1993, in the presence of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The documents themselves were signed by Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO, foreign Minister Shimon Peres for Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for the United States and foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev for Russia.

The Accord provided for the creation of a Palestinian interim self-government, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The Palestinian Authority would have responsibility for the administration of the territory under its control. The Accords also called for the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

It was anticipated that this arrangement would last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated (beginning no later than May 1996). Remaining issues such as the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, security and borders would be part of the &quot;permanent status negotiations&quot; during this period.

In August 1993, the delegations had reached an agreement, which was signed in secrecy by Peres while visiting Oslo. In the Letters of Mutual Recognition, the PLO acknowledged the State of Israel and pledged to reject violence, and Israel recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and as partner in negotiations. Yasser Arafat was allowed to return to the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In 1995, the Oslo I Accord was followed by Oslo II.

==Principles of the Accords==
In essence, the accords called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and affirmed a Palestinian right of self-government within those areas through the creation of a Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority. Palestinian rule was to last for a five-year interim period during which &quot;permanent status negotiations&quot; would commence in order to reach a final agreement.

The negotiations would cover major issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, and security and borders were to be decided at these permanent status negotiations (Article V). Israel was to grant interim self-government to the Palestinians in phases.

Along with the principles, the two groups signed Letters of Mutual Recognition—the Israeli government recognized the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, while the PLO recognized the right of the state of Israel to exist and renounced terrorism as well as other violence, and its desire for the destruction of the Israeli state.

The aim of Israeli–Palestinian negotiations was to establish a Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority, an elected Council, for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, for a transitional period not exceeding five years, leading to a permanent settlement based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, an integral part of the whole peace process.

In order that the Palestinians govern themselves according to democratic principles, free and general political elections would be held for the council.

Jurisdiction of the Palestinian Council would cover the West Bank and Gaza Strip, except for issues that would be finalized in the permanent status negotiations. The two sides viewed the West Bank and Gaza as a single territorial unit.

The permanent status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians would start &quot;not later than the beginning of the third year of the interim period&quot;; the interim period would &quot;begin upon the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area&quot;. That withdrawal began with the signing of the Gaza–Jericho Agreement on 4 May 1994, thus the interim period would end on 4 May 1999.

The five-year transitional period would commence with Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. There would be a transfer of authority from the Israel Defense Forces to the authorized Palestinians, concerning education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, and tourism. The council would establish a strong police force, while Israel would continue to carry the responsibility for defending against external threats.

An Israeli–Palestinian Economic Cooperation Committee would be established in order to develop and implement in a cooperative manner the programs identified in the protocols.

The Declaration of Principles would enter into force one month after its signing. All protocols annexed to the Declaration of Principles and the Agreed Minutes pertaining to it were to be regarded as a part of it.

The Oslo I Accord contains some explanations of a number of articles in the Accord, with understandings the parties had agreed on:

====General understandings====
Any powers and responsibilities transferred to the Palestinians through the Declaration of Principles prior to the inauguration of the council will be subject to the same principles pertaining to Article IV, as set out in the agreed minutes below.

====Specific understandings====
;Article IV: Council&#x27;s jurisdiction
It was to be understood that: Jurisdiction of the council would cover West Bank and Gaza Strip territory, except for issues that would be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations.

;Article V: Permanent status negotiations issues
It was understood that several issues were postponed to permanent status negotiations, including: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements, borders, relations and co-operation with other neighbours, and other issues of common interest. The outcome of these permanent status negotiations should not be prejudiced or pre-empted by the parties.

Israeli military forces and civilians would be allowed to continue using roads freely within the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.

==Reactions==
===In Israel===
In Israel, a strong debate over the accords took place; the left wing supported them, while the right wing opposed them. After a two-day discussion in the Knesset on the government proclamation in the issue of the accord and the exchange of the letters, on 23 September 1993, a vote of confidence was held in which 61 Knesset members voted for the decision, 50 voted against and 8 abstained.

On both sides (Israel and Palestine), there were fears of the other side&#x27;s intentions. Israelis suspected that the Palestinians were entering into a tactical peace agreement, and that they were not sincere about wanting to reach peace and coexistence with Israel. They saw it as part of the PLO&#x27;s Ten Point Program which calls for a national authority &quot;over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated&quot; until &quot;the liberation of all Palestinian territory&quot; and understood it as an attempt to justify the signing of the accords as a step to reach a final goal.

Jerusalem&#x27;s new mayor and later Prime Minister Ehud Olmert opposed the agreement and called it a &quot;dark cloud over the city&quot;. He favored to bring more Jews to East Jerusalem and expand Jerusalem to the east.

===In Palestine===
Palestinian reactions were also divided. Fatah, the group that represented the Palestinians in the negotiations, accepted the accords. But Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine objected to the accords.

On both sides (Israel and Palestine), there were fears of the other side&#x27;s intentions. Many Palestinians feared that Israel was not serious about dismantling their settlements in the West Bank, especially around Jerusalem. They feared they might even accelerate their settlement program in the long run, by building more settlements and expanding existing ones.

===In Lebanon===
On 13 September 1993 the Lebanese Army opened fire on an anti-Oslo demonstration in south Beirut organised by Hizbollah killing nine people and wounding thirty.

=== Nobel Peace Prize ===
In 1994 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize following the signing on the Oslo Accords, &quot;for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East&quot;. The Accords have not resulted in peace to date.

==Remarks from Benjamin Netanyahu==
In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: &quot;They asked me before the election if I&#x27;d honor [the Oslo accords]... I said I would, but [that] I&#x27;m going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the &#x27;67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.&quot; Netanyahu then explained how he conditioned his signing of the 1997 Hebron agreement on American consent that there be no withdrawals from &quot;specified military locations&quot;, and insisted he be allowed to specify which areas constituted a &quot;military location&quot;—such as the whole of the Jordan Valley. &quot;Why is that important? Because from that moment on I stopped the Oslo Accords&quot;, Netanyahu affirmed.
However, this is clearly consistent with Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s October 1995 statement to the Knesset on the ratification of the interim Oslo agreement: &quot;B. The security border of the State of Israel will be located in the Jordan Valley, in the broadest meaning of that term.&quot;

==Additional agreements==
In addition to the first accord, the parties concluded:

*The Gaza–Jericho Agreement or Cairo Agreement, signed on 4 May 1994, which initiated a partial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority
*The Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (also known as Oslo 2), signed on 28 September 1995 gave Palestinians self-rule in Bethlehem, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Qalqilya, Ramallah, Tulkarm, and some 450 villages.

After 1995, a number of additional agreements were concluded to implement the Oslo Accords.

==Consequences of the accord==
In 2013 the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation stated, &quot;The Oslo Accord divided the metropolis of Hebron—in two. In a small, fortified area of its old city quarters—a small group of Israeli settlers reside, surrounded by more than 120,000 Palestinians&quot;.

==Libraries==
Flagler County Library System consists of two branches with over 57,000 borrowers. The Main Branch is located at 2500 Palm Coast Pkwy NW, Palm Coast and the Bunnell Branch is located at 103 E Moody Blvd, Bunnell. The Flagler County Library system currently employees eighteen staff, with fourteen full-time employees and four part-time employees with an annual operating budget of $1 million.

The Flagler County Public Library was created by the County Commission in 1987, but as early as 1937, a room of the County Courthouse in Bunnell was set aside for a small library, which was sponsored by the Colony Club. The current library director is Holly Albanese.

The Flagler County Library System offers a wide variety of services beyond traditional library services. They have an e-book collection through Overdrive and Axis360. The library system will assist patrons in filing taxes, and applying for some government programs, as well as with passport applications. Both libraries offer fax services, and the Main Branch also offers scanning services.

In 2001, the Flagler County Library System began a local oral history project called the &quot;Flagler County Memories Project&quot;. This project is currently being recorded and then preserved on compact discs. The project mission states, &quot;This collection of oral life histories seeks to sample the common themes and unique stories of selected local residents.&quot;

<text>Keith Peter Shine (born 19 April 1958) FRS is the Regius Professor of Meteorology and Climate Science at the University of Reading. He is the first holder of this post, which was awarded to the university by Queen Elizabeth II to mark her Diamond Jubilee.

==Education==
Shine was educated at Halesowen Grammar School and Imperial College London where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1978. He completed his postgraduate education at the University of Edinburgh, where he was awarded a PhD in meteorology in 1981 for research supervised by Bob Harwood.
He now teaches atmospheric physics to second year students at the University of Reading.

==Research==
Shine&#x27;s research interests are in meteorology and climate science, with a focus on understanding how human activity initiates climate change. He has also investigated the role played by water vapour in the Earth&#x27;s energy budget, which considers the energy flows both into and away from the Earth in the form of shortwave radiation from the Sun and outgoing longwave radiation from the Earth and its atmosphere, respectively.

In addition, Shine is at the forefront of identifying and quantifying radiative forcing, a way of measuring the strength of climate change mechanisms. He has been heavily involved in major United Nations&#x27; assessments of climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion, and was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1995 IPCC Second Assessment Report.

Prior to working at Reading in 1988, he held postdoctoral research posts at the University of Liverpool and University of Oxford.

==Awards and honours==
Shine was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2009.

<text>Gerard Groote (October 1340 – 20 August 1384), otherwise &quot;Gerrit&quot; or &quot;Gerhard Groet&quot;, in Latin &quot;Gerardus Magnus&quot;, was a Dutch Catholic deacon, who was a popular preacher and the founder of the Brethren of the Common Life. He was a key figure in the Devotio Moderna movement.

== Biography ==

=== Birth and education ===

He was born in the Hanseatic city Deventer in the Bishopric of Utrecht, where his father held a good civic position. He studied at Aachen, then went to the University of Paris when only fifteen. Here he studied scholastic philosophy and theology at the Sorbonne under a pupil of William of Occam&#x27;s, from whom he imbibed the nominalist conception of philosophy; in addition he studied Canon law, medicine, astronomy and even magic, and apparently some Hebrew. After a brilliant course he graduated in 1358. In 1362 he was appointed teacher at the Deventer chapter school. 

=== Religious life ===
Soon after, Groote settled in Cologne, teaching philosophy and theology, and was granted a prebend in Utrecht and another in Aachen. In 1366 his countrymen sent him to Avignon on a secret mission to Pope Urban V. The life of the brilliant young scholar was rapidly becoming luxurious, secular and selfish, when a great spiritual change passed over him which resulted in a final renunciation of every worldly enjoyment. This conversion, which took place in 1374, appears to have been due partly to the effects of a dangerous illness and partly to the influence of a fellow student, Henry de Calcar, the learned and pious prior of the Charterhouse at Munnikhuizen (Monnikenhuizen) near Arnhem, who had remonstrated with him on the vanity of his life.

In 1374 Groote turned his family home in Deventer into a shelter for poor women and lived for several years as a guest of the Carthusian monastery. In 1379, having received ordination as a deacon, he became a missionary preacher throughout the diocese of Utrecht. The success which followed his labours not only in the city of Utrecht, but also in Zwolle, Deventer, Kampen, Amsterdam, Haarlem, Gouda, Leiden, Delft, Zutphen and elsewhere, was immense; according to Thomas à Kempis the people left their business and their meals to hear his sermons, so that the churches could not hold the crowds that flocked together wherever he came.

The bishop of Utrecht supported him warmly, and got him to preach against concubinage in the presence of the clergy assembled in synod. The impartiality of his censures, which he directed not only against the prevailing sins of the laity, but also against heresy, simony, avarice, and impurity among the secular and regular clergy, provoked the hostility of the clergy, and accusations of heterodoxy were brought against him. It was in vain that Groote emitted a &quot;Publica Protestatio&quot;, in which he declared that Jesus was the great subject of his discourses, that in all of them he believed himself to be in harmony with Catholic doctrine, and that he willingly subjected them to the candid judgment of the Church.

The bishop was induced to issue an edict which prohibited from preaching all who were not in priestly orders, and an appeal by Groote to Pope Urban VI was without effect. There is a difficulty as to the date of this prohibition; either it was only a few months before Groote&#x27;s death, or else it must have been removed by the bishop, for Groote seems to have preached in public in the last year of his life.

At some period (perhaps 1381, perhaps earlier) he paid a visit of some days&#x27; duration to the famous mystic John Ruysbroeck, prior of the Augustinian canons at Groenendaal near Brussels; during this visit was formed Groote&#x27;s attraction for the rule and life of the Augustinian canons which was destined to bear notable fruit. At the close of his life he was asked by some of the clerics who attached themselves to him to form them into a religious order and Groote resolved that they should be Canons Regular of St. Augustine. No time was lost in the effort to carry out the project, but Groote died before a foundation could be made.

The initiation of this movement was the great achievement of Groote&#x27;s life; he lived to preside over the birth and first days of his other creation, the society of Brethren of the Common Life. He died of the plague at Deventer, which he had contracted while nursing the sick, in 1384 at the age of 44. Geert Groote was also a famous writer, who made an important Middle Dutch translation of a book of hours. His translation was used innumerable times throughout the following centuries.

===The Brethren of the Common Life===

Young men especially flocked to him in great numbers. Some of these he sent to his schools, others he occupied at transcribing good books, to all he taught thorough Christian piety. Groote and Florence Radewyns, his favourite disciple, founded at Zwolle the Brethren of the Common Life. In 1387 a site was secured at Windesheim, some north of Deventer, and here was established the monastery that became the cradle of the Windesheim Congregation of canons regular embracing in course of time nearly one hundred houses, and leading the way in the series of reforms undertaken during the 15th century by all the religious orders in Germany. Henceforth his communities, which were spreading rapidly through the Netherlands, Lower Germany, and Westphalia, claimed and received all his attention. He contemplated organizing his clerics into a community of canons regular, but it was left to Radewyns, his successor, to realize this plan at Windesheim two years later.

===Devotio Moderna===

A movement known as the Modern Devotion (Devotio Moderna) was founded in the Netherlands by Groote and Florens Radewyns, in the late fourteenth century. For Groote the pivotal point is the search for inner peace, which results from the denial of one&#x27;s own self and is to be achieved by &quot;ardour&quot; and &quot;silence&quot;. This is the heart of the &quot;New Devotion&quot;, or the &quot;Devotio moderna&quot;. Solitary meditation on Christ’s Passion and redemption, on one’s own death, the Last Judgment, heaven, and hell was essential.

In the course of the 15th century, the Modern Devotion found adherents throughout the Netherlands and Germany. Its precepts were further disseminated in texts such as &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas à Kempis, which reached an increasingly literate public. In this context small works of art such as diptychs that provided a focus for private worship enjoyed wide popularity.

**&quot;Chronicon Windeshemense&quot; of Johann Busch (ed. K Grube, 1886).

An account, based on the &quot;Britannica&quot; sources, is in S. Kettlewell, &quot;Thomas à Kempis and the Brothers of Common Life&quot; (1882), i. c. 5; and a shorter account in F. R. Cruise, &quot;Thomas à Kempis&quot;, 1887, pt. ii. A sketch, with an account of Groote&#x27;s writings, is given by L. Schulze in Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot; (ed. 3); he insists on the fact that Groote&#x27;s theological and ecclesiastical ideas were those commonly current in his day, and that the attempts to make him a &quot;reformer before the Reformation&quot; are unhistorical.

Gadsden County is home to one public high school, Gadsden County High School (formerly East Gadsden High School), formed in 2017 by the merger of East Gadsden High and the high school portion of West Gadsden High School; the West Gadsden High building was converted to West Gadsden Middle. West Gadsden was formed by the merger of the former Chattahoochee High and Greensboro High and was located on the western outskirts of Quincy near Greensboro. East Gadsden, formed by the merger of James A. Shanks High and Havana Northside High, was located on Hwy. 90 east of Quincy.

Robert F. Munroe Day School and Tallavanna Christian School are private schools in the county that were founded as segregation academies.

==Politics==
Due to its majority-black population, Gadsden County is the most reliably Democratic county in Florida. It is also the strongest Democratic county in Florida, giving Democrats higher margins than even in highly populated urban counties like Broward, despite having a population of 43,826. No Democratic gubernatorial or presidential candidate has received less than 60% of the vote in the county since 1992.

In the 2022 gubernatorial election, it was one of only five counties in the state to vote for Democratic nominee Charlie Crist over incumbent Republican governor Ron DeSantis, and it was the only one to give Crist more than 60% of the vote. Similarly, in the 2024 presidential election it was the only county to give Kamala Harris over 60% of the vote, and one of only six counties won by Harris.

According to the secretary of state&#x27;s office, Democrats maintain a massive majority of registered voters in Gadsden County. As of May 23, 2022, the county has the highest percentage of registered Democrats of all counties in Florida. The last Republican to win a majority in the county was Richard Nixon in his landslide 1972 victory, and Gadsden was the solitary Florida county to vote against Reagan in 1984 and George Bush in 1988.
