<text>Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi ( – 13 December 1466), known mononymously as Donatello (; ), was an Italian sculptor of the Renaissance period. Born in Florence, he studied classical sculpture and used his knowledge to develop an Early Renaissance style of sculpture. He spent time in other cities, where he worked on commissions and taught others; his periods in Rome, Padua, and Siena introduced to other parts of Italy the techniques he had developed in the course of a long and productive career. His &quot;David&quot; was the first freestanding nude male sculpture since antiquity; like much of his work it was commissioned by the Medici family.

He worked with stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco, and wax, and used glass in inventive ways. He had several assistants, with four perhaps being a typical number. Although his best-known works are mostly statues executed in the round, he developed a new, very shallow, type of bas-relief for small works, and a good deal of his output was architectural reliefs for pulpits, altars and tombs, as well as &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;s for homes.

Broad, overlapping, phases can be seen in his style, beginning with the development of expressiveness and classical monumentality in statues, then developing energy and charm, mostly in smaller works. Early on he veered away from the International Gothic style he learned from Lorenzo Ghiberti, with classically informed pieces, and further on a number of stark, even brutal pieces. The sensuous eroticism of his most famous work, the bronze &quot;David&quot;, is very rarely seen in other pieces.

==Working and personal life==
All accounts describe Donatello as amiable and well-liked, but rather poor at the business side of his career. Like (not only) Michelangelo in the next century, he tended to accept more commissions than he could handle, and many works were either completed some years late, handed to other sculptors to finish, or never produced. Again like Michelangelo, he enjoyed steady support and patronage from the Medici family.

All sources agree that he carved stone and modelled clay or wax for bronzes very quickly and confidently, and art historians feel able to distinguish his hand from that of others, even within the same work. Italian Renaissance sculptors nearly always used assistants, with the master often giving parts of a piece over to them, but Donatello, who would perhaps not have been good at managing a large workshop like that of Ghiberti, seems to have had at most times a relatively small number of experienced assistants, some of whom became significant masters in their own right. The technical quality of his work can vary, especially in bronze pieces, where casting faults may occur; even the bronze &quot;David&quot; has a hole under his chin, and a patch on his thigh.

Donatello certainly made drawings, probably especially for reliefs. In the case of his stained glass designs and perhaps other works these were his whole contribution. Vasari claimed to have several in his collection, which he praised highly: &quot;I have both nude and draped figures, various animals which astound anyone who sees them, and other beautiful things..&quot;. But very few, if any, surviving drawings are now accepted as probably by his own hand, and these are strong and lively sketches with figures, such as the three in its collections that the French government still attributes to Donatello himself.

A story told both by Vasari and the earlier Pomponio Gaurico says that he kept a bucket containing money hanging on a cord from the ceiling of his workshop, from which those around could take if they needed it. A tax return from 1427, near the peak of his career, shows a much lower income than Ghiberti&#x27;s for the same year, and he seems to have died in modest circumstances, although this may not have been of concern to him; &quot;he was very happy in his old age&quot; according to Vasari.

==Early life==
Donatello was born in Florence, probably in 1386, based on his own later statement in his catasto tax declaration; he claimed to be 41 years old in July 1427. He was the son of Niccolò di Betto Bardi, who was a &quot;wool-stretcher&quot; (&quot;tiratore di lana&quot;) and member of the Florentine Arte della Lana, the wool workers guild, which probably provided a good income.

Donatello&#x27;s actual surname was therefore Bardi, but if he was related to the well known Bardi family of bankers, it seems to have been rather distantly. The banker Bardis were still wealthy and powerful, despite the default of Edward III of England in 1345 having caused the failure of their bank. After Contessina de&#x27; Bardi married Cosimo de&#x27; Medici around 1415, any connection he had might still have been useful to Donatello. However, Donatello&#x27;s father did have a connection with the powerful Buonaccorso Pitti, whose diary records a fight in Pisa in 1380 in which Niccolò intervened, giving Pitti&#x27;s opponent a fatal blow.

Vasari&#x27;s claim that Donatello was raised and educated in the house of the prominent Martelli family is probably baseless, and given for literary, even political reasons. They were certainly later keen patrons of Donatello, and also commissioned work from Vasari himself.

==Early career==
Donatello&#x27;s first appearance in any documentary records is unpromising; in January 1401, at the age of about 15, he was accused in Pistoia, 25 miles from Florence and then controlled by it, of hitting a German with a stick, drawing blood. He was probably there with his father, who had an official job in Pistoia at the time, while Buonaccorso Pitti was the Captain, or governor. While there Donatello appears to have befriended, and perhaps worked with, Filippo Brunelleschi, who was some ten years older (born in 1377), and although not yet a master goldsmith, working on silver figures for an altar in Pistoia Cathedral. What experience Donatello had to assist him, if that was what he was doing, is unclear. 

Both Donatello and Brunelleschi returned to Florence in early 1401, in time for Brunelleschi to take part in the famous competition for the Baptistery doors, often seen as the start of Florentine Renaissance sculpture. Seven sculptors were invited to submit trial panels, for which they were paid; Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; of Brunelleschi wrongly claims that Donatello was one of them, but they were all more experienced figures. Following Vasari and Brunelleschi&#x27;s biographer Antonio Manetti, the unexpected result declared by the 34 judges was that the entries by two young Florentines, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Brunelleschi, were the best. An attempt was made to get the two to share the commission, but amid bitter recriminations that lasted for years, this failed and Ghiberti was given the whole commission. Ghiberti himself on the other hand (and the only contemporary voice) claimed in his &quot;Commentarii&quot; that the vote went unanimously for him, including the competing artists.

Any part played by the adolescent Donatello, presumably assisting Brunelleschi with his trial piece, is unknown. After the final result in late 1402, or early 1403, they seem to have left for Rome together, staying until at least the next year, to study the artistic and architectural remains left by Ancient Rome, then very abundant, though for the most part still buried. They were very early in this effectively archaeological pursuit, which included measuring remains, and hiring labourers to excavate. The main source for this period is the biography of Brunelleschi by Antonio Manetti (1423–1497), who knew both men, but it was written after their deaths in the 1470s. 

Vasari just repeats a shorter version of Manetti&#x27;s account, according to which both men were able to support themselves by jobs for Roman goldsmiths, which probably represented important training for Donatello. Perhaps they were also able to sell excavated sculptures. Brunelleschi subsequently became a highly important architect, while Donatello began his career in sculpture.

Donatello is recorded as working as an apprentice, and for the last few months on a salary, in the studio of Lorenzo Ghiberti in 1404–1407, apparently working on the workshop&#x27;s main project, the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, and from 1406 on he began stone carving at the cathedral for the Porta della Mandorla on its north side, a large project that was still some years from completion. He was paid in November 1406 for a figure of a prophet on the door, most probably the one for the left pinnacle (now in the Museo dell&#x27; Opera del Duomo, the cathedral museum). Giovanni d&#x27;Ambrogio, whose work, according to Kreytenberg, &quot;provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of Renaissance sculpture&quot;, has been described by Manfred Wundram as the &quot;true mentor of Donatello&quot;.

==Early statues for Florence==
===Cathedral===
By early 1408 Donatello had acquired sufficient reputation to be given the commission for a life-size prophet for the cathedral, to be paired with another by Nanni di Banco, a brilliant sculptor of Donatello&#x27;s age, who seems to have been both a rival and friend. In the end they were not placed as intended, probably because they appeared too small from far below, and the Donatello appears to be lost.

From now on he received a series of commissions for full-size statues for prominent public locations. These are now among his most famous works, but after about 1425 he produced few sculptures of this type. His marble &quot;David&quot; may date from around this time, or slightly later, perhaps 1412. He was commissioned to rework it in 1416, the cathedral surrendering it to the republic, who placed in the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio. It was &quot;one of the early cases in monumental sculpture where he is portrayed as a youth&quot;, rather than the King of Israel, and &quot;teeters between the Gothic and Renaissance worlds&quot;. 

In 1409–1411 he executed the colossal seated figure of &quot;Saint John the Evangelist&quot;, which occupied a niche of the old cathedral façade until 1588, and is now in the cathedral museum. This was placed with the base about 3 metres from the ground, and Donatello adjusts his composition with this in mind; since 2015 it and other cathedral sculptures have been displayed at their original heights. 

In 1415 the cathedral authorities decided to revive and complete medieval projects, and add eight lifesize marble figures for the niches of the higher levels of Giotto&#x27;s Campanile adjoining the cathedral, as well as complete a row on the cathedral facade (in which Donatello was not involved). All the figures for the campanile series were removed in 1940, to be replaced by replicas with the originals moved to the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo. They were placed very high, and so were seen from a distance, at a sharp angle, factors which needed allowing for in the compositions, and made &quot;fine detail virtually useless for visual effect&quot;; Since 2015 the museum&#x27;s new displays show this and other statues for the cathedral at the intended original heights.

Donatello was responsible for six of the eight campanile figures, in two cases working with the younger Nanni di Bartolo (&quot;il Rosso&quot;). The commissions and starts stretched between 1414 and 1423, and while most were completed by 1421, the last of his statues was not finished until 1435. This was the striking &quot;Zuccone&quot; (&quot;Baldy&quot;, or &quot;Pumpkin Head&quot; probably intended as Habakkuk or Jeremiah), the best known of the series, and reportedly Donatello&#x27;s favourite.

His other statues for the campanile are known as: the &quot;Beardless Prophet&quot; and &quot;Bearded Prophet&quot; (both from 1414 to 1420); the &quot;Sacrifice of Isaac&quot; (with Nanni di Batolo, 1421); &quot;il Populano&quot;, a prophet not finally finished until 1435.

The visibility of statues high on the cathedral buildings was to remain a concern for the rest of the century; Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; was intended for such a place, but proved too heavy to raise and support. Donatello, with Brunelleschi, proposed a large but lightweight solution, and made a prophet Joshua with a brick core, then a modelled layer of clay or terracotta, all painted white. This was put in place on the cathedral some time after 1415, and remained until the 18th century; it was known as the &quot;White Colossus&quot; or &quot;homo magnus et albus&quot; (&quot;Large White Man&quot;).

===Orsanmichele===
Another large-scale sculptural project in the city was the completion of the statues for the niches around the outside of the rectangular Orsanmichele, a building owned by the guilds of Florence, which was in the process of turning itself from a grain market to a church on the ground floor, still with offices above. There were 14 niches around the outside, and each of the main guilds was responsible for one, normally choosing their patron saint. The location had the advantage that the niches were much lower than on the cathedral, with the feet of the statues some three metres above ground level.

Nevertheless, according to a story in Vasari, Donatello had trouble with his first statue for Orsanmichele, a marble &quot;St. Mark&quot; (1411–1413) for the linen-weavers guild. Viewing the finished statue at ground level, the weavers did not like it. Donatello got them to put it in its niche and cover it up while he worked to improve it. After two weeks under cover, he showed it in position, without having done any work on it, and they happily accepted it. It has a contrapposto pose, with the robe on the leg bearing the weight in straight &quot;vertical drapery folds resembling the flutes of a Doric column.&quot; Like most of the Orsanmichele statues, this has been moved to the museum inside, and replaced by a replica.

About 1415 to 1417 he completed the marble &quot;Saint George&quot; for the Confraternity of the Cuirass-makers or armourers; the important relief on the base is discussed below, and was slightly later. Because of a staircase on the other side of the wall, the niche is shallower than the others, but Donatello turns this to his advantage, pushing the figure forward into space, and with the &quot;anxious look&quot; on the face suggesting alertness or &quot;prontezza&quot;, &quot;the quality above all others singled out for praise in the successive Renaissance eulogies of the work&quot;. Holes and the shape of a hand suggest that the figure was originally fitted with a wreath or helmet on his head, and carried a sword or lance; the client would have been able to supply these pieces in bronze.

The gilt-bronze &quot;Saint Louis of Toulouse&quot; dates to some years later, 1423–25. It is now in the museum of the Basilica di Santa Croce, having been replaced in 1460 by the bronze &quot;Incredulity of Saint Thomas&quot; by Verrocchio. It is technically very unusual, as it was built up from a number of sections cast and gilded separately, necessitated by the difficulty of fire-gilding a whole over-life size figure. The collaboration with Michelozzo may have begun with this piece, and 1423 marks the beginning of Donatello&#x27;s documented work in bronze, with three recorded commissions that year: the &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, a reliquary bust of Saint Rossore, and the relief for the Siena Baptistery discussed below. Michelozzo had great experience with bronze, and no doubt helped with the technical aspects, and Donatello took to the medium very quickly.

===Elsewhere===
In 1418 the Signoria commissioned a large and imposing figure of Florence&#x27;s heraldic lion, the Marzocco for the entrance to a new apartment at Santa Maria Novella built for a rare visit by the pope; in the event he did not finish it in time. It was later placed in the Piazza della Signoria, where there is now a replica, with the original in the Bargello Museum.

Before about 1410 he made the &quot;painted wooden crucifix&quot; now in Santa Croce, which features in a famous story in Vasari. It portrays a very realistic Christ in a moment of agony, eyes, and mouth partially opened, the body contracted in an ungraceful posture. According to the story, Donatello proudly showed it to Brunelleschi, who complained it made Christ look like a peasant, at which Donatello challenged him to do something better; he then produced the Brunelleschi Crucifix. At the time Brunelleschi&#x27;s more classical figure was probably considered to have won the contest, but modern tastes may dispute this.


==&quot;Stiacciato&quot; relief style==
Donatello became famous for his reliefs, especially his development of a very &quot;low&quot; or shallow relief style, called &quot;stiacciato&quot; (literally &quot;flattened-out&quot;), where all parts of the relief are low. This contrasted with the developing technique of other sculptors who included very high and low relief in the same composition, with Ghiberti&#x27;s &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; doors (1424-1451) for the Florence Baptistery a leading example.


Donatello&#x27;s &quot;first milestone&quot; in the technique is his marble &quot;Saint George Freeing the Princess&quot; on the base of his &quot;Saint George&quot; for Orsanmichele. The figures project slightly forward, but &quot;by skilful overlaps are brought back into a tightly-stretched unified skin-plane which is scarcely broken in surface relief to suggest a deep, though not limitless, space&quot;. The relief does not provide a &quot;completely coherent system of perspective&quot; (nor did any Italian work for some five or six years after), but the arcaded hall on the right represents a partial scheme of perspective.

His next major development in this direction was in bronze, still a relatively new medium for him. Ghiberti had been involved from 1417 for a project for the font at the Siena Baptistery; it seems to have been his idea to have six bronze, rather than marble, reliefs, and these were allocated to him, Jacopo della Quercia, and a local father and son team. By 1423 Ghiberti had not even started work, and one relief, &quot;The Feast of Herod&quot; was given to Donatello instead (the overall subject was the life of John the Baptist).

This is placed low, the bottom at about the level of the viewer&#x27;s knee, and the relief allows for that. The composition has figures in three receding planes defined by the architecture. At left Herod recoils in horror as he is presented with John the Baptist&#x27;s head on a platter; to the right of centre Salome is still dancing. In a space behind musicians are playing, and beyond them John&#x27;s head is presented to two figures, one presumably Herodias. It does not represent a full one-point perspective scheme, as there are two vanishing points, perhaps intended to create subliminal impressions of tension and disharmony in the viewer, reflecting the grisly subject.

Other &quot;stiacciato&quot; reliefs include &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot; in the wall-tomb in Sant&#x27;Angelo a Nilo, Naples, (1426-1428, see below), the &quot;Madonna of the Clouds&quot; and &quot;Pazzi Madonna&quot;, both c. 1425−1430 and domestic pieces respectively with and without a carved background, &quot;The Ascension with Christ Giving the Keys to Saint Peter&quot; (1428–30), for an unknown location but in the Medici collection by the end of the century, and a small &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; (perhaps 1426, probably by his workshop).

At all times Donatello and his workshop made more conventional reliefs, at a variety of depths and sizes, and in different materials.

==Partnership with Michelozzo==
Around 1425 Donatello entered into a formal partnership with Michelozzo, who is mainly remembered as an architect, but was also a sculptor, especially of smaller-scale works in metal. He had trained with the mint making dies for coins, where he still had a salaried position. Michelozzo was the younger by about ten years, and they had probably known each other for years. Michelozzo wanted to extract himself from an arrangement with Ghiberti, and Donatello had too much work, and was poor at organizing a workshop, at which Michelozzo seems to have excelled. Both had very good relations with the Medici family and so their powerful supporters. The partnership was very successful, and was renewed until it had lasted for nine years, when a dispute that was mostly the fault of Donatello ended it.

The partnership&#x27;s combination of skills in monumental sculpture and architecture made it well qualified to take on elaborate wall tombs. From 1425 to 1428, they collaborated on the Tomb of Antipope John XXIII in the Florence Baptistery; the executors were Giovanni de&#x27; Medici and Medici supporters. Donatello made the recumbent bronze figure of the deceased, and Michelozzo, with assistants, the several figures in stone. The tomb, elegantly integrating a variety of elements into a narrow vertical space, in a classicizing style, made a great impact and &quot;became the model for the Quattrocento wall-tomb whenever an elaborate or particular impressive expression was wanted&quot; with variations found well into the next century.

After his death in 1427, the partnership took on the funerary monument of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci, a Medici ally, at the church of Sant&#x27;Angelo a Nilo in Naples. The work was done at Pisa on the coast, and the pieces shipped south. A donkey was purchased to help with transport, and in 1426 Donatello had bought a boat to ship marble from Carrara to Pisa. Donatello&#x27;s personal contribution was probably limited to the &quot;Assumption&quot; relief discussed above. Finishing in 1429, for the font at the Baptistery of San Giovanni, Siena, apart from the relief of &quot;The Feast of Herod&quot; (discussed above), he made small bronze statues of &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Hope&quot;, and three small bronze &quot;spiritelli&quot;, naked winged putti-like figures, classical in inspiration, and highly influential on later art.

Images of the &quot;Virgin and Child&quot;, mostly for homes, had long been a staple for Italian painters, and becoming affordable ever lower down the income scale. Now sculptors were producing them as reliefs, in a variety of materials, and with the cheaper terracotta or plaster ones often painted. The attribution of the large numbers of such images is often difficult, especially as the style of Donatello and contemporaries such as Ghiberti continued to be used for them for a long time.

Another type of work for sculptors was coats of arms and other heraldic pieces for the outsides of the &quot;palazzi&quot; of the great families of the city, of which Donatello made a number. Donatello also restored antique sculptures for the Palazzo Medici.

The breakup of the partnership with Michelozzo seems to have been partly precipitated by Donatello&#x27;s delays in doing his part in the commission for an exterior pulpit for Prato Cathedral; highlights in the year at Prato, close to and controlled by Florence, were when the city&#x27;s famous relic, the Girdle of Thomas (&quot;Sacra Cintola&quot;), thought to be the belt the Virgin Mary dropped to Thomas the Apostle as she rose in the air during her Assumption, was displayed to the population from a high pulpit. This took place five times every year, one coinciding with a trade fair that was important for the city&#x27;s economy. The commission began in 1428, but Donatello did not begin work on his allotted areas for years, despite relentless chasing by the Prato authorities, and finally Cosimo de&#x27; Medici.

Donatello&#x27;s reliefs of dancing children for the pulpit, &quot;a veritable bacchanalian dance of half-nude putti, pagan in spirit, passionate in its wonderful rhythmic movement&quot;, were finally delivered in 1438, and it seems that though designed by Donatello, perhaps using his first idea for the Florence &quot;cantoria&quot; frieze (see below), they are not believed to have actually been carved by him. The Prato authorities were unhappy, and the ten years it had taken to get them finished seems to have strained relations with Michelozzo, and the partnership was not renewed in 1434. The two remained on amicable terms, and were to collaborate later. The pulpit reliefs are now replaced by replicas, with the rather weathered originals displayed inside the cathedral.

A factor in the delay was probably Donatello&#x27;s travelling, which increased from about 1430, after a long period of steady work and residence in Florence after his return from Rome in about 1404. In 1430 he worked with Brunelleschi at Lucca on the construction of a defensive dyke and wall, and later in the year visited Pisa, Lucca again and finished the year in Rome, where he spent much of his time until 1433. Some of this travel was to see antiquities, and political difficulties had greatly reduced the flow of commissions in Florence.

Michelozzo was also with Donatello in Rome for some of the time, but the few products there of the visits lead art historians to describe the visits as mainly resulting in studying classical works. It is not clear whether anything was actually made there, or executed in Florence and shipped down. There was probably a large papal commission in view, but if so, nothing resulted. The main surviving piece is a tabernacle surround for Saint Peter&#x27;s in marble relief, 228 cm (89.7 in) high, and now in the museum there. The main figurative sections are a &quot;stiacciato&quot; panel with the &quot;Entombment of Christ&quot;, and a total of sixteen child-angels at various points in the classicising architectural framework. This &quot;first clearly defines the Early Renaissance wall-tabernacle type&quot; and was very influential.

There was also the old-fashioned tomb slab for the cleric Giovanni Crivelli in Santa Maria in Aracoeli, which might well not be attributed to Donatello if he had not signed it. It is not clear whether a workshop was opened in Rome, or if these were carved in Florence and shipped down.

It has been speculated that the visits led to meetings between Donatello and Leon Battista Alberti, then in Rome, and perhaps writing his &quot;De Statua&quot;. There may have been mutual influence, and Donatello seems to have returned from Rome with an interest in a modular system of human proportions. The bronze &quot;David&quot; uses proportions very close to those Alberti recommends.

==Children, putti and &quot;spiritelli&quot;==
In the 1430s and 1440s Donatello made many sculptures of young children dancing, as well as putti (cherubs) and a variant of these traditionally called &quot;spiritelli&quot; (&quot;imps&quot; or &quot;sprites&quot;). Putti were not new in Italian sculpture, but were given a rather unusual prominence by Donatello.

Some early examples are three out of a group of six freestanding bronze &quot;spiritelli&quot; on the cover for the font of the Siena Baptistery (1429), standing over his earlier relief of the &quot;Feast of Herod&quot; discussed above. One dances and two play musical instruments. They have been said to be &quot;the first true free-standing figurines of the Renaissance&quot; and were enormously influential, expressing &quot;what was at the heart of the Renaissance—the classical reborn into the Christian&quot;.

His most famous work in this genre is his relief frieze for the &quot;cantoria&quot; or singing gallery of Florence Cathedral. There are two of these galleries rather high on the walls of the nave. Luca della Robbia had been given the commission for the first in 1431, and Donatello for the second in 1433, with his contract promising 20% higher payment if his were more beautiful than della Robbia&#x27;s.

They develop the style of the Prato pulpit reliefs, the figures &quot;primarily symbols of Dionysiac abandon, and the childish character of their bodies is forgotten in our sense of their liberated animal life. If in a photograph we cover their heads our first glance reveals a Bacchic sarcophagus more intricate and vigorous than anything in antique art; and only on looking more carefully are we aware of their fat tummies and chubby legs&quot;.

Six &quot;spiritelli&quot; in animated conversation crowd at the top of the large classical frame of his Cavalcanti &quot;Annunciation&quot; in Santa Croce, Florence, made for a brother in law of the Medici, c. 1436-1438.

The remarkable bronze statue called the &quot;Amore-Attis&quot;, perhaps from the early 1440s, has one foot in the world of the &quot;spiritelli&quot; and the other in the sensuous eroticism of the bronze &quot;David&quot;. The figure has wings and a tail, stands on a snake, and has a variety of classical attributes, too many for a simple identification. He wears leggings that emphasize rather than hide his private parts. In the 17th century it was taken to be a work of antiquity, despite a clear description of it by Vasari.

==Bronze &quot;David&quot;==
Donatello&#x27;s bronze &quot;David&quot;, now in the Bargello museum, is his most famous work, and the first known free-standing nude statue produced since antiquity. It is conceived fully in the round, independent of any architectural surroundings, and nearly at life-size.

Although the commission is not documented, the statue is first recorded placed on a column in the courtyard of the newly-built Palazzo Medici at a wedding in 1469, but it probably pre-dates the start of that building in 1444. It was most likely commissioned by Cosimo de&#x27; Medici for the older Medici palace on the same street, probably between 1434 and 1440, after Donatello returned from Rome and Cosimo from exile. 

David was well-established as a symbol of the Republic of Florence, victorious in defence against larger surrounding powers, with at this period the Duchy of Milan the most threatening. Though the statue certainly was intended to convey this meaning, it also has a sensuous and erotic power that was original. The many previous Florentine images of David, like Donatello&#x27;s stone &quot;David&quot; of about 1408–09, showed him clothed; here he wears only a hat and boots which, as with the &quot;Amore-Attys&quot;, serve only to accentuate his nudity. 

Donatello&#x27;s &quot;innovation ... is the transformation of the King of Israel into a young Greek god&quot;, in &quot;a work of almost incredible innovation, which nothing else in the art of the time leads us to anticipate ...during the rest of the century in continues to be far beyond the current of contemporary taste.&quot; The figure shows &quot;a real boy whose chest was narrower and flank less rounded than the Greek ideal&quot;, and the &quot;waist is the centre of plastic interest, from which radiate all the other planes of the body&quot;, which became the norm in Renaissance nude sculpture. 

One foot rests casually on the severed head of Goliath, giving the figure a &quot;contrapposto&quot; pose. The feathers of Goliath&#x27;s helmet crest brush against the inside of David&#x27;s thigh, in a further sensuous touch. The &quot;David&quot; and the &quot;Amore-Attis&quot; supplement various pieces of contemporary gossip to suggest Donatello&#x27;s sexual interests.

It seems likely that Donatello&#x27;s homosexuality was well known, and tolerated and protected by the Medici and so others. The main evidence comes from anecdotes in the &quot;Detti piacevoli&quot;, a large collection of celebrity gossip probably compiled around 1480 (but not published until 1548), perhaps by the humanist and poet Angelo Poliziano (1454–1494), a Medici insider as tutor to Lorenzo&#x27;s children. These tell of Donatello surrounding himself with &quot;handsome assistants&quot; and chasing in search of one that had fled his workshop. 

He was said to hire especially beautiful boys, and &quot;stained&quot; them (probably meaning make-up) so that no one else would find them pleasing; when one assistant left after a quarrel, they made up by &quot;laughing&quot; at each other, a slang term for sex. However, no detail is known with certainty about his private life, and unlike many artists (for example Sandro Botticelli) there are no recorded denunciations for sodomy in the Florentine archives, though these are incomplete.

==Wooden statues==

Wood was still used for crucifixes for its lightness. It was also cheap and convenient for carrying it on liturgical processions. Donatello&#x27;s early crucifix for Santa Croce has lowerable arms for this purpose. Wooden sculptures were almost always painted and partly gilded (as terracotta and even marble and bronze often were). 

When a Florentine confraternity in Venice commissioned a statue of John the Baptist, patron saint of Florence, still in the Frari Church there, wood was chosen. The statue is probably the only work by Donatello in the city. He usually did not sign his work, except for some commissions destined for outside Florence. The baptist was signed and dated 1438. Before this was revealed in conservation work it had been dated later, after his stay in Padua, according to the idea that Donatello&#x27;s works became more and more expressive. 

The redating of the &quot;Saint John&quot; had knock-on consequences for a far more celebrated wooden figure, the &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot; long in the Florence Baptistery (now Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo), where the carving style is comparable. This is &quot;formidably expressive&quot; in a stark style found in Donatello&#x27;s last years, and had been dated to around 1456, until the date was found on the other figure; it is now dated generally to the late 1430s, or at any rate before Donatello went to Padua.

According to Kenneth Clark, it shows &quot;a female fakir whose small sunken eyes, gazing across the desert, have beheld the vision of God. Her body is no longer of the least importance to her&quot;. 

In 2020 the painted wooden crucifix of the church of Sant&#x27;Angelo in Legnaia, a suburb of Florence, was attributed by the diocese to Donatello, and dated to the 1460s. This is in a simpler style.

==The Old Sacristy==
The &quot;Sagrestia Vecchia&quot;, as it is now called, of San Lorenzo, Florence was Donatello&#x27;s last major project before his years in Padua, and forms the only large space almost wholly decorated by him. Opinions have varied as to the success of his scheme ever since. The various parts combine experimentation in some places and conservatism in others, and the whole has failed to achieve the iconic status of the rather similar Pazzi Chapel of a few years later, which perhaps learnt the lessons of the sacristy; Luca della Robbia was the sculptor there.

The sacristy was newly built, designed by Brunelleschi, and the first part completed of a major reconstruction of the church by the Medicis. It combined the functions of a Medici funerary chapel, containing the tomb of Giovanni and his wife under the vesting table for the vestments to be laid out; both are still in place. The exact dates of Donatello&#x27;s involvement are unclear, but it is usually placed after the return from exile of the Medicis in 1434, and Donatello&#x27;s departure for Pisa in 1443/44, probably at the end of the 1430s.

Donatello&#x27;s additions were two pairs of bronze doors with relief panels, and elaborate architectural surrounds for them, and two sets of large relief roundels below the main dome. In the pendentives are four scenes from the life of John the Baptist, and at the top of the purely decorative arches in pietra serena are ones of the Four Evangelists, sitting at large desks on which their attributes perch. These are all in painted stucco, the evangelists mostly white on a now rather muddy blue-grey background, with gold highlights for the halos. Three of the scenes from John&#x27;s life have many small figures and complicated architectural settings and backgrounds, while the fourth, set on Patmos, has a landscape background. All use a colour scheme of white for the figures, different shades of a terracotta brown for the settings, and the muddy blue-grey for the sky. There are also two large reliefs of pairs of standing Medici patron saints over the doorways, in the same technique and colours. In different places, the stucco was painted both when wet, in a kind of fresco technique, and when dry.
The bronze doors were relatively small and had a stack of five panels on each door, each containing a pair of standing figures on a plain background, a conservative design, possibly influenced by Early Christian art, such as the doors of Santa Sabina in Rome, or consular diptychs. One pair has the Twelve Apostles with other saints making up the numbers, and the other has martyrs, who in most cases cannot be confidently identified. The execution is again uneven, with much probably done by assistants.

The scheme received criticism, by now rather unusual for Donatello, from very early on. The modelling and execution of some of the reliefs was crude, especially the scenes from John&#x27;s life, and it is often thought that the various added elements distract from the simplicity and harmony of the architecture. The level of detail in the higher reliefs makes them simply hard for the viewer to read from below. According to Antonio Manetti, Brunelleschi&#x27;s biographer, Donatello did not consult the architect about the additions to the doorways at all, such was his &quot;pride and arrogance&quot;.

Filarete, perhaps echoing a comment by Alberti, wrote that the paired figures on the doors looked like fencers; he referred to the apostle doors, though the remark is more fairly applied to the martyrs, most of whom hold thin palm fronds. We do not know how Donatello felt about his finished scheme, but he never used painted stucco again; nor did anyone much else, as within a few years the Della Robbia workshop had perfected painted and glazed terracotta in large pieces, as in the Pazzi Chapel, which was clearly the better technique. The reception of the scheme has been suggested as a factor in Donatello&#x27;s readiness to abandon Florence for a long period.

==In Padua==
===Equestrian Monument of Gattamelata===
In 1443, Donatello was called to Padua by the heirs of the famous condottiere Erasmo da Narni (better known as the , or &#x27;Honey-Cat&#x27;), who had died that year. Designing and planning his &quot;Equestrian Monument of Gattamelata&quot; probably began that year or the next, with the casting mostly done in 1447 or 1448, and the bronze work finished in 1450, although it was not installed on its high stone pedestal until 1453. 

Padua was a prosperous city with a university, long under the control of Venice, and generally friendly to the Medici and their artists; Cosimo had almost certainly given his blessing to Donatello&#x27;s stay. The commission is slightly mysterious; Gattamelata&#x27;s will specified a relatively modest tomb inside the church, where he was indeed buried. It was unexpected that the Venetian government then ordered a grand public monument for a general who had served them for less than a decade, with rather mixed success. The cost, which must have been enormous, was shared by the Venetian government and the family executors, who handled the works, but it is not clear in what proportions. 

A factor may have been a competing commission in nearby Ferrara for an equestrian statue of Niccolò III d&#x27;Este, Marquis of Ferrara, another condottiere, by two Florentine sculptors, one a pupil of Donatello. This was slightly smaller than life-size, with the marquis in civilian dress rather than armour. He had died at the end of 1441, and the monument was in place by 1451, before being destroyed by the French in 1796 (a replica is now in place). 

The Gattamelata was placed on the square outside the Basilica of St Anthony, a famous pilgrimage church (locally called &quot;il Santo&quot;), in ground then used as a cemetery. As with other works outside Florence, it was signed. It is the first life-size equestrian statue since antiquity. Donatello may have seen the Regisole at Ravenna, a late Roman example which was another victim of the French, and he certainly knew the &quot;Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius&quot; (c. 175) in Rome. Donatello&#x27;s work is strongly classicising, with Roman motifs on the armour and saddle (almost impossible to see &quot;in situ&quot;), and the horse perhaps derived from the ancient Horses of Saint Mark in Venice. Andrea del Caldiere, a Paduan metalworker, led the team doing the actual casting for this and his other Paduan bronzes. Other equestrian statues, from the 14th century, had not been executed in bronze and had been placed over tombs rather than erected independently, in a public place. This work became the prototype for other equestrian monuments executed in Italy and Europe in the following centuries.

===Other work in Padua===
Donatello was based in Padua for ten years, though he returned to Florence soon after the &quot;Gattamelata&quot; was finally in place in 1453. He had a studio near the &quot;Santo&quot;, and several assistants. Decades later Padua was for some time the leading Italian centre for small &quot;table bronzes&quot;, which was probably partly a legacy of the stimulus given by Donatello&#x27;s visit. He did not stay in the city the whole time, and he is documented in Florence at some points, and in 1450 is recorded visiting Mantua and Modena for commissions that never came off; in 1451 he was paid by the Bishop of Ferrara for a work he never finished.

In Padua itself, he completed several works for &quot;il Santo&quot;, including the first life-sized bronze crucifix (with a wooden cross, 1444–1449), which originally hung well down the nave. In 1895 it was moved to hang over the high altar, for which Donatello had made a bronze enthroned &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; and six flanking saints, constituting a Holy Conversation, and a total of twenty-one bronze reliefs and one in marble, an &quot;Entombment&quot;. All these were begun in 1446 and nearly complete by June 1450, though some of the statues seem not quite finished, and other sculptors seem to have done some of the work. The four reliefs of scenes from the &quot;Life of Saint Anthony&quot;, with highlights in gold, are of a uniform high standard.

After more than one rearrangement, the first in 1582, the original disposition of the statues is uncertain, but they were probably closer together, in one row, than they are now, with two now placed on a railing below and forward of the others.

The &quot;Madonna and Child Enthroned&quot;, between St. Francis and St. Anthony, in bronze (), portrays the Christ Child being displayed to the faithful by the Madonna, who wears a crown. The Madonna is neither standing nor sitting on the throne but is portrayed in the act of rising. She is flanked by two saints, Anthony of Padua and Francis of Assisi. Shown at the base of her throne, to each side of the Madonna, are sphinxes, allegorical figures of knowledge. On the throne&#x27;s back is a relief of the &quot;Fall of Man&quot;, depicting Adam and Eve.

==In Siena==

Between 1457 and 1461 Donatello was active in and for Siena, though he was now aging, and perhaps mostly contributed designs and &quot;modelli&quot; rather than carving much himself, at least in stone. In 1457 he had received three large commissions for the city, of which only one reached Siena. Firstly there were bronze doors for the cathedral, of which only a possible trial cast of one panel survives (in the Victoria and Albert Museum); the Sienese may have been unable to fund what would have been a very expensive project.

His bronze &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; is an important late work, which ended in a Medici courtyard in Florence, while his bronze &quot;John the Baptist&quot; was delivered minus a forearm and is now in Siena Cathedral. Another commission was a large relief &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (&quot;Madonna delle Grazie&quot;) with blue glass inlays in the surround, completed in 1459, with much of the work done by another, perhaps the local Urbano da Cortona, who had been pushed aside to allow Donatello to have the commission.

The signed &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; is in his late, stark, style, showing the killing in progress, with Judith about to strike a second blow. Relief scenes on the triangular base seem to show the drunken feast and revels that preceded the killing, in a final outing for Donatello&#x27;s sensual mode. However, most of the younger revellers have wings. Donatello used real cloth to give texture in some of the modelling, and perhaps Holofernes&#x27; legs were moulded from a live model. It may have been planned as a fountain, as there are spouts at the corners of the base, though there now seems to be no internal plumbing. When the Medici were expelled in 1494 it and the bronze &quot;David&quot; were moved to the Palazzo della Signoria; the Medici were now intended to be seen as the tyrannical victims rather than the liberating underdogs.

==Last years==
After returning from Siena he remained in Florence until his death in 1466. He was evidently unable to work for a period, of uncertain extent, before his death; Vasari records this, but without any timing. But, with the help of assistants, he embarked on a major project in these years, reliefs that now form two pulpits for San Lorenzo, Florence, the burial place of the Medicis, though it is possible that this was not the function originally intended. They were only assembled in this way in the following century, and the panel sizes vary.

At least the designs of most of these are thought to have by Donatello himself, and the modelling of many parts; the precise attribution of the reliefs remains much discussed. Some appear to have been cast from unfinished &quot;modelli&quot;, and there is considerable stylistic disparity between panels, and sometimes sections of the same panel. The treatment of the spaces in which the scenes are set is especially varied and experimental, part of &quot;the absolutely uncompromising use of every possible means to express emotion and suffering&quot; that marks these works.

==Work involving glass==

Donatello&#x27;s inventiveness and search for new effects is shown by his various, mostly novel, uses of glass, a material hardly used in European sculpture before. He was commissioned to design stained glass for Florence Cathedral around 1434, a conventional task, but one usually given to a painter rather than a sculptor. He used glass in tesserae form in the backgrounds of reliefs, including the Prato pulpit and &quot;cantoria&quot; reliefs, which was an old style, but his background of a network of roundels with glass-covered wax and gold inlays for the terracotta Piot Madonna (Louvre, c. 1440 or later) is original. 

His Chellini Madonna (c. 1450, Victoria and Albert Museum) is a round bronze relief, 28.5 cm across, which is cast at an even thickness, meaning that the reverse has an intaglio (concave) image matching the convex relief one on the front. This seems to have been intended to be used as a mould for molten glass and perhaps other materials. Donatello gave it to his doctor and friend Giovanni Chellini in 1456, though it was probably not new at that point.

==Portraiture==
Other than tomb effigies, there is no sculpture by Donatello that is certainly intended to be a portrait. Some of his early statues of prophets for the cathedral were said to use the features of specific individuals. Donatello probably never saw Gattamelata alive, and may not have had any good image to work from; his figure seems to have a generalized &quot;Caesar-like head&quot; and is &quot;no portrait in the usual sense&quot;, but an &quot;idealized portrait of brute power&quot;. 

During Donatello&#x27;s career, the distinctive Florentine flat-bottomed bust portrait became established and popular among the city&#x27;s elite, led by the Medici. Donatello is only associated with one example, but this may be the earliest. Niccolò da Uzzano was a significant Medici political associate, as well as a banker and humanist, who died in 1431. The painted terracotta bust portrait of him may have been made using a life- or death mask, presumably not very long after his death, at the latest. He is shown wearing an ancient Roman toga, with &quot;uncompromising realism&quot;, but an expression that &quot;exudes sagacious strength and nobility&quot;. However the attribution to Donatello, the dating and foremost the quality of the bust itself are disputed.

==Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;==

Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s life of Donatello in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; was mostly researched in the 1540s, around a century after the events he recounts, and contains some clear and significant errors of fact. It fully recognises Donatello&#x27;s stature as an artist, and lists many works. His knowledge of those in Padua and Siena appears shaky, and may rely on the accounts of others. In his life of Raphael he praises the &quot;beautiful fancy&quot; (&quot;bel capriccio&quot;) of some figures, which Vasari himself later drew on; but he is evidently unaware that Raphael took them from a Donatello church relief in Padua. He also places Donatello&#x27;s birth in 1403, some seventeen years after better-informed modern scholars, aware of the record of the assault in 1401, and payments for work going back to 1406.

Vasari, a fierce Florentine patriot, saw Donatello as the start of Florentine dominance in Renaissance sculpture, and traced a line of succession between him and his hero Michelangelo, via the somewhat dubious link of Bertoldo di Giovanni (d. 1491), a pupil of Donatello and in theory Michelangelo&#x27;s mentor when he ran the informal &quot;garden academy&quot; of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici at the end of his life. Vasari stressed the close ties between Donatello and the Medici, which were certainly important in his life, but also mirrored those Michelangelo and Vasari himself enjoyed.

==Legacy==
Donatello&#x27;s output was so varied and individual that his influence can be seen in all Florentine sculpture in the 15th century, and well beyond Florence. But he shared important elements of his style, in particular his revival of classical forms and styles, with the other outstanding sculptors of his generation, Ghiberti, Jacopo della Quercia, Luca della Robbia and others. Many younger sculptors assisted him, though his workshop relationships are not very well documented, and recent scholarship has cast doubt on many 19th-century claims (some from Vasari) of other sculptors as &quot;pupils&quot; of Donatello. Regular assistants in Donatello&#x27;s later years included Bartolomeo Bellano (from Padua) and Bertoldo di Giovanni.

When he died, the &quot;sweet style&quot; that he had helped to produce decades before, dominated in the work of Florentine sculptors; his &quot;late style, with its boldness of imagination and execution, probably overawed them and seemed incomprehensible and inaccessible&quot;. Only many years later did Verrocchio and Antonio del Pollaiuolo explore similar expressive effects. His periods in Padua and Siena left behind trained bronze-founders and sculptors who made these cities, especially Padua, significant centres in their own right; indeed, in Padua his presence had a great effect on local painting also. Bartolomeo Bellano was back in Padua by 1469, and remained the leading sculptor there, handing the role over to his pupil Andrea Riccio (c. 1470 – 1532) in due course. 

Desiderio da Settignano may have acted as a younger colleague, and was the main other sculptor who could execute shallow reliefs in a way comparable to Donatello. He died in 1464 at just 34, cutting off a very promising career. The shallow relief style was not much used by other sculptors, though Michelangelo&#x27;s early &quot;Madonna of the Stairs&quot; (c. 1490) is an essay in it. Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; (1501) is both &quot;an ode and a challenge to Donatello&quot;.

==Collections==
Most of Donatello&#x27;s major works for churches remain &quot;in situ&quot;, or moved inside to the church museum. The Bargello in Florence has the main museum collection, including his most famous portable pieces. Hardly any large pieces are outside Italy, but there are many &quot;Madonnas&quot; and other smaller pieces, often with uncertain attributions. The Victoria and Albert Museum has important shallow reliefs, and the Louvre and Berlin State Museums other pieces; generally the American museums arrived too late on the scene to make many major acquisitions, though they have many pieces with workshop attributions.

<doc id="69853" wikidata="Q367901" url="?curid=69853" title="Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples">
<text>Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, Prince of Naples (Vittorio Emanuele Alberto Carlo Teodoro Umberto Bonifacio Amedeo Damiano Bernardino Gennaro Maria di Savoia; 12 February 1937 – 3 February 2024), was the only son of Umberto II, the last King of Italy, and Marie-José of Belgium. Vittorio Emanuele also used the title Duke of Savoy and claimed the headship of the House of Savoy. These claims were disputed by supporters of his third cousin, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, and later by Amedeo&#x27;s son, Aimone.

Vittorio Emanuele lived for most of his life in exile, following the 1946 Italian constitutional referendum, which affirmed the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the Italian Republic. On several occasions, he was the centre of controversy in Italy and abroad due to a series of incidents, including remarks that were seen by some as antisemitic. He was revealed to be a member of Propaganda Due (P2), the state within a state responsible for high-level corruption and political manipulation. In France, he was tried on a murder charge, of which he was cleared of unlawful killing but convicted of a firearms offence. Vittorio Emanuele was arrested in 2006 on charges of criminal association, racketeering, conspiracy, corruption, and exploitation of prostitution. He was acquitted of all charges in 2007 and 2010.

==Early life and family==
Vittorio Emanuele was born on 12 February 1937 in Naples to Umberto, Prince of Piedmont, who would later become the last King of Italy as Umberto II, and Princess Marie-José of Belgium. The Italian royal family was exiled from Italy when he was nine years old. He lived in Switzerland from the time he was exiled until his death. Vittorio Emanuele had three sisters, an older sister Princess Maria Pia and two younger sisters, Princess Maria Gabriella and Princess Maria Beatrice. Princess Maria Pia married Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia in 1955, the son of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia and Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark. In 2003, she remarried Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, son of Prince René of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margaret of Denmark and the younger brother of Queen Anne of Romania. Vittorio Emanuele was also a first cousin of the late King Baudouin of Belgium, former King Albert II of Belgium, the late Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse, and Tsar Simeon II of Bulgaria.

After an eleven-year relationship, Vittorio Emanuele married Swiss biscuit heiress and world-ranked water skier Marina Doria in Tehran, Iran, on 7 October 1971. Their wedding was announced on the occasion of the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire. Coincidentally, Vittorio Emanuele and his wife Marina share a birthday (12 February) but Vittorio Emanuele is two years younger than Marina (she was born in 1935).

Vittorio Emanuele worked as a banker and an aircraft salesman, and then an arms dealer.

Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, has a son, Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice, born on 22 June 1972. Emanuele Filiberto married Clotilde Courau in 2003, and they have two daughters together.

===Duke of Savoy===
On 7 July 2006, Vittorio Emanuele&#x27;s kinsman and dynastic rival, Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta declared himself to be the head of the House of Savoy and Duke of Savoy, claiming that Vittorio Emanuele had lost his dynastic rights when he married without the permission of Umberto II in 1971. Amedeo received the support of the President of the &quot;Council of Senators of the Kingdom&quot; Aldo Alessandro Mola and Vittorio Emanuele&#x27;s sister, Maria Gabriella.

Vittorio Emanuele and his son applied for a judicial injunction to forbid Amedeo from using the title &quot;Duke of Savoy&quot;. In February 2010, the court of Arezzo ruled that the Duke of Aosta and his son must pay damages totalling €50,000 to their cousins and cease using the surname &quot;Savoy&quot; instead of &quot;Savoy-Aosta&quot;. However, the verdict was overturned on appeal, with the court of second resort allowing Amedeo the use of the short surname, in the form of di Savoia, and additionally revoking the financial penalty originally imposed on him.

==Exile from and return to Italy==

=== Reasons for exile ===
In line with certain other countries that were formerly monarchies (such as France or Romania), the Italian Constitution required all male members of the House of Savoy to leave Italy and barred them from ever returning to Italian soil again. This was enacted as a &quot;temporary disposition&quot; enacted when the constitution was promulgated in 1948. The constitution also forbade any amendment that would change the republican form of government, effectively foreclosing any effort to restore the monarchy short of adopting a new constitution.

=== Requests for return ===
Vittorio Emanuele lobbied the Parliament of Italy over the years in which the law prohibiting his return was in force, to be allowed to return to his homeland after 56 years in exile. In 1999, he filed a case at the European Court of Human Rights, in which the Prince charged that his lengthy exile violated his human rights. In September 2001, the court decided to hold a hearing on the case at a date to be fixed later.

Before his return to his homeland, he renounced any claim to Italy&#x27;s crown jewels, which were stored in a deposit box at the Bank of Italy. He publicly stated that the crown jewels &quot;are no longer ours&quot;, referring to the House of Savoy. At the time, he hoped that the crown jewels would be publicly displayed. However, the royal family asked for the jewels back in 2021 and sued the Italian government and the Bank of Italy in 2022 when they were not returned.

In February 2002, Vittorio Emanuele and his son Emanuele Filiberto wrote a signed letter, published through a law firm, in which they formally expressed their loyalty to the Constitution of Italy.

=== Return to Italy ===

On 23 October 2002, the provision in the constitution that barred male members of the former royal house from returning to Italy was repealed. As part of a deal with the government, Vittorio Emanuele signed an agreement renouncing all claims to the defunct throne and recognizing the Republic as the only lawful government of Italy. Vittorio Emanuele was permitted to re-enter the country on 10 November 2002. On 23 December 2002, he made his first trip home in over half a century. On the one-day visit he, his wife, and his son had a 20-minute audience with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.

Upon their first visit in 2003 to Naples, where Vittorio Emanuele was born, and from where his family sailed into exile in 1946, the reception of the Savoys was mixed; most people were indifferent to them, some hostile, a few supportive. The media reported that many in Naples were not happy to see the return of the family when hundreds of noisy demonstrators chanted negative slogans as they progressed through the city. Demonstrations were staged by two traditionally opposing factions: anti-monarchists on one hand, and supporters of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, the royal house deposed when Italy was united in 1861 under the House of Savoy.

==Death==
Vittorio Emanuele died in Geneva Cantonal Hospital, Switzerland on 3 February 2024, aged 86. A statement from the Royal House of Savoy gave the time of his death as 07:05 (CET).

His funeral was held on 10 February 2024 in the Turin Cathedral and, afterwards, he was cremated. Attendees at his funeral included his widow Marina, Princess of Naples, his son Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice, his daughter-in-law Princess Clotilde, Princess of Venice, his granddaughter Princess Vittoria, Princess of Carignano, his sister Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Parma, his nephew Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia, Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta, and Princess Olga, Duchess of Aosta, Prince Jean of Luxembourg, the Prince of Monaco, Queen Sofía of Spain, Leka, Prince of Albania, Boris, Prince of Turnovo, Fuad II of Egypt, Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark, Afonso, Prince of Beira, Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, John T. Dunlap, and Daniel McVicar. The ashes were subsequently buried in the Royal Crypt of the Basilica di Superga.

==Controversies==
=== Unilateral declaration of kingship (1969) ===

Vittorio Emanuele unilaterally declared himself King of Italy on 15 December 1969. He argued that by agreeing to submit to a referendum on his place as head of state, his father had thereby abdicated. Vittorio Emanuele took this action after his father allegedly called for Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta to visit him in Portugal to name him his heir. Under his self-assumed powers as King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele conferred the title of Duchess of Sant&#x27;Anna di Valdieri on his then-fiancée, Marina Doria.

=== Dirk Hamer&#x27;s death (1978–2015) ===
On the night of 17 August or the morning of 18 August 1978, on the island of Cavallo (which lies off the south coast of Corsica), Vittorio Emanuele discovered his yacht&#x27;s rubber dinghy had been taken and attached to another nearby yacht. Arming himself with a rifle, he attempted to board the vessel. He shot at a passenger he had awakened; the shot missed the passenger but mortally wounded Dirk Hamer (the 19-year-old son of Ryke Geerd Hamer), a passenger sleeping on the deck of another adjacent yacht. The prince admitted civil liability for the death in a letter dated 28 August 1978. Vittorio Emanuele was arrested and Dirk Hamer later died of his wounds on 7 December 1978 before he could provide any evidence.

On 11 October 1989, Vittorio Emanuele was indicted on charges of inflicting lethal injury and possession of a dangerous weapon. However, on 18 November 1991, after thirteen years of legal proceedings, the Paris Assize Court acquitted him of the fatal wounding and unintentional homicide charges, finding him guilty only of unauthorised possession of an M1 carbine. He received a six-month suspended prison sentence.

When incarcerated in June 2006, on unconnected charges of corruption (see below, Arrest and imprisonment), Vittorio Emanuele was recorded admitting that &quot;I was in the wrong, [...] but I must say I fooled them [the French judges]&quot;, leading to a call from Dirk Hamer&#x27;s sister Birgit for Vittorio Emanuele to be retried in Italy for killing her brother.

Birgit Hamer undertook a long legal fight to obtain the full video. She stated: &quot;What for us is a confession is a boast for him: he laughs about the fact that he killed a boy.&quot; The story of the video was broken by aristocratic journalist Beatrice Borromeo, who also wrote the preface for a book on the murder, by Birgit Hamer. Vittorio Emanuele sued the newspaper for defamation, claiming the video had been manipulated. In 2015, a court judgement ruled in favour of the newspaper. On Twitter Borromeo posted: (&quot;Winning a case is always nice, but against Victor Emmanuel of Savoy the pleasure is double&quot;), which resulted in a spat on Twitter with his son Emanuele Filiberto.

=== Allegations of antisemitism (2003) ===

Vittorio Emanuele also said in 2003 that the antisemitic laws passed under Mussolini&#x27;s regime were &quot;not that terrible&quot;. In response, the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, Amos Luzzatto, stated &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it was he who signed the racial laws in 1938. But, as a Savoy heir, Victor Emmanuel has never distanced himself from them,&quot; in an interview with newspaper.

On 27 January 2005, in a letter published by , Vittorio Emanuele issued an apology to Italy&#x27;s Jewish population, asking forgiveness from the Italian Jewish community, and declaring that it was an error for the Italian Royal Family to have signed the racial laws of 1938.

=== Arrest and imprisonment (2006) ===

On 16 June 2006, Vittorio Emanuele was arrested in Varenna and imprisoned in Potenza on charges of corruption and recruitment of prostitutes for clients of the Casinò di Campione of Campione d&#x27;Italia.

The enquiry was conducted by Italian magistrate John Woodcock, of British ancestry, famous for other VIPs&#x27; arrests.

Woodcock described Emanuele as the &quot;undisputed leader&quot; of an influence-trafficking network associated with Sicilian organized crime.

After several days, Vittorio Emanuele was released and placed under house arrest. He was released from house arrest on 20 July 2006 but had to stay within the borders of Italy. Vittorio Emanuele was acquitted of all charges in the years 2007 and 2010.

 reported in 2006 that Emanuele Filiberto had distanced himself from his father.

===Seeking compensation from Italy (2007)===
In 2007, Vittorio Emanuele and his son, Emanuele Filiberto, requested formally that the state pay financial damages of €260 million, and initiate full restitution of all properties and belongings that had been confiscated from the royal house after the abolition of the monarchy. The financial damages claim is based on having suffered moral injustice during the exile. The Italian government has rejected the request and, in response, indicated that it may seek damages for historic grievances.

==Succession==
In June 2023, his son Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice, announced his intention to renounce his claim to the throne in favour of his daughter, Princess Vittoria of Savoy, when he felt she was ready to succeed. Until he formally does so, he remains as his father&#x27;s heir.

===Patrilineal descent===

<text>The Gambia Armed Forces, also known as the Armed Forces of The Gambia, consists of three branches: the Gambia National Army (GNA), the Gambia Navy, and the Republican National Guard (RNG). It formerly included the Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG) from the 1980s to 1996, when they were moved under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. The commander-in-chief is the president of the Gambia who is currently Adama Barrow, whereas practical control is exercised by the Chief of the Defence Staff who is currently Lieutenant General Yankuba Drammeh.

== History and formation ==

=== Independence to the coup d&#x27;etat (1965–1981) ===
At independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, defence and security in The Gambia was the responsibility of the Field Force. The Field Force was a paramilitary unit of the police, consisting of roughly 140 men at independence and rising to around 500 in 1980. It has been formed in 1958 following the disbandment of the Gambia Regiment, part of the British Army. There was little concern about security in The Gambia due to its small size and the safety provided by being totally surrounded by Senegal, with which it had signed a mutual defence pact in 1965.

This lax attitude to defense changed following the 1981 coup d&#x27;etat. Executed by members of the Field Force and led by radical leftist politician Kukoi Samba Sanyang, the rebels took advantage of President Dawda Jawara being out of the country to execute a coup d&#x27;etat. Having broken into the Field Force armory, the rebels proceeded to release all the prisoners from Mile Two Prison, distributing weapons to those they felt were on their side. The rebels held Jawara&#x27;s wife and children hostage, one of several acts that undermined public support for the coup. As the remaining members of the Field Force opted to remain neutral, Jawara asked for Senegal to intervene. They sent hundreds of soldiers into The Gambia, including airborne and sea assault units. The rebels were defeated four days after the coup began, having cost the lives of 33 Senegalese soldiers and an estimated 500 Gambians, many of whom were innocent civilians.

=== Senegambia Confederation (1981–1989) ===
A few months following the coup, the Kaur Declaration was signed, which created the Senegambia Confederation. A necessary element of this was the formation of a Gambian military, which came into existence following the Gambia Armed Forces Act 1985. Jawara emphasized that the Gambia Armed Forces (GAF) should be kept &quot;as small as possible&quot;. Initially, it consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA) and the Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG). The GNA was composed of new recruits and remnants of the Field Force and was trained by a British Army Training Team (BATT). The GNG was composed of new recruits trained by the Senegalese Gendarmerie, on French lines. The Kaur Agreement also created the Confederal Army, which was two-thirds Senegalese and one-third Gambian, able to deploy anywhere in the Confederation.

Gambian soldiers that formed part of the Confederal Army were paid significantly more than Gambian soldiers in the GAF, which created a feeling of resentment. There were also accusations of widespread corruption and nepotism in the selection process for Gambian Confederal troops from the ranks of the GAF. Gambian soldiers were considered junior to their Senegalese counterparts, and Senegal also contributed far more resources and soldiers to the confederation. Senegalese soldiers were given the key tasks of guarding Banjul airport, the port, and the Gambian president. The confederation collapsed in 1989 over a dispute regarding the rotation of the Confederal presidency. In August, Senegal suddenly removed 300 Senegalese troops from The Gambia without warning, forcing the GAF to make up the difference.

=== Increasing discontent (1990–1994) ===
In 1990, ECOWAS despatched troops to Liberia as part of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). In August, 105 Gambian soldiers deployed to Monrovia, alongside Ghanaian, Nigerian, Guinean, and Sierra Leonean troops. Some in The Gambia questioned the goal of the mission and others doubted the military&#x27;s readiness to participate. During the first deployment, two Gambian soldiers, Corporal Modou Bojang and Private Sama Jawo were killed. This contingent arrived home on 13 April 1991. Two months later, soldiers from the unit mutinied and went on a protest march to the State House, over claims they were owed money from their deployment. Jawara agreed to meet them, paying them the money and promising to look into their other requests. Immediately following the mutiny, the commanding officer (CO) of the GNA, Colonel Momodou Ndow Njie, was dismissed.

Less than a month following the incident, the government announced that the Nigerian Army Training Assistance Group (NATAG) would be arriving to help train and equip the Gambian soldiers. Further to this, the head of NATAG, Colonel Abubakar Dada, was to become the new CO of the GNA, which &quot;shocked&quot; the Gambian soldiers. In the nine months between this announcement and NATAG arriving, in 1992 Gambia suffered another mutiny that was very similar to the first, perpetrated by the second contingent of peacekeepers returning from Liberia. These two mutinies demonstrated the growing sense of distrust in the ranks, primarily from ECOMOG peacekeepers and junior officers who saw that promotions were based on favoritism, eroding their confidence in the hierarchy. Another concern was the extent to which Nigerians had control over the senior ranks.
In 1992, the government disbanded the Gambia National Gendarmerie, which had served to counter the two mutinies in 1991 and 1992. It was merged into a unit in the police called the Tactical Support Group (TSG). This action, according to several former soldiers, caused the 1994 coup d&#x27;etat to be &quot;fait accompli&quot; because there was no one to counter the army. On the morning of 22 July 1994, when Jawara was at his office in the State House, he received a report that armed soldiers were approaching. They far outnumbered the contingent of presidential guards at the State House that day, and so Jawara quickly fled. The mutinying soldiers briefly exchanged fire with the TSG and after overpowering the police, had no trouble in taking over the state. The whole affair was over by midday, with no bloodshed.

=== Military rule and the Jammeh era (1994–2016) ===
Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh was announced as head of the new ruling council, the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC), along with four other junior officers. The initial press release following the coup pointed to &quot;rampant corruption&quot; as its cause. While civilians were appointed to the government positions, decisions were regularly made through military decrees, of which 70 were made in the first two years. After 26 months in power, Jammeh retired from the military and was elected President in 1996. He began to replace the image of him as a military leader with one of him as a religious and spiritual leader.

Jammeh awarded promotions and pay rises to armed forces personnel and improvements were made to the Yundum barracks. The Gambia Army Revolving Loan Scheme was set up to provide cheap loans to soldiers, and military personnel were afforded educational opportunities. The NATAG contingent also left The Gambia following the coup. In addition to this, Jammeh expanded the structure of the armed forces. In 1995, he announced his intention to establish a navy, which was formed in 1997. The Gambia Armed Forces Act 2008 established a national guard, which included several specialized units in its structure. Under Jammeh, the GAF included the Gambia National Army, the Gambia Navy, and the Republican National Guard. A Chief of the Defence Staff was appointed to head the military with the President as its commander-in-chief.

In May 2011, Gambia appointed its first female general, Ramatoulie DK Sanneh.

== Foreign relations ==
The Gambia&#x27;s relations with Taiwan, which began following the coup and lasted until 2013, had a number of material benefits for the military. They regularly trained Gambian troops and offered scholarships at Taiwanese military academies to Gambian officers. They also donated uniforms and high-speed boats as well as funding improvements to military facilities. Turkey was another key defense partner for the GAF, with Turkish trainers involved in training 5000 Gambian troops between 1991 and 2005. Around 60 officers and NCOs were also sent to Turkey for training. The agreement ended in 2005, but a Military Advisory Mechanism remained in place. A new bi-lateral defense agreement with Turkey was signed in 2014.

From 2007 to 2009, the Gambia also hosted a team of military advisors from Pakistan, including Brig. Gen Amir Mumtaz, Captain (Navy) Baber Bilal and Gp. Capt Shakir Qazi. The Pakistan Armed Forces Advisory Mission helped establish frameworks and structures to model the Gambian army and navy. 

The Gambia has also hosted US and British training teams. Since 2006, soldiers of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment of the British Army have deployed bi-annually to the Gambia. In January 2017, they helped train them prior to their deployment to Sudan as part of the peacekeeping operation. It was the site of Exercise African Endeavour in 2011, which was organised by United States Africa Command (US AFRICOM). 

Since 2000, a contingent of Gambian troops have at all times been deployed to peacekeeping activities, first in the ECOWAS Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL) and the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), but since 2004 primarily in the African Union United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). Following the election of Adama Barrow as President of Gambia in 2016, it submitted an application to re-join the Commonwealth of Nations on 22 January 2018 and rejoined on 8 February 2018.

== Organisation ==
=== Leadership ===
*Commander-in-Chief: President Adama Barrow
** Chief of the Defence Staff: Major General Mamat Cham
*** Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff: Major General Yankuba Drammeh
**** Commander, Gambia National Army: Brigadier General Momodou Cham
**** Commander, Gambian Navy: Commodore Madani Senghore
**** Commander, Republican National Guard

=== Branches ===
The Gambia Armed Forces Act 1985 established four branches: the Gambia National Army, the Gambia Navy, the Gambia Air Force, and the Gambia National Gendarmerie. In 1992, the GNG merged to become part of a police unit called the Tactical Support Group. The Air Force was never truly operational. In 2008, a Republican National Guard was founded as an additional branch.

====Gambia National Army====
The strength of the Gambia National Army (GNA) differs depending on the source. It has been given as 1,900 soldiers, 1,000 soldiers, or 900 soldiers. It is said to comprise two infantry battalions, one engineering squadron, and a Presidential Guard company. The army has barracks in Fajara, Yundum, Kudang, and Farafenni. In terms of vehicles and equipment, the army has eight Ferret armoured cars, and four M8 Greyhound armoured cars. It is also said to possess at least one M101 howitzer. Turkey donated Gambia 2 Otokar Cobra-1 infantry mobility vehicles and 2 Katmerciler Hızır MRAP vehicles. In addition to two Cobra-1s, many high-frequency radios, mine detectors, uniforms, winter jackets and similar military equipment were donated to Gambia.

==== Gambia Navy ====
The strength of the Gambian Navy was most recently estimated at approximately 500 personnel. It exists to enforce fishery legislation and regulation, and assistance has been given in that task by the Senegalese Navy. In February 2008, officers of the US Navy helped to install an automatic identification system in the Gambia called the Maritime Security and Safety Information System (MSSIS). In September 2011, a team from the HSV-2 &quot;Swift&quot; docked in Banjul to conduct a two-week intensive training programme for the Navy. In August 2013, Taiwan donated three new patrol vessels to the Gambia to replace the four ageing vessels of the Dvora-class that it donated in 2009.

==== Gambia Air Force ====
The government considered creating a Gambian Air Force in 2002 and sent pilots to be trained by Ukraine. It purchased its first aircraft, a Sukhoi Su-25, from Georgia in 2003. However, it did not go ahead with the programme and did not announce the creation of an air force.

====Republican National Guard====
An amendment to the Gambia Armed Forces Bill in April 2008 included the creation of a new branch of the GAF, the Republican National Guard (NRG).

The NRG is thought to have a strength of 50 personnel and is made up of a State Guard unit, a Special Forces unit, and a Presidential Guard unit.

=== Independent formations ===
*The Gambia National Army Band is the military band of the GAF. It was formed in 1998 by Major Momodou Dibba. It is the successor to the former Gambia Defence Force Band. It consists of 15 soldiers. In July 2001, it released an album called &quot;Afingjang&quot; which was recorded by Ndaabi studios in Serekunda. In November 2010, the band hosted the United States Navy Band at the Buffer Zone in Tallinding.
*The Child Welfare Unit was founded in 2007 and is responsible for ensuring the protection of children by the military. It is partnered with the child protection services of ECOWAS states.
*Joint Officer&#x27;s Mess

==Missions==

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the Gambia has contributed troops to a number of peacekeeping operations:

* Since 1997, the Gambia has sent peacekeeping forces to the following places: Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Timor Leste, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Liberia, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Sudan, Burundi, Darfur, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Chad.
* The Gambia has contributed over 200 troops per year to African Union missions from 2005 to 2007.
* The Gambia contributed to an ECOWAS mission in 2003, sending over 150 troops.
* Former President Jammeh also contributed over 100 troops to UN missions in 2003 and 2004 (over 100 troops each year), and over 200 troops from 2008 to 2010

<text>The Gambia followed a formal policy of non-alignment throughout most of former President Dawda Jawara&#x27;s tenure. It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia&#x27;s relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States. Starting in 1995, President Yahya Jammeh established diplomatic relations with several additional countries, including Libya, the Republic of China (on Taiwan, before 2013), and Cuba. As scholars on Gambia&#x27;s foreign policy have argued, throughout Jammeh&#x27;s period, the country&#x27;s foreign policy was a shifting sand, with little of direction. 

Amat Jeng, a scholar on Gambia&#x27;s foreign policy, argues that &quot;The Gambia under Jammeh was not constrained by the bureaucratic hurly-burly which characterizes the foreign policy terrain of big democracies. In The Gambia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) had, on several occasions, been left in a vacuum, thereby placing it under the Office of the President. Between 1997 and 2013, the MFA had been occupied by more than 18 different ministers in more than 20 sworn-in occasions. This qualifies the argument that Jammeh had always had the power to fire ministers at will. In North Korea, the MFA has been occupied only by ten different foreign ministers since 1948.&quot; During Yahya Jammeh&#x27;s presidency, The Gambia&#x27;s foreign relations were characterized by a mix of isolationism, confrontational diplomacy, and strategic alliances. Jammeh&#x27;s regime frequently clashed with Western nations over human rights issues, resulting in strained relations with the European Union and the United States. He often pursued alliances with non-Western countries, such as China, Iran, and Libya, to counterbalance Western influence and gain economic support. His administration also pulled The Gambia out of the Commonwealth in 2013, accusing the organization of neo-colonialism. Jammeh&#x27;s unpredictable and authoritarian leadership style made Gambia&#x27;s foreign policy under his rule highly controversial and often isolated the country on the international stage.

Despite these tensions, Jammeh&#x27;s government engaged in regional diplomacy within West Africa, maintaining membership in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), though relations with neighboring Senegal were often tense due to border disputes and differing political stances. Jammeh&#x27;s erratic foreign policy choices ultimately contributed to The Gambia&#x27;s diplomatic isolation until his ouster in 2017.

During his last years, the EU grew increasingly intolerant of Jammeh&#x27;s iron-fist rule. Consequently, Brussels withheld millions of Euros to The Gambia. Jammeh fired back by expelling the EU&#x27;s top diplomat in the country after he had accused the bloc and human rights activists of conniving to besmirch the image of his government for its stance on homosexuality.

The Gambia was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from its independence in 1965 until its withdrawal in October 2013.

After presidential elections in 2016, the winning candidate Adama Barrow promised to return The Gambia to the Commonwealth. On 14 February 2017, The Gambia began the process of returning and formally presented its application to re-join to Secretary-General Patricia Scotland on 22 January 2018. Boris Johnson, who became the first British Foreign Secretary to visit The Gambia since the country gained independence in 1965, announced that the British government welcomed The Gambia&#x27;s return to the Commonwealth.

<doc id="69861" wikidata="Q104027" url="?curid=69861" title="Kirk Douglas">
<text>Kirk Douglas (born Issur Danielovitch; December 9, 1916 – February 5, 2020) was an American actor and filmmaker. After an impoverished childhood, he made his film debut in &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war films. During his career, he appeared in more than 90 films and was known for his explosive acting style. He was named by the American Film Institute the 17th-greatest male star of Classic Hollywood cinema.

Douglas played an unscrupulous boxing hero in &quot;Champion&quot; (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. His other early films include &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947); &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (1950), playing opposite Lauren Bacall and Doris Day; &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (1951); and &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1951), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. He received his second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), opposite Lana Turner, and earned his third for portraying Vincent van Gogh in &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), a role for which he won the Golden Globe for the Best Actor in a Drama. He also starred with James Mason in the adventure &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), a large box-office hit.

In September 1949 at the age of 32, he established Bryna Productions, which began producing films as varied as &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957) and &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960). In those two films, he collaborated with the then relatively unknown director Stanley Kubrick, taking lead roles in both films. Douglas helped to break the Hollywood blacklist by having Dalton Trumbo write &quot;Spartacus&quot; with an official on-screen credit. He produced and starred in &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (1962) and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), the latter opposite Burt Lancaster, with whom he made seven films. In 1963, he starred in the Broadway play &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, a story that he purchased and later gave to his son Michael Douglas, who turned it into an Oscar-winning film. Douglas continued acting into the 1980s, appearing in such films as &quot;Saturn 3&quot; (1980), &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (1980), &quot;Tough Guys&quot; (1986), a reunion with Lancaster, and in the television version of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1988) plus in an episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; in 2000, for which he received his third nomination for an Emmy Award.

As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas received an Academy Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he wrote ten novels and memoirs. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife, producer Anne Buydens, until his death in 2020. A centenarian, Douglas was one of the last surviving stars of the film industry&#x27;s Golden Age.

==Early life and education==
Douglas was born Issur Danielovitch in Amsterdam, New York, on December 9, 1916, the fourth of seven children and the only son of Bryna &quot;Bertha&quot; (née Sanglel) and Herschel &quot;Harry&quot; Danielovitch. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mogilev Governorate, in the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus), and the family spoke Yiddish at home. His sisters were: Pesha &quot;Bessie&quot;, Kaleh &quot;Katherine&quot;, Tamara &quot;Mary&quot;, Siffra &quot;Frieda&quot;, Haska &quot;Ida&quot;, and Rachel &quot;Ruth&quot;. Douglas embraced his Jewish heritage after a near-fatal helicopter crash at the age of 74.

His father&#x27;s brother, who had immigrated earlier, used the surname Demsky, which Douglas&#x27;s family adopted in the United States. Douglas grew up as Izzy Demsky and legally changed his name to Kirk Douglas before entering the United States Navy during World War II.

In his 1988 autobiography, &quot;The Ragman&#x27;s Son&quot;, Douglas notes the hardships that he, along with his parents and six sisters, endured during their early years in Amsterdam:


Douglas had an unhappy childhood, living with an alcoholic, physically abusive father. While his father drank up what little money they had, Douglas and his mother and sisters endured &quot;crippling poverty&quot;.

Douglas first wanted to be an actor after he recited &quot;The Red Robin of Spring&quot;, a poem by the English poet John Clare, while in kindergarten and received applause. Growing up, he sold snacks to mill workers to earn enough to buy milk and bread to help his family. He later delivered newspapers, and he had more than forty jobs during his youth before becoming an actor. He found living in a family with six sisters to be stifling: &quot;I was dying to get out. In a sense, it lit a fire under me.&quot; After appearing in plays at Amsterdam High School, from which he graduated in 1934, he knew he wanted to become a professional actor. Unable to afford the tuition, Douglas talked his way into the dean&#x27;s office at St. Lawrence University and showed him a list of his high school honors. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1939. He received a loan which he paid back by working part-time as a gardener and a janitor. He was a standout on the school&#x27;s wrestling team and wrestled one summer in a carnival to make money. He later became good friends with world-champion wrestler Lou Thesz.

Douglas&#x27;s acting talents were noticed at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, which gave him a special scholarship. One of his classmates was Betty Joan Perske (later known as Lauren Bacall), who would play an important role in launching his film career. Bacall wrote that she &quot;had a wild crush on Kirk&quot;, and they dated casually. Another classmate, and a friend of Bacall&#x27;s, was aspiring actress Diana Dill, who would later become Douglas&#x27;s first wife.

During their time together, Bacall learned Douglas had no money and that he once spent the night in jail since he had no place to sleep. She once gave him her uncle&#x27;s old coat to keep warm: &quot;I thought he must be frozen in the winter ... He was thrilled and grateful.&quot; Sometimes, just to see him, she would drag a friend or her mother to the restaurant where he worked as a busboy and waiter. He told her his dream was to someday bring his family to New York to see him on stage. During that period she fantasized about someday sharing her personal and stage lives with Douglas, but would later be disappointed: &quot;Kirk did not really pursue me. He was friendly and sweet—enjoyed my company—but I was clearly too young for him,&quot; the eight-years-younger Bacall later wrote.

==Career==

===Rise to stardom===
Douglas joined the United States Navy in 1941, shortly after the United States entered World War II, where he served as a communications officer in anti-submarine warfare aboard USS &quot;PC-1139&quot;. He was medically discharged in 1944 for injuries sustained from the premature explosion of a depth charge. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade).

After the war, Douglas returned to New York City and found work in radio, theater, and commercials. In his radio work, he acted in network soap operas and saw those experiences as being especially valuable, as skill in using one&#x27;s voice is important for aspiring actors; he regretted that later the same avenues became no longer available. His stage break occurred when he took over the role played by Richard Widmark in &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; (1943), which then led to other offers.

Douglas had planned to remain a stage actor until his friend Lauren Bacall helped him get his first film role by recommending him to producer Hal B. Wallis, who was looking for a new male talent. Wallis&#x27;s film &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck became Douglas&#x27; debut screen appearance. He played a young, insecure man stung by jealousy, whose life was dominated by his ruthless wife, and who hid his feelings with alcohol. It would be the last time that Douglas portrayed a weakling in a film role. Reviewers of the film noted that Douglas already projected qualities of a &quot;natural film actor&quot;, with the similarity of this role with later ones explained by biographer Tony Thomas:

In 1947, Douglas appeared in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (UK: &quot;Build My Gallows High&quot;), playing a large supporting role in this classic noir thriller starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer. Douglas made his Broadway debut in 1949 in &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, produced by Katharine Cornell. The month after &quot;Out of the Past&quot; was released, &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, the first film teaming Douglas with Burt Lancaster, presented Douglas playing a supporting part quite similar to his role in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; in another classic fast-paced noir thriller.

Douglas&#x27; image as a tough guy was established in his eighth film, &quot;Champion&quot; (1949), after producer Stanley Kramer chose him to play a selfish boxer. In accepting the role, he took a gamble, however, since he had to turn down an offer to star in a big-budget MGM film, &quot;The Great Sinner&quot;, which would have earned him three times the income. Melvyn Douglas played the third-billed (above the title) part Kirk Douglas passed on. &quot;The Great Sinner&quot; flopped.

Film historian Ray Didinger says Douglas &quot;saw &quot;Champion&quot; as a greater risk, but also a greater opportunity ... Douglas took the part and absolutely nailed it.&quot; Frederick Romano, another sports film historian, described Douglas&#x27;s acting as &quot;alarmingly authentic&quot;:


Douglas received his first Academy Award nomination, and the film earned six nominations in all. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a stark, realistic study of the boxing rackets.&quot;

After &quot;Champion&quot; he decided that, to succeed as a star, he needed to ramp up his intensity, overcome his natural shyness, and choose stronger roles. He later stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be much of an actor without vanity. And I&#x27;m not interested in being a &#x27;modest actor&#x27;&quot;. Early in his Hollywood career, Douglas demonstrated his independent streak and broke his studio contracts to gain total control over his projects, forming his own movie company, Bryna Productions (named after his mother) in September 1949.

===Peak years of success===

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas was a major box-office star, playing opposite some of the leading actresses of that era. He portrayed a frontier peace officer in his first western, &quot;Along the Great Divide&quot; (1951). He quickly became very comfortable with riding horses and playing gunslingers, and he appeared in many Westerns. He considered &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (1962), in which he plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, his personal favorite. The film, written by Dalton Trumbo, was respected by critics but did not do well at the box office due to poor marketing and distribution.

In 1950, Douglas played Rick Martin in &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot;, based on a novel of the same name by Dorothy Baker based on the life of jazz cornetist Bix Beiderbecke. Composer and pianist Hoagy Carmichael, a friend of the real Beiderbecke, played the sidekick, adding realism to the film and giving Douglas insight into the role. Doris Day starred as Jo, a young woman who was infatuated with the struggling jazz musician. This was strikingly opposite of the real-life account in Doris Day&#x27;s autobiography, which described Douglas as &quot;civil but self-centered&quot; and the film as &quot;utterly joyless&quot;. During filming, bit actress Jean Spangler disappeared, and her case remains unsolved. On October 9, 1949, Spangler&#x27;s purse was found near the Fern Dell entrance to Griffith Park in Los Angeles. There was an unfinished note in the purse addressed to a &quot;Kirk,&quot; which read:
&quot;Can&#x27;t wait any longer, Going to see Dr. Scott. It will work best this way while mother is away&quot;. Douglas, married at the time, called the police and told them he was not the Kirk mentioned in the note. When interviewed via telephone by the head of the investigating team, Douglas stated that he had &quot;talked and kidded with her a bit&quot; on set, but that he had never been out with her. Spangler&#x27;s girlfriends told police that she was three months pregnant when she disappeared, and scholars such as Jon Lewis of Oregon State University have speculated that she may have been considering an illegal abortion.

In 1951, Douglas starred as a newspaper reporter anxiously looking for a big story in &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot;, director Billy Wilder&#x27;s first effort as both writer and producer. The subject and story was controversial at the time, and U.S. audiences stayed away. Some reviews saw it as &quot;ruthless and cynical ... a distorted study of corruption, mob psychology and the free press.&quot; Possibly it &quot;hit too close to home&quot;, said Douglas. It won a Best Foreign Film award at the Venice Film Festival. The film&#x27;s stature has increased in recent years, with some surveys placing it in their Top 500 Films list. Woody Allen considers it one of his favorite films. As the film&#x27;s star and protagonist, Douglas is credited for the intensity of his acting. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;his focus and energy ... is almost scary. There is nothing dated about Douglas&#x27; performance. It&#x27;s as right-now as a sharpened knife.&quot; Biographer Gene Philips noted that Wilder&#x27;s story was &quot;galvanized&quot; by Douglas&#x27;s &quot;astounding performance&quot; and no doubt was a factor when George Stevens, who presented Douglas with the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1991, said of him: &quot;No other leading actor was ever more ready to tap the dark, desperate side of the soul and thus to reveal the complexity of human nature.&quot;

Also in 1951, Douglas starred in &quot;Detective Story&quot;, nominated for four Academy Awards, including one for Lee Grant in her debut film. Grant said Douglas was &quot;dazzling, both personally and in the part. ... He was a big, big star. Gorgeous. Intense. Amazing.&quot; To prepare for the role, Douglas spent days with the New York Police Department and sat in on interrogations. Reviewers recognized Douglas&#x27;s acting qualities, with Bosley Crowther describing Douglas as &quot;forceful and aggressive as the detective&quot;.

In &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), another of his three Oscar-nominated roles, Douglas played a hard-nosed film producer who manipulates and uses his actors, writers, and directors. In 1954 Douglas starred as the titular character in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, a film based on Homer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Odyssey&quot;, with Silvana Mangano as Penelope and Circe, and Anthony Quinn as Antinous.

In &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), Douglas showed that in addition to serious, driven characters, he was adept at roles requiring a lighter, comic touch. In this adaptation of the Jules Verne novel, he played a happy-go-lucky sailor who was the opposite in every way to the brooding Captain Nemo (James Mason). The film was one of Walt Disney&#x27;s most successful live-action movies and a major box-office hit. Douglas managed a similar comic turn in the western &quot;Man Without a Star&quot; (1955) and in &quot;For Love or Money&quot; (1963). He showed further diversity in one of his earliest television appearances. He was a musical guest (as himself) on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; (1954).

In 1955, Douglas was finally able to get his film production company, Bryna Productions, off the ground. To do so, he had to break contracts with Hal B. Wallis and Warner Bros., but he began to produce and star in his own films, starting with &quot;The Indian Fighter&quot; in 1955. Through Bryna, he produced and starred in the films &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957), &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), &quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; (1962), and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964). In 1958, Douglas formed the music publishing company Peter Vincent Music Corporation, a Bryna Productions subsidiary. Peter Vincent Music was responsible for publishing the soundtracks of &quot;The Vikings&quot; and &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

While &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; did not do well at the box office, it has since become one of the great anti-war films, and it is one of director Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s early films. Douglas, a fluent French speaker, portrayed a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from facing a firing squad. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas&#x27;s &quot;seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men.&quot; The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some large problems, one of which was Kubrick&#x27;s rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: &quot;I called Stanley to my room ... I hit the ceiling. I called him every four-letter word I could think of ... &#x27;I got the money, based on &quot;that&quot; [original] script. Not this shit!&#x27; I threw the script across the room. &#x27;We&#x27;re going back to the original script, or we&#x27;re not making the picture.&#x27; Stanley never blinked an eye. We shot the original script. I think the movie is a classic, one of the most important pictures—possibly the &quot;most&quot; important picture—Stanley Kubrick has ever made.&quot;

Douglas played military men in numerous films, with varying nuance, including &quot;Top Secret Affair&quot; (1957), &quot;Town Without Pity&quot; (1961), &quot;The Hook&quot; (1963), &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), &quot;Heroes of Telemark&quot; (1965), &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965), &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot; (1966), &quot;Is Paris Burning&quot; (1966), &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980), and &quot;Saturn 3&quot; (1980). His acting style and delivery made him a favorite with television impersonators such as Frank Gorshin, Rich Little, and David Frye.

His role as Vincent van Gogh in &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), directed by Vincente Minnelli and based on Irving Stone&#x27;s bestseller, was filmed mostly on location in France. Douglas was noted not only for the veracity of van Gogh&#x27;s appearance but for how he conveyed the painter&#x27;s internal turmoil. Some reviewers consider it the most famous example of the &quot;tortured artist&quot; who seeks solace from life&#x27;s pain through his work. Others see it as a portrayal not only of the &quot;painter-as-hero&quot;, but a unique presentation of the &quot;action painter&quot;, with Douglas expressing the physicality and emotion of painting, as he uses the canvas to capture a moment in time.

Douglas was nominated for an Academy Award for the role, with his co-star Anthony Quinn winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as Paul Gauguin, van Gogh&#x27;s friend. Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: &quot;He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness.&quot; Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a painful experience: &quot;Not only did I look like Van Gogh, I was the same age he was when he committed suicide.&quot; His wife said he often remained in character in his personal life: &quot;When he was doing &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, he came home in that red beard of Van Gogh&#x27;s, wearing those big boots, stomping around the house—it was frightening.&quot;

In general, however, Douglas&#x27;s acting style fit well with Minnelli&#x27;s preference for &quot;melodrama and neurotic-artist roles&quot;, writes film historian James Naremore. He adds that Minnelli had his &quot;richest, most impressive collaborations&quot; with Douglas, and for Minnelli, no other actor portrayed his level of &quot;cool&quot;: &quot;A robust, athletic, sometimes explosive player, Douglas loved stagy rhetoric, and he did everything passionately.&quot; Douglas had also starred in Minnelli&#x27;s film &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; four years earlier, for which he received a Best Actor Oscar nomination.

===Financial troubles===
For approximately 15 years and 27 films, Douglas&#x27;s agent had been Sam Norton, who was compensated with 10% of Douglas&#x27;s gross earnings. In addition, Norton was partners with Jerome “Jerry” B. Rosenthal in the law firm of Rosenthal &amp; Norton which received an additional 10%. On the day of his wedding in 1958 his bride Anne had been quietly pulled aside by Norton and been presented by Norton (without Kirk Douglas&#x27;s knowledge) with a pre-nuptial agreement. She signed the document, but Douglas, because he held Norton as both his best friend and a father figure, was unwilling to get involved in his wife&#x27;s subsequent attempts to obtain a copy. Anne Douglas went behind her husband&#x27;s back, engaging lawyer Greg Bautzer and suing to obtain a copy from Norton successfully. Her distrust of Norton grew, especially as he had been granted power of attorney, and she found that the pre-nuptial agreement meant that she and their children had no claim on Douglas&#x27;s estate until they had been married for five years. She could also find no documentation to prove Norton&#x27;s assertion that Douglas was a millionaire. Her suspicions were further aroused when the Broadway play &quot;A Very Special Baby&quot; for which Norton had convinced Douglas to guarantee financing, closed after only a week. She shared her concerns first with Greg Bautzer and then Edward Lewis who advised her to hire Price Waterhouse to investigate her husband&#x27;s finances.

Douglas returned from filming &quot;The Devils Disciple&quot; in England in late 1958, and was presented with the results of Price Waterhouse&#x27;s audit which detailed that the 18 months he had recently spent overseas on the advice of Norton did not qualify for a tax-free income break, that the investments he had been advised to make in fact had been channeled through dummy companies owned by his agent. As a result, Douglas had no money and owed the IRS $750,000. Douglas engaged a new lawyer and was able to get Rosenthal &amp; Norton to give up their rights to any interest in his latest film &quot;The Vikings&quot; and any of his future income. Norton was dismissed as his agent, but as he had put nearly all of his assets in his wife&#x27;s name, Douglas was only able to recover $200,000 from him.

The profits from &quot;The Vikings&quot; allowed Douglas to pay off his IRS debt, with his financial future now dependent on the success of &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

===&quot;Spartacus&quot; and mid-career===
In 1960, Douglas played the title role in what many consider his career-defining appearance as the Thracian gladiator slave rebel Spartacus with an all-star cast in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960). He was the executive producer as well, which increased the $12 million production cost and made &quot;Spartacus&quot; one of the most expensive films up to that time. Douglas initially selected Anthony Mann to direct, but replaced him early on with Stanley Kubrick, with whom he had previously collaborated in &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;.

When the film was released, Douglas gave full credit to its screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo, who was on the Hollywood blacklist, and thereby effectively ended it. During a 2012 interview Douglas said, &quot;I&#x27;ve made over 85 pictures, but the thing I&#x27;m most proud of is breaking the blacklist.&quot; The film&#x27;s producer, Edward Lewis, and the family of Dalton Trumbo publicly disputed Douglas&#x27;s claim. In the film &quot;Trumbo&quot; (2015), Douglas is portrayed by Dean O&#x27;Gorman.

Douglas bought the rights to stage a play of the novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; from its author, Ken Kesey. He mounted a play from the material in 1963 in which he starred and that ran on Broadway for five months. Reviews were mixed. Douglas retained the movie rights due to an innovative loophole of basing the rights on the play rather than the novel, despite Kesey&#x27;s objections, but after a decade of being unable to find a producer he gave the rights to his son, Michael. In 1975, the film version was produced by Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz, and starred Jack Nicholson, as Douglas was then considered too old to play the character as written. The film won all five major Academy Awards, only the second film to do so (after &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; in 1934).

Douglas made seven films over four decades with actor Burt Lancaster: &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; (1947), &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1959), &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (1963), &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (1976), and &quot;Tough Guys&quot; (1986), which fixed the notion of the pair as something of a team in the public imagination. Douglas was always billed under Lancaster in these movies, but, with the exception of &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; and, even more so, &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (where Lancaster&#x27;s part is just a cameo appearance, while Douglas plays the film&#x27;s villain), their roles were usually of a similar size. Both actors arrived in Hollywood at about the same time and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.

John Frankenheimer, who directed the political thriller &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; in 1964, had not worked well with Lancaster in the past and originally did not want him in this film. However, Douglas thought Lancaster would fit the part and &quot;begged me to reconsider,&quot; said Frankenheimer, and he then gave Lancaster the most colorful role. &quot;It turns out that Burt Lancaster and I got along magnificently well on the picture,&quot; he later said.

In 1967 Douglas starred with John Wayne in the western film directed by Burt Kennedy titled &quot;The War Wagon&quot;.

In &quot;The Arrangement&quot; (1969), a drama directed by Elia Kazan and based upon his novel of the same title, Douglas starred as a tormented advertising executive, with Faye Dunaway as costar. The film did poorly at the box office, receiving mostly negative reviews. Dunaway believed many of the reviews were unfair, writing in her biography, &quot;I can&#x27;t understand it when people knock Kirk&#x27;s performance, because I think he&#x27;s terrific in the picture,&quot; adding that &quot;he&#x27;s as bright a person as I&#x27;ve met in the acting profession.&quot; She says that his &quot;pragmatic approach to acting&quot; would later be a &quot;philosophy that ended up rubbing off on me.&quot;

===Later work===
In the 1970s, he starred in films such as &quot;There Was a Crooked Man...&quot; (1970), &quot;A Gunfight&quot; (1971), &quot;The Light at the Edge of the World&quot; (1971). and &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978). He made his directorial debut in &quot;Scalawag.&quot; (1973), and subsequently also directed &quot;Posse&quot; (1975), in which he starred alongside Bruce Dern.

In 1980, he starred in &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, playing the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Nimitz&quot;, which travels through time to the day before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. It was produced by his son Peter Douglas. He also played in a dual role in &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (1982), an Australian film which received critical acclaim and numerous awards.

In 1986, he reunited with his longtime co-star, Burt Lancaster, in a crime comedy, &quot;Tough Guys&quot;, with a cast including Charles Durning and Eli Wallach. It marked the final collaboration between Douglas and Lancaster, completing a partnership of more than 40 years. That same year, he co-hosted (with Angela Lansbury) the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. The symphony was conducted by Zubin Mehta.

In 1988, Douglas starred in a television adaptation of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, opposite Jason Robards and Jean Simmons. The film won two Emmy Awards. In the 1990s, Douglas continued starring in various features. Among them was &quot;The Secret&quot; in 1992, a television movie about a grandfather and his grandson who both struggle with dyslexia. That same year, he played the uncle of Michael J. Fox in a comedy, &quot;Greedy&quot;. He appeared as the Devil in the video for the Don Henley song &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot;. In 1996, after suffering a severe stroke at age 79 which impaired his ability to speak, Douglas still wanted to make movies. He underwent years of voice therapy and made &quot;Diamonds&quot; in 1999, in which he played an old professional boxer who was recovering from a stroke. It co-starred his longtime friend from his early acting years, Lauren Bacall.

In 2003, Michael and Joel Douglas produced &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot;, which along with Kirk starred various family members, including Michael, Michael&#x27;s son Cameron, and his wife from 50 years earlier, Diana Dill, playing his wife. His final feature-film appearance was in the 2004 Michael Goorjian film &quot;Illusion&quot;, in which he depicts a dying film director forced to watch episodes from the life of a son he had refused to acknowledge. His last screen role was the TV movie &quot;Empire State Building Murders&quot;, which was released in 2008. In March 2009, at the age of 92, Douglas performed an autobiographical one-man show, &quot;Before I Forget&quot;, at the Center Theatre Group&#x27;s Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, California. The four performances were filmed and turned into a documentary that was first screened in January 2010.

On December 9, 2016, he celebrated his 100th birthday at the Beverly Hills Hotel, joined by several of his friends, including Don Rickles, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg, along with Douglas&#x27;s wife Anne, his son Michael and his daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones. Douglas was described by his guests as still being in good shape, able to walk with confidence into the Sunset Room for the celebration.

Douglas appeared at the 2018 Golden Globes with his daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones, a rare public appearance in the final decade of his life. He received a standing ovation and helped Zeta-Jones present the award for &quot;Best Screenplay – Motion Picture&quot;.

==Style and philosophy of acting==

Douglas stated that the keys to acting success are determination and application: &quot;You must know how to function and how to maintain yourself, and you must have a love of what you do. But an actor also needs great good luck. I have had that luck.&quot; Douglas had great vitality and explained that &quot;it takes a lot out of you to work in this business. Many people fall by the wayside because they don&#x27;t have the energy to sustain their talent.&quot;

That attitude toward acting became evident with &quot;Champion&quot; (1949). From that one role, writes biographer John Parker, he went from stardom and entered the &quot;superleague&quot;, where his style was in &quot;marked contrast to Hollywood&#x27;s other leading men at the time&quot;. His sudden rise to prominence is explained by comparing it to that of Jack Nicholson&#x27;s:

As a producer, Douglas had a reputation of being a compulsively hard worker who expected others to exude the same level of energy. As such, he was typically demanding and direct in his dealing with people who worked on his projects, with his intensity spilling over into all elements of his film-making. This was partly due to his high opinion of actors, movies, and moviemaking: &quot;To me it is the most important art form—it &quot;is&quot; an art, and it includes all the elements of the modern age.&quot; He also stressed prioritizing the entertainment goal of films over any messages, &quot;You can make a statement, you can say something, but it must be entertaining.&quot;

As an actor, he dived into every role, dissecting not only his own lines but all the parts in the script to measure the rightness of the role, and he was willing to fight with a director if he felt justified. Melville Shavelson, who produced and directed &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot; (1966), said that it didn&#x27;t take him long to discover what his main problem was going to be in directing Douglas:


For most of his career, Douglas enjoyed good health and what seemed like an inexhaustible supply of energy. He attributed much of that vitality to his childhood and pre-acting years: &quot;The drive that got me out of my hometown and through college is part of the makeup that I utilize in my work. It&#x27;s a constant fight, and it&#x27;s tough.&quot; His demands on others, however, were an expression of the demands he placed on himself, rooted in his youth. &quot;It took me years to concentrate on being a human being—I was too busy scrounging for money and food, and struggling to better myself.&quot;

Actress Lee Grant, who acted with him and later filmed a documentary about him and his family, notes that even after he achieved worldwide stardom, his father would not acknowledge his success. He said &quot;nothing. Ever.&quot; Douglas&#x27;s wife, Anne, similarly attributes the energy he devotes to acting to his tough childhood:

Douglas has credited his mother, Bryna, for instilling in him the importance of &quot;gambling on yourself&quot;, and he kept her advice in mind when making films. Bryna Productions was named in her honor. Douglas realized that his intense style of acting was something of a shield: &quot;Acting is the most direct way of escaping reality, and in my case it was a means of escaping a drab and dismal background.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Personality===
In &quot;The Ragman&#x27;s Son&quot;, Douglas described himself as a &quot;son of a bitch,&quot; adding, &quot;I&#x27;m probably the most disliked actor in Hollywood. And I feel pretty good about it. Because that&#x27;s me... . I was born aggressive, and I guess I&#x27;ll die aggressive.&quot; Co-workers and associates alike noted similar traits, with Burt Lancaster once remarking, &quot;Kirk would be the first to tell you that he is a very difficult man. And I would be the second.&quot; Douglas&#x27;s brash personality is attributed to his difficult upbringing living in poverty and his aggressive alcoholic father who was neglectful of Kirk as a young child. According to Douglas, &quot;there was an awful lot of rage churning around inside me, rage that I was afraid to reveal because there was so much more of it, and so much stronger, in my father.&quot; Douglas&#x27; discipline, wit and sense of humor were also often recognized.

===Marriages and children===
Douglas and his first wife, Diana Dill, married on November 2, 1943. They had two sons, actor Michael Douglas and producer Joel Douglas, before divorcing in 1951.

According to his autobiography &quot;The Ragman&#x27;s Son,&quot; he and Italian actress Pier Angeli were engaged in the early 1950s after meeting on the set of the film &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953), but they never made it down the aisle. Afterwards, in Paris, he met producer Anne Buydens (born Hannelore Marx; April 23, 1919, Hanover, Germany) while acting on location in &quot;Act of Love&quot;. She originally fled from Germany to escape Nazism and survived by putting her multilingual skills to work at a film studio, creating translations for subtitles. They married on May 29, 1954. In 2014, they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. They had two sons, Peter, a producer, and Eric, an actor who died on July 6, 2004, from an overdose of alcohol and drugs at the age of 46. In 2017, the couple released a book, &quot;Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter and a Lifetime in Hollywood&quot;, that revealed intimate letters they shared through the years. Throughout their marriage, Douglas had affairs with other women, including several Hollywood starlets. He never hid his infidelities from his wife, who was accepting of them and explained, &quot;as a European, I understood it was unrealistic to expect total fidelity in a marriage.&quot;

===Mike Todd===
Douglas was good friends with producer Mike Todd who lived across the street from him in Palm Springs. On the morning of March 22, 1958, they were playing tennis when Todd asked him to come with him later that day on his private aircraft to New York, where he was due to receive an award. He suggested that Douglas could make the presentation to him and afterwards on the way back they could stop and visit former president Harry Truman in Independence, Missouri.

Upon hearing of the plan, Douglas&#x27;s wife Anne had an uneasy feeling and urged him to take a commercial flight instead. After a heated argument about the matter, Douglas in a temper said that if he could not fly with Todd then he would not go at all.

The next morning while driving in the car to Los Angeles, Douglas and his family heard on the radio the news that Todd&#x27;s aircraft had crashed a few hours after takeoff, killing all on board.

===Religion===
On February 13, 1991, aged 74, Douglas was in a helicopter and was injured when the aircraft collided with a small plane above Santa Paula Airport. Two other people were also injured, including Noel Blanc, the son of voice actor Mel Blanc who was piloting the helicopter, and two people in the plane were killed. This near-death experience sparked a search for meaning by Douglas, which led him, after much study, to embrace the Judaism in which he had been raised. He documented this spiritual journey in his book, &quot;Climbing the Mountain: My Search for Meaning&quot; (1997).

He decided to visit Jerusalem again and wanted to see the Western Wall Tunnel during a trip where he would dedicate two playgrounds he donated to the state. His tour guide arranged to end the tour of the tunnel at the bedrock where, according to Jewish tradition, Abraham&#x27;s binding of Isaac took place.

In his earlier autobiography, &quot;The Ragman&#x27;s Son&quot;, he recalled, &quot;years back, I tried to forget that I was a Jew,&quot; but later in his career he began &quot;coming to grips with what it means to be a Jew,&quot; which became a theme in his life. In an interview in 2000, he explained this transition:

Douglas noted that an underlying theme of some of his films, including &quot;The Juggler&quot; (1953), &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot; (1966), and &quot;Remembrance of Love&quot; (1982), was about &quot;a Jew who doesn&#x27;t think of himself as one, and eventually finds his Jewishness.&quot; &quot;The Juggler&quot; was the first Hollywood feature to be filmed in the newly established state of Israel. Douglas recalled that, while there, he saw &quot;extreme poverty and food being rationed.&quot; But he found it &quot;wonderful, finally, to be in the majority.&quot; The film&#x27;s producer, Stanley Kramer, tried to portray &quot;Israel as the Jews&#x27; heroic response to Hitler&#x27;s destruction.&quot;

Although his children had non-Jewish mothers, Douglas stated that they were &quot;aware culturally&quot; of his &quot;deep convictions&quot; and he never tried to influence their own religious decisions. Douglas&#x27;s wife, Anne, converted to Judaism before they renewed their wedding vows in 2004. Douglas celebrated a second Bar-Mitzvah ceremony in 1999, aged 83.

===Philanthropy===
Douglas and his wife donated to various non-profit causes during his career and planned on donating most of their $80 million net worth. Among the donations have been those to his former high school and college. In September 2001, he helped fund his high school&#x27;s musical, &quot;Amsterdam Oratorio&quot;, composed by Maria Riccio Bryce, who won the school Thespian Society&#x27;s Kirk Douglas Award in 1968. In 2012 he donated $5 million to St. Lawrence University, his alma mater. The college used the donation for the scholarship fund he began in 1999.

He donated to various schools, medical facilities, and other non-profit organizations in southern California. This included the rebuilding of over 400 Los Angeles Unified School District playgrounds that were aged and in need of restoration. The Douglases established the Anne Douglas Center for Homeless Women at the Los Angeles Mission, which has helped hundreds of women turn their lives around. In Culver City, they opened the Kirk Douglas Theatre in 2004. They supported the Anne Douglas Childhood Center at the Sinai Temple of Westwood. In March 2015, Douglas and his wife donated $2.3 million to the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles.

Since the early 1990s, Kirk and Anne Douglas donated up to $40 million to Harry&#x27;s Haven, an Alzheimer&#x27;s treatment facility in Woodland Hills, to care for patients at the Motion Picture Home. To celebrate his 99th birthday on December 9, 2015, they donated another $15 million to help expand the facility with a new two-story Kirk Douglas Care Pavilion.

Douglas donated a number of playgrounds in Jerusalem and donated the Kirk Douglas Theater at the Aish Center across from the Western Wall.

===Politics===

Douglas and his wife traveled to more than 40 countries, at their own expense, to act as goodwill ambassadors for the U.S. Information Agency, speaking to audiences about why democracy works and what freedom means. In 1980, Douglas flew to Cairo to talk with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. For all his goodwill efforts, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Jimmy Carter in 1981. At the ceremony, Carter said that Douglas had &quot;done this in a sacrificial way, almost invariably without fanfare and without claiming any personal credit or acclaim for himself&quot;. In subsequent years, Douglas testified before Congress about elder abuse.

Douglas was a long-time member of the Democratic Party. He wrote letters to politicians who were friends. He noted in his memoir, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; (2007), that he felt compelled to write to former president Jimmy Carter in 2006 to stress that &quot;Israel is the only successful democracy in the Middle East ... [and] has had to endure many wars against overwhelming odds. If Israel loses one war, they lose Israel.&quot; During the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries he endorsed Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s campaign.

===Role in breaking Hollywood blacklist===
Howard Fast was originally hired to adapt his own 1951 novel &quot;Spartacus&quot; as a screenplay, but he had difficulty working in the format. He was replaced by Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted as one of the Hollywood 10, and intended to use the pseudonym &quot;Sam Jackson&quot;. Trumbo had been jailed for contempt of Congress in 1950, after which he had survived by writing screenplays under assumed names.

Kirk Douglas claimed that it was his insistence that Trumbo be given screen credit for his work that broke the blacklist. In his autobiography, Douglas states that this decision was motivated by a meeting that Edward Lewis, Stanley Kubrick, and he had regarding whose names to list for the screenplay in the film credits, given Trumbo&#x27;s shaky position with Hollywood executives. One idea was to credit Lewis as co-writer or sole writer, but Lewis vetoed both suggestions. Kubrick then suggested that his own name be used. Douglas and Lewis found Kubrick&#x27;s eagerness to take credit for Trumbo&#x27;s work revolting, and the next day, Douglas called the gate at Universal saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to leave a pass for Dalton Trumbo.&quot; Douglas writes, &quot;For the first time in 10 years, Trumbo walked on to a studio lot. He said, &#x27;Thanks, Kirk, for giving me back my name.&#x27;

In fact, Douglas did not announce Trumbo as the credited screenwriter of &quot;Spartacus&quot; until August 1960, seven months after producer-director Otto Preminger&#x27;s January 20, 1960, announcement that he had hired Trumbo to adapt Leon Uris&#x27; novel &quot;Exodus&quot; for the screen. Douglas later successfully denied Trumbo a sought credit on the film &quot;Town Without Pity&quot; as he worried that his continued association with the screen writer would hurt his career. and Kirk Douglas publicly announced that Trumbo was the screenwriter of &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Further, President John F. Kennedy publicly ignored a demonstration organized by the American Legion and went to see the film.

===Blogging===
Douglas blogged from time to time. Originally hosted on Myspace, his posts were hosted by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; beginning in 2012. As of 2008, he was believed to be the oldest celebrity blogger in the world.

===Rape allegation===
Douglas is alleged to have raped actress Natalie Wood in the summer of 1955, when she was 16 and he 38. Wood&#x27;s alleged rape was first publicised in Suzanne Finstad&#x27;s 2001 biography of the actress, though Finstad never named the offender.

The allegation received renewed attention in January 2018, after the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony paid tribute to Douglas, with several news outlets citing a 2012 anonymous blog post which accused Douglas. In July 2018, Wood&#x27;s sister Lana said during a 12-part podcast about her sister&#x27;s life that her sister was sexually assaulted as a teen and that the attack had occurred inside the Chateau Marmont during an audition and went on &quot;for hours&quot;. In the 2021 memoir &quot;Little Sister: My Investigation Into the Mysterious Death of Natalie Wood&quot;, Lana Wood alleged Douglas was her sister&#x27;s assailant. Douglas&#x27;s son Michael issued a statement, saying &quot;May they both rest in peace.&quot;

==Health problems and death==
On January 28, 1996, at age 79, Douglas suffered a severe stroke, which impaired his ability to speak. Doctors told his wife that unless there was rapid improvement, the loss of his ability to speak would probably be permanent. However, after a regimen of daily speech-language therapy that lasted several months, his ability to speak returned, although it was still limited. He was able to accept an honorary Academy Award two months later (in March) and to thank the audience. He wrote about this experience in his 2002 book &quot;My Stroke of Luck&quot;, which he hoped would be an &quot;operating manual&quot; for others on how to handle a stroke victim in their own family.

Douglas died at his home in Beverly Hills, California, surrounded by his family on February 5, 2020, at age 103. His cause of death was kept private. Douglas&#x27;s funeral was held at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery on February 7, 2020, two days after his death. He was buried in the same plot as his son Eric. On April 29, 2021, his wife Anne died at age 102 and was buried next to him and their son.

==Filmography==
In a 2014 article, Douglas cited &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;, &quot;Champion&quot;, &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot;, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Act of Love&quot;, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Indian Fighter&quot;, &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot;, and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; as the films he was most proud of throughout his acting career.

In 1983, Douglas received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1996, Douglas received an Honorary Academy Award for &quot;50 years as a moral and creative force in the motion picture community.&quot; The award was presented by producer/director Steven Spielberg. As a result of Douglas&#x27;s stroke the previous summer, however, in which he lost most of his speaking ability, his close friends and family were concerned about whether he should try to speak, or what he should say. Both his son Michael, and his long-time friend Jack Valenti, urged him to only say &quot;Thank you&quot;, and leave the stage. Douglas agreed, but had second thoughts when standing in front of the audience. He later reflected that: &quot;I intended to just say &#x27;thank you,&#x27; but I saw 1,000 people, and felt I had to say something more, and I did.&quot; Valenti remembers that after Douglas held up the Oscar, addressed his sons, and told his wife how much he loved her, everyone was astonished at his voice&#x27;s improvement:

Since 2006, the Santa Barbara International Film Festival has awarded the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in film to acknowledge lifetime contributions to the film industry. Recipients of the award include Robert De Niro, Ed Harris, Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas, Hugh Jackman, and Judi Dench. The award is typically presented to actors, although directors Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese have been presented with it. In 2015, a star was nicknamed after Douglas in the International Star Registry to commemorate his 99th birthday.

<text>A Friend of the Earth is a 2000 novel by T.C. Boyle. The novel is a story of environmental destruction set in 2025; as a result of global warming and the greenhouse effect, the climate has drastically changed, and, accordingly, biodiversity is a thing of the past.

==America in 2025==
Due to habitat loss, many animal species have become extinct, but the flora has also considerably suffered. Many foods, including beef, eggs, beer, etc., are no longer readily available. Instead, rice is grown everywhere, and sake is the only alcoholic beverage available. Other vegetables are grown in domed fields. El Niño has become an everyday companion of the inhabitants of the United States: strong winds are continuously blowing, and there is heavy rainfall for several months every year. In the dry season, it is unbearably hot. Helpful medicines have been found in the rainforest, including cures for cancer.

Deforestation has occurred for two reasons: (a) the storms, which have uprooted whole forests; and, (b) the timber industry&#x27;s limitless destruction of primeval forests all over the world, including the tropical rainforest. On top of it all, modern science has invented many artificial ways to prolong human life (for example, there are TV ads for organ transplants), and longevity among humans is now a fact with life expectancy having climbed to over the 100-year mark. Consequently, the world is massively overpopulated. In the US, what used to be unspoiled nature is now residential areas, with condominiums having sprung up everywhere. Inside these condos, people who do not care about the environment live their lives in front of their computers and televisions.

At no point in the novel does Boyle enter into a discussion of the political situation, but there are various hints hidden in the text which tell us that the social security system has crumbled and that many older Americans are left to their own devices, without a regular income, many of them seemingly even without a roof over their heads.

==Plot summary==
&quot;A Friend of the Earth&quot; is the story of Tyrone O&#x27;Shaughnessy Tierwater, a U.S. citizen born in 1950, half Irish Catholic and half Jewish (&quot;I&#x27;m a mess and I know it. Jewish guilt, Catholic guilt, enviro-eco-capitalistico guilt: I can&#x27;t even expel gas in peace.&quot;), whose personal tragedy fits in with, and adds to, the gloomy atmosphere created in the novel.

Egged on by Andrea, the woman he loves, he becomes a committed &quot;Earth Forever!&quot; activist (an allusion to the radical environmental group Earth First!) in the 1980s, is imprisoned for ecotage, but eventually cannot change anything. On top of that, he suffers the loss of his first wife when their daughter is only three and of his daughter when she is only 25. When the novel opens, Tierwater is a 75-year-old disillusioned ex-con living on the estate of a famous pop star in the Santa Ynez Valley, north of Santa Barbara, in California and looking after the latter&#x27;s private menagerie.

Maclovio Pulchris, the singer, has had the idea of preserving some of the last surviving animals of several species in order to initiate a captive breeding program at some later point in time, choosing to preserve the animals no one else would. Tierwater has been working for Pulchris (&quot;Mac&quot;) for ten years when, in 2025, Andrea, his ex-wife and stepmother to his daughter Sierra, contacts him after more than 20 years. She and a friend of hers, April Wind, move in with Tierwater, officially for April Wind to write a biography, or rather hagiography, of Sierra Tierwater, his daughter, who died in 2001 as a martyr to the environmentalist cause (falling out of a tree in old growth woodland in which she had been living for about three years).

In the course of the next few months the situation deteriorates even more. The rain and the wind destroy the animals&#x27; cages, and subsequently they have to be kept in Pulchris&#x27;s basement. One morning one of the lions gets loose and attacks and kills the singer, as well as a number of employees. As a consequence, the other lions are shot—and thus lions as a species become extinct. (There is just one surviving lion in the San Diego Zoo left.)

Jobless and penniless, Tierwater, who has fallen in love all over again with Andrea, is evicted from the estate by Pulchris&#x27;s heirs. Along with Andrea, Tyrone leaves the compound, heading for a mountain cabin owned by Earth Forever! somewhere in the forest which decades ago served as a hideout. They arrive there with only one of Pulchris&#x27;s animals in tow: Petunia, the Patagonian fox, which they now keep as their domestic animal, passing it off as their dog.

In the final scene of the book, a teenaged girl comes hiking along the trail where the forest surrounding the dilapidated cabin would have been. Tierwater and Andrea, who again call themselves husband and wife now, have a glimmer of hope that life will soon be like life 30 years before, as the novel ends on an optimistic note.

==Themes==
Major themes discussed and referred to throughout the book include the effects of climate change and reduction of biodiversity. 

There are implicit references to Christianity throughout. Maclovio Pulchris&#x27; animal menagerie seems to be a direct reference to the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark. Similarly, the death of Tierwater&#x27;s daughter, Sierra, seems to be a reference to New Testament sacrifice. Another theme includes the prevalence of a pandemic illness known as mucosa in the year 2025 setting.

==Intertextual references==

*Aldo Leopold, author of &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; (1949)

==Allusions/references to other works==

<text>A science museum is a museum devoted primarily to science. Older science museums tended to concentrate on static displays of objects related to natural history, paleontology, geology, industry and industrial machinery, etc. Modern trends in museology have broadened the range of subject matter and introduced many interactive exhibits. Modern science museums, increasingly referred to as &#x27;science centres&#x27; or &#x27;discovery centres&#x27;, also feature technology.

While the mission statements of science centres and modern museums may vary, they are commonly places that make science accessible and encourage the excitement of discovery.

==History==
As early as the Renaissance period, aristocrats collected curiosities for display. Universities, and in particular medical schools, also maintained study collections of specimens for their students. Scientists and collectors displayed their finds in private cabinets of curiosities. Such collections were the predecessors of modern natural history museums.

In 1683, the first purpose-built museum covering natural philosophy, the original Ashmolean museum (now called the Museum of the History of Science) in Oxford, England, was opened, although its scope was mixed.

This was followed in 1752 by the first dedicated science museum, the Museo de Ciencias Naturales, in Madrid, which almost did not survive Francoist Spain. Today, the museum works closely with the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas).

The Utrecht University Museum, established in 1836, and the Netherlands&#x27; foremost research museum, displays an extensive collection of 18th-century animal and human &quot;rarities&quot; in its original setting.

More science museums developed during the Industrial Revolution, when great national exhibitions showcased the triumphs of both science and industry. An example is the Great Exhibition in 1851 at The Crystal Palace, London, England, surplus items from which contributed to the Science Museum, London, founded in 1857.

In the United States of America, various natural history Societies established collections in the early 19th century. These later evolved into museums. A notable example is the New England Museum of Natural History (now the Museum of Science) which opened in Boston in 1864. Another was the Academy of Science, St. Louis, founded in 1856, the first scientific organisation west of the Mississippi. (Although the organisation managed scientific collections for several decades, a formal museum was not created until the mid-20th century.)

==Modern science museums==

The modern interactive science museum appears to have been pioneered by Munich&#x27;s Deutsches Museum (German Museum of Masterpieces of Science and Technology) in the early 20th century. This museum had moving exhibits where visitors were encouraged to push buttons and work levers. The concept was taken to the United States by Julius Rosenwald, chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Company, who visited the Deutsches Museum with his young son in 1911. He was so captivated by the experience that he decided to build a similar museum in his home town. The Ampère Museum, close to Lyon, was created in 1931 and is the first interactive scientific museum in France. Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry opened in phases between 1933 and 1940.

In 1959, the Museum of Science and Natural History (now the Saint Louis Science Center) was formally created by the Academy of Science of Saint Louis, featuring many interactive science and history exhibits, and in August 1969, Frank Oppenheimer dedicated his new Exploratorium in San Francisco almost completely to interactive science exhibits, building on the experience by publishing &#x27;Cookbooks&#x27; that explain how to construct versions of the Exploratorium&#x27;s exhibits. 

The Ontario Science Centre, which opened in September 1969, continued the trend of featuring interactive exhibits rather than static displays.

In 1973, the first Omnimax cinema opened at the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park. The tilted-dome Space Theater doubled as a planetarium. The Science Centre was an exploratorium-style museum included as a small part of the complex. This combination of interactive science museum, planetarium and Omnimax theater pioneered a configuration that many major science museums now follow.

Also in 1973, the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) was founded as an international organisation to provide a collective voice, professional support, and programming opportunities for science centres, museums and related institutions.

The massive Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie (City of Science and Industry) opened in Paris in 1986, and national centres soon followed in Denmark (Experimentarium), Sweden (Tom Tits Experiment), Finland (Heureka), and Spain (Museu de les Ciencies Principe Felipe). In the United Kingdom, the first interactive centres also opened in 1986 on a modest scale, with further developments more than a decade later, funded by the National Lottery for projects to celebrate the Millennium.

Since the 1990s, science museums and centres have been created or greatly expanded in Asia. Examples are Thailand&#x27;s National Science Museum and Japan&#x27;s Minato Science Museum.

==Science centres==

Museums that brand themselves as &quot;science centres&quot; emphasise a hands-on approach, featuring interactive exhibits that encourage visitors to experiment and explore.

Recently, there has been a push for science museums to be more involved in science communication and educating the public about the scientific process. Microbiologist and science communicator Natalia Pasternak Taschner stated, &quot;I believe that science museums can promote critical thinking, especially in teenagers and young adults, by teaching them about the scientific method and the process of science, and how by using this to develop knowledge and technology, we can be less wrong.&quot;

Urania was a science centre founded in Berlin in 1888. Most of its exhibits were destroyed during World War II, as were those of a range of German technical museums. The Academy of Science of Saint Louis (founded in 1856) created the Saint Louis Museum of Science and Natural History in 1959 (Saint Louis Science Center), but generally science centres are a product of the 1960s and later. In the United Kingdom, many were founded as Millennium projects, with funding from the National Lotteries Fund.

The first &#x27;science centre&#x27; in the United States was the Science Center of Pinellas County, founded in 1959. The Pacific Science Center (one of the first large organisations to call itself a &#x27;science centre&#x27; rather than a museum), opened in a Seattle World&#x27;s Fair building in 1962.

In 1969, Oppenheimer&#x27;s Exploratorium opened in San Francisco, California, and the Ontario Science Centre opened near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. By the early 1970s, COSI Columbus, then known as the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, had run its first &#x27;camp-in&#x27;.

In 1983, the Smithsonian Institution invited visitors to the Discovery Room in the newly opened National Museum of Natural History Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland, where they could touch and handle formerly off-limits specimens.

The new-style museums banded together for mutual support. In 1971, 16 museum directors gathered to discuss the possibility of starting a new association; one more specifically tailored to their needs than the existing American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums). As a result of this, the Association of Science-Technology Centers was formally established in 1973, headquartered in Washington DC, but with an international organisational membership.

The corresponding European organisation is Ecsite, and in the United Kingdom, the Association of Science and Discovery Centres represents the interests of over 60 major science engagement organisations. The Asia Pacific Network of Science and Technology Centres (ASPAC) is an association initiated in 1997 with over 50 members from 20 countries across Asia and Australia (2022). Their regional sister organisations are the Network for the Popularization of Science and Technology in Latin America and The Caribbean (RedPOP), the North Africa and Middle East science centres (NAMES), and the Southern African Association of Science and Technology Centres (SAASTEC). In India, the National Council of Science Museums runs science centres at several places including Delhi, Bhopal, Nagpur and Ranchi. There are also a number of private Science Centres, including the Birla Science Museum and The Science Garage in Hyderabad.

<text>The Phoenician alphabet is an abjad (consonantal alphabet) used across the Mediterranean civilization of Phoenicia for most of the 1st millennium BC. It was one of the first alphabets, attested in Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions found across the Mediterranean region. In the history of writing systems, the Phoenician script also marked the first to have a fixed writing direction—while previous systems were multi-directional, Phoenician was written horizontally, from right to left. It developed directly from the Proto-Sinaitic script used during the Late Bronze Age, which was derived in turn from Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The Phoenician alphabet was used to write Canaanite languages spoken during the Early Iron Age, sub-categorized by historians as Phoenician, Hebrew, Moabite, Ammonite and Edomite, as well as Old Aramaic. It was widely disseminated outside of the Canaanite sphere by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean, where it was adopted and adapted by other cultures. The Phoenician alphabet proper was used in Ancient Carthage until the 2nd century BC, where it was used to write the Punic language. Its direct descendant scripts include the Aramaic and Samaritan alphabets, several Alphabets of Asia Minor, and the Archaic Greek alphabets.

The Phoenician alphabet proper uses 22 consonant letters—as an abjad used to write a Semitic language, the vowel sounds were left implicit—though late varieties sometimes used to denote some vowels. As its letters were originally incised using a stylus, their forms are mostly angular and straight, though cursive forms increased in use over time, culminating in the Neo-Punic alphabet used in Roman North Africa.

== History ==
=== Origin ===

The earliest known proto-alphabetic inscriptions are the Proto-Sinaitic script sporadically attested in the Sinai Peninsula and in Canaan in the late Middle and Late Bronze Age. The script was not widely used until the rise of Syro-Hittite states in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.

The Phoenician alphabet is a direct continuation of the &quot;Proto-Canaanite&quot; script of the Bronze Age collapse period. The inscriptions found on the Phoenician arrowheads at al-Khader near Bethlehem and dated offered the epigraphists the &quot;missing link&quot; between the two. The Ahiram epitaph, whose dating is controversial, engraved on the sarcophagus of king Ahiram in Byblos, Lebanon, one of five known Byblian royal inscriptions, shows essentially the fully developed Phoenician script, although the name &quot;Phoenician&quot; is by convention given to inscriptions beginning in the mid-11th century BC.

=== Spread and adaptations ===

Beginning in the 9th century BC, adaptations of the Phoenician alphabet thrived, including Greek, Old Italic and Anatolian scripts. The alphabet&#x27;s attractive innovation was its phonetic nature, in which one sound was represented by one symbol, which meant only a few dozen symbols to learn. The other scripts of the time, cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, employed many complex characters and required long professional training to achieve proficiency; which had restricted literacy to a small elite.

Another reason for its success was the maritime trading culture of Phoenician merchants, which spread the alphabet into parts of North Africa and Southern Europe. Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa. Later finds indicate earlier use in Egypt.

The alphabet had long-term effects on the social structures of the civilizations that came in contact with it. Its simplicity not only allowed its easy adaptation to multiple languages, but it also allowed the common people to learn how to write. This upset the long-standing status of literacy as an exclusive achievement of royal and religious elites, scribes who used their monopoly on information to control the common population. The appearance of Phoenician disintegrated many of these class divisions, although many Middle Eastern kingdoms, such as Assyria, Babylonia and Adiabene, would continue to use cuneiform for legal and liturgical matters well into the Common Era.

According to Herodotus, the Phoenician prince Cadmus was accredited with the introduction of the Phoenician alphabet— &#x27;Phoenician letters&#x27;—to the Greeks, who adapted it to form their Greek alphabet. Herodotus claims that the Greeks did not know of the Phoenician alphabet before Cadmus. He estimates that Cadmus lived 1600 years before his time, while the historical adoption of the alphabet by the Greeks was barely 350 years before Herodotus.

The Phoenician alphabet was known to the Jewish sages of the Second Temple era, who called it the &quot;Old Hebrew&quot; (Paleo-Hebrew) script.
===Notable inscriptions===
The conventional date of 1050 BC for the emergence of the Phoenician script was chosen because there is a gap in the epigraphic record; there are not actually any Phoenician inscriptions securely dated to the 11th century. The oldest inscriptions are dated to the 10th century.

* KAI 14: Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II, 5th century BC

* Çineköy inscription, Phoenician-Luwian bilingual, 8th century BC

===Modern rediscovery===
The Phoenician alphabet was deciphered in 1758 by Jean-Jacques Barthélemy, but its relation to the Phoenicians remained unknown until the 19th century. It was at first believed that the script was a direct variation of Egyptian hieroglyphs, which were deciphered by Champollion in the early 19th century.

However, scholars could not find any link between the two writing systems, nor to hieratic or cuneiform. The theories of independent creation ranged from the idea of a single individual conceiving it, to the Hyksos people forming it from corrupt Egyptian. It was eventually discovered that the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet was inspired by the model of hieroglyphs.

== Table of letters ==
The chart shows the graphical evolution of Phoenician letter forms into other alphabets. The sound values also changed significantly, both at the initial creation of new alphabets and from gradual pronunciation changes which did not immediately lead to spelling changes. The Phoenician letter forms shown are idealized: actual Phoenician writing is less uniform, with significant variations by era and region.
When alphabetic writing began, with the early Greek alphabet, the letter forms were similar but not identical to Phoenician, and vowels were added to the consonant-only Phoenician letters. There were also distinct variants of the writing system in different parts of Greece, primarily in how those Phoenician characters that did not have an exact match to Greek sounds were used. The Ionic variant evolved into the standard Greek alphabet, and the Cumae variant into the Italic alphabets (including the Latin alphabet).

The Runic alphabet is derived from Italic, the Cyrillic alphabet from medieval Greek. The Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic scripts are derived from Aramaic (the latter as a medieval cursive variant of Nabataean). Ge&#x27;ez is from South Arabian.

==Letter names==
Phoenician used a system of acrophony to name letters: a word was chosen with each initial consonant sound, and became the name of the letter for that sound. These names were not arbitrary: each Phoenician letter was based on an Egyptian hieroglyph representing an Egyptian word; this word was translated into Phoenician (or a closely related Semitic language), then the initial sound of the translated word became the letter&#x27;s Phoenician value. For example, the second letter of the Phoenician alphabet was based on the Egyptian hieroglyph for &quot;house&quot; (a sketch of a house); the Semitic word for &#x27;house&#x27; was &quot;bet&quot;; hence the Phoenician letter was called &quot;bet&quot; and had the sound value &quot;b&quot;.

According to a 1904 theory by Theodor Nöldeke, some of the letter names were changed in Phoenician from the Proto-Canaanite script. This includes:
* &quot;gaml&quot; &#x27;throwing stick&#x27; to &quot;gimel&quot; &#x27;camel&#x27;
* &quot;digg&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27; to &quot;dalet&quot; &#x27;door&#x27;
* &quot;hll&quot; &#x27;jubilation&#x27; to &quot;he&quot; &#x27;window&#x27;
* &quot;ziqq&quot; &#x27;manacle&#x27; to &quot;zayin&quot; &#x27;weapon&#x27;
* &quot;naḥš&quot; &#x27;snake&#x27; to &quot;nun&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27;
* &quot;piʾt&quot; &#x27;corner&#x27; to &quot;pe&quot; &#x27;mouth&#x27;
* &quot;šimš&quot; &#x27;sun&#x27; to &quot;šin&quot; &#x27;tooth&#x27;

Yigael Yadin (1963) went to great lengths to prove that there was actual battle equipment similar to some of the original letter forms named for weapons (samek, zayin).

Later, the Greeks kept approximations of the Phoenician names, albeit they did not mean anything to them other than the letters themselves; on the other hand, the Latins (and presumably the Etruscans from whom they borrowed a variant of the Western Greek alphabet) and the Orthodox Slavs (at least when naming the Cyrillic letters, which came to them from the Greek by way of the Glagolitic) based their names purely on the letters&#x27; sounds.

==Numerals==
The Phoenician numeral system consisted of separate symbols for 1, 10, 20, and 100. The sign for 1 was a simple vertical stroke (𐤖). Other numerals up to 9 were formed by adding the appropriate number of such strokes, arranged in groups of three. The symbol for 10 was a horizontal line or tack (). The sign for 20 (𐤘) could come in different glyph variants, one of them being a combination of two 10-tacks, approximately Z-shaped. Larger multiples of ten were formed by grouping the appropriate number of 20s and 10s. There existed several glyph variants for 100 (𐤙). The 100 symbol could be multiplied by a preceding numeral, e.g. the combination of 4 and 100 yielded 400. The system did not contain a numeral zero.
==Derived alphabets==

Phoenician was prolific. Many of the writing systems in use today can ultimately trace their descent to it, so ultimately to Egyptian hieroglyphs. The Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian and Georgian scripts are derived from the Greek alphabet, which evolved from Phoenician; the Aramaic alphabet, also descended from Phoenician, evolved into the Arabic and Hebrew scripts. It has also been theorised that the Brahmi and subsequent Brahmic scripts of the Indian cultural sphere also descended from Aramaic, effectively uniting most of the world&#x27;s writing systems under one family, although the theory is disputed.

===Early Semitic scripts===
The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet is a regional variant of the Phoenician alphabet, so called when used to write early Hebrew. The Samaritan alphabet is a development of Paleo-Hebrew, emerging in the 6th century BC. The South Arabian script may be derived from a stage of the Proto-Sinaitic script predating the mature development of the Phoenician alphabet proper. The Geʽez script developed from South Arabian.

=== Samaritan alphabet ===
The Phoenician alphabet continued to be used by the Samaritans and developed into the Samaritan alphabet, that is an immediate continuation of the Phoenician script without intermediate non-Israelite evolutionary stages. The Samaritans have continued to use the script for writing both Hebrew and Aramaic texts until the present day. A comparison of the earliest Samaritan inscriptions and the medieval and modern Samaritan manuscripts clearly indicates that the Samaritan script is a static script which was used mainly as a book hand.

===Aramaic-derived===
The Aramaic alphabet, used to write Aramaic, is an early descendant of Phoenician. Aramaic, being the lingua franca of the Middle East, was widely adopted. It later split off into a number of related alphabets, including Hebrew, Syriac, and Nabataean, the latter of which, in its cursive form, became an ancestor of the Arabic alphabet. The Hebrew alphabet emerges in the Second Temple period, from around 300 BC, out of the Aramaic alphabet used in the Persian empire. There was, however, a revival of the Phoenician mode of writing later in the Second Temple period, with some instances from the Qumran Caves, such as the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll dated to the 2nd or 1st century BC.

By the 5th century BC, among Jews the Phoenician alphabet had been mostly replaced by the Aramaic alphabet as officially used in the Persian empire (which, like all alphabetical writing systems, was itself ultimately a descendant of the Proto-Canaanite script, though through intermediary non-Israelite stages of evolution). The &quot;Jewish square-script&quot; variant now known simply as the Hebrew alphabet evolved directly out of the Aramaic script by about the 3rd century BC (although some letter shapes did not become standard until the 1st century AD).

The Kharosthi script is an Aramaic-derived alphasyllabary used in the Indo-Greek Kingdom in the 3rd century BC. The Syriac alphabet is the derived form of Aramaic used in the early Christian period. The Sogdian alphabet is derived from Syriac. It is in turn an ancestor of the Old Uyghur. The Manichaean alphabet is a further derivation from Sogdian.

The Arabic script is a medieval cursive variant of Nabataean, itself an offshoot of Aramaic.

===Brahmic scripts===

It has been proposed, notably by Georg Bühler (1898), that the Brahmi script of India (and by extension the derived Indic alphabets) was ultimately derived from the Aramaic script, which would make Phoenician the ancestor of virtually every alphabetic writing system in use today, with the notable exception of hangul.

It is certain that the Aramaic-derived Kharosthi script was present in northern India by the 4th century BC, so that the Aramaic model of alphabetic writing would have been known in the region, but the link from Kharosthi to the slightly younger Brahmi is tenuous. Bühler&#x27;s suggestion is still entertained in mainstream scholarship, but it has never been proven conclusively, and no definitive scholarly consensus exists.

===Greek-derived===

The Greek alphabet is derived from the Phoenician. With a different phonology, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script to represent their own sounds, including the vowels absent in Phoenician. It was possibly more important in Greek to write out vowel sounds: Phoenician being a Semitic language, words were based on consonantal roots that permitted extensive removal of vowels without loss of meaning, a feature absent in the Indo-European Greek. However, Akkadian cuneiform, which wrote a related Semitic language, did indicate vowels, which suggests the Phoenicians simply accepted the model of the Egyptians, who never wrote vowels. In any case, the Greeks repurposed the Phoenician letters of consonant sounds not present in Greek; each such letter had its name shorn of its leading consonant, and the letter took the value of the now-leading vowel. For example, &quot;ʾāleph&quot;, which designated a glottal stop in Phoenician, was repurposed to represent the vowel ; &quot;he&quot; became , &quot;ḥet&quot; became (a long vowel), &quot;ʿayin&quot; became (because the pharyngeality altered the following vowel), while the two semi-consonants &quot;wau&quot; and &quot;yod&quot; became the corresponding high vowels, and . (Some dialects of Greek, which did possess and , continued to use the Phoenician letters for those consonants as well.)

The Alphabets of Asia Minor are generally assumed to be offshoots of archaic versions of the Greek alphabet.

The Latin alphabet was derived from Old Italic (originally derived from a form of the Greek alphabet), used for Etruscan and other languages. The origin of the Runic alphabet is disputed: the main theories are that it evolved either from the Latin alphabet itself, some early Old Italic alphabet via the Alpine scripts, or the Greek alphabet. Despite this debate, the Runic alphabet is clearly derived from one or more scripts that ultimately trace their roots back to the Phoenician alphabet.

The Coptic alphabet is mostly based on the mature Greek alphabet of the Hellenistic period, with a few additional letters for sounds not in Greek at the time. Those additional letters are based on the Demotic script.

The Cyrillic script was derived from the late (medieval) Greek alphabet. Some Cyrillic letters (generally for sounds not in medieval Greek) are based on Glagolitic forms.

=== Paleohispanic scripts ===
These were an indigenous set of genetically related semisyllabaries, which suited the phonological characteristics of the Tartessian, Iberian and Celtiberian languages. They were deciphered in 1922 by Manuel Gómez-Moreno but their content is almost impossible to understand because they are not related to any living languages. While Gómez-Moreno first pointed to a joined Phoenician-Greek origin, following authors consider that their genesis has no relation to Greek.

The most remote script of the group is the Tartessian or Southwest script which could be one or several different scripts. The main bulk of PH inscriptions use, by far, the Northeastern Iberian script, which serves to write Iberian in the levantine coast North of Contestania and in the valle of the river Ebro (Hiber). The Iberic language is also recorded using two other scripts: the Southeastern Iberian script, which is more similar to the Southwest script than to Northeastern Iberian; and a variant of the Ionic Greek Alphabet called the Greco-Iberian alphabet. Finally, the Celtiberian script registers the language of the Celtiberians with a script derived from Northeastern Iberian, an interesting feature is that it was used and developed in times of the Roman conquest, in opposition to the Latin alphabet.

Among the distinctive features of Paleohispanic scripts are:
* Semi-syllabism. Half of the signs represent syllables made of occlusive consonants (k g b d t) and the other half represent simple phonemes such as vowels (a e i o u) and continuant consonants (l n r ŕ s ś).
* Duality. Appears on the earliest Iberian and Celtiberian inscriptions and refers to how the signs can serve a double use by being modified with an extra stroke that transforms, for example &quot;ge&quot; with a stroke becomes &quot;ke&quot; . In later stages the scripts were simplified and duality vanishes from inscriptions.
* Redundancy. A feature that appears only in the script of the Southwest, vowels are repeated after each syllabic sign.

<text>Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French general and statesman who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led a series of military campaigns across Europe during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1796 to 1815. He led the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then ruled the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814, and briefly again in 1815. He was King of Italy from 1805 to 1814 and Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine from 1806 to 1813.

Born on the island of Corsica to a family of Italian origin, Napoleon moved to mainland France in 1779 and was commissioned as an officer in the French Royal Army in 1785. He supported the French Revolution in 1789, and promoted its cause in Corsica. He rose rapidly through the ranks after winning the siege of Toulon in 1793 and defeating royalist insurgents in Paris on 13 Vendémiaire in 1795. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies in the War of the First Coalition, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. He led an invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798 which served as a springboard to political power. In November 1799, Napoleon engineered the Coup of 18 Brumaire against the Directory, and became First Consul of the Republic. He won the Battle of Marengo in 1800, which secured France&#x27;s victory in the War of the Second Coalition, and in 1803 sold the territory of Louisiana to the United States. In December 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French, further expanding his power.

The breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens led to the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered the coalition with a decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon defeated Prussia at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806, marched his into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in 1807 at the Battle of Friedland. Seeking to extend his trade embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and installed his brother Joseph as King of Spain in 1808, provoking the Peninsular War. In 1809, the Austrians again challenged France in the War of the Fifth Coalition, in which Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after winning the Battle of Wagram. In summer 1812, he launched an invasion of Russia, briefly occupying Moscow before conducting a catastrophic retreat of his army that winter. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russia in the War of the Sixth Coalition, in which Napoleon was decisively defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. They exiled him to the Mediterranean island of Elba and restored the Bourbons to power. Ten months later, Napoleon escaped from Elba on a brig, landed in France with a thousand men, and marched on Paris, again taking control of the country. His opponents responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated him at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon was exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died of stomach cancer in 1821, aged 51.

Napoleon is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and Napoleonic tactics are still studied at military schools worldwide. His legacy endures through the modernizing legal and administrative reforms he enacted in France and Western Europe, embodied in the Napoleonic Code. He established a system of public education, abolished the vestiges of feudalism, emancipated Jews and other religious minorities, abolished the Spanish Inquisition, enacted the principle of equality before the law for an emerging middle class, and centralized state power at the expense of religious authorities. His conquests acted as a catalyst for political change and the development of nation states. However, he is controversial due to his role in wars which devastated Europe, his looting of conquered territories, and his mixed record on civil rights. He abolished the free press, ended directly elected representative government, exiled and jailed critics of his regime, reinstated slavery in France&#x27;s colonies except for Haiti, banned the entry of blacks and mulattos into France, reduced the civil rights of women and children in France, reintroduced a hereditary monarchy and nobility, and violently repressed popular uprisings against his rule.

==Early life==
Napoleon&#x27;s family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family who emigrated to Corsica in the 16th century and his maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a noble family from Lombardy.

Napoleon&#x27;s parents, Carlo Maria Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, lived in the Maison Bonaparte home in Ajaccio, where Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769. He had an elder brother, Joseph, and, later, six younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme. Five more siblings were stillborn or did not survive infancy. Napoleon was baptized as a Catholic, under the name &quot;Napoleone di Buonaparte&quot;. In his youth, his name was also spelled as &quot;Nabulione&quot;, &quot;Nabulio&quot;, &quot;Napolionne&quot;, and &quot;Napulione&quot;.

Napoleon was born one year after the Republic of Genoa ceded Corsica to France. His father supported Pasquale Paoli during the Corsican war of independence against France. After the Corsican defeat at the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769 and Paoli&#x27;s exile in Britain, Carlo became friends with the French governor Charles Louis de Marbeuf, who became his patron and godfather to Napoleon. With Mabeuf&#x27;s support, Carlo was named Corsican representative to the court of Louis XVI and Napoleon obtained a royal bursary to a military academy in France.

The dominant influence of Napoleon&#x27;s childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child. Later in life, Napoleon said, &quot;The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother.&quot; Napoleon&#x27;s noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.

In January 1779, at age 9, Napoleon moved to the French mainland and enrolled at a religious school in Autun to improve his French (his mother tongue was the Corsican dialect of Italian). Although he eventually became fluent in French, he spoke with a Corsican accent and his French spelling was poor.

In May, he transferred to the military academy at Brienne-le-Château where he was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent, birthplace, short stature, mannerisms, and poor French. He became reserved and melancholic, applying himself to reading. An examiner observed that Napoleon &quot;has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics. He is fairly well acquainted with history and geography ... This boy would make an excellent sailor&quot;.

One story of Napoleon at the school is that he led junior students to victory against senior students in a snowball fight, which allegedly showed his leadership abilities. But the story was only told after Napoleon had become famous. In his later years at Brienne, Napoleon became an outspoken Corsican nationalist and admirer of Paoli.

In September 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the &quot;École militaire&quot; in Paris where he trained to become an artillery officer. He excelled at mathematics, and read widely in geography, history and literature. However, he was poor at French and German. His father&#x27;s death in February 1785 cut the family income and forced him to complete the two-year course in one year. In September he was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace and became the first Corsican to graduate from the &quot;École militaire&quot;.

==Early career==

=== Return to Corsica ===

Upon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in &quot;La Fère&quot; artillery regiment. He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, but spent long periods of leave in Corsica which fed his Corsican nationalism. In September 1789, he returned to Corsica and promoted the French revolutionary cause. Paoli returned to the island in July 1790, but he had no sympathy for Bonaparte, as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence.

Bonaparte plunged into a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists. He became a supporter of the Jacobins and joined the pro-French Corsican Republicans who opposed Paoli&#x27;s policy and his aspirations to secede. He was given command over a battalion of Corsican volunteers and promoted to captain in the regular army in 1792, despite exceeding his leave of absence and a dispute between his volunteers and the French garrison in Ajaccio.

In February 1793, Bonaparte took part in the failed French expedition to Sardinia. Following allegations that Paoli had sabotaged the expedition and that his regime was corrupt and incompetent, the French National Convention outlawed him. In early June, Bonaparte and 400 French troops failed to capture Ajaccio from Corsican volunteers and the island was now controlled by Paoli&#x27;s supporters. When Bonaparte learned that the Corsican assembly had condemned him and his family, the Buonapartes fled to Toulon on the French mainland.

===Siege of Toulon===

Bonaparte returned to his regiment in Nice and was made captain of a coastal battery. In July 1793, he published a pamphlet, &quot;Le souper de Beaucaire&quot; (Supper at Beaucaire), demonstrating his support for the National Convention which was now heavily influenced by the Jacobins.

In September, with the help of his fellow Corsican Antoine Christophe Saliceti, Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces sent to recapture the port of Toulon which was occupied by Allied forces. He quickly increased the available artillery and proposed a plan to capture a hill fort where republican guns could dominate the city&#x27;s harbour and force the Allies to evacuate. The successful assault on the position on 16–17 December led to the capture of the city.

Toulon brought Bonaparte to the attention of powerful men including Augustin Robespierre, the younger brother of Maximilien Robespierre, a leading Jacobin. He was promoted to brigadier general and put in charge of defences on the Mediterranean coast. In February 1794, he was made artillery commander of the Army of Italy and devised plans to attack the Kingdom of Sardinia.

The French army carried out Bonaparte&#x27;s plan in the Second Battle of Saorgio in April 1794, and then advanced to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, it headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the Republic of Genoa to determine the country&#x27;s intentions towards France.

===13 Vendémiaire===
After the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794, Bonaparte&#x27;s association with leading Jacobins made him politically suspect to the new regime. He was arrested on 9 August but released two weeks later. He was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions as part of France&#x27;s war with Austria and, in March 1795, he took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the Royal Navy.

From 1794, Bonaparte was in a romantic relationship with Désirée Clary whose sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte&#x27;s elder brother Joseph. In April 1795, Bonaparte was assigned to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in the Vendée region. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella &quot;Clisson et Eugénie&quot;, about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte&#x27;s own relationship with Clary.

In August, he obtained a position with the Bureau of Topography where he worked on military planning. On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for refusing to serve in the Vendée campaign. He sought a transfer to Constantinople to offer his services to Sultan Selim III. The request was eventually granted, but he never took up the post.

On 3 October, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention. Paul Barras, a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction, knew of Bonaparte&#x27;s military exploits at Toulon and made him second in command of the forces defending the convention in the Tuileries Palace. Bonaparte had seen the massacre of the King&#x27;s Swiss Guard during the Insurrection of 10 August 1792 there three years earlier and realized that artillery would be the key to its defence. He ordered a young cavalry officer, Joachim Murat, to seize cannons and Bonaparte deployed them in key positions. On 5 October 1795—&quot;13 Vendémiaire An IV&quot; in the French Republican calendar—he fired on the rebels with canister rounds (later called: &quot;a whiff of grapeshot&quot;). About 300 to 1,400 rebels died in the uprising.

Bonaparte&#x27;s role in defeating the rebellion earned him and his family the patronage of the new government, the French Directory. On 26 October, he was promoted to commander of the Army of the Interior, and in January 1796 he was appointed head of the Army of Italy.

Within weeks of the &quot;Vendémiaire&quot; uprising&quot;,&quot; Bonaparte was romantically involved with Joséphine de Beauharnais, the former mistress of Barras. Josephine had been born in the French colonies in the Lesser Antilles, and her family owned slaves on sugar plantations The couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony. Bonaparte now habitually styled himself &quot;Napoleon Bonaparte&quot; rather than using the Italian form &quot;Napoleone di Buonaparte.&quot;

===First Italian campaign===
Two days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. He went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the Kingdom of Sardinia in Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of victories during the Montenotte campaign, he knocked the Piedmontese out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians, laying siege to Mantua. The Austrians launched offensives against the French to break the siege, but Bonaparte defeated every relief effort, winning the Battle of Castiglione, the Battle of Bassano, the Battle of Arcole, and the Battle of Rivoli. The French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, Austria lost 43% of its soldiers dead, wounded or taken prisoner.

The French then invaded the heartlands of the House of Habsburg. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen in 1796, but Charles withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning of Bonaparte&#x27;s assault. In their first encounter, Bonaparte pushed Charles back and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797. Alarmed by the French thrust that reached Leoben, about 100 km from Vienna, the Austrians sued for peace.

The preliminary peace of Leoben, signed on 18 April, gave France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries, and promised to partition the Republic of Venice with Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of Venetian independence. He authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark.

In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte&#x27;s army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 standards. The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte&#x27;s tactics. Bonaparte extracted an estimated 45 million French pounds from Italy during the campaign, another 12 million pounds in precious metals and jewels, and more than 300 paintings and sculptures.

During the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and one for circulation in France. The royalists attacked him for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.

Bonaparte sent General Charles-Pierre Augereau to Paris to support a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that purged royalists from the legislative councils on 4 September—the Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his republican allies in control again but more dependent upon Bonaparte who finalized peace terms with Austria by the Treaty of Campo Formio. Bonaparte returned to Paris on 5 December 1797 as a hero. He met Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, France&#x27;s Foreign Minister, and took command of the Army of England for the planned invasion of Britain.

===Egyptian expedition===

After two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France&#x27;s naval strength was not yet sufficient to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain&#x27;s access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East and join forces with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore, an enemy of the British. Bonaparte assured the Directory that &quot;as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions&quot;. The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to the Indian subcontinent.

In May 1798, Bonaparte was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences. His Egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists, with mathematicians, naturalists, chemists, and geodesists among them. Their discoveries included the Rosetta Stone, and their work was published in the &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; in 1809. En route to Egypt, Bonaparte reached Hospitaller Malta on 9 June 1798, then controlled by the Knights Hospitaller. Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim surrendered after token resistance, and Bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men.

Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July. He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks, Egypt&#x27;s ruling military caste. This helped the French practise their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July, about from the pyramids. Bonaparte&#x27;s forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks&#x27; Egyptian cavalry. Twenty-nine French and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed. The victory boosted the French army&#x27;s morale.

On 1 August 1798, the British fleet under Sir Horatio Nelson captured or destroyed all but two vessels of the French fleet in the Battle of the Nile, preventing Bonaparte from strengthening the French position in the Mediterranean. His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings. In early 1799, he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus (Syria and Galilee). Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa. The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal. Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war, ostensibly on parole, so he ordered the garrison and some 1,500–5,000 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning. Men, women, and children were robbed and murdered for three days.

Bonaparte began with an army of 13,000 men. 1,500 were reported missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. Bonaparte was alleged to have ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium to speed the retreat. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.

Bonaparte stayed informed of European affairs. He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition. On 24 August 1799, fearing that the Republic&#x27;s future was in doubt, he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris. The army was left in the charge of Jean-Baptiste Kléber.

==Ruler of France==

=== &quot;18 Brumaire&quot; ===

Unknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return from Egypt with his army to ward off a possible invasion of France, but these messages never arrived. By the time that he reached Paris in October, France&#x27;s situation had been improved by a series of victories. The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular. Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero&#x27;s welcome. The Directory discussed Bonaparte&#x27;s desertion but was too weak to punish him.

Bonaparte formed an alliance with Talleyrand and leading members of the Council of Five Hundred and Directory: Lucien Bonaparte, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, Roger Ducos and Joseph Fouché to overthrow the government. On 9 November 1799 (&quot;18 Brumaire&quot; according to the revolutionary calendar), the conspirators launched a coup, and the following day, backed by grenadiers with fixed bayonets, forced the Council of Five Hundred to dissolve the Directory and appoint Bonaparte, Sieyès and Ducos provisional consuls.

===French Consulate===
On 15 December, Bonaparte introduced the Constitution of the Year VIII, under which three consuls were appointed for 10 years. Real power lay with Bonaparte as First Consul, and his preferred candidates Cambacérès and Charles-François Lebrun were appointed as second and third consuls who only had an advisory role. The constitution also established a Legislative Body and Tribunate which were selected from indirectly elected candidates, and a Senate and Council of State which were effectively nominated by the executive.

The new constitution was approved by plebiscite on 7 February 1800. The official count was over three million in favour and 1,562 against. Lucien, however, had doubled the count of the &quot;yes&quot; vote to give the false impression that a majority of those eligible to vote had approved the constitution.

Historians have variously described Bonaparte&#x27;s new regime as &quot;dictatorship by plebiscite&quot;, &quot;absolutist rule decked out in the spirit of the age&quot;, and &quot;soft despotism&quot;. Local and regional administration was reformed to concentrate power in the central government, censorship was introduced, and most opposition newspapers were closed down to stifle dissent. Royalist and regional revolts were dealt with by a combination of amnesties for those who lay down their arms and brutal repression of those who continued to resist. Bonaparte also improved state finances by securing loans under a promise to defend private property, raising taxes on tobacco, alcohol and salt, and extracting levies from France&#x27;s satellite republics.

Bonaparte believed that the best way to secure his regime was by a victorious peace. In May 1800, he led an army across the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Bonaparte was still in Egypt. After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French captured Milan on 2 June.

The French confronted an Austrian army under Michael von Melas at Marengo on 14 June. The Austrians fielded about 30,000 soldiers while Bonaparte commanded 24,000 troops. The Austrians&#x27; initial attack surprised the French who were gradually driven back. Late in the afternoon, however, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and reversed the tide of the battle. The Austrian army fled leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrians signed an armistice and agreed to abandon Northern Italy.

When peace negotiations with Austria stalled, Bonaparte reopened hostilities in November. A French army under General Moreau swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory over the Austrians at Hohenlinden in December. The Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio.

Bonaparte&#x27;s triumph at Marengo increased his popularity and political authority. However, he still faced royalist plots and feared Jacobin influence, especially in the army. Several assassination plots, including the &quot;Conspiration des poignards&quot; (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise two months later, gave him a pretext to arrest about 100 suspected Jacobins and royalists, some of whom were shot and many others deported to penal colonies.

====Temporary peace in Europe====
After a decade of war, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Under the treaty, Britain agreed to withdraw from most of the colonies it had recently captured from France and her allies, and France agreed to evacuate Naples. In April, Bonaparte publicly celebrated the peace and his controversial Concordat of 1801 with Pope Pius VII under which the Pope recognized Bonaparte&#x27;s regime and the regime recognized Catholicism as the majority religion of France. In a further step towards national reconciliation (known as &quot;fusion&quot;), Bonaparte offered an amnesty to most émigrés who wished to return to France.

With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Bonaparte became increasingly popular, both domestically and abroad. In May 1802, the Council of State recommended a new plebiscite asking the French people to make &quot;Napoleon Bonaparte&quot; Consul for life. (It was the first time his first name was officially used by the regime.) About 3.6 million voted &quot;yes&quot; and 8,374 &quot;no.&quot; 40%-60% of eligible Frenchmen voted, the highest turnout for a plebiscite since the Revolution.

France had regained her overseas colonies under Amiens but did not control them all. The French National Convention had voted to abolish slavery in February 1794, but, in May 1802, Bonaparte reintroduced it in all the recovered colonies except Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe which were under the control of rebel generals. A French military expedition under Antoine Richepanse regained control of Guadeloupe and slavery was reintroduced there on 16 July.

Saint-Domingue was the most profitable of the colonies a major source of sugar, coffee and indigo but was under the control of the former slave Toussaint Louverture. Bonaparte sent the Saint-Domingue expedition under his brother-in-law General Leclerc to retake the colony and they landed there in February 1802 with 29,000 men. Although Toussaint was captured and sent to France in July, the expedition ultimately failed due to high rates of disease and a string of defeats against rebel commander Jean-Jacques Dessalines. In May 1803, Bonaparte acknowledged defeat, and the last 8,000 French troops left the island. The former slaves proclaimed the independent republic of Haiti in 1804.

As war with Britain again loomed in 1803, Bonaparte realized that his American colony of Louisiana would be difficult to defend. In need of funds, he agreed to the Louisiana Purchase with the United States, doubling the latter&#x27;s size. The price was $15 million.

The peace with Britain was uneasy. Britain did not evacuate Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte&#x27;s annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly, as did Bonaparte&#x27;s occupation of Holland and apparent ambitions in India. The dispute culminated in a declaration of war by Britain in May 1803. Bonaparte responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne and ordering the arrest of every British male between eighteen and sixty years old in France and its dependencies as a prisoner of war.

===French Empire===


==== Bonaparte becomes Napoleon I ====
In February 1804, Bonaparte&#x27;s police made a series of arrests in relation to a royalist plot to kidnap or assassinate him that involved the British government, Moreau and an unnamed Bourbon prince. On the advice of his foreign minister, Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though there was no proof he had been involved in the plot. Enghien&#x27;s kidnapping and execution infuriated royalists and monarchs throughout Europe, and drew a formal protest from Russia.

Following the royalist plot, Bonaparte&#x27;s supporters convinced him that creating a hereditary regime would help secure it in case of his death, make it more acceptable to constitutional monarchists, and put it on the same footing as other European monarchies. On 18 May, the senate proclaimed Napoleon &quot;Emperor of the French&quot; and approved a new constitution. The following day, Napoleon appointed 18 of his leading generals Marshals of the Empire.The hereditary empire was confirmed by a plebiscite in June. The official result showed 3.5 million voted &quot;yes&quot; and 2,569 voted &quot;no&quot;. The yes count, however, was falsely inflated by 300,000 to 500,000 votes. The turnout, at 35%, was below the figure for the previous plebiscite. Britain, Russia, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire refused to recognize Napoleon&#x27;s new title. Austria, however, recognized Napoleon as Emperor of the French in return for his recognition of Francis I as Emperor of Austria.

Napoleon&#x27;s coronation, with the participation of Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre Dame de Paris, on 2 December 1804. After having been anointed by the pope, Napoleon crowned himself with a replica of Charlemagne&#x27;s crown. He then crowned Joséphine, who became only the second woman in French history, after Marie de&#x27; Medici, to be crowned and anointed. He then swore an oath to defend the territory of the Republic; to respect the Concordat, freedom of worship, political and civil liberty and the sale of nationalized lands; to raise no taxes except by law; to maintain the Legion of Honour; and to govern in the interests, wellbeing and the glory of the French people.

On 26 May, Napoleon crowned himself King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan. Austria saw this as a provocation because of its own territorial interests in Italy. When Napoleon incorporated Genoa and Liguria into his empire, Austria formally protested against this violation of the Treaty of Lunéville.

====War of the Third Coalition====

 By September 1805, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Naples and the Ottoman Empire had joined Britain in a coalition against France.

In 1803 and 1804, Napoleon had assembled a force around Boulogne for an invasion of Britain. They never invaded, but the force formed the core of Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, created in August 1805. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, artillery and cavalry reserves, and the élite Imperial Guard. By August 1805, the had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.

To facilitate the invasion, Napoleon planned to lure the Royal Navy from the English Channel by a diversionary attack on the British West Indies. However, the plan unravelled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to Cádiz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel.

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, Napoleon abandoned his invasion of England and sought to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian ally could arrive in force. On 25 September, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of .

Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered most of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon&#x27;s army, however, moved quickly and outflanked the Austrian positions. After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack surrendered. For just 2,000 French casualties, Napoleon had captured 60,000 Austrian soldiers through his army&#x27;s rapid marching.

For the French, this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the Royal Navy attained at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. After Trafalgar, the Royal Navy was never again seriously challenged by Napoleon&#x27;s fleet.

French forces occupied Vienna in November, capturing 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. Napoleon then sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies. Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Francis I decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates.

At the Battle of Austerlitz, on 2 December, Napoleon deployed his army below the Pratzen Heights. He ordered his right wing to feign retreat, enticing the Allies to descend from the heights in pursuit. The French centre and left wing then captured the heights and caught the allies in a pincer movement. Thousands of Russian troops fled across a frozen lake to escape the trap and 100 to 2,000 of them drowned. About a third of the allied forces were killed, captured or wounded.

The disaster at Austerlitz led Austria to seek an armistice. By the subsequent Treaty of Pressburg, signed on 26 December, Austria left the coalition, lost substantial territory to the Kingdom of Italy and Bavaria, and was forced to pay an indemnity of 40 million francs. Alexander&#x27;s army was granted safe passage back to Russia.

Napoleon went on to say, &quot;The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought&quot;. Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a &quot;personal Napoleonic one&quot;. Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, &quot;he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen&quot;.

====Middle-Eastern alliances====
Napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia, possibly by forming an alliance with the Ottoman Empire. In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III recognized Napoleon as &quot;Emperor&quot;. He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France &quot;our sincere and natural ally&quot;. That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain. A Franco-Persian alliance was formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar. It collapsed in 1807 when France and Russia formed an unexpected alliance. In the end, Napoleon made no effective alliances in the Middle East.

====War of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit====


After Austerlitz, Napoleon increased his political power in Europe. In 1806, he deposed the Bourbon king of Naples and installed his elder brother, Joseph, on the throne. He then made his younger brother, Louis, King of Holland. He also established the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe. The creation of the confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire.

Napoleon&#x27;s growing influence in Germany threatened the status of Prussia as a great power and in response Frederick William III decided on war with France. Prussia and Russia signed a new military alliance creating the fourth coalition against France. Prussia, however, committed a strategic blunder by declaring war when French troops were still in southern Germany and months before sufficient Russian troops could reach the front.

Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards thus cutting the Prussians off from Berlin and the slowly approaching Russians. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which quickly disintegrated.

In the following month, the French captured 140,000 soldiers and over 2,000 cannon. Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.

Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806. The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign.

In the next few months, Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and fought a bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807. After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides, the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive.

On 14 June Napoleon obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland, inflicting casualties of up to 30% of the Russian army. The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. The two emperors began peace negotiations on 25 June at the town of Tilsit during a meeting on a raft floating in the middle of the River Niemen which separated the French and Russian troops and their respective spheres of influence.

Napoleon offered Alexander relatively lenient terms—demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. In contrast, Prussia was treated harshly. It lost half its territory and population and underwent a two-year occupation costing it about 1.4 billion francs. From former Prussian territory, Napoleon created the Kingdom of Westphalia, ruled by his young brother Jérôme, and the Duchy of Warsaw.

Prussia&#x27;s humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused lasting resentment against France in that country. The treaty was also unpopular in Russia, putting pressure on Alexander to end the alliance with France. Nevertheless, the Treaties of Tilsit gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.

====Peninsular War and Erfurt====

After Tilsit, Napoleon turned his attention to Portugal, which was reluctant to strictly enforce the blockade against its traditional ally Britain. On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish consent and headed towards Portugal to enforce the blockade. Junot occupied Lisbon in November, but the Portuguese royal family had already fled to Brazil with the Portuguese fleet.

In March 1808, a palace coup led to the abdication of the Spanish king Carlos IV in favour of his son Fernando VII. The following month, Napoleon summoned Carlos and Fernando to Bayonne where, in May, he forced them both to relinquish their claims to the Spanish throne. Napoleon then made his brother Joseph King of Spain.

By then, there were 120,000 French troops garrisoned in the peninsula and widespread Spanish opposition to the occupation and the overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons. On 2 May, an uprising against the French broke out in Madrid and spread throughout Spain in the following weeks. In the face of brutal French repression, the uprising developed into a sustained conflict.

In July, Joseph travelled to Madrid where he was proclaimed King of Spain on the 24th. However, following news of a French defeat by regular Spanish forces at the Battle of Bailén, Joseph fled Madrid several days later. The following month, a British force landed in Portugal and, on the 21st, they defeated the French at Vimiero. Under the Convention of Cintra, the French evacuated Portugal.

The defeats at Bailén and Vimiero convinced Napoleon that he had to take command of the Iberian campaign. Before leaving for Spain, he attempted to strengthen the alliance with Russia and obtain a commitment from Alexander that Russia would declare war on Austria if she attacked France. At the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808, Napoleon and Alexander reached an agreement that recognized the Russian conquest of Finland and called upon Britain to cease its war against France. However, Alexander failed to provide a firm commitment to make war with Austria.

On 6 November, Napoleon was in Vitoria and took command of 240,000 French troops. After a series of victories over Anglo-Spanish forces, they retook Madrid on 4 December. Napoleon then pursued the retreating British forces who were eventually evacuated at Corunna in January 1809. Napoleon left for France on 17 January, leaving Joseph in command.

Napoleon never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. In April, the British sent another army to the peninsula under Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. British, Portuguese and Spanish regular forces engaged the French in a protracted series of conflicts. Meanwhile, a brutal guerrilla war engulfed much of the Spanish countryside, a conflict in which atrocities were committed by both sides.

Napoleon later called the Peninsular campaign, &quot;the unlucky war [that] ruined me.&quot; It tied up some 300,000 French troops from 1808 to 1812. By 1814, the French had been driven from the peninsula, with over 150,000 casualties in the campaign.

====War of the Fifth Coalition====

The overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons caused alarm in Austria over Napoleon&#x27;s ambitions while France&#x27;s military difficulties in the Peninsular encouraged Austria to go to war. In the early morning of 10 April 1809, the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The Austrian advance, however, was disorganized and they were unable to defeat the Bavarian army before the French could concentrate their forces. Napoleon arrived from Paris on the 17th to lead the French campaign. In the following Battle of Eckmühl he was slightly wounded in the heel but the Austrians were forced to retreat across the Danube. The French occupied Vienna on 13 May but most of the population had fled and the retreating army had destroyed all four bridges across the river.

On 21 May, the French attempted to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other and the French were forced back. The battle was reported in European capitals as a defeat for Napoleon and damaged his aura of invincibility.

After six weeks of preparations, Napoleon made another attempt at crossing the Danube. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram (5–6 July) the Austrians were forced to retreat but the French and Austrians each suffered losses of 37,000 to 39,000 killed, wounded or captured. The French caught up with the retreating Austrians at Znaim on 10 July, and the latter signed an armistice on the 12th.

In August, a British force landed in Holland but lost 4,000 men, mainly to illness, before withdrawing in December.

The Treaty of Schönbrunn in October 1809 was harsh for Austria which lost substantial territory and over three million subjects. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports of Trieste and Fiume(Rijeka); the part of Poland annexed by Austria in the third partition in 1795, known at the time as West Galicia, was given to the Polish-ruled Duchy of Warsaw; and the territory of the former Archbishopric of Salzburg went to Bavaria. Austria was required to pay an indemnity of 200 million francs and its army was reduced to 150,000 men.

==== Consolidation of the Empire ====
Napoleon&#x27;s union with Joséphine had not produced a child, and he decided to secure the dynasty and strengthen its position in Europe by a strategic marriage into one of Europe&#x27;s major royal houses. In November 1809, he announced his decision to divorce Joséphine and the marriage was annulled in January 1810. Napoleon had already commenced negotiations for the marriage of Tsar Alexander&#x27;s sister Anna, but the Tsar responded that she was too young. Napoleon then turned to Austria, and a marriage to the Austrian Emperor&#x27;s daughter, Marie Louise, was quickly agreed.

The marriage was formalized in a civil ceremony on 1 April and a religious service at the Louvre on the following day. The marriage to Marie Louise was widely seen as a shift in French policy towards stronger ties with Austria and away from the already strained relationship with Russia. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to the heir apparent, François Charles Joseph Napoleon, King of Rome.

With the annexation of the Papal states (May 1809, February 1810), Holland (July 1810) and the northern coastal regions of Westphalia (August 1810), mainland France further increased its territory. Napoleon now ruled about 40% of the European population either directly or indirectly through his satellite kingdoms.

====Invasion of Russia====

Tsar Alexander saw the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, Napoleon&#x27;s marriage alliance with Austria and the election of the French Marshal Bernadotte as Crown Prince of Sweden as attempts to contain Russia. In December 1810, Napoleon annexed the Duchy of Oldenburg which Alexander considered an insult as his uncle was the duke. The Tsar responded by allowing neutral shipping into Russian ports and banning most French imports. Russia feared that Napoleon intended to restore the Kingdom of Poland while Napoleon suspected Russia of seeking an alliance with Britain against France.

In late 1811, Napoleon began planning an invasion of Russia. A Franco-Prussian alliance signed in February 1812 forced Prussia to provide 20,000 troops for the invasion and, in March, Austria agreed to provide 30,000 men. Napoleon&#x27;s multinational &quot;grande armée&quot; comprised around 450,000 frontline troops of which about a third were native French speakers. Napoleon called the invasion the &quot;Second Polish War,&quot; but he refused to guarantee an independent Poland for fear of alienating his Austrian and Prussian allies.

On 24 June, Napoleon&#x27;s troops began crossing the Nieman river into Russian Lithuania with the aim of luring the Russians into one or two decisive battles. The Russians retreated 320 kilometres east to the Dvina river and implemented a scorched earth policy, making it increasingly difficult for the French to forage food for themselves and their horses. On 18 August, Napoleon captured Smolensk with the loss of 9,000 of his men, but the Russians were able to withdraw in good order.

The Russians, now commanded by Kutuzov, made a stand at Borodino, outside Moscow, on 7 September. The battle resulted in 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, in one of the bloodiest days of battle in Europe up to that time. The Russians withdrew overnight and Napoleon later stated, &quot;The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves worthy of victory, and the Russians worthy of being invincible&quot;.

The Russians retreated to Tarutino, and Napoleon entered Moscow on 14 September. The following evening, the city was set on fire on the orders of its governor Feodor Rostopchin. Alexander, in St Petersburg, refused to negotiate a peace, and after six weeks Napoleon&#x27;s army evacuated Moscow.

After capturing Maloyaroslavets with the loss of 4,000 to 10,000 men, Napoleon retreated towards Smolensk. The French were attacked by Cossacks and peasants and suffered from the intense cold, disease and lack of food and water. Around 40,000 to 50,000 troops reached Smolensk on 9 November, a loss of about 60,000 in three weeks. Napoleon also heard that an attempted coup by General Malet in Paris had only narrowly failed.

From Smolensk, Napoleon&#x27;s army headed for Vilnius, where there was a French garrison of 20,000. In late November, under attack from all sides by Russian forces, the &quot;grande armée&quot; managed to cross the Berezina river on pontoon bridges in temperatures reaching . On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left his disintegrating army for Paris. In the following weeks, the remnants of the &quot;grande armée&quot;, about 75,000 troops, crossed the Nieman into allied territory. Russian military losses in the campaign were up to 300,000 and total military deaths from both sides were up to one million.

====War of the Sixth Coalition====


The French, pursued by the Russians, withdrew from most of Poland and Prussia over the winter of 1812–13 while both sides rebuilt their forces. Sweden and Prussia declared war on France in March 1813. In April, Napoleon assumed command of an army of 200,000 troops, and defeated the coalition at Lützen and Bautzen. Britain formally joined the coalition in June followed by Austria in August, but the allies were again defeated in the Battle of Dresden (August 1813).

The coalition, however, had a growing advantage in infantry, cavalry, reserves and armaments. In the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars, the coalition was victorious at Leipzig in October. Although coalition casualties were 54,000 men, the French lost 38,000 killed or wounded and 15,000 taken prisoner. Up to 50,000 more were lost to death, illness and desertion during the French retreat to the Rhine.

The Frankfurt proposals were peace terms offered by the coalition in November 1813 under which Napoleon would remain emperor, but France would be reduced to its &quot;natural frontiers.&quot; That meant that France would retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the west bank of the Rhine, while withdrawing from Spain, Holland, Italy and Germany. Napoleon did not accept the terms and the allies crossed the Rhine into French territory on 1 January 1814. Wellington&#x27;s British forces had already crossed the Pyrenees into south-western France.

In north-eastern France, Napoleon led about 70,000 troops against a coalition army of 200,000. After a defeat at La Rothière, the French won a series of victories in February which induced the coalition to offer peace on the basis of France&#x27;s 1791 frontiers. Napoleon, however, decided to fight on.

After a series of battles in March, the allies forced Napoleon to retreat at the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube (20–21 March). The coalition then moved towards Paris, whose defence was under the command of Joseph Bonaparte. On 29 March, a coalition army of 200,000 began their attack on the Belleville and Montmartre heights. Empress Marie Louise fled Paris that evening with her son, the King of Rome. With an army of only 38,000 to defend the capital, Joseph authorized the French marshal Auguste de Marmont to capitulate on 31 March. The following day, the allies accepted Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord as head of a provisional government. On 2 April, the Senate deposed Napoleon.

Meanwhile, Napoleon was in Fontainebleau with an army of 40,000 to 60,000. He contemplated a march on Paris but, on 4 April, his senior commanders persuaded him to abdicate in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. Tsar Alexander, however, demanded an unconditional abdication and Napoleon reluctantly complied on 6 April.

In his farewell address to the soldiers of the Old Guard on 20 April, Napoleon said:
===Exile to Elba===


With the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 11 April 1814, the allies exiled Napoleon to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, off the Tuscan coast, where they made him sovereign. The following night, Napoleon attempted suicide with poison he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow. Its potency had weakened with age, however, and he survived to be exiled, while his wife and son took refuge in Austria. He was conveyed to the island on HMS &quot;Undaunted&quot; and disembarked at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814. In the first few months on Elba, he drew up plans for administrative reforms, road and building works, and improvements to the island&#x27;s mines and agriculture, but results were limited by lack of funds. When Napoleon learned that Joséphine had died in France on 29 May, he was distraught and locked himself in his room for two days.

Napoleon understood that the French king Louis XVIII was unpopular. Realizing that his wife and son would not be joining him in exile, cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean, Napoleon escaped from Elba in the brig &quot;Inconstant&quot; on 26 February 1815 with about 1,000 men and a flotilla of seven vessels.

===Hundred Days===

On 1 March 1815, Napoleon and his followers landed on the French mainland at Golfe-Juan and headed for Grenoble through the foothills of the Alps, taking the route now known as Route Napoléon. The 5th Regiment intercepted him just south of Grenoble on 7 March. Napoleon approached the battalion alone and called to them, &quot;Here I am. Kill your Emperor, if you wish!&quot; The soldiers responded with, &quot;Vive l&#x27;empereur!&quot; and joined Napoleon&#x27;s men. Six days later, 5,000 troops under Michel Ney, who had boasted that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, also joined Napoleon.

On 13 March, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw. Four days later, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia each pledged to put 150,000 men into the field to end his rule. Louis XVIII, however, fled Paris for Belgium in the early hours of 20 March after realizing that he did not have enough reliable troops to oppose Napoleon. Napoleon entered Paris that evening.

Napoleon appointed a government and introduced constitutional changes which were approved by plebiscite in May. A Chamber of Representatives was also indirectly elected that month on a highly restrictive property franchise. Napoleon&#x27;s priority was to raise an army to face the coalition, but the law did not allow conscription and he was only able to raise about 300,000 men, mostly raw recruits and national guards.

On 12 June, Napoleon led about 124,000 men, known as the Army of the North, into Belgium, aiming to drive a wedge between Wellington&#x27;s army of 112,000 British, German and Dutch troops and Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s force of 130,000 Prussians and Saxons. After engagements at the Battle of Ligny and Battle of Quatre Bras, Napoleon confronted Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. Wellington&#x27;s army withstood repeated attacks by the French until, late in the afternoon, Blücher&#x27;s Prussians arrived in force on Napoleon&#x27;s right flank. The coalition forces broke through Napoleon&#x27;s lines, inflicting a devastating defeat.

Napoleon returned to Paris and found that the legislature had turned against him. Realizing that his position was untenable, he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son. He left Paris three days later and settled at Joséphine&#x27;s former palace in Château de Malmaison. By 28 June, the Prussian army was at Senlis, just north of Paris.

When Napoleon heard that Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive, he fled to Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, considering an escape to the United States. However, when he found that British ships were blockading the port, he surrendered to Frederick Lewis Maitland on on 15 July 1815.

==Exile on Saint Helena==

Napoleon was held in British custody and transferred to the island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, from the west coast of Africa. Napoleon and 27 followers arrived at Jamestown, Saint Helena, in October 1815 on board HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot;. The prisoner was guarded by a garrison of 2,100 soldiers while a squadron of 10 ships continuously patrolled the waters to prevent escape. In the following years, there were rumours of escape plots, but no serious attempts were made.

Napoleon stayed for two months at a pavilion in Briars before he was moved to Longwood House, a 40-room wooden bungalow. The location and interior of the house were damp, windswept, rat-infested and unhealthy. &quot;The Times&quot; published articles insinuating the British government was trying to hasten his death. Napoleon often complained of his living conditions in letters to the island&#x27;s governor, Hudson Lowe, while his attendants complained of &quot;colds, catarrhs, damp floors and poor provisions&quot;.

Napoleon insisted on imperial formality. When he held a dinner party, men were expected to wear military dress and &quot;women [appeared] in evening gowns and gems. It was an explicit denial of the circumstances of his captivity&quot;. He formally received visitors, read, and dictated his memoirs and commentaries on military campaigns. He studied English under Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases for a few months but gave up as he was poor at languages.

Napoleon also circulated reports of poor treatment in the hope that public opinion would force the allies to revoke his exile on Saint Helena. Under instructions from the British government, Lowe cut Napoleon&#x27;s expenditure, refused to recognize him as a former emperor, and made his supporters sign a guarantee they would stay with the prisoner indefinitely. Accounts of the mistreatment led, in March 1817, to a debate in parliament and Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland&#x27;s call for an inquiry.


In mid-1817, Napoleon&#x27;s health worsened. His physician, Barry O&#x27;Meara, diagnosed chronic hepatitis and warned Lowe that he could die from the poor climate and lack of exercise. Lowe thought O&#x27;Meara was exaggerating and dismissed him in July 1818.

In November 1818, the allies announced that Napoleon would remain a prisoner on Saint Helena for life. When he learnt the news, he became depressed and more isolated, spending longer periods in his rooms which further undermined his health. A number of his entourage also left Saint Helena including Las Cases in December 1816, General Gaspard Gourgaud in March 1818 and Albine de Montholon, who was possibly Napoleon&#x27;s lover, in July 1819.

In September 1819, two priests and a new physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, joined Napoleon&#x27;s retinue.

===Death===

Napoleon&#x27;s health continued to worsen, and in March 1821 he was confined to bed. In April he wrote two wills declaring that he had been murdered by the British, that the Bourbons would fall and that his son would rule France. He left his fortune to 97 legatees and asked to be buried by the Seine.

On 3 May he was given the last rites but could not take communion due to his illness. He died on 5 May 1821 at age 51. His last words, variously recorded by those present, were either &quot;France, l&#x27;armée, tête d&#x27;armée, Joséphine&quot; (&quot;France, the army, head of the army, Joséphine&quot;), or &quot;qui recule&quot;...&quot;à la tête d&#x27;armée&quot; (&quot;who retreats... at the head of the army&quot;) or &quot;France, my son, the Army.&quot;

Antommarchi and the British wrote separate autopsy reports, each concluding that Napoleon had died of internal bleeding caused by stomach cancer, the disease that had killed his father. A later theory, based on high concentrations of arsenic found in samples of Napoleon&#x27;s hair, held that Napoleon had died of arsenic poisoning. However, subsequent studies also found high concentrations of arsenic in hair samples from Napoleon&#x27;s childhood and from his son and Joséphine. Arsenic was widely used in medicines and products such as hair creams in the 19th century. A 2021 study by an international team of gastrointestinal pathologists once again concluded that Napoleon died of stomach cancer.

Napoleon was buried with military honours in the Valley of the Geraniums. Napoleon&#x27;s heart and intestines were removed and sealed inside his coffin. Napoleon&#x27;s penis was allegedly removed during the autopsy and sold and exhibited. In 1840, the British government gave Louis Philippe I permission to return Napoleon&#x27;s remains to France. Napoleon&#x27;s body was exhumed and found to be well preserved as it had been sealed in four coffins (two of metal and two of mahogany) and placed in a masonry tomb. On 15 December 1840, a state funeral was held in Paris with 700,000-1,000,000 attendees who lined the route of the funeral procession to the chapel of Les Invalides. The coffin was later placed in the cupola in St Jérôme&#x27;s Chapel, where it remained until Napoleon&#x27;s tomb, designed by Louis Visconti, was completed. In 1861, during the reign of Napoleon III, his remains were entombed in a sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.

==Religion==

=== Religious beliefs ===
Napoleon was baptized in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771, and raised a Roman Catholic. He began to question his faith at age 13 while at Brienne. Biographers have variously described him from that time as a deist, a follower of Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;natural religion&quot; or a believer in destiny. He consistently expressed his belief in a God or creator.

He understood the power of organized religion in social and political affairs, and later sought to use it to support his regime. His attitude to religion is often described as utilitarian. In 1800 he stated, &quot;it was by making myself a Catholic that I won the war in the Vendée, by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt, by making myself an ultramontane that I turned men&#x27;s hearts towards me in Italy. If I were to govern a nation of Jews I would rebuild the Temple of Solomon.&quot;

Napoleon had a civil marriage with Joséphine in 1796 and, at the pope&#x27;s insistence, a private religious ceremony with her the day before his coronation as Emperor in 1804. This marriage was annulled by tribunals under Napoleon&#x27;s control in January 1810. In April 1810, Napoleon married Austrian princess Marie Louise in a Catholic ceremony. Napoleon was excommunicated by the pope through the bull &quot;Quum memoranda&quot; in 1809. His will in 1821 stated, &quot;I die in the Apostolical Roman religion, in the bosom of which I was born, more than fifty years since.&quot;

Napoleon read the Koran in translation and had an interest in Islam and the Orient. He also defended Muhammad (&quot;a great man&quot;) against Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Mahomet&quot;.

===Concordat===
Seeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, Napoleon and Pope Pius VII agreed to the Concordat of 1801. The agreement recognized the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and in return the Church recognized Napoleon&#x27;s regime, undercutting much of the ground from royalists. The Concordat confirmed the seizure of Church lands and endowments during the revolution, but reintroduced state salaries for the clergy. The government also controlled the nomination of bishops for investiture by the pope. Bishops and other clergy were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime.

When the Concordat was published on 8 April 1802, Napoleon presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles, which further increased state control over the French Church. Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon, especially in Italy and Germany.

===Arrest of Pope Pius VII===
Napoleon progressively occupied and annexed the Papal States from 1805. When he annexed Rome in May 1809, the pope excommunicated him the following month. In July, French officials arrested the pope in the Vatican and exiled him to Savona. In 1812 the pontiff was transferred to the Palace of Fontainebleau in France. In January 1813, Napoleon pressured the pope to sign a new &quot;Concordat of Fontainebleau&quot; which was soon repudiated by the pontiff. The pope was not released until 1814.

===Religious emancipation===

In February 1795, the National Convention proclaimed religious equality for France&#x27;s Protestant churches and other religions. In April 1802, Napoleon published laws increasing state control of Calvinist congregations and Lutheran directories, with their pastors to be paid by the state. With Napoleon&#x27;s military victories, formal religious equality and civil rights for religious minorities spread to the conquered territories and satellite states, although their implementation varied with the local authorities.

The Jews of France had been granted full civil rights in September 1791 and religious equality in 1795. The revolutionary and Napoleonic regimes abolished Jewish ghettoes in the territories they conquered. Napoleon wished to assimilate Jews into French society and convened an assembly of Jewish notables in 1806 to that end. In 1807, he summoned a Sanhedrin to adapt the law of Moses to those of the empire. An imperial decree of March 1808 organized Jewish worship into consistories, limited usury and encouraged Jews to adopt a family name, intermarriage, and civil marriage and divorce. Jews, however, were still subject to discrimination in many parts of the empire and satellite states.

==Personality==
Pieter Geyl wrote in 1947, &quot;It is impossible that two historians, especially two historians living in different periods, should see any historical personality in the same light.&quot; There is no dispute that Napoleon was ambitious, although commentators disagree on whether his ambition was mostly for his own power and glory or for the welfare of France. Historians agree that Napoleon was highly intelligent with an excellent memory, and was a superior organizer who could work efficiently for long hours. In battle, he could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates, keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point.

He was an inspiring leader who could obtain the best from his soldiers and subordinates. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers. He could charm people when he needed to but could also publicly humiliate them and was known for his rages when his plans were frustrated. Historian McLynn sees him as a misogynist with a cruel streak which he often inflicted on women, children and animals.

There is debate over whether Napoleon was an outsider who never felt at home in France or with other people. Hippolyte Taine said Napoleon saw others only as instruments and was cut off from feelings of admiration, sympathy or pity. Arthur Lévy replied that Napoleon genuinely loved Joséphine and often showed humanity and compassion to his enemies or those who had let him down. He had the normal middle class virtues and understood the common man.

Similarly, historians are divided over whether Napoleon was consistently ruthless when his power was threatened or surprisingly indulgent in some cases. Those arguing for a ruthless personality point to episodes such as his violent suppression of revolts in France and conquered territories, his execution of the Duc d&#x27;Enghien and plotters against his rule, and his massacre of Turkish prisoners of war in Syria in 1799. Others point to his mild treatment of disloyal subordinates such as Charles XIV John, Talleyrand and Fouché.

Many historians see Napoleon as pragmatic and a realist, at least in the early years of his rule. He was not driven by ideology and promoted capable men irrespective of their political and social background, as long as they were loyal. As an expert in military matters, he valued technical expertise and listened to the advice of experts in other fields. However, there is a consensus that once he dominated Europe he became more intolerant of other views and surrounded himself with &quot;yes men&quot;. Towards the end of his reign he lost his realism and ability to compromise.

Some historians talk of Napoleon&#x27;s dual nature: a rationalist with a strong romantic streak. He took a team of scholars, artists and engineers with him to Egypt in order to scientifically study the country&#x27;s culture and history, but at the same time was struck by romantic &quot;orientalism&quot;. &quot;I was full of dreams,&quot; he stated. &quot;I saw myself founding a religion, marching into Asia, riding an elephant, a turban on my head and in my hand a new Koran that I would have composed to suit my need.&quot;

Napoleon was superstitious. He believed in omens, numerology, fate and lucky stars, and always asked of his generals: is he lucky? Dwyer states that Napoleon&#x27;s victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 left him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility. &quot;I am of the race that founds empires&quot;, he once boasted, deeming himself an heir to the Ancient Romans.

Various psychologists have attempted to explain Napoleon&#x27;s personality. Alfred Adler cited Napoleon to describe an inferiority complex in which short people adopt over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height; this inspired the term &quot;Napoleon complex&quot;. Adler, Erich Fromm and Wilhelm Reich ascribed his nervous energy to sexual dysfunction. Harold T. Parker speculated that rivalry with his older brother and bullying when he moved to France led him to develop an inferiority complex which made him domineering.

==Appearance and image==

In his youth, Bonaparte was consistently described as small and thin. Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger, who accompanied him in 1797 and 1798, noted that &quot;Bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated-looking; his face, too, was very thin, with a dark complexion... his black, unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders&quot;, but that, despite his slight and unkempt appearance, &quot;his looks and expression were earnest and powerful.&quot;

English painter Joseph Farington, who met him in 1802, said Bonaparte&#x27;s eyes were &quot;lighter, and more of a grey, than I should have expected from his complexion&quot;, that &quot;his person is below middle size&quot;, and that &quot;his general aspect was milder than I had before thought it.&quot;

In his later years Napoleon gained weight and had a sallow complexion. Novelist Paul de Kock, who saw him in 1811, called Napoleon &quot;yellow, obese, and bloated&quot;.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the British press depicted Napoleon as a dangerous tyrant, poised to invade. A nursery rhyme warned children that he ate naughty people; the &quot;bogeyman&quot;. He was mocked as a short-tempered small man and was nicknamed &quot;Little Boney in a strong fit&quot;. In fact, at about 170 cm (5 ft 7 in), he was of average height.

He is often portrayed wearing a large bicorne hat—sideways—with a hand-in-waistcoat gesture—a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.

==Reforms==
Napoleon instituted numerous reforms, many of which had a lasting influence on France, Europe and the world. He reformed the French administration, codified French law, implemented a new education system, and established the first French central bank, the Banque de France. He negotiated the Concordat of 1801 with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the majority Catholic population to his regime. It was presented alongside the Organic Articles, which regulated public worship in France. He also implemented civil and religious equality for Protestants and Jews. In May 1802, he instituted the Legion of Honour to encourage civilian and military achievements. The order is still the highest decoration in France. He introduced three French constitutions culminating in the reintroduction of a hereditary monarchy and nobility.

=== Administration ===
Napoleon introduced a series of centralizing administrative reforms soon after taking power. In 1800, he established prefects appointed to run France&#x27;s regional departments, sub-prefects to run districts and mayors to run towns. Local representative bodies were retained, but their powers were reduced and indirect elections with a high property qualification replaced direct elections. Real power in the regions was now in the hands of the prefects who were judged by how they met the main priorities of Napoleon&#x27;s government: efficient administration, law and order, stimulating the local economy, gathering votes for plebiscites, conscripting soldiers and provisioning the army.

An enduring reform was the foundation, in December 1799, of the Council of State, an advisory body of experts which could also draft laws for submission to the legislative body. Napoleon drew many of his ministers and ambassadors from the council. It was the council which undertook the codification of French law.

After several attempts by revolutionary governments, Napoleon officially introduced the metric system in France in 1801 and it was spread through western Europe by his armies. The new system was unpopular in some circles, so in 1812 he introduced a compromise system in the retail trade called the &quot;mesures usuelles&quot; (traditional units of measurement). In December 1805, Napoleon abolished the Revolutionary calendar, with its ten-day week, which had been introduced in 1793.

===Napoleonic Code===
Napoleon&#x27;s civil code of laws, known from 1807 as the Napoleonic Code, was implemented in March 1804. It was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the &quot;Second Consul&quot;. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The code introduced a clearly written and accessible set of national laws to replace the various regional and customary law systems that had operated in France.

The civil code entrenched the principles of equality before the law, religious toleration, secure property rights, equal inheritance for all legitimate children, and the abolition of the vestiges of feudalism. However, it also reduced the rights of women and children and severely restricted the grounds for divorce.

A criminal code was promulgated in 1808, and eventually seven codes of law were produced under Napoleon. The Napoleonic code was carried by Napoleon&#x27;s armies across Europe and influenced the law in many parts of the world. Alfred Cobban described it as, &quot;the most effective agency for the propagation of the basic principles of the French Revolution.&quot;

===Warfare===
In the field of military organization, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed what was already in place. He continued the Revolutionary policies of conscription and promotion based primarily on merit.

Corps replaced divisions as the largest army units, mobile artillery was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid, and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine. These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare.

Napoleon was regarded by the influential military theorist Carl von Clausewitz as a genius in the art of war, and many historians rank him as a great military commander. Wellington considered him the greatest military commander of all time, and Henry Vassall-Fox called him &quot;the greatest statesman and the ablest general of ancient or modern times&quot;. Cobban states that he showed his genius in moving troops quickly and concentrating them on strategic points. His principles were to keep his forces united, keep no weak point unguarded, seize important points quickly, and seize his chance. Owen Connelly, however, states, &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s personal tactics defy analysis.&quot; He used his intuition, engaged his troops, and reacted to what developed.

Napoleon was an aggressive commander with a preference for the offensive. Under Napoleon, the focus shifted towards destroying enemy armies rather than simply outmanoeuvering them. Wars became more costly and decisive as invasions of enemy territory occurred on larger fronts. The political cost of war also increased, as defeat for a European power now meant more than just losing isolated territories. Peace terms were often punitive, sometimes involving regime change, which intensified the trend towards total war since the Revolutionary era.

===Education===
Napoleon&#x27;s educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of secondary and tertiary education in France and throughout much of Europe. He synthesized academic elements from the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution. His education laws of 1802 left most primary education in the hands of religious or communal schools which taught basic literacy and numeracy for a minority of the population. He abolished the revolutionary central schools and replaced them with secondary schools and elite lycées where the curriculum was based on reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, natural history, classics, and ancient history.

He retained the revolutionary higher education system, with &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in professions including law, medicine, pharmacy, engineering and school teaching. He introduced &quot;grandes écoles&quot; in history and geography, but opposed one in literature because it was not vocational. He also founded the military academy of Saint Cyr. He promoted the advanced centres, such as the École Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and advanced research in science.

In 1808, he founded the Imperial University, a supervisory body with control over curriculum and discipline. The following year he introduced the baccalaureate. The system was designed to produce the efficient bureaucrats, technicians, professionals and military officers that the Napoleonic state required. It outperformed its European counterparts, many of which borrowed from the French system.

Female education, in contrast, was designed to be practical and religious, based on home science, the catechism, basic literacy and numeracy, and enough science to eradicate superstition.

=== Nobility and honours ===
In May 1802, Bonaparte created the Legion of Honour whose members would be military personnel and civilians with distinguished service to the state. The new institution was unpopular with republicans and the measure only passed by 14 votes to 10 in the Council of State. The Legion of Honour became an order of chivalry after the empire was proclaimed in 1804. In August 1806, Napoleon created an hereditary imperial nobility including princes, dukes, counts, barons and knights. Eventually the empire had over 3,000 nobles and more than 30,000 members of the Legion of Honour.

==Memory and evaluation==
===Criticism===

There is debate over whether Napoleon was &quot;an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe&quot; or &quot;a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler&quot;. He was compared to Adolf Hitler by Pieter Geyl in 1947, and Claude Ribbe in 2005. Most modern critics of Napoleon, however, reject the Hitler comparison, arguing that Napoleon did not commit genocide and did not engage in the mass murder and imprisonment of his political opponents. Nevertheless, David A. Bell and McLynn condemn his killing of 3,000–5,000 Turkish prisoners of war in Syria.

A number of historians have argued that his expansionist foreign policy was a major factor in the Napoleonic wars, which cost six million lives and caused economic disruption for a generation. McLynn and Correlli Barnett suggest that Napoleon&#x27;s reputation as a military genius is exaggerated. Cobban and Susan P. Conner argue that Napoleon had insufficient regard for the lives of his soldiers and that his battle tactics led to excessive casualties.

Critics also cite Napoleon&#x27;s exploitation of conquered territories. To finance his wars, Napoleon increased taxes and levies of troops from annexed territories and satellite states. He also introduced discriminatory tariff policies which promoted French trade at the expense of allies and satellite states. He institutionalized plunder: French museums contain art stolen by Napoleon&#x27;s forces from across Europe. Artefacts were brought to the Musée du Louvre for a grand central museum; an example which would later be followed by others.

Many historians have criticized Napoleon&#x27;s authoritarian rule, especially after 1807, which included censorship, the closure of independent newspapers, the bypassing of direct elections and representative government, the dismissal of judges showing independence, and the exile of critics of the regime. Historians also blame Napoleon for reducing the civil rights of women, children and people of colour, and reintroducing the legal penalties of civil death and confiscation of property. His reintroduction of an hereditary monarchy and nobility remains controversial. His role in the Haitian Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France&#x27;s colonies in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean adversely affect his reputation.

===Propaganda and memory===

Napoleon&#x27;s use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power, legitimated his regime, and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship and control of the press, books, theatre, and art were part of his propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing peace and stability to France. Propaganda focused on his role first as a general then as a civil leader and emperor. He fostered a relationship with artists, commissioning and controlling different forms of art to suit his propaganda goals.

Napoleonic propaganda survived his exile to Saint Helena. Las Cases, who was with Napoleon in exile, published &quot;The Memorial of Saint Helena&quot; in 1822, creating a legend of Napoleon as a liberal, visionary proponent of European unification, deposed by reactionary elements of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. Napoleon remained a central figure in the romantic art and literature of the 1820s and 1830s.

The Napoleonic legend played a key role in collective political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 Revolution. The defiance manifested itself in seditious materials, displaying the tricolour and rosettes. There were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of Napoleon&#x27;s life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations.

Bell sees the return of Napoleon&#x27;s remains to France in 1840 as an attempt by Louis-Phillipe to prop up his unpopular regime by associating it with Napoleon, and that the regime of Napoleon III was only possible due to the continued resonance of the Napoleonic legend.

Venita Datta argues that following the collapse of militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Writers and critics of the &quot;Belle Époque&quot; exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.

In the 21st century, Napoleon appears regularly in popular fiction, drama and advertising. Napoleon and his era remain major topics of historical research with a sharp increase in historical books, articles and symposia during the bicentenary years of 1999 to 2015.

===Long-term influence outside France===

Napoleon was responsible for spreading many of the values of the French Revolution to other countries, especially through the Napoleonic Code. After the fall of Napoleon, it continued to influence the law in western Europe and other parts of the world including Latin America, the Dominican Republic, Louisiana and Quebec.

Napoleon&#x27;s regime abolished remnants of feudalism in the lands he conquered and in his satellite states. He liberalized property laws, ended manorialism, abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalized divorce, closed the Jewish ghettos and ended the Spanish Inquisition. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality before the law was proclaimed for all men.

Napoleon reorganized what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of about three hundred &quot;Kleinstaaten&quot;, into a more streamlined forty-state Confederation of the Rhine; this helped promote the German Confederation and the unification of Germany in 1871, as it sparked a new wave of German nationalism that opposed the French intervention.

The movement toward Italian unification was similarly sparked by Napoleonic rule. These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the nation state.

The Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy had a significant effect on Spanish America. Many local elites sought to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII of Spain, whom they considered the legitimate monarch. Napoleon indirectly began the process of Latin American independence when the power vacuum was filled by local political leaders such as Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín. Such leaders embraced nationalistic sentiments influenced by French nationalism and led successful independence movements in Latin America.

Napoleon&#x27;s reputation is generally favourable in Poland, which is the only country in the world to evoke him in its national anthem, Poland Is Not Yet Lost.

== Children ==

Napoleon married Joséphine in 1796, but the marriage produced no children. In 1806, he adopted his step-son, Eugène de Beauharnais (1781–1824), and his second cousin, Stéphanie de Beauharnais (1789–1860), and arranged dynastic marriages for them.

Napoleon&#x27;s marriage to Marie Louise produced one child, Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles (Napoleon II) (1811–1832), known from birth as the King of Rome. When Napoleon abdicated in 1815 he named his son his successor as &quot;Napoleon II&quot;, but the allies refused to recognize him. He was awarded the title of the Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21, with no children.

Napoleon acknowledged one illegitimate son: Charles Léon (1806–1881) by Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne. Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810–1868), the son of his Polish mistress Maria Walewska, was also widely known to be his child, as DNA evidence has confirmed. He may have had further illegitimate offspring.

<doc id="69882" wikidata="Q159591" url="?curid=69882" title="Alexander of Battenberg">
<text>Alexander Joseph (; 5 April 1857 – 17 November 1893), known as Alexander of Battenberg, was the first prince (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria from 1879 until his abdication in 1886. 

The Bulgarian Grand National Assembly elected him as Prince of autonomous Bulgaria in 1879. He dissolved the assembly the following year and suspended the Constitution in 1881, considering it too liberal. He restored the Constitution in 1883, leading to open conflict with Russia that made him popular in Bulgaria. Unification with Eastern Rumelia was achieved and recognised by the powers in 1885. A coup carried out by pro-Russian Bulgarian Army officers forced him to abdicate in September 1886. He later became a general in the Austrian army.

==Early life==
Alexander was the second son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by the latter&#x27;s morganatic marriage with Countess Julia von Hauke. The Countess and her descendants gained the title of Princess of Battenberg (derived from an old residence of the Grand Dukes of Hesse) and the style &quot;Durchlaucht&quot; (&quot;Serene Highness&quot;) in 1858. Prince Alexander was a nephew of Russia&#x27;s Tsar Alexander II, who had married a sister of Prince Alexander of Hesse. His mother, the daughter of Polish general Hans Moritz Hauke, had been lady-in-waiting to the Tsaritsa. Alexander was known to his family, and many later biographers, as &quot;Sandro&quot; or &quot;Drino&quot;.

Alexander&#x27;s brother, Prince Louis of Battenberg, married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Their children included Queen Louise of Sweden, Earl Mountbatten of Burma and Princess Alice of Battenberg, the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth II.

Alexander&#x27;s other brother, Prince Henry of Battenberg, married Queen Victoria&#x27;s youngest daughter Princess Beatrice. Among their children was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain.

==Prince of Bulgaria==
In his boyhood and early youth, Alexander frequently visited Saint Petersburg, and he accompanied his uncle, Tsar Alexander II, who was much attached to him, during the Bulgarian campaign of 1877. 

When, under the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Bulgaria became an autonomous principality under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, the Tsar recommended his nephew to the Bulgarians as a candidate for the newly created throne, and the Grand National Assembly unanimously elected Prince Alexander as Prince of Bulgaria (29 April 1879). At that time he held a commission as a lieutenant in the Prussian life-guards at Potsdam. Before proceeding to Bulgaria, Prince Alexander paid visits to the Tsar at Livadia, to the courts of the Great Powers. After paying a visit to the Ottoman Sultan&#x27;s court, a Russian warship conveyed him to Varna where he took an oath to the Tarnovo Constitution at Veliko Tarnovo (8 July 1879) and then proceeded to Sofia. People everywhere en route greeted him with immense enthusiasm.

==Reign==
The new ruling prince had not had any previous experience in government, and a range of problems confronted him. He found himself caught between the Russians, who wanted him to be a do-nothing king (a &quot;roi fainéant&quot;), and the Bulgarian politicians, who actively pursued their own quarrels with a violence that threatened the stability of Bulgaria. One of his servants was the Bessarabian boyar Stefan Uvaliev from the Căzănești village, who supported him financially.

In 1881, a marriage was suggested between Alexander and Princess Viktoria of Prussia, the daughter of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Victoria, Princess Royal, the latter of whom was then crown princess of the German Empire and was the oldest daughter of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Queen Victoria. While the would-be bride&#x27;s mother and maternal grandmother supported the prospective marriage, her German relatives 
– her paternal grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm I; her brother, later Kaiser Wilhelm II (Kaiser Wilhelm I&#x27;s grandson); and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck – opposed it, fearing that it would offend the Russian ruling house, most notably Prince Alexander&#x27;s cousin Tsar Alexander III. Alexander III had recently ascended to the Russian throne and, unlike his father, was far from kindly disposed to the prince. Prince Alexander was later ordered to make a formal declaration renouncing the betrothal.

After attempting to govern under these conditions for nearly two years, the prince, with the consent of the Russian Tsar, assumed absolute power, having suspended the Constitution (9 May 1881). A specially convened assembly voted (13 July 1881) for suspension of the ultra-democratic constitution for a period of seven years. The experiment, however, proved unsuccessful; the monarchical coup infuriated Bulgarian Liberal and Radical politicians, and real power passed to two Russian generals, Sobolev and Kaulbars, specially dispatched from Saint Petersburg. After vainly endeavouring to obtain the recall of the generals, the prince restored the constitution with the concurrence of all Bulgarian political parties (19 September 1883). A serious breach with Russia followed, and the part which the prince subsequently played in encouraging Bulgarian national aspirations widened that breach.

The revolution of Plovdiv (18 September 1885), which brought about the union of Eastern Rumelia with Bulgaria, took place with Alexander&#x27;s consent, and he at once assumed the government of the province. In the year which followed, the prince gave evidence of considerable military and diplomatic ability. He rallied the Bulgarian army, now deprived of its Russian officers (withdrawn by Tsar Alexander III), which Alexander replaced by graduates of the Bulgarian Military Academy to resist the Serbian invasion (later known as &quot;The Victory of Bulgarian Cadets vs. Serbian Generals&quot;). Alexander mobilised his troops standing at the Turkish frontier and ordered them to go north to Slivnitsa as fast as possible. In the meantime, he ordered his troops already deployed there to fortify the garrison. Having ensured the smooth running of operations. Alexander returned after repelling a Serbian attack near Sofia threatening Bulgarian lines from the hinterland. He returned just in time to conduct a final counterattack against Serbian troops, followed by pursuing them deep into their own territory. The Bulgarians won a decisive victory at Slivnitsa (19 November), after which Bulgarian troops advanced as far as Pirot, capturing it on 27 November. Although the intervention of Austria protected Serbia from the consequences of defeat, Prince Alexander&#x27;s success sealed the union with Eastern Rumelia. After long negotiations, Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II nominated him as governor-general of that province for five years (5 April 1886).

==Loss of Throne==
This arrangement, however, cost Alexander much of his popularity in Bulgaria, while discontent prevailed among a number of his officers, who considered themselves slighted in the distribution of rewards at the close of the campaign. Encouraged by the promise of Tsar Alexander III to keep their Bulgarian rank in the Russian army and receiving common Russian salary these officers formed a military plot, and on the night of 20 August 1886 the conspirators seized the prince in the palace at Sofia and compelled him to sign his abdication; they then hurried him to the Danube at Oryahovo, transported him on his yacht to Reni, and handed him over to the Russian authorities, who allowed him to proceed to Lemberg. However, he soon returned to Bulgaria as a result of the success of the counter-revolution led by Stefan Stambolov, which overthrew the provisional government set up by the Russian party at Sofia. His position, however, had become untenable, partly as a result of an ill-considered telegram which he addressed to Tsar Alexander III on his return. The attitude of Bismarck, who, in conjunction with the Russian and Austrian governments, forbade him to punish the leaders of the military conspiracy, also undermined Alexander&#x27;s position. He therefore issued a manifesto resigning the throne and left Bulgaria on 8 September 1886.

After his abdication from the Bulgarian throne, Alexander I claimed the title Prince of Tarnovo and used it until his death.

==Later years==

Alexander then retired into private life. A few years later he married Johanna Loisinger, an actress, and assumed the style of Count von Hartenau (6 February 1889). They had a son &quot;Assen&quot;, Count von Hartenau (1890-1965) and a daughter Countess Marie Therese Vera &quot;Tsvetana&quot; von Hartenau (1893-1935). The last years of his life he spent principally at Graz, where he held a local command in the Austrian army, and where he died of a ruptured appendix on 17 November 1893. His remains, brought to Sofia, received a public funeral there, and were buried in a mausoleum erected to his memory.

Prince Alexander possessed much charm and amiability of manner; he was tall, dignified and strikingly handsome. Many authorities have generally recognised his capabilities as a soldier. As a ruler he committed some errors, but his youth and inexperience and the extreme difficulty of his position account for much. He had some aptitude for diplomacy, and his intuitive insight and perception of character sometimes enabled him to outwit the crafty politicians who surrounded him. His principal fault remained a want of tenacity and resolution; his tendency to unguarded language undoubtedly increased the number of his enemies.

<doc id="69886" wikidata="Q313456" url="?curid=69886" title="Charles Taze Russell">
<text>Charles Taze Russell (February 16, 1852 – October 31, 1916), or Pastor Russell, was an American Adventist minister from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and founder of the Bible Student movement. He was an early Christian Zionist.

In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious magazine, &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence&quot;. In 1881, he co-founded Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower Tract Society with William Henry Conley as president. In 1884 the corporation was registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six-volume Bible study series titled &quot;Millennial Dawn&quot;, later renamed &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;, nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime. (A seventh volume was commissioned by his successor as society president, Joseph Rutherford, and published in 1917.) The Watch Tower Society ceased publication of Russell&#x27;s writings in 1927, though his books are still published by several independent groups.

After Russell&#x27;s death, a crisis surrounding Rutherford&#x27;s leadership of the society culminated in a movement-wide schism. As many as three-quarters of the approximately 50,000 Bible Students associated in 1917 had left by 1931. This resulted in the formation of several groups with variations of the name &quot;Bible Students&quot;. Those who remained associated with the Watch Tower Society adopted the name &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot; in 1931, while those who severed ties with the Society formed their own groups including the Pastoral Bible Institute in 1918, the Laymen&#x27;s Home Missionary Movement in 1919, and the Dawn Bible Students Association in 1929.

==Early life==

Charles Taze Russell was born to Scotch-Irish parents, immigrant Joseph Lytle/Lytel Russell and Ann Eliza Birney, on February 16, 1852, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was nine years old.

The Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. When Charles was in his early teens, his father made him partner of his Pittsburgh haberdashery store. By age twelve, Russell was writing business contracts for customers and given charge of some of his father&#x27;s other clothing stores. At age thirteen, Russell left the Presbyterian Church to join the Congregational Church. In his youth he was known to chalk Bible verses on fence boards and city sidewalks in an attempt to convert unbelievers; he particularly noted the punishment of hell awaiting the unfaithful.

At age sixteen, a discussion with a childhood friend on faults perceived in Christianity (such as contradictions in creeds, along with medieval traditions) led Russell to question his faith. He investigated various other religions, but concluded that they did not provide the answers he was seeking. In 1870, at age eighteen, he attended a presentation by Adventist minister Jonas Wendell. Russell later said that, although he had not entirely agreed with Wendell&#x27;s arguments, the presentation had inspired him with a renewed zeal and belief that the Bible is the word of God.

==Marriage==
On March 13, 1879, Russell married Maria Frances Ackley after a few months&#x27; acquaintance. The couple separated in 1897. Russell blamed the marriage breakup on disagreements over Maria Russell&#x27;s insistence on a greater editorial role in &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower&quot; magazine. A later court judgment noted that he had labelled the marriage &quot;a mistake&quot; three years before the dispute over her editorial ambitions had arisen.

Maria Russell filed a suit for legal separation in the Pennsylvania courts of common pleas at Pittsburgh in June 1903. In 1906 she filed for divorce under a claim of mental cruelty. She was granted a separation, with alimony, in 1908. Maria Russell died at the age of 88 in St. Petersburg, Florida, on March 12, 1938, from complications related to Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.

==Ministry==
Russell was a charismatic figure, but claimed no special revelation or vision for his teachings and no special authority on his own behalf. He stated that he did not seek to found a new denomination, but intended to gather together those who were seeking the truth of God&#x27;s Word &quot;during this harvest time&quot;. He wrote that the &quot;clear unfolding of truth&quot; within his teachings was due to &quot;the simple fact that God&#x27;s due time has come; and if I did not speak, and no other agent could be found, the very stones would cry out.&quot;

He viewed himself—and all other Christians anointed with the Holy Spirit—as &quot;God&#x27;s mouthpiece&quot; and an ambassador of Christ. Later in his career he accepted without protest that many Bible Students viewed him as the &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; of Matthew 24:45. After his death, the &quot;Watch Tower&quot; said that he had been made &quot;ruler of all the Lord&#x27;s goods&quot;.

===Beginnings===

About 1870, Russell and his father established a group with a number of acquaintances to undertake an analytical study of the Bible and the origins of Christian doctrine, creed, and tradition. The group, strongly influenced by the writings of Millerite Adventist ministers George Storrs and George Stetson, who were also frequent attendees, concluded that many of the primary doctrines of the established churches, including the Trinity, hellfire, and inherent immortality of the soul, were not substantiated by the scriptures.

Around January 1876, Russell received a copy of Nelson Barbour&#x27;s &quot;Herald of the Morning&quot; in the mail. Barbour was an influential Adventist writer and publisher. Russell telegraphed Barbour to set up a meeting. Barbour and John Henry Paton visited in Allegheny in March 1876 at Russell&#x27;s expense so that he could hear their arguments, and compare the conclusions that each side had made in their studies. Russell sponsored a speech by Barbour in St. George&#x27;s Hall, Philadelphia in August 1876 and attended other lectures by Barbour.

Among the teachings Barbour introduced was the view that Christians who had died would be raised in April 1878. Russell, who had previously rejected prophetic chronology, was moved to devote his life to what he was convinced were now the last two years before the invisible, spiritual return of Christ. He sold his five clothing stores for approximately $300,000 (current value $). With Russell&#x27;s encouragement and financial backing, Barbour wrote an outline of their views in &quot;Three Worlds and the Harvest of This World&quot;, published in 1877. A text Russell had previously written, titled &quot;The Object and Manner of our Lord&#x27;s Return&quot;, was published concurrently through the offices of the &quot;Herald of the Morning&quot;. Russell was eager to lead a Christian revival and called two separate meetings of Christian leaders in Pittsburgh. Russell&#x27;s ideas, particularly stressing the imminence of the rapture and the second advent of Christ, were rejected both times.

===Split with Barbour===
When 1878 arrived, failure of the expected rapture brought great disappointment for Barbour and Russell, and their associates and readers. But one of Russell&#x27;s associates claimed that Russell was not upset.

Confused by what was perceived to be an error in calculation, Russell re-examined the doctrine to see if he could determine whether it had biblical origins or was simply Christian tradition. He concluded that the doctrine was Christian tradition. Through the pages of the &quot;Herald&quot;, he wrote about what he had concluded on the subject. Barbour, embarrassed by the failure of their expectations, rejected Russell&#x27;s explanation. They conducted a debate in successive issues of the journal from early 1878 to mid-1879. In a matter of months, Barbour changed some of the views which he and Russell had previously shared, and no longer relied on prophetic chronology. They began to debate over the issue of &#x27;Christ&#x27;s ransom&#x27;, and the two eventually separated because of their disagreements.

Russell withdrew his financial support and started his own journal, &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence&quot;, publishing his first issue in July 1879. Barbour formed The Church of the Strangers that same year, continuing to publish &quot;Herald of the Morning&quot;.

===Watch Tower Society===
In 1881, Russell founded Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower Tract Society, with William Henry Conley as president and Russell as secretary-treasurer; they intended to disseminate tracts, papers, doctrinal treatises and Bibles. All materials were printed and bound by Russell&#x27;s privately owned Tower Publishing Company for an agreed price, then distributed by colporteurs. The Society was incorporated in 1884, with Russell as president, and in 1886 its name was changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.

In 1908, Russell transferred the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to Brooklyn, New York where it remained until 2016, when it was relocated to Warwick, New York.

===Publications===
With the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout New England, the Virginias, Ohio, and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him &quot;Pastor&quot;, and commonly referred to him as &quot;Pastor Russell&quot;. Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition.

In 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: &quot;Food for Thinking Christians.&quot; The 162-page &quot;pamphlet&quot; was published using donated funds amounting to approximately $40,000 (current value $). It had a circulation of nearly 1.5 million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels. During the same year he published &quot;Tabernacle and its Teachings&quot; which was quickly expanded and reissued as &quot;Tabernacle Shadows of the &quot;Better Sacrifices&quot;&quot;, outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by Moses. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the American Tract Society for the year 1880.

In 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15 million in the United States and Canada.

In 1910, the secular journal &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; calculated that by 1909, Russell&#x27;s writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac. In 1912 &quot;The Continent&quot;, a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell&#x27;s writings had achieved a greater circulation &quot;than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America&quot;.

Russell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a heretic in this period.

====&quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;====
Russell devoted nearly a tenth of his fortune, along with contributed funds, in publishing and distributing &quot;Food for Thinking Christians&quot; in 1881. That year he also published &quot;The Tabernacle and its Teachings&quot; and &quot;Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices&quot;. In 1886, after reportedly not making back most of the money spent publishing these three titles, he began publication of what was intended to be a seven-volume series. The volumes were collectively called &quot;Millennial Dawn&quot;, later renamed &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot; to clarify that they were not novels. Russell published six volumes in the series:
* &quot;The Plan of the Ages&quot; – later renamed &quot;The Divine Plan of the Ages&quot; (1886)
* &quot;The Time is at Hand&quot; (1889)
* &quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot; (1891)
* &quot;The Day of Vengeance&quot; – later renamed &quot;The Battle of Armageddon&quot; (1897)
* &quot;The At-one-ment Between God and Men&quot; (1899)
* &quot;The New Creation&quot; (1904)

The delayed publication of the seventh volume became a source of great anticipation and mystery among Bible Students. Following Russell&#x27;s death in 1916, a seventh volume titled &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot; was published in 1917; this was advertised as his &quot;posthumous work&quot;. This seventh volume was a detailed interpretation of the Book of Revelation, but also included interpretations of Ezekiel and the Song of Solomon. Controversy quickly surrounded both its publication and content. It soon became known that much of the contents were written and compiled by two of Russell&#x27;s associates, Clayton J. Woodworth and George H. Fisher, and edited by Joseph Rutherford, by then the new president of the Watch Tower Society.

====&quot;Photo Drama of Creation&quot;====

Russell directed the production of a worldwide roadshow presentation titled &quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation&quot;, an innovative eight-hour religious film in four parts. It was the first major screenplay to incorporate synchronized sound, moving film, and color slides. Production began as early as 1912, and the &quot;Drama&quot; was introduced in 1914 by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. A book by the same name was also published. The project&#x27;s expenses put the organization under some financial pressures; the full cost was estimated at US$300,000 (current value $).

==Theology and teachings==
Following his examination of the Bible, Russell and other Bible Students came to regard Christian creeds and traditions as harmful errors. They saw their own work as restoring Christianity to the purity of its first century. Many contemporary Church leaders and scholars considered his views heretical. Russell agreed with other Protestants on the primacy of the Bible, and on justification by faith alone, but thought that errors had been introduced in interpretation. Russell agreed with many 19th-century Protestants, including Millerites, in the concept of a Great Apostasy that began in the first century AD. He also agreed with many other contemporary Protestants in belief in the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and in Armageddon.

Russell&#x27;s scriptural interpretations differed from those of Catholics, and of many Protestants, in the following areas: 

* Hell. He said there was a heavenly resurrection of 144,000 righteous, as well as a &quot;great multitude&quot;, but believed that the remainder of mankind slept in death, awaiting an earthly resurrection, rather than suffering in a literal Hell.
* The Trinity. Russell believed in the divinity of Christ, but differed from orthodoxy by teaching that Jesus had received that divinity as a gift from the Father after dying on the cross. He also taught that the Holy Spirit is not a person, but the manifestation of God&#x27;s power.
* Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Russell believed that Christ had returned invisibly in October 1874, and that he had been ruling from heaven since that date. He believed that a &quot;time of trouble&quot; began then that would mark a gradual deterioration of civilized society leading up to the end of the &quot;Gentile Times&quot;, with a climactic multi-national attack on a restored Israel, worldwide anarchy, and the sudden destruction of all world governments in October 1914. After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Russell reinterpreted 1914 as the beginning of Armageddon.
* Pyramidology. Following views first taught by Christian writers such as John Taylor (1781–1864), Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819–1900) and Joseph Seiss (1823–1904), Russell believed that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built by the Hebrews (associating them with the Hyksos) under God&#x27;s direction, but to be understood only in the modern era. He adopted Seiss&#x27; terminology, referring to the pyramid as &quot;the Bible in stone&quot;. He held that certain biblical texts, including Isaiah 19:19–20, prophesied a future understanding of the Great Pyramid. He believed that the pyramid&#x27;s various ascending and descending passages represented biblical concepts such as the fall of man, the provision of the Mosaic Law, the death of Christ and the exultation of the saints in heaven. Calculations were based on the assumption that each inch of the various passages represented one year. Russell&#x27;s &quot;Divine Plan of the Ages&quot; stated, &quot;The Pyramid witnesses that the close of 1914 will be the beginning of the time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation—no, nor shall ever be afterward.&quot;
* Christian Zionism. Expanding on an idea suggested by Nelson Barbour, Russell taught as early as 1879 that God&#x27;s favor had been restored to Jews as the result of a prophetic &quot;double&quot; which had ended in 1878 (favor from Jacob to Jesus, then disfavor from Jesus until 1878). In 1910, he conducted a meeting at the New York Hippodrome Theatre, with thousands of Jews attending. His teaching that Jews should not convert to Christianity shocked Jews and Christians alike. Russell believed that the land of Palestine belonged exclusively to the Jewish race, that God was then calling Jews back to their land, and that they would be the center of earthly leadership under God&#x27;s Kingdom. Early in Russell&#x27;s ministry, he speculated that the Jews might flock to Palestine and form their own nation by the year 1910. Shortly before his death in 1916, he used the Jewish press to stress that 1914 prophetically marked the time when Gentile nations no longer had earthly authority; he said that all Jews were, from that time onward, permitted and guided by God to gather to Palestine and to reclaim the land boldly for themselves.
* Spiritualism and the occult. &quot;Russell attacked Spiritualism (which he called Spiritism)&quot;.

==Death==

Russell&#x27;s health declined markedly in the three years leading up to his death. During his final ministerial tour of the western and southwestern United States, he became increasingly ill with cystitis, but ignored advice to abandon the tour. Russell died on October 31, 1916, at age 64 near Pampa, Texas, while returning to Brooklyn by train.

An associate of Russell stated that Russell&#x27;s body at age 64 was more worn out than that of his father who died at age 84. He was buried outside of Pittsburgh in United Cemetery, Ross Township, Pennsylvania. The gravesite is marked by a headstone. Nearby stood a pyramid memorial erected by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1921. The pyramid memorial was vandalized and subsequently removed in September 2021.

==Legacy==
In January 1917, Joseph Franklin Rutherford was elected president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, despite disputes over the election process. Further disputes arose over interpretation of sections of Russell&#x27;s will dealing with the future contents of &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower&quot; magazine, as well as who, if anyone, had authority to print new literature. By the end of the 1920s, nearly three-quarters of the Bible Student congregations had rejected Rutherford&#x27;s on-going changes in organizational structure, doctrinal interpretations, and congregational practices, some of which began to appear in material printed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as early as 1917. Many Bible Students were disaffected by Rutherford&#x27;s rejection of Russell&#x27;s views regarding his role in the restoration of the &quot;truth&quot; and support of the Great Pyramid as having been built under God&#x27;s direction.

Those remaining supportive of Rutherford adopted the new name &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot; in 1931. They renamed their magazine as &quot;The Watchtower&quot;. Many of the most prominent Bible Students who had left the society held their own meeting in October 1929 to gather other dissenters; the First Annual Bible Students Reunion Convention was held in the old Pittsburgh &quot;Bible House&quot; long used by Russell. These conventions were held yearly, but the process of &#x27;regathering&#x27; took nearly twenty years.

==Controversies==
===Leadership style===
As early as 1892, Russell&#x27;s views and management style were strongly criticized by certain individuals associated with his ministry. In 1893, a paper was written and circulated to Bible Students in Pittsburgh by associates Otto van Zech, Elmer Bryan, J. B. Adamson, S. G. Rogers, Paul Koetitz, and others. It accused Russell of being a dictatorial leader, a shrewd businessman who appeared eager to collect funds from the selling of the &quot;Millennial Dawn&quot; books, of cheating one of them financially, and of issuing thousands of &quot;Millennial Dawn&quot; books under a female pseudonym.

Russell wrote a booklet &quot;A Conspiracy Exposed and Harvest Siftings&quot; in response, issuing it as an extra to the April 1894 &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower&quot; magazine. He intended to pre-empt efforts by his critics to circulate their views to a wider audience of Bible Students. Russell printed copies of letters he had received from these former associates to show that their claims were false, and that those involved &#x27;were guided by Satan in an attempt to subvert his work&#x27; as a &quot;minister of the gospel&quot;.

===Allegation of immoral conduct===
In 1897, Russell&#x27;s wife, Maria, left him after a disagreement over the management of &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower&quot; magazine. According to Russell&#x27;s successor Joseph Franklin Rutherford, she believed that, as his wife, she should have equal control over its administration and equal privilege in writing articles, preaching, and traveling abroad as his representative. In 1903, she filed for legal separation on the grounds of mental cruelty, referring to forced celibacy and frequent cold, indifferent treatment by him. The separation was granted in 1906, with Russell charged to pay alimony.

During the trial Mrs. Russell&#x27;s attorney alleged that in 1894 Mr. Russell had engaged in &quot;improper intimacy&quot; with Rose Ball, by then a 25-year-old woman. The Russells had cared for her as a foster daughter said to be an orphan. Mrs. Russell alleged that Ball had told her Mr. Russell claimed to be an amorous &quot;jellyfish floating around&quot; to different women until someone responded to his advances. Mr. Russell denied the accusations and said he had never used such language to describe himself. When the judge asked Mrs. Russell if she was accusing her husband of adultery, she replied, &quot;No&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the &quot;Mission Friend&quot; of Chicago reprinted the &quot;jellyfish&quot; story while also accusing Russell of immoral conduct. Russell sued the papers for libel; the jury decided in his favor, awarding him one dollar. Following an appeal, Russell received a cash settlement of $15,000 (current value $) plus court costs, and an agreement that the two papers publish his weekly syndicated sermons as well as a retraction defending his character.

Rose Ball later married and lived in Australia. As Rose Ball Henninges, she died November 22, 1950, at the age of 81 in Melbourne. For several years she had written articles for &quot;The People&#x27;s Paper&quot; and was associated with the Bible Students in Australia until her death.

===&#x27;Miracle Wheat&#x27;===

On March 22, 1911, &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reported that Russell was accused of gaining profit from a strain of wheat named &quot;Miracle Wheat&quot; by K.B. Stoner of Fincastle, Virginia, who claimed to have discovered this strain. Russell sold the wheat for $60 per bushel, far above the average cost of wheat at the time. Throughout 1912 and 1913, the &quot;Eagle&quot; continued to report on Russell&#x27;s alleged fraud. Russell sued the &quot;Eagle&quot; for libel, but lost. A government expert investigated the &quot;Miracle Wheat&quot; and said it &quot;was low in the Government tests&quot;. Prior to entering the court, the &quot;Eagle&quot; declared that &quot;at the trial it will show that &quot;Pastor&quot; Russell&#x27;s religious cult is nothing more than a money-making scheme.&quot;

Russell defended himself publicly, and in writing, claiming that the wheat was donated to the Watch Tower Society. He said that although sold for $1 per pound, Mr. Stoner allegedly routinely sold it for a $1.25 per pound. Russell claimed to have no financial connection to the wheat, and said that no one claimed a refund although he had offered one for up to a year later for any who were dissatisfied with their purchase. In 1975, the Watch Tower Society stated that gross receipts from the &quot;Miracle Wheat&quot; fundraiser totaled &quot;about $1800&quot; (current value $), of which &quot;Russell himself did not get a penny&quot;. It also said that &quot;the Society itself made no claim for the wheat on its own knowledge and the mo…ney received went as a donation into Christian missionary work.&quot;

===Qualifications===
In June 1912, Rev. J. J. Ross (1871–1935), Pastor of the James Street Baptist Church in Hamilton, Ontario, published and widely distributed a four-page leaflet titled, &quot;Some Facts about the Self-Styled &quot;Pastor&quot; Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame).&quot; He alleged that Russell was involved in questionable business practices, had defrauded his estranged wife, and denounced his qualifications, legitimacy and moral example as a Pastor. Russell sued Ross for defamatory libel on December 2, 1912.

After several delays the case came before Police Court Magistrate George H. Jelfs on March 17, 1913. During cross-examination Russell said that he had attended public school for seven years, having left when he was about fourteen years of age, after which he received instruction through private tutors. He said that he was versed in Latin terms &quot;to an extent&quot; but did not know Hebrew or Greek, that he had never been ordained by any bishop or minister, and had never attended a theological seminary or any schools of higher learning.

The Hamilton and Toronto Ontario newspapers reported the claims made by Ross and provided a brief outline of the court proceedings. They did not refer to any alleged misconduct on the part of Russell. They criticized Ross for having fled Ontario when summoned and not being present during any of the court proceedings.

On April 1, 1913, the High Court of Ontario returned a verdict of &quot;No Bill&quot; ruling that Russell was not entitled to damages because, the libel was not likely to result in any violence within Canada. Following the libel case, Ross published an expanded edition of 48-pages titled, &quot;Some Facts and More Facts about the Self-Styled &quot;Pastor&quot; Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame)&quot;. In this work, Ross claimed that during the proceedings on March 17, 1913, Russell had repeatedly lied under oath by affirming that he was ordained, but denying the same when cross-examined, by affirming that he knew the Greek language, but when shown by Counselor Staunton an extract from the New Testament in Greek by Westcott &amp; Hort, he was unable to recognize it, and that he had not been divorced from his wife, but retracted the statement under cross-examination.

In response, Russell stated through various printed and public sources that he had never claimed knowledge of the Greek language, merely the alphabet and that early Christians were also criticized by the religious authorities for being unlearned and ignorant. He believed that his ordination was &quot;of God&quot; according to the biblical pattern, not requiring any denominational approval or theological training. He suggested that his annual election as &quot;Pastor&quot; by over 500 congregations worldwide constituted him as properly ordained. Russell contended that Ross and others were attacking him because they were unable to answer his theological arguments, preferring instead to resort to slander and character assassination.

===Use of Masonic symbolism===
Some have claimed that various symbols Russell employed in his published literature are Masonic in nature, and that such associations implied he engaged in occult activity. In later editions of the &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot; series a winged solar disk was stamped on the front cover, a symbol that is also associated with Freemasonry. However, Russell&#x27;s use of the winged solar-disk originated from his understanding of Malachi 4:2, which denotes a sun with wings, as a symbol that Christ&#x27;s millennial Kingdom had begun to emerge.

Some critics also claim that the pyramid that stood near Russell&#x27;s gravesite was Masonic because of its shape and its use of the Cross and Crown symbol, although this remains disputed. The Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon has said that Russell was not a Freemason, and notes that the symbols pre-date the fraternity.

In June 1913, during a transcontinental speaking tour, Russell lectured in a Masonic hall in San Francisco, saying:
Throughout his ministry he said that he believed Christian identity is incompatible with Freemasonry. He described Freemasonry, Knights of Pythias, Theosophy, and other such groups as &quot;grievous evils&quot; and &quot;unclean&quot;.

<doc id="69887" wikidata="Q460735" url="?curid=69887" title="West End of London">
<text>The West End of London (commonly referred to as the West End) is a district of Central London, London, England, west of the City of London and north of the River Thames, in which many of the city&#x27;s major tourist attractions, shops, businesses, government buildings and entertainment venues, including West End theatres, are concentrated - and as such the term &quot;West End&quot; is used internationally as a metonym for London&#x27;s theatre district and associated performing arts scene - just as &quot;Broadway&quot; is used to describe that of New York City.

The term was first used in the early 19th century to describe fashionable areas to the west of Charing Cross. The West End covers parts of the boroughs of Westminster and Camden.

While the City of London is the main financial district in London, the West End is the main commercial and entertainment centre of the city. It is the largest central business district in the United Kingdom. It is one of the most expensive locations in the world in which to rent commercial and office space.

==History==
Medieval London comprised two adjacent cities – the City of London in the east, and the City of Westminster in the west.

Over time they came to form the centre of modern London, although each kept its own distinct character and its separate legal identity (for example, the City of London has its own police force and is a distinct county). The City of London became a centre for the banking, financial, legal and professional sectors, while Westminster became associated with the leisure, shopping, commerce, and entertainment sectors, the government, and home to universities and embassies. The modern West End is closely associated with this area of central London.

Lying to the west of the historic Roman and medieval City of London, the West End was long favoured by the rich elite as a place of residence because it was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City. It was close to the royal seat of power at the Palace of Westminster (now home to parliament), and is largely contained within the City of Westminster (one of the 32 London boroughs).

The Great Fire of London didn&#x27;t directly affect the West End a great deal, but the huge loss of housing in the City of London, led to a building boom in the west. This began with an initial development by Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans in the 1660s. Then during the late 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, it was built as a series of palaces, expensive town houses, fashionable shops and places of entertainment. The areas closest to the City around Holborn, Seven Dials, and Covent Garden contained poorer communities that were cleared and redeveloped in the 19th century.
==Boundaries==
As the West End is a term used colloquially by Londoners and is not an official geographical or municipal definition, its exact constituent parts are up for debate. Westminster City Council&#x27;s 2005 report &quot;Vision for the West End&quot; included the following areas in its definition: Covent Garden, Soho, Chinatown, Leicester Square, the shopping streets of Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street, the area encompassing Trafalgar Square, the Strand and Aldwych, and the district known as Theatreland. The Edgware Road to the north-west and the Victoria Embankment to the south-east were also covered by the document but were treated as &quot;adjacent areas&quot; to the West End.

According to Ed Glinert&#x27;s &quot;West End Chronicles&quot; (2006) the districts falling within the West End are Mayfair, Soho, Covent Garden, Fitzrovia and Marylebone. By this definition, the West End borders Temple, Holborn and Bloomsbury to the east, Regent&#x27;s Park to the north, Paddington, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge to the west, and Victoria and Westminster to the south. Other definitions include Bloomsbury within the West End.

One of the City of Westminster wards is called &quot;West End&quot;. This electoral unit includes some of the most prosperous areas of the borough, including Soho, Mayfair and parts of southern Marylebone. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 10,575.

<text>The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT, also simply NW) is a translation of the Bible published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society; it is used and distributed by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The New Testament portion was released first, in 1950, as the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, with the complete &quot;New World Translation&quot; of the Bible released in 1961.

It is not the first Bible to be published by the Watch Tower Society, but it is its first translation into English. Commentators have noted that scholarly effort went into producing the translation but many have described it as &quot;biased&quot;.

== History ==

Until the release of the &quot;New World Translation&quot;, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in English-speaking countries primarily used the &quot;King James Version&quot;. According to the publishers, one of the main reasons for producing a new translation was that most Bible versions in common use, including the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; (King James), employed archaic language. The stated intention was to produce a fresh translation, free of archaisms. Additionally, over the centuries since the &quot;King James Version&quot; was produced, more copies of earlier manuscripts of the original texts in the Hebrew and Greek languages had become available. According to the publishers, better manuscript evidence had made it possible to determine with greater accuracy what the original writers intended, particularly in more obscure passages, allowing linguists to better understand certain aspects of the original languages.

A fresh translation of the New Testament, which Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses usually refer to as the &quot;Christian Greek Scriptures&quot;, was proposed in October 1946 by the president of the Watch Tower Society, Nathan H. Knorr. Work began on December 2, 1947, when the &quot;New World Bible Translation Committee&quot; was formed, composed of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who professed to be anointed. The Watch Tower Society is said to have &quot;become aware&quot; of the committee&#x27;s existence a year later. The committee agreed to turn over its translation to the Society for publication and on September 3, 1949, Knorr convened a joint meeting of the board of directors of both the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s New York and Pennsylvania corporations where he again announced to the directors the existence of the committee and that it was now able to print its new modern English translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Several chapters of the translation were read to the directors, who then voted to accept it as a gift. The &quot;New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures&quot; was released at a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness convention at Yankee Stadium, New York, on August 2, 1950.

The translation of the Old Testament, which Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses refer to as the &quot;Hebrew Scriptures&quot;, was released in five volumes in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958, and 1960. The complete &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot; was released as a single volume in 1961, and has since undergone various revisions. Cross references that had appeared in the six separate volumes were updated and included in the complete volume in the 1984 revision.

In 1961, the Watch Tower Society began to translate the &quot;New World Translation&quot; into Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; the New Testament in these languages was released simultaneously in July 1963 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1989, the &quot;New World Translation&quot; was translated into eleven languages, with more than 56,000,000 copies printed.

For many years, the &quot;New World Translation&quot; was thought to be the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s first original translation of ancient Biblical Hebrew, Koine Greek, and Old Aramaic biblical texts, until the re-discovery of the German &quot;Magdeburger Bibel&quot; (&quot;Magdeburg Bible&quot;), formally called &quot;Die heiligen Schriften&quot; (&quot;The Holy Scriptures&quot;). 
=== Translators ===

The &quot;New World Translation&quot; was produced by the New World Bible Translation Committee, formed in 1947. This committee is said to have comprised unnamed members of multinational backgrounds. The committee requested that the Watch Tower Society not publish the names of its members, stating that they did not want to &quot;advertise themselves but let all the glory go to the Author of the Scriptures, God,&quot; adding that the translation, &quot;should direct the reader, not to the translators, but to the Bible’s Author, Jehovah God&quot;. The publishers stated that &quot;the particulars of [the New World Bible Translation Committee&#x27;s members] university or other educational training are not the important thing&quot; and that &quot;the translation testifies to their qualification&quot;.

Former high-ranking Watch Tower staff have identified various members of the translation team. In 1983 former Governing Body member Raymond Franz listed Nathan H. Knorr, Fredrick W. Franz, Albert D. Schroeder, George D. Gangas, and Milton G. Henschel as members of the translation team, adding that only Frederick Franz had sufficient knowledge in biblical languages. Referring to the identified members, evangelical minister Walter Ralston Martin said in 1997, &quot;The New World Bible translation committee had no known translators with recognized degrees in Greek or Hebrew exegesis or translation... None of these men had any university education except Franz, who left school after two years, never completing even an undergraduate degree.&quot; Fredrick Franz had stated that he was familiar with not only Hebrew, but with Greek, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French for the purpose of biblical translation. In 2003, Jason BeDuhn noted, &quot;the members of the translation team remain anonymous, just as they do for the NKJB and the Lockman Foundation&#x27;s NASB&quot;.

=== Translation Services Department ===

In 1989, a Translation Services Department was established at the world headquarters of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, overseen by the Writing Committee of the Governing Body. The goal of the Translation Services Department was to accelerate Bible translation with the aid of computer technology. Previously, some Bible translation projects lasted twenty years or more. Under the direction of the Translation Services Department, translation of the Old Testament in a particular language may be completed in as little as two years. During the period from 1963 to 1989, the &quot;New World Translation&quot; became available in ten additional languages. Since the formation of the Translation Services Department in 1989, there has been a significant increase in the number of languages in which the &quot;New World Translation&quot; has been made available.

=== 2013 revision ===

At the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s annual meeting on October 5, 2013, a significantly revised translation was released. Referring to the new revision, the publishers stated, &quot;There are now about 10 percent fewer English words in the translation. Some key Biblical terms were revised. Certain chapters were changed to poetic format, and clarifying footnotes were added to the regular edition.&quot;

The Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53 – 8:11) and the Short and Long Conclusions of Mark 16 (Mark 16:8–20)—offset from the main text in earlier editions—were removed. The new revision was also released as part of an app called &quot;JW Library&quot;. As of August 2024, the 2013 edition of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; has been translated, in whole or in part, into 300 languages.

== Translation ==

According to the Watch Tower Society, the &quot;New World Translation&quot; attempts to convey the intended sense of original-language words according to the context. The original &quot;New World Translation&quot; employs nearly 16,000 English expressions to translate about 5,500 biblical Greek terms, and over 27,000 English expressions to translate about 8,500 Hebrew terms. The translators state that, where possible in the target language, the &quot;New World Translation&quot; prefers literal renderings and does not paraphrase the original text.

=== Textual basis ===

The master text used for translating the Old Testament into English was Kittel&#x27;s Biblia Hebraica. The Hebrew texts, Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia and Biblia Hebraica Quinta were used for preparing the latest version of this translation. Other works consulted in preparing the translation include Aramaic Targums, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Torah, the Greek Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate, the Masoretic Text, the Cairo Codex, the Aleppo Codex, Christian David Ginsburg&#x27;s Hebrew Text, and the Leningrad Codex.
The Greek master text by the Cambridge University scholars B. F. Westcott and F. J. A. Hort (1881) was used as the basis for translating the New Testament into English. The committee also referred to the Novum Testamentum Graece (18th edition, 1948) and to works by Jesuit scholars José M. Bover (1943), and Augustinus Merk (1948). The United Bible Societies&#x27; text (1975) and the Nestle-Aland text (1979) were used to update the footnotes in the 1984 version. Additional works consulted in preparing the &quot;New World Translation&quot; include the Armenian Version, Coptic Versions, the Latin Vulgate, Sistine and Clementine Revised Latin Texts, Textus Receptus, the Johann Jakob Griesbach&#x27;s Greek text, the Emphatic Diaglott, and various papyri.

=== Other languages ===

Translation into other languages is based on the English text, supplemented by comparison with the Hebrew and Greek text. The complete &quot;New World Translation&quot; has been published in more than one hundred languages or scripts, with the New Testament available in more than fifty additional languages.

When the Writing Committee approves the translation of the Bible into a new language, it appoints a group of baptized Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to serve as a translation team. Translators are given a list of words and expressions commonly used in the English &quot;New World Translation&quot; with related English words grouped together (e.g. &quot;atone&quot;, &quot;atonement&quot;, or &quot;propitiation&quot;). A list of vernacular equivalents is then composed. A database of Greek and Hebrew terms is available where a translator has difficulty rendering a verse. The vernacular terms are then applied to the text in the target language. Further editing and translation are then performed to produce a final version.

== Features ==

The layout resembles the 1901 edition of the American Standard Version. The translators use the terms &quot;Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures&quot; and &quot;Christian Greek Scriptures&quot; rather than &quot;Old Testament&quot; and &quot;New Testament&quot;, stating that the use of &quot;testament&quot; was based on a misunderstanding of 2 Corinthians 3:14. Headings were included at the top of each page to assist in locating texts; these have been replaced in the 2013 revision by an &quot;Outline of Contents&quot; introducing each Bible book. There is also an index listing scriptures by subject.

Square brackets [ ] were added around words that were inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun &quot;you&quot; was printed in small capitals (i.e., ) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The &quot;New World Translation&quot; attempts to indicate progressive rather than completed actions, such as &quot;proceeded to rest&quot; in Genesis 2:2 instead of &quot;rested&quot;. The 2013 release indicates progressive verbs only where considered contextually important.

=== Use of &quot;Jehovah&quot; ===

The name &quot;Jehovah&quot; is a translation of the Tetragrammaton (, transliterated as &quot;YHWH&quot;, though the original pronunciation is unknown). The &quot;New World Translation&quot; uses the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; 6,979 times in the Old Testament. According to the Watch Tower Society, the Tetragrammaton appears in &quot;the oldest fragments of the Greek Septuagint&quot;. In reference to the &quot;Septuagint&quot;, biblical scholar Paul E. Kahle stated, &quot;We now know that the Greek Bible text as far as it was written by Jews for Jews did not translate the Divine name by Kyrios, but the Tetragrammaton written with Hebrew or Greek letters was retained in such MSS (manuscripts). It was the Christians who replaced the Tetragrammaton by Kyrios when the divine name written in Hebrew letters was not understood any more.&quot; However, according to professor Albert Pietersma, since pre-Christian times &quot;Adonai&quot; and the Tetragrammaton were considered equivalent to the Greek term &quot;kyrios&quot;. Pietersma stated, &quot;The translators felt no more bound to retain the tetragram in written form than they felt compelled to render distinctively Hebrew el, Elohim or Shaddai.&quot; He also considers that old manuscripts containing the tetragram, like the papyrus Fouad 266, &quot;is evidence of a secondary stage.&quot;

The &quot;New World Translation&quot; also uses the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; 237 times in the New Testament where the extant texts use only the Greek words &quot;kyrios&quot; (&quot;Lord&quot;) and &quot;theos&quot; (&quot;God&quot;). The use of &quot;Jehovah&quot; in the New Testament is very rare, but not unique to the &quot;New World Translation&quot;. Walter Martin, an evangelical minister, wrote, &quot;It can be shown from literally thousands of copies of the Greek New Testament that not once does the tetragrammaton appear.&quot; However, the translators of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; believed that the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; was present in the original manuscripts of the New Testament when quoting from the Old Testament, but replaced with the other terms by later copyists. Based on this reasoning, the translators consider to have &quot;restored the divine name&quot;, though it is not present in any extant manuscripts.

=== Editions ===

In 1984, a &quot;Reference&quot; edition of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; was released in addition to a revision of the regular volume. The regular edition includes several appendices containing arguments for various translation decisions, maps, diagrams and other information; and over 125,000 cross references. The reference edition contains the cross references and adds footnotes about translation decisions and additional appendices that provide further detail relating to certain translation decisions and doctrinal views. The &quot;Reference&quot; edition is out of print as of the release of the 2013 revision of the &quot;New World Translation&quot;.

==== &quot;Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures&quot; ====

The New World Bible Translation Committee included the English text from the &quot;New World Translation&quot; in its 1969 and 1985 editions of &quot;The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures&quot;. It also incorporates the Greek text published by Westcott and Hort in &quot;The New Testament in the Original Greek&quot; and a literal word-for-word translation.

=== Non-print editions ===

In 1978, the Watch Tower Society began producing recordings of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; on audio cassette, with the New Testament released by 1981 and the Old Testament in three albums released by 1990. In 2004, the NWT was released on compact disc in MP3 format in major languages. Since 2008, audio downloads of the NWT have been made available in 18 languages in MP3 and AAC formats, including support for podcasts.
In 1983, the English Braille edition of the &quot;New World Translation&quot;″s New Testament was released; the complete English Braille edition was released by 1988. NWT editions have since become available in several additional Braille scripts. Production of the NWT in American Sign Language began in 2006; the New Testament was made available by 2010, and the complete ASL edition was released in February 2020.

In 1992, a digital edition of the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—With References&quot; was released on floppy disk. Since 1994, the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—With References&quot; has been included in the &quot;Watchtower Library on CD-ROM&quot;. Both editions of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; are available online in various languages and digital formats.
Since 2015, a &quot;Study Edition&quot; of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; has been gradually released online starting with the books of the New Testament, based on the 2013 revision with additional reference material.

== Critical review ==
Biblical scholars have noted the New World Translation&#x27;s attempts at accurate conservative translation, its critical apparatus, and its use of modern critical editions of the biblical manuscripts. Criticism of the New World Translation focuses mainly on Christological issues in its rendering of the New Testament: the translation of the word &quot;Kyrios&quot; (Greek: Κύριος) as &quot;Jehovah&quot; —usually translated as &quot;Lord&quot; by classical translators, its rendering of passages related to the doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ such as John 1:1, and for its difficult-to-understand formal equivalence. Critics of the movement claim that the NWT is scholastically dishonest.

=== Overall review ===

In its review of Bible translations released from 1955 to 1985, &quot;The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary&quot; listed the &quot;New World Translation&quot; among the major modern translations.

In 1982, Pentecostal theologian Gordon Fee and Douglas K. Stuart in their &quot;How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth&quot; refer to the &quot;New World Translation&quot; as being an &quot;extremely literal translation&quot; filled with &quot;heretical doctrines&quot;. In 1985, Alan Stewart Duthie responded to the assertion by Fee &amp; Stuart that the NWT is &quot;filled with the heretical doctrines of this cult&quot;, stating that although &quot;there are some heretical doctrines to be found ... [it] does not reach even 0.1% of the whole, which is very far from &#x27;full&#x27;&quot;. Duthie adds &quot;if your purpose is to study the Bible in detail [...] then you can be recommended to use NJB or NAB for their accessibility and commentary features, or study edition of other translations. If your study interest is more in the original wording, then you could use RSV or NWT or NASV&quot;.

In October 1996, James B. Parkinson compared various translations and gave scores for accuracy for 30 Old Testament translations and 51 New Testament translations. Parkinson gave a score of 76 to the NWT Old Testament (1960). For the New Testament he gave the NWT (1950) overall: 75, manuscripts: 99 and translation: 66.5. He scored the &quot;Kingdom Interlinear Translation&quot; (1985) overall: 80, manuscripts: 99 and translation: 73.5. Parkinson stated, &quot;the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; New World Translation (NWT, 1950) offers a relatively accurate translation from a different theological perspective. Like Rotherham, though, it is often not smooth reading.&quot;

Jason BeDuhn stated in 2003 that the differences between Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; theology and that of mainstream denominations, &quot;creates a hostile atmosphere in which every representative of that mainstream theology charges that any variation in the NW from more familiar translation must serve the ulterior motives of distorting the &#x27;truth&#x27;&quot;.

In 2004, Anthony Byatt and Hal Flemings published their anthology &quot;″Your Word is Truth&#x27;, Essays in Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (1950, 1953)&quot;. They included essays responding to criticism of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; from non-Witnesses, and a bibliography of reviews of the work.

George D. Chryssides stated in 2019 that the unfavourable criticisms by Harold Henry Rowley (1953), Julius R. Mantey (1974) and William Barclay (1953) &quot;were extremely vague&quot;, but that Bruce M. Metzger (1953) &quot;mentioned a few specific passages which he believed were wrongly translated.&quot;

=== Old Testament ===

Regarding the &quot;New World Translation&quot;″s use of English in the first volume of the &quot;New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures&quot; (&quot;Genesis to Ruth&quot;, 1953), biblical scholar Harold Henry Rowley was critical of what he called &quot;wooden literalism&quot; and &quot;harsh construction&quot;. He characterized these as &quot;an insult to the Word of God&quot;, citing various verses of Genesis as examples. Rowley concluded, &quot;From beginning to end this [first] volume is a shining example of how the Bible should not be translated.&quot; He added in a subsequent review that &quot;the second volume shows the same faults as the first.&quot; While a member of the denomination, Rolf Furuli—a former professor in Semitic languages—said that a literal translation that follows the sentence structure of the source language rather than target language must be somewhat wooden and unidiomatic. Furuli added that Rowley&#x27;s assessment based on his own preference for idiomatic translations ignores the NWT&#x27;s stated objective of being as literal as possible.

Samuel Haas, in his 1955 review of the first volume of the NWT in the &quot;Journal of Biblical Literature&quot;, stated that he did not agree with the introduction of the name Jehovah: &quot;religious bias is shown most clearly in the policy of translating the tetragrammaton as Jehovah.&quot; He concluded, &quot;this work indicates a great deal of effort and thought as well as considerable scholarship, it is to be regretted that religious bias was allowed to colour many passages.&quot;

In 1960, Frederick William Danker wrote, &quot;not to be snubbed is the &quot;New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, Rendered from the Original by the New World Translation Committee&quot;... &#x27;the orthodox&#x27; do not possess all the truth, yet one does well to &#x27;test the spirits&#x27;.&quot;

In 1981, biblical scholar Benjamin Kedar-Kopfstein stated that the Old Testament work is largely based on the formal structure of biblical Hebrew. In 1989, Kedar-Kopfstein said, &quot;In my linguistic research in connection with the Hebrew Bible and translations, I often refer to the English edition of what is known as the &#x27;New World Translation.&#x27; In so doing, I find my feeling repeatedly confirmed that this work reflects an honest endeavor to achieve an understanding of the text that is as accurate as possible. Giving evidence of a broad command of the original language, it renders the original words into a second language understandably without deviating unnecessarily from the specific structure of the Hebrew. ... Every statement of language allows for a certain latitude in interpreting or translating. So the linguistic solution in any given case may be open to debate. But I have never discovered in the &#x27;New World Translation&#x27; any biased intent to read something into the text that it does not contain.&quot; In 1993 Kedar-Kopfstein said that the NWT is one of his occasionally quoted reference works.

=== New Testament ===

Edgar J. Goodspeed, translator of the New Testament in &quot;An American Translation&quot;, positively evaluated the New World translation. According to the October 15, 1999 issue of &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, Goodspeed wrote to the Watch Tower Society in 1950 stating, &quot;I am interested in the mission work of your people, and its world wide scope, and much pleased with the free, frank and vigorous translation. It exhibits a vast array of sound serious learning, as I can testify.&quot;

Steven T. Byington said in 1950, &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have made their own translation of the book for which they consider &#x27;New Testament&#x27; an illegitimate name. It is well supplied with faults and merits.&quot; Byington reports that he agrees with the translation of some words and not others. Regarding the introduction of the name Jehovah instead of lord, Byington says: &quot;fifteen pages of the preface present the arguments to justify this. I think the justification insufficient; but the &#x27;Jehovah&#x27; does not shock a reader&quot;. He also says that the arrangement of the verse numbers escapes confusion &quot;by making its verse numbers much lighter&quot; and adds that &quot;the use of a cheap quality of paper enables the publishers to cut the price below the already low price of the&quot; Revised Standard Version. Byington concludes: &quot;the book does not give enjoyable continuous reading; but if you are digging for excellent or suggestive renderings, this is among the richer mines.&quot;

In 1952, religious writer Alexander Thomson wrote of the &quot;New World Translation&quot;: &quot;The translation is evidently the work of skilled and clever scholars, who have sought to bring out as much of the true sense of the Greek text as the English language is capable of expressing. ... We heartily recommend the &quot;New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures&quot;, published in 1950 by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.&quot; In 1959, Thomson added that on the whole the version was quite a good one, even though it was padded with many English words which had no equivalent in the Greek or Hebrew.

Allen Wikgren (member of the &quot;New Revised Standard Version&quot; committee, as well as the committee which produced the USB Greek text) said in 1952, &quot;independent readings of merit often occur in other modern speech versions, such as Verkyl&#x27;s New Testament (1945) and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; edition of the New Testament (1950)&quot;. 

In 1953, former American Bible Society board member Bruce M. Metzger stated that the translation was written to support Jehovah&#x27;s Witness doctrines, with &quot;several quite erroneous renderings of the Greek&quot;, and cited 6 examples (John 1:1, Col. 1:15-17, Phil. 2:6, Titus 2:13, 2 Pet. 1:1, and Rev. 3:14). In 1964, Metzger again reviewed the NWT and concluded, &quot;on the whole, one gains a tolerably good impression of the scholarly equipment of the translators (their names are not divulged). They refer not only to modern translations [...] but to ancient translations as well. Frequently an intelligent use of a critical information is apparent&quot;. Metzger noted that the consistency in the decision to translate &quot;the same Greek word by the same word in English has a specious show of faithfulness to the original tends to produce a certain woodnness, resulting in the distortion of the effect of the original&quot;. Metzger considered the rendering of Κύριος as Jehovah in the New World Translation to be indefensible: &quot;Some of the translations which are simply indefensible include the following. The introduction of the word &#x27;Jehovah&#x27; into the New Testament text&quot;. He added, &quot;it is entirely without critical significance to be told that modern translations of the New Testament&quot; render &#x27;Lord&#x27; by the Tetragrammaton. Metzger also criticized the NWT&#x27;s renderings of 3 verses: John 1:1 and Colossians 1:16, as in 1953, and adds Jude 11–15.

J. Carter Swaim in 1953 wrote that &quot;objection is sometimes made to new translations on the ground that to abolish archaic phrases tends to cheapen the Scripture&quot;. Referring to the &quot;New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures&quot; he added: &quot;it is a translation that has its own peculiarities, and its own excellences too. The Witnesses, who are enthusiastic in the spread of their tenets, regard this as one of their most effective devices&quot;.

Theologian William Barclay concluded in 1953, &quot;the deliberate distortion of truth by this sect is seen in their New Testament translations. John 1:1 is translated: &#x27;...the Word was a god,&#x27; a translation which is grammatically impossible... It is abundantly clear that a sect which can translate the New Testament like that is intellectually dishonest&quot;.

In 1954, Unitarian theologian Charles Francis Potter stated about the &quot;New World Translation&quot;: &quot;Apart from a few semantic peculiarities like translating the Greek word &quot;stauros&quot; as &#x27;stake&#x27; instead of &#x27;cross&#x27;, and the often startling use of the colloquial and the vernacular, the anonymous translators have certainly rendered the best manuscript texts, both Greek and Hebrew, with scholarly ability and acumen.&quot;

Frederick E. Mayer wrote in 1954: &quot;It is a version that lends support to denial of doctrines which the Christian churches consider basic, such as the co-equality of Jesus Christ with the Father, the personhood of the Holy Spirit, and the survival of the human person after physical death. It teaches the annihilation of the wicked, the non-existence of hell, and the purely animal nature of man&#x27;s soul.&quot;

In 1961 F. F. Bruce stated: &quot;some of its distinctive renderings reflect the biblical interpretations which we have come to associate with Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (e. g. &#x27;the Word was a god&quot; in John 1:1)&quot;. He also stated that &quot;some of the renderings which are free from a theological tendency strike one as quite good&quot;.

In his review in &quot;Andover Newton Quarterly&quot; Robert M. McCoy reported in 1963: &quot;in not a few instances the &quot;New World Translation&quot; contains passages which must be considered as &#x27;theological translations.&#x27; This fact is particularly evident in those passages which express or imply the deity of Jesus Christ.&quot; He concludes: &quot;The translation of the New Testament is evidence of the presence in the movement of scholars qualified to deal intelligently with the many problems of Biblical translation. This translation, as J. Carter Swaim observes, has its peculiarities and its excellences. All in all, it would seem that a reconsideration of the challenge of this movement to the historic churches is in order.&quot; 

In 1963, theologian Anthony A. Hoekema wrote, &quot;Their New World Translation of the Bible is by no means an objective rendering of the sacred text into modern English, but is a biased translation in which many of the peculiar teachings of the Watchtower Society are smuggled into the text of the Bible itself.&quot;

Samuel MacLean Gilmour said in 1966: &quot;in 1950 the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses published their New World Translation of The New Testament, and the preparation of the New World Old Testament translation is now far advanced. The New Testament translation was made by a committee whose membership has never been revealed —a committee that possessed an unusual competence in Greek and that made the Westcott and Hort Greek text basic to their translation. It is clear that doctrinal considerations influenced many turns of phrase, but the work is no crack-pot or pseudo-historical fraud&quot;.

In 1967, Robert H. Countess wrote that the &quot;NWT has certain praiseworthy features—for example, an &quot;apparatus criticus&quot;—everyone must admit&quot;, but described the NWT&#x27;s rendering of &quot;a god&quot; at John 1:1 as &quot;most unfortunate for several reasons&quot;. In 1982, in his critical analysis &quot;The Jehovah&#x27;s Witness&#x27; New Testament&quot; he wrote that the NWT &quot;must be viewed as a radically biased piece of work. At some points it is actually dishonest. At others it is neither modern nor scholarly.&quot; Rolf Furuli, while a member of the denomination, responded, &quot;Countess ascribes to the NWT translators rules for translation which they have never expressed, and then he shows inconsistently the translators have followed these rules [...] His account of the NWT, therefore, is not a balanced, scholarly presentation; rather, it surrenders both to emotionally inspired caricature and a partisan spirit&quot;.

Julius R. Mantey, the co-author of &quot;A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament&quot; and &quot;A Hellenistic Greek Reader&quot;, said in 1980 that the NWT&#x27;s rendering of John 1:1 is &quot;a shocking mistranslation&quot; and &quot;Obsolete and incorrect&quot;.

In 2003, theologians John Weldon and John Ankerberg reviewed the &quot;New World Translation&quot;, stating: &quot;it is our goal in this article to briefly critique the English translation of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; Watchtower Bible and Tract Society&#x27;s The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT)&quot;. Weldon and Ankerberg accused the &quot;New World Translation&quot;″s translators of renderings that conform &quot;to their own preconceived and unbiblical theology&quot;, citing several examples that they considered to support theological views in favor of accurate translation.

The 2003 edition of the &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states, &quot;[Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses] are allowed no other books than the Bible and the society&#x27;s own publications, which includes its own translation of the Bible with an impressive critical apparatus. The work is excellent except when scientific knowledge comes into conflict with the accepted doctrines of the movement. In their so-called &quot;New World Translation&quot;, the term &quot;Kyrios&quot; is rendered Jehovah instead of Lord everywhere in the New Testament (237 times) except at Philippians 2.11, where St. Paul refers the word to Christ.&quot;

In 2004, historian Jason BeDuhn examined New Testament passages in which he believed &quot;bias is most likely to interfere with translation&quot; from nine of &quot;the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world&quot;. BeDuhn compared the &quot;King James&quot;, the &quot;(New) Revised Standard&quot;, the &quot;New International&quot;, the &quot;New American Bible&quot;, the &quot;New American Standard Bible&quot;, the &quot;Amplified Bible&quot;, the &quot;Living Bible&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s English&quot; and the NWT versions in Matthew 28:9, Philippians 2:6, Colossians 1:15–20, Titus 2:13, Hebrews 1:8, John 8:58, John 1:1. For each passage, he compared the Greek text with the renderings of each English translation, and looked for biased attempts to change the meaning. BeDuhn said that the &quot;New World Translation&quot; was &quot;not bias free&quot;, adding that whilst the general public and various biblical scholars might assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias, he considered it to be &quot;the most accurate of the translations compared&quot;, and a &quot;remarkably good translation&quot;. He added that &quot;most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation&quot;. Despite his positive review, BeDuhn said the introduction of the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; into the New Testament 237 times was &quot;not accurate translation by the most basic principle of accuracy&quot;, and that it &quot;violate[s] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God&quot;. In rebuttal, Thomas Howe strongly criticized BeDuhn&#x27;s positive review of the &quot;New World Translation&quot;, stating that BeDuhn&#x27;s main goal is to deny the deity of Christ. According to Howe, &quot;in this critical evaluation, BeDuhn&#x27;s arguments are challenged and his conclusions called into question&quot;.

In 2008, Kenneth J. Baumgarten and Kevin Gary Smith published an article in the South African Theological Seminary&#x27;s journal, &quot;Conspectus&quot;, entitled, &quot;An Examination of the Consistency of the New World Translation with the Stated Philosophy of the Translators&quot;, in which they studied the use of &quot;the Greek term θεός in reference to Jesus Christ&quot; and concluded that &quot;in seven of the nine sample texts, the NWT violates one or more of its stated translation values and principles. They said the most common violation is its pervasive tendency to subvert the most natural understanding of the Greek text in favour of a &#x27;preferred religious view&#x27;.&quot;

George D. Chryssides noted in 2016 that the New World Translation&#x27;s rendering of passages about Christ&#x27;s role in the creation of the world—for example, Colossians 1:15-17—are phrased in such a way as to suggest that Christ was created and not, as the Nicene Creed states, &quot;begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God.&quot;

=== Commentary about non-English versions ===

Cees Houtman wrote of the Dutch translation in 1984: &quot;respect and knowledge are the requirements that a translator must meet. It was noted above that in the past distrust was often expressed regarding the translation work of persons belonging to a different modality or denomination and there was a fear of the theological points of view being reflected in the translation. A purely objective evaluation of translations, however, must conclude that only in very exceptional cases can passages be pointed out in which the confessional (or political and social) point of view of the translators shines through. Even the New World Translation of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses can survive the scrutiny of the critics. In this context, one should also note, for example, that Remonstrants and Mennonites were able to use the SV [(Statenvertaling)]. Scripture and religious beliefs tend to come to light in notes and introductions to translations.&quot;

The Evangelical German Bible Society reviewed the German-language edition of 1986 and described the NWT as a &quot;translation that is accurate in many respects, but tendentious in the sense of the special teachings of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;.

In 2004, Xabier Pikaza wrote of the Spanish translation, &quot;Traducción del Nuevo Mundo ... is the name given by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to their version of the Bible, which is based on the conviction that the other versions, in all languages, are somehow tainted by the presuppositions of the various churches and Christian confessions. Only this version would reflect the exact content of the Scriptures in the original languages, because &#x27;The Bible is the Word of God as long as it is well translated&#x27;. It is not a direct translation from the original languages, but is made from the English text (published in 1960), although the editors claim to have faithfully consulted the original Hebrew and Greek texts. The edition, in two columns, is very well cared for; it includes a critical apparatus and numerous intertextual references. Many Catholic and Protestant scholars have accused this Bible of flaws and biased interpretations. But, on the whole, it offers a reliable vision of the Word of God, which can lead men to the New World, that is, to the Messianic Kingdom&quot;.

Sverre Bøe in 2011 said, &quot;the Norwegian version of The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT) by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses intends to be &#x27;accurate&#x27;, literal and precise, and in many respects it really is. A number of dogmatic concerns, however, break with such principles, often based on an anti-trinitarian understanding&quot;.

=== &quot;Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures&quot; ===

Thomas Nelson Winter considered the &quot;Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures&quot; to be a &quot;highly useful aid toward the mastery of &quot;koine&quot; (and classical) Greek,&quot; adding that the translation &quot;is thoroughly up-to-date and consistently accurate.&quot;

Julius R. Mantey stated that the KIT &quot;changed the readings in scores of passages to state what Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe and teach. That is a distortion not a translation.&quot;

According to the February 1, 1998 issue of &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, Jason BeDuhn ordered copies of the KIT for his students at Indiana University Bloomington, and wrote that &quot;it is the best interlinear New Testament available&quot;.

=== Controversial passages ===

Much criticism of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; involves the rendering of certain texts in the New Testament considered to be biased in favor of specific Witness practices and doctrines. These include:

* the use of &quot;torture stake&quot; instead of &quot;cross&quot; as the instrument of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion;
* the use of the indefinite article (&quot;a&quot;) in its rendering of John 1:1 to give &quot;the Word was &quot;a&quot; god&quot;;
* the term &quot;public declaration&quot; at Romans 10:10, which may reinforce the imperative to engage in public preaching;
* the term &quot;taking in knowledge&quot; rather than &quot;know&quot; at John 17:3 (in the 1984 revision), to suggest that salvation is dependent on ongoing study;
* the placement of the comma in Luke 23:43, which affects the timing of the fulfillment of Jesus&#x27; promise to the thief at Calvary.

== Russia ban ==

The New World Translation, along with the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses organization, was banned in Russia in 2017, after the prosecution used quotes from Wikipedia to argue that the translation is extremist and not a true Bible. This decision was questioned by international observers, and even by Alexander Dvorkin, who had previously asked for the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; organization to be banned.

<doc id="69890" wikidata="Q803847" url="?curid=69890" title="Binary heap">
<text>A binary heap is a heap data structure that takes the form of a binary tree. Binary heaps are a common way of implementing priority queues. The binary heap was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964 as a data structure for implementing heapsort.

A binary heap is defined as a binary tree with two additional constraints:
*Shape property: a binary heap is a &quot;complete binary tree&quot;; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
*Heap property: the key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to (≥) or less than or equal to (≤) the keys in the node&#x27;s children, according to some total order.

Heaps where the parent key is greater than or equal to (≥) the child keys are called &quot;max-heaps&quot;; those where it is less than or equal to (≤) are called &quot;min-heaps&quot;. Efficient (that is, logarithmic time) algorithms are known for the two operations needed to implement a priority queue on a binary heap:
*Inserting an element;
*Removing the smallest or largest element from (respectively) a min-heap or max-heap.
Binary heaps are also commonly employed in the heapsort sorting algorithm, which is an in-place algorithm because binary heaps can be implemented as an implicit data structure, storing keys in an array and using their relative positions within that array to represent child–parent relationships.

==Heap operations==
Both the insert and remove operations modify the heap to preserve the shape property first, by adding or removing from the end of the heap. Then the heap property is restored by traversing up or down the heap. Both operations take time.

=== Insert ===
To insert an element to a heap, we perform the following steps:

# Add the element to the bottom level of the heap at the leftmost open space.
# Compare the added element with its parent; if they are in the correct order, stop.
# If not, swap the element with its parent and return to the previous step.

Steps 2 and 3, which restore the heap property by comparing and possibly swapping a node with its parent, are called &quot;the up-heap&quot; operation (also known as &quot;bubble-up&quot;, &quot;percolate-up&quot;, &quot;sift-up&quot;, &quot;trickle-up&quot;, &quot;swim-up&quot;, &quot;heapify-up&quot;, &quot;cascade-up&quot;, or &quot;fix-up&quot;).

The number of operations required depends only on the number of levels the new element must rise to satisfy the heap property. Thus, the insertion operation has a worst-case time complexity of . For a random heap, and for repeated insertions, the insertion operation has an average-case complexity of O(1).

As an example of binary heap insertion, say we have a max-heap

and we want to add the number 15 to the heap. We first place the 15 in the position marked by the X. However, the heap property is violated since , so we need to swap the 15 and the 8. So, we have the heap looking as follows after the first swap:

However the heap property is still violated since , so we need to swap again:

which is a valid max-heap. There is no need to check the left child after this final step: at the start, the max-heap was valid, meaning the root was already greater than its left child, so replacing the root with an even greater value will maintain the property that each node is greater than its children (; if , and , then , because of the transitive relation).

=== Extract===
The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in a min-heap) while retaining the heap property is as follows:

#Replace the root of the heap with the last element on the last level.
#Compare the new root with its children; if they are in the correct order, stop.
#If not, swap the element with one of its children and return to the previous step. (Swap with its smaller child in a min-heap and its larger child in a max-heap.)
Steps 2 and 3, which restore the heap property by comparing and possibly swapping a node with one of its children, are called the &quot;down-heap&quot; (also known as &quot;bubble-down&quot;, &quot;percolate-down&quot;, &quot;sift-down&quot;, &quot;sink-down&quot;, &quot;trickle down&quot;, &quot;heapify-down&quot;, &quot;cascade-down&quot;, &quot;fix-down&quot;, &quot;extract-min&quot; or &quot;extract-max&quot;, or simply &quot;heapify&quot;) operation.

So, if we have the same max-heap as before

We remove the 11 and replace it with the 4.

Now the heap property is violated since 8 is greater than 4. In this case, swapping the two elements, 4 and 8, is enough to restore the heap property and we need not swap elements further:

The downward-moving node is swapped with the &quot;larger&quot; of its children in a max-heap (in a min-heap it would be swapped with its smaller child), until it satisfies the heap property in its new position. This functionality is achieved by the Max-Heapify function as defined below in pseudocode for an array-backed heap &quot;A&quot; of length &quot;length&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). &quot;A&quot; is indexed starting at 1.

 // Perform a down-heap or heapify-down operation for a max-heap
 // &quot;A&quot;: an array representing the heap, indexed starting at 1
 // &quot;i&quot;: the index to start at when heapifying down
 Max-Heapify(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;i&quot;):
 &quot;left&quot; ← 2×&quot;i&quot;
 &quot;right&quot; ← 2×&quot;i&quot; + 1
 &quot;largest&quot; ← &quot;i&quot;
 if &quot;left&quot; ≤ &quot;length&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) and &quot;A&quot;[&quot;left&quot;] &gt; A[&quot;largest&quot;] then:
 &quot;largest&quot; ← &quot;left&quot;
 if &quot;right&quot; ≤ &quot;length&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) and &quot;A&quot;[&quot;right&quot;] &gt; &quot;A&quot;[&quot;largest&quot;] then:
 &quot;largest&quot; ← &quot;right&quot;
 if &quot;largest&quot; ≠ &quot;i&quot; then:
 swap &quot;A&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] and &quot;A&quot;[&quot;largest&quot;]
 Max-Heapify(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;largest&quot;)

For the above algorithm to correctly re-heapify the array, no nodes besides the node at index &quot;i&quot; and its two direct children can violate the heap property. The down-heap operation (without the preceding swap) can also be used to modify the value of the root, even when an element is not being deleted.

In the worst case, the new root has to be swapped with its child on each level until it reaches the bottom level of the heap, meaning that the delete operation has a time complexity relative to the height of the tree, or O(log &quot;n&quot;).

=== Insert then extract ===
Inserting an element then extracting from the heap can be done more efficiently than simply calling the insert and extract functions defined above, which would involve both an codice_1 and codice_2 operation. Instead, we can do just a codice_2 operation, as follows:

# Compare whether the item we&#x27;re pushing or the peeked top of the heap is greater (assuming a max heap)
# If the root of the heap is greater:
## Replace the root with the new item
## Down-heapify starting from the root
# Else, return the item we&#x27;re pushing

Python provides such a function for insertion then extraction called &quot;heappushpop&quot;, which is paraphrased below. The heap array is assumed to have its first element at index 1.
 // Push a new item to a (max) heap and then extract the root of the resulting heap. 
 // &quot;heap&quot;: an array representing the heap, indexed at 1
 // &quot;item&quot;: an element to insert
 // Returns the greater of the two between &quot;item&quot; and the root of &quot;heap&quot;.
 Push-Pop(&quot;heap&quot;: List&lt;T&gt;, &quot;item&quot;: T) -&gt; T:
 if &quot;heap&quot; is not empty and heap[1] &gt; &quot;item&quot; then: // &lt; if min heap
 swap &quot;heap&quot;[1] and &quot;item&quot;
 _downheap(&quot;heap&quot; starting from index 1)
 return &quot;item&quot;
A similar function can be defined for popping and then inserting, which in Python is called &quot;heapreplace&quot;:
 // Extract the root of the heap, and push a new item 
 // &quot;heap&quot;: an array representing the heap, indexed at 1
 // &quot;item&quot;: an element to insert
 // Returns the current root of &quot;heap&quot;
 Replace(&quot;heap&quot;: List&lt;T&gt;, &quot;item&quot;: T) -&gt; T:
 swap &quot;heap&quot;[1] and &quot;item&quot;
 _downheap(&quot;heap&quot; starting from index 1)
 return &quot;item&quot;

=== Search ===
Finding an arbitrary element takes O(n) time.

=== Delete ===
Deleting an arbitrary element can be done as follows:

# Find the index formula_1 of the element we want to delete
# Swap this element with the last element. Remove the last element after the swap.
# Down-heapify or up-heapify to restore the heap property. In a max-heap (min-heap), up-heapify is only required when the new key of element formula_1 is greater (smaller) than the previous one because only the heap-property of the parent element might be violated. Assuming that the heap-property was valid between element formula_1 and its children before the element swap, it can&#x27;t be violated by a now larger (smaller) key value. When the new key is less (greater) than the previous one then only a down-heapify is required because the heap-property might only be violated in the child elements.

=== Decrease or increase key ===
The decrease key operation replaces the value of a node with a given value with a lower value, and the increase key operation does the same but with a higher value. This involves finding the node with the given value, changing the value, and then down-heapifying or up-heapifying to restore the heap property.

Decrease key can be done as follows:

# Find the index of the element we want to modify
# Decrease the value of the node
# Down-heapify (assuming a max heap) to restore the heap property

Increase key can be done as follows:

# Find the index of the element we want to modify
# Increase the value of the node
# Up-heapify (assuming a max heap) to restore the heap property

==Building a heap==
Building a heap from an array of input elements can be done by starting with an empty heap, then successively inserting each element. This approach, called Williams&#x27; method after the inventor of binary heaps, is easily seen to run in time: it performs insertions at cost each.

However, Williams&#x27; method is suboptimal. A faster method (due to Floyd) starts by arbitrarily putting the elements on a binary tree, respecting the shape property (the tree could be represented by an array, see below). Then starting from the lowest level and moving upwards, sift the root of each subtree downward as in the deletion algorithm until the heap property is restored. More specifically if all the subtrees starting at some height formula_4 have already been &quot;heapified&quot; (the bottommost level corresponding to formula_5), the trees at height formula_6 can be heapified by sending their root down along the path of maximum valued children when building a max-heap, or minimum valued children when building a min-heap. This process takes formula_7 operations (swaps) per node. In this method most of the heapification takes place in the lower levels. Since the height of the heap is formula_8, the number of nodes at height formula_4 is formula_10. Therefore, the cost of heapifying all subtrees is:

:formula_11

This uses the fact that the given infinite series formula_12 converges.

The exact value of the above (the worst-case number of comparisons during the heap construction) is known to be equal to:

:formula_13,
where is the sum of all digits of the binary representation of and is the exponent of in the prime factorization of .

The average case is more complex to analyze, but it can be shown to asymptotically approach comparisons.

The Build-Max-Heap function that follows, converts an array &quot;A&quot; which stores a complete
binary tree with &quot;n&quot; nodes to a max-heap by repeatedly using Max-Heapify (down-heapify for a max-heap) in a bottom-up manner.
The array elements indexed by
, , ..., &quot;n&quot;
are all leaves for the tree (assuming that indices start at 1)—thus each is a one-element heap, and does not need to be down-heapified. Build-Max-Heap runs

== Heap implementation ==

Heaps are commonly implemented with an array. Any binary tree can be stored in an array, but because a binary heap is always a complete binary tree, it can be stored compactly. No space is required for pointers; instead, the parent and children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices. These properties make this heap implementation a simple example of an implicit data structure or Ahnentafel list. Details depend on the root position, which in turn may depend on constraints of a programming language used for implementation, or programmer preference. Specifically, sometimes the root is placed at index 1, in order to simplify arithmetic.

Let &quot;n&quot; be the number of elements in the heap and &quot;i&quot; be an arbitrary valid index of the array storing the heap. If the tree root is at index 0, with valid indices 0 through &quot;n − &quot;1, then each element &quot;a&quot; at index &quot;i&quot; has
* children at indices 2&quot;i &quot;+ 1 and 2&quot;i &quot;+ 2
* its parent at index &quot;floor&quot;((&quot;i&quot; − 1) / 2).
Alternatively, if the tree root is at index 1, with valid indices 1 through &quot;n&quot;, then each element &quot;a&quot; at index &quot;i&quot; has
* children at indices 2&quot;i&quot; and 2&quot;i &quot;+1
* its parent at index &quot;floor&quot;(&quot;i&quot; / 2).

This implementation is used in the heapsort algorithm which reuses the space allocated to the input array to store the heap (i.e. the algorithm is done in-place). This implementation is also useful as a Priority queue. When a dynamic array is used, insertion of an unbounded number of items is possible.

The codice_1 or codice_2 operations can then be stated in terms of an array as follows: suppose that the heap property holds for the indices &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;+1, ..., &quot;e&quot;. The sift-down function extends the heap property to &quot;b&quot;−1, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;+1, ..., &quot;e&quot;.
Only index &quot;i&quot; = &quot;b&quot;−1 can violate the heap property.
Let &quot;j&quot; be the index of the largest child of &quot;a&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] (for a max-heap, or the smallest child for a min-heap) within the range &quot;b&quot;, ..., &quot;e&quot;.
(If no such index exists because then the heap property holds for the newly extended range and nothing needs to be done.)
By swapping the values &quot;a&quot;[&quot;i&quot;] and &quot;a&quot;[&quot;j&quot;] the heap property for position &quot;i&quot; is established.
At this point, the only problem is that the heap property might not hold for index &quot;j&quot;.
The sift-down function is applied tail-recursively to index &quot;j&quot; until the heap property is established for all elements.

The sift-down function is fast. In each step it only needs two comparisons and one swap. The index value where it is working doubles in each iteration, so that at most log2 &quot;e&quot; steps are required.

For big heaps and using virtual memory, storing elements in an array according to the above scheme is inefficient: (almost) every level is in a different page. B-heaps are binary heaps that keep subtrees in a single page, reducing the number of pages accessed by up to a factor of ten.

The operation of merging two binary heaps takes Θ(&quot;n&quot;) for equal-sized heaps. The best you can do is (in case of array implementation) simply concatenating the two heap arrays and build a heap of the result. A heap on &quot;n&quot; elements can be merged with a heap on &quot;k&quot; elements using O(log &quot;n&quot; log &quot;k&quot;) key comparisons, or, in case of a pointer-based implementation, in O(log &quot;n&quot; log &quot;k&quot;) time. An algorithm for splitting a heap on &quot;n&quot; elements into two heaps on &quot;k&quot; and &quot;n-k&quot; elements, respectively, based on a new view
of heaps as an ordered collections of subheaps was presented in. The algorithm requires O(log &quot;n&quot; * log &quot;n&quot;) comparisons. The view also presents a new and conceptually simple algorithm for merging heaps. When merging is a common task, a different heap implementation is recommended, such as binomial heaps, which can be merged in O(log &quot;n&quot;).

Additionally, a binary heap can be implemented with a traditional binary tree data structure, but there is an issue with finding the adjacent element on the last level on the binary heap when adding an element. This element can be determined algorithmically or by adding extra data to the nodes, called &quot;threading&quot; the tree—instead of merely storing references to the children, we store the inorder successor of the node as well.

It is possible to modify the heap structure to make the extraction of both the smallest and largest element possible in formula_14formula_15 time. To do this, the rows alternate between min heap and max-heap. The algorithms are roughly the same, but, in each step, one must consider the alternating rows with alternating comparisons. The performance is roughly the same as a normal single direction heap. This idea can be generalized to a min-max-median heap.

== Derivation of index equations ==
In an array-based heap, the children and parent of a node can be located via simple arithmetic on the node&#x27;s index. This section derives the relevant equations for heaps with their root at index 0, with additional notes on heaps with their root at index 1.

To avoid confusion, we define the level of a node as its distance from the root, such that the root itself occupies level 0.

=== Child nodes ===

For a general node located at index (beginning from 0), we will first derive the index of its right child, formula_16.

Let node be located in level , and note that any level contains exactly formula_17 nodes. Furthermore, there are exactly formula_18 nodes contained in the layers up to and including layer (think of binary arithmetic; 0111...111 = 1000...000 - 1). Because the root is stored at 0, the th node will be stored at index formula_19. Putting these observations together yields the following expression for the index of the last node in layer .

::formula_20

Let there be nodes after node in layer L, such that

::formula_21

Each of these nodes must have exactly 2 children, so there must be formula_22 nodes separating &#x27;s right child from the end of its layer (formula_23).

::formula_24

Noting that the left child of any node is always 1 place before its right child, we get formula_25.

If the root is located at index 1 instead of 0, the last node in each level is instead at index formula_18. Using this throughout yields formula_27 and formula_28 for heaps with their root at 1.

=== Parent node ===

Every non-root node is either the left or right child of its parent, so one of the following must hold:

* formula_29
* formula_30

Hence,
::formula_31

Now consider the expression formula_32.

If node formula_1 is a left child, this gives the result immediately, however, it also gives the correct result if node formula_1 is a right child. In this case, formula_35 must be even, and hence formula_36 must be odd.

::formula_37

Therefore, irrespective of whether a node is a left or right child, its parent can be found by the expression:

::formula_38

==Related structures==
Since the ordering of siblings in a heap is not specified by the heap property, a single node&#x27;s two children can be freely interchanged unless doing so violates the shape property (compare with treap). Note, however, that in the common array-based heap, simply swapping the children might also necessitate moving the children&#x27;s sub-tree nodes to retain the heap property.

The binary heap is a special case of the d-ary heap in which d = 2.

<text>The IMI Galil () is a family of Israeli-made automatic rifles chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges. Originally designed by Yisrael Galili and Yakov Lior in the late 1960s, the Galil was first produced by the state-owned Israel Military Industries and is now exported by the privatized Israel Weapon Industries.

The first Galil rifle was manufactured using RK 62 receivers. Moreover, the Galil design is largely based on the Finnish rifle RK 62 (a derivative of the AK-47).

The Israeli Army initially deployed the 5.56×45mm NATO Galil in three basic configurations; the automatic rifle machine-gun (ARM), the automatic rifle (AR), and the short automatic rifle (SAR). A modern version of the Galil currently in production in multiple calibers is known as the Galil ACE.

==History==
The Belgian FN FAL battle rifle had initially been adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces in the late 1950s (chambered for the 7.62×51mm cartridge). The FAL had its limitations, a common complaint being that the abundant local sand and dust exposure would cause weapon malfunction (later attributed to lack of stringent maintenance). Overall, however, the FN FAL was considered long and bulky. Its length and malfunctions became such consistent issues that during the 1973 Yom Kippur War some soldiers began arming themselves with the much smaller Uzi.

During the Six-Day War the Israelis captured thousands of primarily Egyptian AK-47s. This rifle was proven reliable and controllable. The required maintenance was low enough that conscripted troops had less stringent regulations on the weapon&#x27;s care.

When the IDF began the process of procuring a new, automatic rifle, the AK-47 was considered, but the difficulty of procurement limited its viability. Hence the IDF specifically sought a weapon that would offer the same benefits as AK-47, such as low maintenance requirements, but would also have the accuracy of the M16 and FN FAL. The would-be standard weapon was originally nicknamed the &quot;Balashnikov&quot;. Several weapons were tendered to the Israeli Army, in response to its specifications for a standard-issue assault rifle. These included the M16A1 and Stoner 63 from the US, and the HK33 (West Germany). An indigenous design was offered by Uziel Gal, creator of the Uzi submachine gun. This was found complex and unreliable.

The successful design was offered by Yisrael Galil, based on the 7.62×39mm Valmet Rk 62, an AK-47 derivative from Finland. (The first Galils were manufactured with Valmet Rk 62 receivers.) At the time, the US was replacing European countries (especially France) as Israel&#x27;s main partner and weapons supplier. Hence, Galil&#x27;s rifle was chambered for the US 5.56×45mm round (originally the US M193 55-grain version). Tests conducted from the end of the 1960s to the early 1970s led to Galili&#x27;s rifle emerging as the winner. However, issuance of the Galil was delayed by the sudden onset of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

The Israeli army first used the 5.56×45mm NATO caliber Galil in three basic configurations:

* The Automatic Rifle Machine-gun (ARM) with bi-pod, wire-cutter and carrying handle; would become the standard service rifle issued to front line infantry troops. Also the version that famously features a bottle opener in the front hand-guard.
* The Automatic Rifle (AR) with no bi-pod, wire-cutter or carrying handle. Issued to support troops and military police units.
* The Short Automatic Rifle (SAR) with shortened barrel. Issued to vehicle crews, army staff and specialty troops.

Although the Galil was the official service rifle of Israel from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, it was never the principal rifle used (in terms of numbers). Around 1975, 60,000 M16A1s from the U.S. Military Aid Program (MAP) began to arrive in Israel that were quickly integrated into IDF service. The cost of producing the Galil for all IDF forces was very expensive, and Israel continued to purchase M16s and later M4s with military credit from the US, which had replaced many Galils then in service. In general, Israeli troops preferred the M16, because it was lighter and more accurate, if not quite as rugged and reliable. When the M4 came along, this weapon (with its short length and light weight) became even more attractive, along with the M4&#x27;s versatility in using different optics without losing zeroing when the weapon was disassembled, plus other rail-mounted accessories. The M16 and M4 also proved to be better suited to the grenade launching role, using the US M203 integrated 40mm launcher. Israeli paratroops in particular preferred the M4 carbine to the Galil, while the M16 was retained for training recruits, reservists, Artillery Corps, and the Armored Corps (Heil HaShiryon).

By 2000, both the Galil ARM and AR variants were phased out from standard issue and replaced by M4 and M16 variants. The Galil SAR (&quot;G&#x27;lilon&quot;) was kept in use by some rear-line services, including the Knesset Guard and the Artillery and Armored Corps, until around 2004.

For a short time, the Galil was licensed by NWM (Nederlandsche Wapen-en Munitiefabriek) De Kruithoorn N.V. for sales to a NATO country.

Currently they are only manufactured in Colombia by Indumil, alongside the Galil Ace and the Galil Córdova, the latter of which was designed by Indumil.

400 Galil rifles were purchased through the Antiguan government for the Medelin cartel.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===
The Galil series of rifles are selective fire weapons operated by a Kalashnikov-pattern gas-driven long-stroke piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a rotary bolt with two locking lugs that lock into recesses milled into the receiver.

When fired, a portion of the propellant gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier on the right side of the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.

The ejection of spent cases from the Galil is sometimes a violent action. Cases can be dented by the ejector and be thrown as much as 40 ft away from the rifle in some cases, depending on position.

===Features===
The Galil is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism patterned after the trigger used in the American M1 Garand. The rifle&#x27;s fire selector switch has three positions: S-A-R. The standard AK-47 style selector is retained on the right face of the receiver, and a dual thumb-selector is present on the left face above the pistol grip for easier manipulation. Pushing the left-selector to the rear position &quot;R&quot; (British terminology for &quot;repetition&quot;), provides semi-automatic fire. Pushing it to the middle position &quot;A&quot; produces fully automatic fire. Pushing the lever fully forward to &quot;S&quot; will activate the safety. Some models use a reverse-linkage RAS mechanism that performs the opposite action; pushing forward sets the rifle to Repetition or Automatic, and pulling rearward engages the safety,

The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted sheet metal steel receiver, but due to the higher operating pressures of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block, and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.

The Gas-Block, handguard retainers and folding-stock mechanism components are cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, trigger guard, dust cover (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.

The weapon is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle can be used with a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.

===Barrel===
Early production models were supplied with barrels that had six right-hand grooves and a 305mm (1:12 in) rifling twist (optimized for use with M193 ammunition), while recent production models feature a 178mm (1:7 in) twist barrel with six right-hand grooves (used to stabilize the heavier SS109/M855 projectile). The barrel has a slotted flash suppressor with 6 ports and can be used to launch rifle grenades (such as the BT/AT 52) or mount a bayonet lug attachment (it will accept the M7 bayonet).

===Feeding===
The Galil is fed from a curved, steel box magazine with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with ballistite (blank) cartridges, used to launch rifle grenades. The magazine is inserted front end first in a similar manner to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type STANAG magazines. Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted that it is difficult to engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine&#x27;s extended length.

===Sights===
The L-shaped rear sight has two apertures preset for firing at 0–300 m and 300–500 m respectively (the rear sight can only be adjusted for elevation). The front post is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation zero and is enclosed in a protective hood. Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous tritium capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100 m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted dovetail adapter that is used to mount various optical sights.

===Stock===
The standard stock found on the Galil is a rough-copy of the FN-FAL Paratrooper stock, with modifications for simpler production and ease of use. Unlike the FAL folding stock, the Galil uses no locking button and is operated entirely by a pin and spring pivoting mechanism; to fold the stock, the &quot;L&quot; bracket on the stock portion is pressed down to where the spring is fully compressed and the entire stock is allowed to pivot on the buttstock hinge. The same operation is done for unfolding to the stock to the open-position.

The bracket and knuckle assemblies feature camming surfaces that allow the emergency unfolding of the stock by simply pulling the buttstock rearwards, however this should generally be avoided as it will wear down the mechanism rapidly over time, and lead to the stock wobbling in both positions.

There were six different types of Galil folding stock (not including the Micro or Galatz models) that were utilized over time on the Galil and R4 series of weapons. Wooden AK47 type buttstocks were also offered by request, although none are known to have been used by any militaries and were mostly relegated to the civilian market.

Contrary to popular belief, all Galil folding stocks are made of tubular aluminum like its FAL rendition; steel was never used, as it would have added too much additional weight, and the aluminum stocks were more than durable for standard firing and rifle-grenade usage.

==Variants==

===Galil AR===

This variant is the standard rifle version, fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip, a side-folding tubular metal skeleton stock that folds to the right side (fitted to all variants except the Galil Sniper). The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a barrel.

===Galil SAR===
This variant (aka: G&#x27;lilon) is configured with a shorter barrel. Due to having a shorter barrel, a corresponding shorter piston and gas tube as well as a unique gas block are also found on the SAR. The SAR variant saw the longest service life in the IDF, being used with the Armored Corps until 2005. The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a barrel. While the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a barrel.

===Galil ARM===

This variant is additionally equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler in temperature during sustained automatic fire, and also has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod&#x27;s legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, can be used to open bottles by design (in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose, which damaged them). The 5.56mm NATO version uses a 35-round magazine and a has a barrel, while the 7.62mm NATO version uses a 25-round magazine and has a barrel.

===Micro Galil===
The most recent addition to the Galil family of weapons is the MAR compact carbine, which retains the internal features of the original Galil with a completely new frame, operating system and an even shorter barrel. Introduced to the public at the second International Defence Industry Exhibition in Poland in 1994, the weapon was developed for use with the army and police special units, vehicle crews, army staff, special operations personnel and airborne infantry.

The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size version of the Galil SAR (706 mm stock extended / 465 mm folded), weighing 2.98 kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel , receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has a cyclic rate of fire of around 650–750 RPM (rounds per minute), which is a bit higher than the full sized rifles. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located on both sides of the receiver) has four settings: &quot;S&quot;—weapon is safe, &quot;A&quot;—automatic fire, &quot;B&quot;—3-round burst, &quot;R&quot;—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300 m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer, and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164 kg, or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.

The MAR has undergone several changes over time, and it is worth noting that it may also be found with a polymer-coated aluminum stock or an all-polymer stock. The Model 699 is available with a 267mm barrel and optional left-side charging handle which is welded onto the left side of the bolt carrier and protrudes through a slot cut in the receiver cover that is covered by a spring-loaded cover while the bolt carrier is forward.

===Galil Sniper===

The 7.62mm Galil Sniper (aka: &quot;Galil Tzalafim&quot; or &quot;Galatz&quot;) is a derivative of the ARM that is used in conjunction with high-quality 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition for consistent accuracy.

The precision rifle is a semi-automatic-only rifle with a similar operating system to other Galil variants, but optimised for accuracy. The rifle is fed from a proprietary 25-round box magazine. It uses a heavy-profile match barrel that is heavier than that used on other variants. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which acts as both a flash suppressor and a muzzle brake. It can be replaced with a sound suppressor, which requires the use of subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness.

The weapon was modified with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds to the right side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6×40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing), and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.

The Galatz was first introduced in 1983. The SR-99 is a modernized version of the Galatz featuring an adjustable skeleton stock instead of a wooden stock, synthetic handguard, and a synthetic pistol grip. It is somewhat less rugged but more ergonomic.

The Galatz is made under license by Punj Lloyd Raksha Systems and the Z111 Factory in Vietnam.

===Other variants===

* Magal: A law enforcement carbine variant of the Galil MAR chambered in .30 carbine. It uses the same 15- and 30-round magazines as the M1 carbine, as well as a dedicated 27-round magazine incorporating a bolt hold-open device. First issued in 1999, the MAGAL was withdrawn from service in 2001 after numerous complaints of malfunctions.
* Marksman Assault Rifle Mark 1: 5.56mm designated marksman rifle introduced in 1996. Has a scope and padded stock.
* Golani: A civilian version with a new-production milled semi-automatic receiver and barrel built in the United States. All other components are original IMI Galil production parts.
*Galil ACE: The new generation of the Galil rifle, utilizing a left-side-mounted charging handle, a spring-loaded dust cover, and a plastic or polymer lower receiver designed to lower cost and weight. The ACE has been produced in three versions (Micro, SAR and AR) chambered for 5.56mm NATO, 5.45×39mm, 7.62mm Soviet M43 and 7.62mm NATO. All variants have up to five picatinny rails for mounting optical devices and accessories, It can be stripped without any tools.

===Foreign variants===

====Italian variants====
The Italian firearms manufacturing firm Vincenzo Bernardelli manufactured under license quantities of the Galil assault rifle in two different models for governmental use in the 1980s. The Bernardelli Mod.377 VB-STD assault rifle was an outright clone of the Galil AR/ARM variant.

The Bernardelli Mod.378 VB-SR assault carbine was a modified clone of the Galil SAR with a different magazine well that accepted STANAG magazines, much similar in concept and look to the above-mentioned optional magazine adapter currently available for the Israeli-made models, except that the Bernardelli VB-SR could be manufactured with permanent STANAG magazine well modification on demand. The rifles competed to the trial for the adoption of a new 5.56×45mm NATO caliber rifle, but lost to the Beretta 70/90 assault weapons system.

Both rifles have the A-R-S trigger group (S-E-F; Safe, Semi-Auto, Full-Auto). The STD can be adapted to mount the M203.

The VB-SR&#x27;s parts can be changed with the R5 and the Galil SAR.

====Myanmar variants====
====South African variants====
The Vektor R4 is a South African variant of the Galil ARM assault rifle with several modifications; notably, both the stock and magazine are made of a high-strength polymer and the stock was lengthened, adapting the weapon for the average-sized South African soldier.

====Swedish variants====
The FFV 890 C is a Swedish assault rifle based on the Galil SAR, which was manufactured by Försvarets Fabriksverk. The rifle was FFV&#x27;s entry to the Swedish Armed Forces trials for the new 5.56 mm assault rifle in 1979–1980; in the initial tests, IMI manufactured Galil ARM and SAR renamed as FFV 890 had participated in its stead. Despite the FFV 890 C being superior to the other final contestant in the field trials, FN FNC, the FNC was chosen due to lower manufacturing costs. Due to the loss in the trials, it was never widely adopted anywhere, and saw only limited use within the Swedish police.

<text>A headache, also known as cephalalgia, is the symptom of pain in the face, head, or neck. It can occur as a migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache. There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches.
Headaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society, which classifies it into more than 150 types of primary and secondary headaches. Causes of headaches may include dehydration; fatigue; sleep deprivation; stress; the effects of medications (overuse) and recreational drugs, including withdrawal; viral infections; loud noises; head injury; rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage; and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis).
Treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication (especially in case of migraine or cluster headaches). A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.
About half of adults have a headache in a given year. Tension headaches are the most common, affecting about 1.6 billion people (21.8% of the population) followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million (11.7%).
== Causes ==
There are more than 200 types of headaches. Some are harmless and some are life-threatening. The description of the headache and findings on neurological examination, determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best.

Headaches are broadly classified as &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot;. Primary headaches are benign, recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems. For example, migraine is a type of primary headache. While primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability, they are not dangerous from a physiological point of view. Secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease, like an infection, head injury, vascular disorders, brain bleed, stomach irritation, or tumors. Secondary headaches can be dangerous. Certain &quot;red flags&quot; or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous.

===Primary===
Ninety percent of all headaches are primary headaches. Primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old. The most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches. They have different characteristics. Migraines typically present with pulsing head pain, nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing &quot;bandlike&quot; pressure on both sides of the head, not accompanied by other symptoms. Such kind of headaches may be further classified into-episodic and chronic tension type headaches Other very rare types of primary headaches include:
* cluster headaches: short episodes (15–180 minutes) of severe pain, usually around one eye, with autonomic symptoms (tearing, red eye, nasal congestion) which occur at the same time every day. Cluster headaches can be treated with triptans and prevented with prednisone, ergotamine or lithium.
* trigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia: shooting face pain
* hemicrania continua: continuous unilateral pain with episodes of severe pain. Hemicrania continua can be relieved by the medication indomethacin.
* primary stabbing headache: recurrent episodes of stabbing &quot;ice pick pain&quot; or &quot;jabs and jolts&quot; for 1 second to several minutes without autonomic symptoms (tearing, red eye, nasal congestion). These headaches can be treated with indomethacin.
* primary cough headache: starts suddenly and lasts for several minutes after coughing, sneezing or straining (anything that may increase pressure in the head). Serious causes (see secondary headaches red flag section) must be ruled out before a diagnosis of &quot;benign&quot; primary cough headache can be made.
* primary exertional headache: throbbing, pulsatile pain which starts during or after exercising, lasting for 5 minutes to 24 hours. The mechanism behind these headaches is unclear, possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate, causing pain. These headaches can be prevented by not exercising too strenuously and can be treated with medications such as indomethacin.
* primary sex headache: dull, bilateral headache that starts during sexual activity and becomes much worse during orgasm. These headaches are thought to be due to lower pressure in the head during sex. It is important to realize that headaches that begin during orgasm may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, so serious causes must be ruled out first. These headaches are treated by advising the person to stop sex if they develop a headache. Medications such as propranolol and diltiazem can also be helpful.
* hypnic headache: a moderate-severe headache that starts a few hours after falling asleep and lasts 15–30 minutes. The headache may recur several times during the night. Hypnic headaches are usually in older women. They may be treated with lithium.

=== Secondary ===

Headaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck. Some of these are not harmful, such as cervicogenic headache (pain arising from the neck muscles). The excessive use of painkillers can paradoxically cause worsening painkiller headaches.

More serious causes of secondary headaches include the following:
* meningitis: inflammation of the meninges which presents with fever and meningismus, or stiff neck
* ischemic stroke or a previous stage of the same
* hemorragic stroke or a previous stage of the same
* intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding inside the brain) because of any origin
* subarachnoid hemorrhage (with acute, severe headache, stiff neck without fever) because of any origin
* intraparenchymal hemorrhage (with headache only) because of any origin
* ruptured aneurysm or aneurysm
* brain tumor (a form of cancer): dull headache, worse with exertion and change in position, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Often, the person will have nausea and vomiting for weeks before the headache starts.
* temporal arteritis: inflammatory disease of arteries common in the elderly (average age 70) with fever, headache, weight loss, jaw claudication, tender vessels by the temples, polymyalgia rheumatica
* acute closed-angle glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyeball): a headache that starts with eye pain, blurry vision, associated with nausea and vomiting. On physical exam, the person will have red eyes and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil.
* arteriovenous malformation
* post-ictal headaches: Headaches that happen after a convulsion or other type of seizure, as part of the period after the seizure (the post-ictal state)

Gastrointestinal disorders may cause headaches, including Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, and hepatobiliary disorders. The treatment of the gastrointestinal disorders may lead to a remission or improvement of headaches.

Migraine headaches are also associated with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). CVS is characterized by episodes of severe vomiting, and often occur alongside symptoms similar to those of migraine headaches (photophobia, abdominal pain, etc.).

== Pathophysiology ==
The brain itself is not sensitive to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth, and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.

Headaches often result from traction or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. The pain receptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumours and cause headaches. Blood vessel spasms, dilated blood vessels, inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate pain receptors. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fibre to the nerve cells in the brain, signalling that a part of the body hurts.

Primary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches. The exact mechanisms which cause migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known. There have been different hypotheses over time that attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches.

Migraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain. Previously, migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain. This vascular theory, which was developed in the 20th century by Wolff, suggested that the aura in migraines is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels (vessels inside the brain), and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels (vessels just outside the brain). Dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves, causing a headache. The vascular theory is no longer accepted. Studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation, but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation.

Currently, most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain. Auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex (a part of the brain) known as cortical spreading depression followed by a period of depressed activity. Some people think headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides or serotonin, causing inflammation in arteries, dura and meninges and also cause some vasodilation. Triptans, medications that treat migraines, block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels.

People who are more susceptible to experiencing migraines without headaches are those who have a family history of migraines, women, and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking birth control pills or are prescribed hormone replacement therapy.

Tension headaches are thought to be caused by the activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles.

Cluster headaches involve overactivation of the trigeminal nerve and hypothalamus in the brain, but the exact cause is unknown.

== Diagnosis ==
Most headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone. If the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous, further testing with neuroimaging or lumbar puncture may be necessary. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not useful for headache diagnosis.

The first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new. A &quot;new headache&quot; can be a headache that has started recently, or a chronic headache that has changed character. For example, if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head, and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head, they have a new headache.

=== Red flags ===
It can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk, benign headaches and high-risk, dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar. Headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose.

The American College for Emergency Physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches. They are as follows:
* age younger than 30 years
* features typical of primary headache
* history of similar headache
* no abnormal findings on neurologic exam
* no concerning change in normal headache pattern
* no high-risk comorbid conditions (for example, HIV)
* no new concerning history or physical examination findings

A number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage. These &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms mean that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests.

In general, people complaining of their &quot;first&quot; or &quot;worst&quot; headache warrant imaging and further workup. People with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging, as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing, pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain. People with neurological findings on exam, such as weakness, also need further workup.

The American Headache Society recommends using &quot;SSNOOP&quot;, a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache:
* Systemic symptoms (fever or weight loss)
* Systemic disease (HIV infection, malignancy)
* Neurologic symptoms or signs
* Onset sudden (thunderclap headache)
* Onset after age 40 years
* Previous headache history (first, worst, or different headache)

Other red flag symptoms include:
=== Old headaches ===
Old headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous. They are most often caused by migraines or tension headaches. Migraines are often unilateral, pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea or vomiting. There may be an aura (visual symptoms, numbness or tingling) 30–60 minutes before the headache, warning the person of a headache. Migraines may also not have auras. Tension-type headaches usually have bilateral &quot;bandlike&quot; pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting. However, some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap. It is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different.

The mnemonic &#x27;POUND&#x27; helps distinguish between migraines and tension-type headaches. POUND stands for: 

One review article found that if 4–5 of the POUND characteristics are present, a migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than a tension-type headache (likelihood ratio 24). If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (likelihood ratio 3). If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension-type headaches are 60% more likely (likelihood ratio 0.41). Another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension-type headache: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity, unilateral, throbbing quality, chocolate as a headache trigger, and cheese as a headache trigger.

Cluster headaches are relatively rare (1 in 1000 people) and are more common in men than women. They present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, runny nose and red eye).

Temporomandibular jaw pain (chronic pain in the jaw joint), and cervicogenic headache (headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck) are also possible diagnoses.

For chronic, unexplained headaches, keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers, such as association with menstrual cycle, exercise and food. While mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common, a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise.

Cephalalgiaphobia is fear of headaches or getting a headache.

=== New headaches ===
New headaches are more likely to be dangerous secondary headaches. They can, however, simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome, like migraine or a tension headache.

One recommended diagnostic approach is as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual impairment, new seizures, new weakness, or new confusion, further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography scan (CT scan) to look for a brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. In an older person, if there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness, a temporal artery biopsy should be preformed to look for temporal arteritis, immediate treatment should be started, if results of the biopsy are positive.

=== Neuroimaging ===

==== Old headaches ====
The US Headache Consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches. Most old, chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging. If a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine, neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality. If the person has neurological findings, such as weakness, on exam, neuroimaging may be considered.

==== New headaches ====
All people who present with red flags indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person&#x27;s headaches.

The American College of Radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations:

==== Lumbar puncture ====
A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle. A lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column, which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (usually young, obese women who have increased intracranial pressure), or other causes of increased intracranial pressure. In most cases, a CT scan should be done first.

=== Classification ===
Headaches are most thoroughly classified by the International Headache Society&#x27;s International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which published the second edition in 2004. The third edition of the International Headache Classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version. This classification is accepted by the WHO.

Other classification systems exist. One of the first published attempts was in 1951. The US National Institutes of Health developed a classification system in 1962.

==== ICHD-2 ====

The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is an in-depth hierarchical classification of headaches published by the International Headache Society. It contains explicit (operational) diagnostic criteria for headache disorders. The first version of the classification, ICHD-1, was published in 1988. The current revision, ICHD-2, was published in 2004. The classification uses numeric codes. The top, one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups. The first four of these are classified as primary headaches, groups 5-12 as secondary headaches, cranial neuralgia, central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups.

The ICHD-2 classification defines migraines, tension-types headaches, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches. Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough, exertion and sexual activity (sexual headache) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.

Secondary headaches are classified based on their cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headache may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system.

ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.

The ICHD-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of neuralgia in a different category. According to this system, there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain. Moreover, the ICHD-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified.

Although the ICHD-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches (primarily primary headaches), it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner.

==== NIH ====

The NIH classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches.

The NIH system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches. In this case, primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural causes. According to this classification, primary headaches can only be vascular, myogenic, cervicogenic, traction, and inflammatory.

== Management ==
Primary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments. In those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit.

=== Secondary headaches (caused by another disease) ===
Treatment of secondary headaches involves treating their underlying cause. For example, a person with meningitis will require antibiotics, and a person with a brain tumor may require surgery, chemotherapy or brain radiation. The possible origins of a headache have been studied and classified.

=== Migraines ===
Migraine can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes, but most people require medicines to control their symptoms. Medications are either to prevent getting migraines, or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts.

Preventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month, headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling. Possible therapies include beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs. The type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has. For example, if the person also has depression, an antidepressant is a good choice.

Abortive therapies for migraines may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication that mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.

Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPG block, also known nasal ganglion block or pterygopalatine ganglion blocks) can abort and prevent migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches. It was originally described by American ENT surgeon Greenfield Sluder in 1908. Both blocks and neurostimulation have been studied as treatment for headaches.

Several complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated relaxation training, electromyographic feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy may be considered for migraine treatment, along with medications.

=== Tension-type headaches ===
Tension-type headaches can usually be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin), or acetaminophen. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.

=== Cluster headaches ===
Abortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan (injected under the skin) and triptan nasal sprays. High flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief.

For people with extended periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of prednisone (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1–2 hours before an attack.

=== Neuromodulation ===
Peripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine. How it may work is still being looked into.

== Epidemiology ==
Literature reviews find that approximately 64–77% of adults have had a headache at some point in their lives. During each year, on average, 46–53% of people have headaches. However, the prevalence of headache varies widely depending on how the survey was conducted, with studies finding lifetime prevalence of as low as 8% to as high as 96%. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. Only approximately 1–5% of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause.

More than 90% of headaches are primary headaches. Most of these primary headaches are tension headaches. Most people with tension headaches have &quot;episodic&quot; tension headaches that come and go. Only 3.3% of adults have chronic tension headaches, with headaches for more than 15 days in a month.

Approximately 12–18% of people in the world have migraines. More women than men experience migraines. In Europe and North America, 5–9% of men experience migraines, while 12–25% of women experience migraines.

Cluster headaches are relatively uncommon. They affect only 1–3 per thousand people in the world. Cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women.

== History ==

The first recorded classification system was published by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a medical scholar of Greco-Roman antiquity. He made a distinction between three different types of headache: i) cephalalgia, by which he indicates a sudden onset, temporary headache; ii) cephalea, referring to a chronic type of headache; and iii) heterocrania, a paroxysmal headache on one side of the head.
Another classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by Thomas Willis, in &quot;De Cephalalgia&quot; in 1672. In 1787 Christian Baur generally divided headaches into idiopathic (primary headaches) and symptomatic (secondary ones), and defined 84 categories.

== Children ==
In general, children experience the same types of headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different. The diagnostic approach to headaches in children is similar to that of adults. However, young children may not be able to verbalize pain well. If a young child is fussy, they may have a headache.

Approximately 1% of emergency department visits for children are for headache. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. The most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5%). Other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache (20%), headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (a device put into the brain to remove excess CSF and reduce pressure in the brain) (11.5%) and migraine (8.5%). The most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma), brain abscesses, meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. Only 4–6.9% of kids with a headache have a serious cause.

Just as in adults, most headaches are benign, but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging.

When children complain of headaches, many parents are concerned about a brain tumor. Generally, headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting. One study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are: headache for greater than 6 months, headache related to sleep, vomiting, confusion, no visual symptoms, no family history of migraine and abnormal neurologic exam.

Some measures can help prevent headaches in children. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day, avoiding caffeine, getting enough and regular sleep, eating balanced meals at the proper times, and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches. Treatments for children are similar to those for adults, however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children.

Children who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults. In one study of 100 children with headache, eight years later 44% of those with tension headache and 28% of those with migraines were headache free. In another study of people with chronic daily headache, 75% did not have chronic daily headaches two years later, and 88% did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later.

=== Cardiac Cephalgia in Heart Attack ===
Cardiac cephalgia is a rare type of headache occurring during myocardial infarction, characterized by sudden, severe head pain that typically develops during or immediately following a heart attack. The pain is usually located in the occipital or frontal regions and can be accompanied by other cardiac symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or radiating arm pain. This specific headache type is considered a potential warning sign of cardiac distress and requires immediate medical attention to prevent potentially life-threatening complications.

<text>Wales ( ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It is bordered by the Irish Sea to the north and west, England to the east, the Bristol Channel to the south, and the Celtic Sea to the south-west. , it had a population of 3.2 million. It has a total area of and over of coastline. It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. Its capital and largest city is Cardiff.

A distinct Welsh culture emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glyndŵr led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament (). In the 16th century the whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party. Welsh national feeling grew over the century: a nationalist party, , was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. A governing system of Welsh devolution is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of devolved policy matters.

At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial one; the South Wales Coalfield&#x27;s exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales&#x27;s population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, and the nearby valleys. The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population, with Wrexham being the largest northern city. The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated. Since decline of the country&#x27;s traditional extractive and heavy industries, the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism play major roles in its economy. Agriculture in Wales is largely livestock-based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency.

Both Welsh and English are official languages. A majority of the population of Wales speaks English. Welsh is the dominant language in parts of the north and west, with a total of 538,300 Welsh speakers across the entire country. Wales has four UNESCO world heritage sites, of which three are in the north.

==Etymology==

The English words &quot;Wales&quot; and &quot;Welsh&quot; derive from the same Old English root (singular , plural ), a descendant of Proto-Germanic , which was itself derived from the name of the Gauls known to the Romans as Volcae. This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire. Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. Historically in Britain, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire).

The modern Welsh name for themselves is , and is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced ) are descended from the Brythonic word &quot;combrogi&quot;, meaning &quot;fellow-countrymen&quot;, and probably came into use before the 7th century. In literature, they could be spelt or , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. The Latinised forms of these names, &quot;Cambrian&quot;, &quot;Cambric&quot; and &quot;Cambria&quot;, survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period.

==History==
Although the Welsh nation would not arise until the middle ages, the territory of Wales was permanently settled from the end of the last ice age onwards. These first farmers left many impressive funerary monuments, as well as settlement sites that speak to a dispersed culture. With the arrival of the bronze age, the Great Orme in North Wales became Britain&#x27;s premier producer of copper, one of the key ores for smelting bronze. It is likely that the wealth of mineral resources in Britain, and especially Wales, attracted the Roman invasion, but by this time the island had become distinctively Celtic in culture, and the neolithic population was largely replaced. It was this iron age Celtic culture, and their common language, that were called the Britons by the Romans.

With the departure of the Romans, Britain fractured into various kingdoms. Despite this, there is a sense in which the Roman withdrawal of 383 created a post Roman nation of Britons, with Magnus Maximus proclaimed Roman emperor in Britannia and Gaul. Although long before the term Cymry (the Welsh term for the Welsh) had been adopted, the concept of a British people, from which the Welsh would emerge, was created here.

Encroachment by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers gradually displaced the indigenous culture and language of the Britons, and one group of these Britons became isolated by the geography of the western peninsula, bounded by the sea and English neighbours. It was these English neighbours who named the land Wallia, and the people Welsh.

The people of Wallia, medieval Wales, remained divided into separate kingdoms that fought with each other as much as they fought their English neighbours. Neither were the communities homogenously Welsh. Place name, historical records and archaeological evidence point to coastal Viking/Norse settlement in places such as Swansea, Fishguard and Anglesey, and Saxons settled inland amongst the Welsh in places such as Presteigne.
In the 10th century, Hywel ap Cadell, later Hywel Dda, formed the kingdom of Deheubarth from inheritances in Dyfed and Seisyllwg, and then gained control of the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys in 942. With control of nearly all the territory of Wales, he codified Welsh law, a law code that survived the later fracture of his kingdom, and that became a significant step in the creation of the nation. With a common culture and an external threat, the kingdoms of Wales began to see themselves as one people.

A century later the Kingdom of Gwynedd was in ascendency, and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn subdued all opposition by 1057, becoming the only king to unite all of Wales, and parts of England on the border. &quot;Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.&quot;

The kingdom did not last, and Gruffydd met his death as a result of a surprise attack by Tostig, brother of the English King, Harold. After Gruffydd&#x27;s death, Harold married his widow, but she would be widowed again by the Norman invasion of England in 1066. 

The Normans followed their invasion of England with incursions into Wales, forming the semi-independent Norman Welsh marches (from the French for borderlands), and dividing them from the unconquered Pura Wallia. The fortunes of Welsh marcher lords and various Welsh princes ebbed and flowed, until Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great) forced all other Welsh princes to submit to him in 1216. Yet Wales was divided again after his death, and it was left for his grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd to secure the supremacy once more, recognised as Prince of Wales by the English king, Henry III in the treaty of Montgomery of 1267.

Relations with Henry&#x27;s successor, Edward I, broke down and led to a war of conquest, concluding in 1283 with English victory. The following year the statute of Rhuddlan ended Welsh independence. Wales was divided between principality, ruled by Edward, and the marches and ruled by feudal marcher lords. This persisted, despite the Welsh rebellion under Owain Glyndŵr of 1400–1415, until the rise of the Tudors, with Welsh support. With the Laws in Wales Acts of Henry VIII, the Welsh became full citizens in the Kingdom of England, with parliamentary representation. The Welsh border was also formally defined and the territory reunited.
In 1707 the act of union created the Kingdom of Great Britain. The industrial revolution and the beginning of empire led to the rapid increase in mining and exploitation of Welsh natural materials – metals, coal and slate. The population of Wales expanded rapidly and Wales moved to the centre of the British economy, but the changes bred resentment, this time towards industrialists and not the English state. Meanwhile a series of religious revivals transformed the character of the nation, beginning a tradition of non-conformism. This carried over into the political sphere too. The rapid industrialisation of parts of Wales gave rise to strong and radical Welsh working class movements which led to the Merthyr Rising of 1831, the widespread support for Chartism, and the Newport Rising of 1839. Strong liberal traditions were forged and later replaced by socialism. Since 1922 Wales has voted Labour in every general election.

From the mid 19th century until 1914, Wales experienced a strengthened political culture, religious and cultural revival, renewed interest in Welsh literature, the revival of eisteddfodau. There was a thriving economy a renewed interest in Welsh language, and music, non-conformist Christianity and the emergence of strong national identity, along with the founding of many national institutions. However the period also saw the publication of a report on education that became known as the Treachery of the Blue Books. The report blamed Welsh language and non conformism for poor educational standards and led to a requirement for bilingual education. This fed the rise of the Welsh nationalist movement, expressed in the Cymru Fydd movement, which advocated for greater autonomy and recognition of Welsh identity within the United Kingdom. Calls for devolution grew over the course of a century, and in 1998 the Government of Wales Act created a devolved Welsh assembly for the first time, now renamed the Senedd or Welsh Parliament.

==Government and politics==

Wales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom. ISO 3166-2:GB formerly defined Wales as a principality, with England and Scotland defined as countries and Northern Ireland as a province. However, this definition was raised in the Welsh Assembly in 2010 and the then Counsel General for Wales, John Griffiths, stated, &#x27;Principality is a misnomer and that Wales should properly be referred to as a country.&#x27; In 2011, ISO 3166-2:GB was updated and the term &#x27;principality&#x27; was replaced with &#x27;country&#x27;. UK Government toponymic guidelines state that, &#x27;though there is a Prince of Wales, this role is deemed to be titular rather than exerting executive authority, and therefore Wales is described as a country rather than a principality.&#x27;

In the House of Commons – the 650-member lower house of the UK Parliament – there are 32 members of Parliament (MPs) who represent Welsh constituencies. At the 2024 general election, 27 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, along with 4 Plaid Cymru MPs and 1 Liberal Democrat MP from Wales. The Wales Office is a department of the UK government responsible for Wales, whose minister, the Secretary of State for Wales (Welsh secretary), sits in the UK cabinet.

Wales has a devolved, unicameral legislature known as the Senedd (Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament) which holds devolved powers from the UK Parliament via a reserved powers model.

For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These &quot;principal areas&quot; are responsible for the provision of all local government services.

=== Devolved Government ===
Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created a Welsh devolved assembly, the National Assembly for Wales, with the power to determine how Wales&#x27;s central government budget is spent and administered. Eight years later, the Government of Wales Act 2006 reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act also created a system of government with a separate executive, the Welsh Government, drawn from and accountable to the legislature, the National Assembly. Following a successful referendum in 2011, the National Assembly was empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without requiring the UK Parliament&#x27;s approval of legislative competence. It also gained powers to raise taxes. In May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed &quot;Senedd Cymru&quot; or &quot;the Welsh Parliament&quot;, commonly known as the Senedd in both English and Welsh.

Devolved areas of responsibility include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. The Welsh Government also promotes Welsh interests abroad.

===Law===
By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The &#x27;law of Hywel Dda&#x27; (), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim&#x27;s kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. Other than in the Marches, where March law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536.

English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court. The three divisions are the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice, and the Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by magistrates&#x27; courts or the County Court. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales.

The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of Senedd Cymru in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation.

Wales is served by four regional police forces: Dyfed-Powys Police, Gwent Police, North Wales Police, and South Wales Police. There are five prisons in Wales: four in the southern half of the country, and one in Wrexham. Wales has no women&#x27;s prisons: female inmates are imprisoned in England.

==Geography and natural history== 


Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain. It is about north to south. The oft-quoted &quot;size of Wales&quot; is about . Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George&#x27;s Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. Wales has about of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey, in the north-west.

Much of Wales&#x27;s diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia (), of which five are over . The highest of these is Snowdon (), at . The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Carnedd Gwenllianoften discounted because of its low topographic prominenceover high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy, at , in the south of Snowdonia. The Brecon Beacons () are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan, at ), and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon, at ).
Wales has three national parks: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons, and Pembrokeshire Coast (). It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley, the Gower Peninsula, the Llŷn Peninsula, and the Wye Valley. The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches, three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. The south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies/south-westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the &quot;Royal Charter&quot; off Anglesey in which 459 people died. The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the &quot;Sea Empress&quot; oil spill in 1996.

The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. Offa&#x27;s Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. The Act of Union 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.

===Geology===

The earliest geological period of the Palaeozoic era, the Cambrian, takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

===Climate===

Wales lies within the north temperate zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. 
* Highest maximum temperature: at Hawarden, Flintshire on 18 July 2022.
* Lowest minimum temperature: at Rhayader, Radnorshire (now Powys) on 21 January 1940.
* Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort, Pembrokeshire in July 1955.
* Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962.
* Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC – 0900 UTC): at Rhondda, Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929.
* Wettest spot – an average of rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom).

===Flora and fauna===
Wales&#x27;s wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel. Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors. Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. The pine marten, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. In March 2021, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six beavers in the Dyfi Valley, the first official beaver release in Wales.

Believed to be home to some of Wales&#x27;s rarest land invertebrates, some 2,500 disused coal tips are the subject of study by the Welsh Government; the tips are home to a wide variety of other wildlife.

The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. Freshwater fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, while the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country&#x27;s marine fish. The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily – &quot;Gagea serotina&quot; – and other alpine species such as &quot;Saxifraga cespitosa&quot;, &quot;Saxifraga oppositifolia&quot; and &quot;Silene acaulis&quot;. Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose &quot;Tuberaria guttata&quot; on Anglesey and &quot;Draba aizoides&quot; on the Gower.

==Economy==

Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy. In the 1950s, Wales&#x27;s GDP was twice as big as Ireland&#x27;s; by the 2020s, Ireland&#x27;s economy was four times that of Wales. Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data, gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales was £75 billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017. GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was £23,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017. This compares to Italy&#x27;s GDP/capita of £25,000, Spain £22,000, Slovenia £20,000 and New Zealand £30,000. In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed, compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. For the 2018–19 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales&#x27;s estimated GDP.

In 2019, Wales was a net exporter of electricity. It produced 27.9 TWh of electricity while only consuming 14.7 TWh. In 2021, the Welsh government said that more than half the country&#x27;s energy needs were being met by renewable sources, 2 per cent of which was from 363 hydropower projects.

By UK law, Wales contributes to items that do not directly benefit Wales e.g. over £5 billion for HS2 &quot;which will damage the Welsh economy by £200m pa&quot;, according to the UK and Welsh Government&#x27;s transport adviser Mark Barry. Wales also pays more in military costs than most similar-sized countries e.g. Wales pays twice the amount Ireland spends on the military. The UK government spends £1.75bn per year on the military in Wales, which is almost as much as Wales spends on education every year (£1.8 billion in 2018/19) and five times as much as the total amount spent on the police in Wales (£365 million).

From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was the dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the South Wales coalfield, mining 56 million tons of coal. Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. In the 1920s, over 40 per cent of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry. According to Phil Williams, the Great Depression &quot;devastated Wales&quot;, north and south, because of its &quot;overwhelming dependence on coal and steel&quot;. From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. Much of the new industry was essentially of a &quot;branch (or &quot;screwdriver&quot;) factory&quot; type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly-paid jobs in the company are elsewhere.

Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing, so livestock farming has been the focus of farming. About 78 per cent of the land surface is used for agriculture. The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches, attracts large numbers of tourists, who bolster the economy of rural areas. Wales, like Northern Ireland, has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of &quot;economic mass&quot; (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK: in 2002 it stood at 90 per cent of the EU25 average and around 80 per cent of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation to be awarded Fairtrade status.

The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century: the last bank to do so closed in 1908. Since then the Bank of England has had a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. The Commercial Bank of Wales, established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. The Royal Mint, which issues the coinage circulating through the whole of the UK, has been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. Since decimalisation, in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008.

During 2020, and well into 2021, the restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic affected all sectors of the economy and &quot;tourism and hospitality suffered notable losses from the pandemic&quot; across the UK. As of 6 April 2021, visitors from &quot;red list&quot; countries were still not allowed to enter unless they were UK residents. Restrictions will &quot;likely be in place until the summer&quot;, one report predicted, with June being the most likely time for tourism from other countries to begin a rebound. On 12 April 2021, many tourist facilities were still closed in Wales but non-essential travel between Wales and England was finally permitted. Wales also allowed non-essential retail stores to open. 

== Transport ==
===Main roads===
*The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government.
*The A55 expressway has a similar role along the North Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester.
*The main north-south Wales link is the A470, which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno.

===Rail===
 Rail transport in Wales includes the Wales &amp; Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by Transport for Wales Rail. The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of Chester and Hereford and towns of Shrewsbury, Gobowen for Oswestry and along the Welsh Marches Line, with trains on the Heart of Wales Line from Swansea to Llandovery, Llandrindod and Knighton, connecting with the Welsh Marches line at Craven Arms. Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification, although the programme has experienced significant delays and cost overruns. A North-South railway has been suggested to better link North and South Wales.

===Air and ferries===
Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about southwest of Cardiff city centre, in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways; as of 2022, those flights are no longer available. Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard. The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012.

==Education==
 A distinct education system has developed in Wales. Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon and Cowbridge. One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones, who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country&#x27;s population to read. In the early 19th century, English became the usual language of instruction at schools in Wales. While the country&#x27;s working class was largely Welsh-speaking at the time, Welsh public opinion wished for children to learn English. Many schools used corporal punishment to stop children from speaking Welsh in the first half of the 19th century; the practice declined in the second half of the century. The British government never prohibited the use of Welsh at schools but it treated English as the assumed language of instruction. More Welsh was gradually used at schools in Welsh-speaking areas in the mid to late 19th century and teaching of the language began to receive moderate government support from the late 19th century.

The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales. The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales&#x27;s state schools for pupils aged 5–16 years old. While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh-language National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2021–2022, there were 1,470 maintained schools in Wales. In 2021–22, the country had 471,131 pupils taught by 25,210 full-time equivalent teachers.

==Healthcare==
Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales (), through seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts. It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946, but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services. Historically, Wales was served by smaller &#x27;cottage&#x27; hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales&#x27;s biggest employer. The National Survey for Wales in 2021–22 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health. The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were smokers, 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight.

==Demography==
===Population history===

The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, including Italians, who migrated to South Wales. Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh.

The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change. The resident population of Wales in 2021 according to the census was 3,107,500 (1,586,600 female and 1,521,000 male), an increase of 1.4 per cent over 2011. A decreased change from the 5 per cent increase between 2001 and 2011. Wales accounted for 5.2 per cent of the population of England and Wales in 2021. Wales has seven cities: Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, Wrexham, Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids. (The last two of these have city status in the United Kingdom despite their small populations.) Wrexham, north Wales&#x27;s largest settlement, became Wales&#x27;s newest and seventh city in September 2022.

===Language===

Welsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd. The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to a low of 18.9 per cent in 1981. The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century. In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991). Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011. However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7 per cent of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census.

According to the 2021 census, the Welsh-speaking population of Wales aged three or older was 17.8 per cent (538,300 people) and nearly three-quarters of the population in Wales said they had no Welsh language skills. Other estimates suggest that 29.7 per cent (899,500) of people aged three or older in Wales could speak Welsh in June 2022.

English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. &quot;Wenglish&quot; is the Welsh dialect of the English language. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs.

Since Poland joined the European Union, Wales has seen a significant increase in Polish immigrants. This has made Polish the most common main language in Wales after English and Welsh, at 0.7 per cent of the population.

===Religion===
Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now Wales for more than 1,400 years.
The 2021 census recorded that 46.5 per cent had &quot;No religion&quot;, more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011. The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census. The patron saint of Wales is Saint David (), with Saint David&#x27;s Day () celebrated annually on 1 March. The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity.

The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. It is a province of the Anglican Communion, and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth. The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic, with an estimated 43,000 adherents.

Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs, mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion. Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

=== Ethnicity ===
The 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as &quot;White&quot;, compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011. 90.6 per cent of the population identified as &quot;White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British&quot; in 2021. The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was &quot;Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British&quot; at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011. 1.6 per cent of the population identified as &quot;Mixed or multiple ethnic groups&quot;, compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as &quot;Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African&quot;, compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as &quot;Other ethnic group&quot; compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011. The local authorities with the highest proportions of &quot;high-level&quot; ethnic groups other than &quot;White&quot; were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011.

In 2021, the first statue of a named, non-fictional woman outdoors was raised for Wales&#x27;s first black headteacher, Betty Campbell. In 2023, Patti Flynn (a contemporary of Shirley Bassey, both of Tiger Bay, Cardiff) became the first black Welsh woman to be awarded a purple plaque.

In 2024, Vaughan Gething was elected First Minister of Wales becoming the first black head of government in Europe having previously served as Secretary for Finance.

=== National identity ===

The 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as &quot;Welsh only&quot; and 8.1 per cent identified as &quot;Welsh and British&quot;, giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh. The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001. A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree.

==Culture==

Wales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music. There are four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales: The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal; the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape; and The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales.

===Mythology===

Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the &quot;cynfeirdd&quot; (the early poets). Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts: the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c. 1400). The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Poems such as &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot; and the &quot;Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain&quot;, also contain mythological material. These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post-Roman Britain. Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation &quot;Historia Britonum&quot; (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th-century Latin chronicle (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as &quot;The Welsh Fairy Book&quot; by W. Jenkyn Thomas.

===Literature===

Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions. Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived through the era of the Poets of the Princes (–1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (–1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. The period produced one of Wales&#x27;s greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym. After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.

Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh. From the 16th century the proliferation of the &#x27;free-metre&#x27; verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. Initially excluded, religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic.

Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest&#x27;s translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose works of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of &quot;Rhys Lewis&quot; by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from the verbose Victorian Welsh style, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones&#x27;s &quot;Ymadawiad Arthur&quot;. The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.

The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas, Vernon Watkins, and Dylan Thomas, whose most famous work &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Llŷn Peninsula in 1936. In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913–2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century. He &quot;did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English&quot;. Major writers in the second half of the 20th century include Emyr Humphreys (1919–2020), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, and Raymond Williams (1921–1988).

===Museums and libraries===

Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales. It operates at seven sites: National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, Big Pit National Coal Museum, National Wool Museum, National Slate Museum, National Roman Legion Museum, and the National Waterfront Museum. Entry to all sites is free. The National Library of Wales, based in Aberystwyth, houses important collections of printed works, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection, as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera and Ordnance Survey maps.

===Visual arts===
Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles. A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels. The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David&#x27;s, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence.

Some Welsh artists of the 16th–18th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714–1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist; although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival.

An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists, and its artists&#x27; colony helped to form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France.

Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones, and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle in Swansea, centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and the poet and artist Vernon Watkins, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.

South Wales had several notable potteries, one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend, which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available, more refined ceramics were produced: this was led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764–1870, also known as &quot;Swansea pottery&quot;), and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1820 making fine porcelain, and then utilitarian pottery from 1833 until 1920. Portmeirion Pottery, founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis (daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis, creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion, Gwynedd) is based in Stoke-on-Trent, England.

===National symbols and identity===
Wales is regarded as a modern Celtic nation which contributes to its national identity, with Welsh artists regularly appearing at Celtic festivals. The red dragon is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation. The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the Historia Brittonum. Vortigern (), King of the Celtic Britons, is interrupted while attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys. He is told by Ambrosius to dig up two dragons beneath the castle. He discovers a red dragon representing the Celtic Britons, and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons. Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea.

As an emblem, the red dragon of Wales has been used since the reign of Cadwaladr, King of Gwynedd from around 655 AD, and appears prominently on the national flag of Wales, which became an official flag in 1959. The banner of Owain Glyndŵr is associated with Welsh nationhood; it was carried into battle by Welsh forces during Glyndŵr&#x27;s battles against the English, and includes four lions on red and gold. The standard is similar to the arms of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn the Last), the last Prince of Wales before the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England. The design may also be influenced by the arms of Glyndŵr&#x27;s parents, both of whom had lions in their arms. Owain Glyndŵr Day is celebrated on 16 September in Wales and there have been calls to make it a national bank holiday. The Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers is also used in Wales: it consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet, and the German motto &quot;Ich dien&quot; (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army, including the Royal Welsh, use the badge or a stylised version of it.

On 1 March, Welsh people celebrate Saint David&#x27;s Day, commemorating the death of the country&#x27;s patron saint in 589. It is not a recognised bank holiday although there have been calls to make it so. The day is celebrated by schools and cultural societies across Wales, and customs include the wearing of a leek or a daffodil, which are two national emblems of Wales. Children also wear the national costume. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leeks, , and that for daffodils, or St. Peter&#x27;s leeks. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. Other Welsh festivals include Mabsant when parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church, although this is now rarely observed, and a more modern celebration, Dydd Santes Dwynwen (St Dwynwen&#x27;s Day), observed on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine&#x27;s Day.

&quot;&quot; () is the &quot;de facto&quot;, national anthem of Wales and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team, as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. &quot;&quot; (&quot;Wales forever&quot;) is a popular Welsh motto. Another Welsh motto &quot;Y Ddraig Goch Ddyry Cychwyn&quot; (&quot;the red dragon inspires action&quot;) has been used on the Royal Badge of Wales when it was created in 1953.

===Sport===

More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games, the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final.

Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in North Wales, rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, hosting the tournament in 1999. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets. The Welsh regional teams play in the United Rugby Championship, the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify and the European Rugby Challenge Cup, again dependent on qualification. Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910.

Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League, since 1992. For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system: Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town. The country has produced a considerable number of footballers who have played at international level. At UEFA Euro 2016, the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals.

In international cricket, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply &#x27;England&#x27;. Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. Wales has produced notable participants of individual sports including snooker, track and field, cycling, and boxing.

===Media===

Wales became the UK&#x27;s first digital television nation in 2010. BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English. It has also produced programmes such as &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot; for BBC&#x27;s network audience across the United Kingdom. ITV, the UK&#x27;s main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-orientated service branded ITV Cymru Wales. S4C began broadcasting in 1982. Its output was mostly in Welsh at peak hours, but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC&#x27;s Welsh-language radio service, which broadcasts throughout Wales. A number of independent radio stations broadcast in the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006, several regional radio stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranged from two two-minute news bulletins each weekday (Radio Maldwyn) to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly (Swansea Sound) to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion.

Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The &quot;Western Mail&quot; is Wales&#x27;s only print national daily newspaper. Wales-based regional daily newspapers include the &quot;Daily Post&quot; (which covers North Wales), the &quot;South Wales Evening Post&quot; (Swansea), the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; (Cardiff), and the &quot;South Wales Argus&quot; (Newport). &quot;Y Cymro&quot; is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. &quot;Wales on Sunday&quot; is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper that covers the whole of Wales. The Books Council of Wales is the Welsh-Government-funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature in Welsh and English. The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. Around 650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. Wales&#x27;s main publishing houses include Gomer Press, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, Honno, the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa. Journals with a Welsh focus include &quot;Cambria&quot; (a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English), &quot;Planet,&quot; and &quot;Poetry Wales&quot;. Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles &quot;Golwg&quot; (&quot;View&quot;), published weekly, and &quot;Barn&quot; (&quot;Opinion&quot;), published monthly. &quot;Y Wawr&quot; (&quot;The Dawn&quot;) is published quarterly by &quot;Merched y Wawr&quot;, the national organisation for women. &quot;Y Traethodydd&quot; (&quot;The Essayist&quot;), a quarterly publication by the Presbyterian Church of Wales, first appeared in 1845 and is the oldest Welsh publication still in print.

===Cuisine===
Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from &quot;Porphyra umbilicalis&quot;, an edible seaweed), bara brith (fruit bread), cawl (a lamb stew), cawl cennin (leek soup), and Welsh cakes. Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India, China and the United States. Chicken tikka masala is the country&#x27;s favourite dish, while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as takeaways.

===Performing arts===

====Music and festivals====
Wales, &quot;the land of song&quot;, is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists. The annual &quot;National Eisteddfod&quot; is the country&#x27;s main performance festival. The &quot;Llangollen International Eisteddfod&quot; provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society publishes collections of historical songs and tunes. Traditional instruments of Wales include the &quot;telyn deires&quot; (triple harp), fiddle, &quot;crwth&quot; (bowed lyre) and the &quot;pibgorn&quot; (hornpipe). Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. Welsh congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country. Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs.

The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers in both the classical and pop arenas, as well as some popular bands. The Welsh folk music scene has enjoyed a resurgence in the 21st century.

====Drama====

The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays, &quot;Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen&quot; (&quot;The three Kings from Cologne&quot;) and &quot;Y Dioddefaint a&#x27;r Atgyfodiad&quot; (&quot;The Passion and the Resurrection&quot;). A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude, a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. After the Second World War, the substantial number of amateur theatre companies reduced by two-thirds. Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, were establishing international reputations. Wales has also produced some well-known comedians.

==== Dance ====
Traditional dances include Welsh folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890–1974). Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Hywel Wood (1882–1967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s. The National Dance Company Wales, formed in 1983, is now resident at the Wales Millennium Centre.

<text>Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys (&quot;key values&quot;). It was first described by W. W. Peterson in 1957. Interpolation search resembles the method by which people search a telephone directory for a name (the key value by which the book&#x27;s entries are ordered): in each step the algorithm calculates where in the remaining search space the sought item might be, based on the key values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key, usually via a linear interpolation. The key value actually found at this estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought. If it is not equal, then depending on the comparison, the remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. This method will only work if calculations on the size of differences between key values are sensible.


By comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search space, discarding one half or the other, depending on the comparison between the key found at the estimated position and the key sought — it does not require numerical values for the keys, just a total order on them. The remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. The linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from the start, ignoring any sorting.

On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(&quot;n&quot;)) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(&quot;n&quot;) comparisons.

In interpolation-sequential search, interpolation is used to find an item near the one being searched for, then linear search is used to find the exact item.

==Performance==

Using big-O notation, the performance of the interpolation algorithm on a data set of size &quot;n&quot; is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;); however under the assumption of a uniform distribution of the data on the linear scale used for interpolation, the performance can be shown to be &quot;O&quot;(log log &quot;n&quot;).

Dynamic interpolation search extends the &quot;o&quot;(log log &quot;n&quot;) bound to other distributions and also supports &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) insertion and deletion.

Practical performance of interpolation search depends on whether the reduced number of probes is outweighed by the more complicated calculations needed for each probe. It can be useful for locating a record in a large sorted file on disk, where each probe involves a disk seek and is much slower than the interpolation arithmetic.

Index structures like B-trees also reduce the number of disk accesses, and are more often used to index on-disk data in part because they can index many types of data and can be updated online. Still, interpolation search may be useful when one is forced to search certain sorted but unindexed on-disk datasets.

==Adaptation to different datasets==

When sort keys for a dataset are uniformly distributed numbers, linear interpolation is straightforward to implement and will find an index very near the sought value.

On the other hand, for a phone book sorted by name, the straightforward approach to interpolation search does not apply. The same high-level principles can still apply, though: one can estimate a name&#x27;s position in the phone book using the relative frequencies of letters in names and use that as a probe location.

Some interpolation search implementations may not work as expected when a run of equal key values exists. The simplest implementation of interpolation search won&#x27;t necessarily select the first (or last) element of such a run.

==Book-based searching==
The conversion of names in a telephone book to some sort of number clearly will not provide numbers having a uniform distribution (except via immense effort such as sorting the names and calling them name #1, name #2, etc.) and further, it is well known that some names are much more common than others (Smith, Jones,) Similarly with dictionaries, where there are many more words starting with some letters than others. Some publishers go to the effort of preparing marginal annotations or even cutting into the side of the pages to show markers for each letter so that at a glance a segmented interpolation can be performed.

==Sample implementation==

The following C++ code example is a simple implementation. At each stage it computes a probe position then as with the binary search, moves either the upper or lower bound in to define a smaller interval containing the sought value. Unlike the binary search which guarantees a halving of the interval&#x27;s size with each stage, a misled interpolation may reduce/i-case efficiency of O(&quot;n&quot;).
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
arr[low, high) is sorted, search the data &quot;key&quot; in this array,
if &quot;key&quot; is found, return the corresponding index (NOT necessarily the highest possible index);
if &quot;key&quot; is not found, just return low - 1

How to verify that the algorithm is correct?
Proof:
(finiteness: after one loop, the width of [low, high] decreases strictly )

Fist, high &lt;--- high - 1
scenario 1. when low = high
scenario 2. when low &lt; high, arr[low] = arr[high]
scenario 3. when low &lt; high, arr[low] &lt; arr[high], key &lt; arr[low] or key &gt; arr[high]
scenario 4. when low &lt; high, arr[low] &lt; arr[high], arr[low] &lt;= key &lt;= arr[high]

Now let&#x27;s analyze scenario 4:
Once entering the &quot;while&quot; loop, low &lt;= middle &lt;= high
 let&#x27;s analyse after one loop(if we don&#x27;t return), whether &quot;low &gt; high&quot; will occur
 After one loop:
 case a1: &quot;low&quot; branch has been executed in this loop
 arr[middle] &lt; key &lt;= arr[high]
 so we have middle &lt; high
 so after this loop, we have
 low &lt;= high
 case a2: &quot;high&quot; branch has been executed in this loop
 arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[middle]
 so we have low &lt; middle
 so after this loop, we have
 low &lt;= high

 so after one loop(if we don&#x27;t return), we have &quot;low &lt;= high&quot;
 when we exit the &quot;while&quot; loop:
 case b1: arr[low] &gt;= arr[high]
 In the last loop, if &quot;low&quot; branch is executed, we know
 arr[low - 1] &lt; k &lt;= arr[high]
 arr[low] &gt;= arr[high]
 low &lt;= high
 so we have 
 arr[low - 1] &lt; k &lt;= arr[low] = arr[high]
 In the last loop, if &quot;high&quot; branch is executed, we know
 arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high + 1]
 arr[low] &gt;= arr[high]
 low &lt;= high
 so we have
 arr[low] = arr[high] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high + 1]

 case b2: (arr[low] &lt; arr[high]) &amp;&amp; (arr[low] &gt; key):
 In the last loop, &quot;low&quot; must have been changed
 so we have
 arr[low - 1] &lt; key
 so we have 
 arr[low - 1] &lt; key &lt; arr[low]

 case b3: (arr[low] &lt; arr[high]) &amp;&amp; (key &gt; arr[high])
 In the last loop, &quot;high&quot; must have been changed
 so we have
 key &lt; arr[high + 1]
 so we have
 arr[low] &lt; arr[high] &lt; key &lt; arr[high + 1]
template &lt;typename T&gt;
static Rank interpolation_search_v001(T* arr, const T&amp; key, Rank low, Rank high)
 high -= 1;
 int middle;
 int initial_low = low;

 while ((arr[low] &lt; arr[high]) &amp;&amp; (arr[low] &lt;= key) &amp;&amp; (key &lt;= arr[high])) {
 middle = low + ((key - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low]);

 assert((low &lt;= middle) &amp;&amp; (middle &lt;= high));

 if (arr[middle] &lt; key)
 low = middle + 1;
 else if (key &lt; arr[middle])
 high = middle - 1;
 else
 return middle;

 if (key == arr[low])
 return low;
 else
 return initial_low - 1;

search &quot;key&quot; in the sorted array arr[low, high),
return: the highest index i such that arr[i] &lt;= key

How to verify that the algorithm is correct?
Proof:
finiteness: after one loop, the width of [low, high] decreases strictly 

Fist, high &lt;---- high - 1
scenario 1. when low = high
scenario 2. when low &lt; high, key &lt; arr[low] or arr[high] &lt;= key
scenario 3. when low &lt; high, arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high]

Now let&#x27;s analyze scenario 3:
Once entering the &quot;while&quot; loop, low &lt;= middle &lt; high

when we exit the &quot;while&quot; loop:
 case a1: key &lt; arr[low]
 so &quot;low&quot; is changed in the last loop, we know
 arr[low - 1] &lt;= key &lt; arr[low]
 case a2: arr[high] &lt;= key
 so &quot;high&quot; is changed in the last loop, we know
 key &lt; arr[high], impossible

conclusion: we should return &quot;low - 1&quot;
template &lt;typename T&gt; 
static Rank interpolation_search_v002(T* arr, const T&amp; key, Rank low, Rank high) {
 high -= 1;
 assert(low &lt;= high);
 Rank middle;

 if(key &lt; arr[low]) {
 return low - 1;
 if(arr[high] &lt;= key) {
 return high;

 // now low &lt; high , arr[low] &lt;= key &lt; arr[high]
 while ((arr[low] &lt;= key) &amp;&amp; (key &lt; arr[high])) {
 middle = low + ((high - low) * (key - arr[low])) / (arr[high] - arr[low]);

 assert((low &lt;= middle) &amp;&amp; (middle &lt; high));

 if(key &lt; arr[middle]) {
 high = middle;
 } else {
 low = middle + 1;
 }

 return low - 1;

Notice that having probed the list at index &quot;mid&quot;, for reasons of loop control administration, this code sets either &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; to be not &quot;mid&quot; but an adjacent index, which location is then probed during the next iteration. Since an adjacent entry&#x27;s value will not be much different, the interpolation calculation is not much improved by this one step adjustment, at the cost of an additional reference to distant memory such as disk.

Each iteration of the above code requires between five and six comparisons (the extra is due to the repetitions needed to distinguish the three states of &lt; &gt; and = via binary comparisons in the absence of a three-way comparison) plus some messy arithmetic, while the binary search algorithm can be written with one comparison per iteration and uses only trivial integer arithmetic. It would thereby search an array of a million elements with no more than twenty comparisons (involving accesses to slow memory where the array elements are stored); to beat that, the interpolation search, as written above, would be allowed no more than three iterations.

<doc id="69898" wikidata="Q193270" url="?curid=69898" title="Lateran Treaty">
<text>The Lateran Treaty (; ) was one component of the Lateran Pacts of 1929, agreements between Fascist Italy under Victor Emmanuel III and Benito Mussolini and the Holy See under Pope Pius XI to settle the long-standing Roman question. The treaty and associated pacts were named after the Lateran Palace where they were signed on 11 February 1929, and the Italian Parliament ratified them on 7 June 1929. The treaty recognised Vatican City as an independent state under the sovereignty of the Holy See. Fascist Italy also agreed to give the Catholic Church financial compensation for the loss of the Papal States. In 1948, the Lateran Treaty was recognized in the Constitution of Italy as regulating the relations between the Italian Republic and the Catholic Church. The treaty was significantly revised in 1984, ending the status of Catholicism as the sole state religion, however the Vatican still remains as a independent nation to the present day.

==Content==
The Lateran Pacts are often presented as three treaties: a 27-article treaty of conciliation, a three-article financial convention, and a 45-article concordat; however, the website of the Holy See presents the financial convention as an annex of the treaty of conciliation, considering the pacts as two documents:
* A political treaty recognising the full sovereignty of the Holy See in the State of Vatican City, which was thereby established, accompanied by four annexes:
** A map of the territory of Vatican City State
** Maps of buildings with extraterritorial privilege and exemption from expropriation and taxes (owned by the Holy See but located in Italy and not forming part of Vatican City)
** Maps of buildings with exemption from expropriation and taxes (but without extraterritorial privilege)
** A financial convention agreed on as a definitive settlement of the claims of the Holy See following the capture of Rome in 1870 of its territories and property
* A concordat regulating relations between the Catholic Church and the Italian state.

The treaty defines only part of the public funding of the Catholic Church in Italy.

==History==

During the unification of Italy in the mid-19th century, the Papal States under Pope Pius IX resisted incorporation into the new nation, even as almost all the other Italian countries joined it; Camillo Cavour&#x27;s dream of proclaiming the Kingdom of Italy from the steps of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica did not come to pass. The nascent Kingdom of Italy invaded and occupied Romagna (the eastern portion of the Papal States) in 1860, leaving only Lazio (&quot;Latium&quot;) in the pope&#x27;s domains. Latium, including Rome itself, was occupied and annexed in 1870. For the following sixty years, relations between the Papacy and the Italian government were hostile, and the sovereign rights of the pope became known as the Roman question.

Under the terms of the Law of Guarantees of 1871, the Italian government offered to Pius IX and his successors the use of, but not sovereignty over, the Vatican and Lateran Palaces and a yearly income of 3,250,000 Lire. The Holy See refused this settlement, on the grounds that the pope&#x27;s spiritual jurisdiction required clear independence from any political power, and thereafter each pope considered himself a &quot;prisoner in the Vatican&quot;. The Lateran Treaty ended this impasse.

Negotiations for the settlement of the Roman question began in 1926 between the Holy See and the Italian fascist government led by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, and culminated in the agreements of the Lateran Pacts, signed—the Treaty says—for King Victor Emmanuel III by Mussolini and for Pope Pius XI by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri, on 11 February 1929. It was ratified on 7 June 1929.

The agreements included a political treaty which created the state of the Vatican City and guaranteed full and independent sovereignty to the Holy See. The Pope was pledged to perpetual neutrality in international relations and to abstention from mediation in a controversy unless specifically requested by all parties. In the first article of the treaty, Italy reaffirmed the principle established in the 1848 Constitution of the Kingdom of Italy, that &quot;the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Religion is the only religion of the State&quot;. The attached financial agreement was accepted as settlement of all the claims of the Holy See against Italy from the loss of temporal power over the Papal States in 1870, though the sum agreed to was actually less than Italy had offered in 1871. To commemorate the successful conclusion of the negotiations, Mussolini commissioned the &quot;Via della Conciliazione&quot; (&quot;Road of the Conciliation&quot;), which would symbolically link the Vatican City to the heart of Rome.

=== After 1946 ===
The post-World War II Constitution of the Italian Republic, adopted in 1948, states that relations between the State and the Catholic Church &quot;are regulated by the Lateran Treaties&quot;. In 1984, the concordat was significantly revised. Both sides declared: &quot;The principle of the Catholic religion as the sole religion of the Italian State, originally referred to by the Lateran Pacts, shall be considered to be no longer in force.&quot; The exclusive state financial support for the Church was also ended, and replaced by financing through a dedicated personal income tax called the &quot;otto per mille&quot;, to which other religious groups, Christian and non-Christian, also have access. , there were ten other religious groups with access.

The revised concordat regulated the conditions under which the state accords legal recognition to church marriages and to ecclesiastical declarations of nullity of marriages. The agreement also ended state recognition of knighthoods and titles of nobility conferred by the Holy See, the right of the state to request ecclesiastical honours for those chosen to perform religious functions for the state or the royal household, and the right of the state to present political objections to the proposed appointment of diocesan bishops. In 2008, it was announced that the Vatican would no longer immediately adopt all Italian laws, citing conflict over right-to-life issues following the trial and ruling of the Eluana Englaro case.

==Violations==
The Italian racial laws of 1938 prohibited marriages between Jews and non-Jews, including Catholics: the Vatican viewed this as a violation of the Concordat, which gave the church the sole right to regulate marriages involving Catholics. Furthermore, Article 34 of the Concordat had also specified that marriages performed by the Catholic Church would always be considered valid by civil authorities; the Holy See understood this to apply to all marriages in Italy celebrated by Roman Catholic clergy, regardless of the faiths of those being married.

<doc id="69899" wikidata="Q1208358" url="?curid=69899" title="Eastern League (1938–present)">
<text>The Eastern League (EL) is a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) sports league that has operated under that name since 1938, with the exception of the 2021 season, during which the league operated under the moniker Double-A Northeast. The league has played at the Double-A level since 1963, and consists primarily of teams located in the Northeastern United States.

==History==
The league was founded in 1923 as the New York–Pennsylvania League. The first team outside the two original states was created in 1936 when the York White Roses of York, Pennsylvania, moved to Trenton, New Jersey, and were renamed the Trenton Senators. The league was renamed as the Eastern League in 1938 when the Scranton Miners of Scranton, Pennsylvania, moved to Hartford, Connecticut, and became the Hartford Bees. 

The league has had teams in a total of 52 different cities, located in 12 different states and two Canadian provinces. The league consisted of six to eight teams from 1923 until 1993. The league expanded to 10 teams in 1994 with the addition of the Portland Sea Dogs and the New Haven Ravens and split into two divisions, the Northern Division and the Southern Division. The league expanded to 12 teams in 1999 with the addition of the Altoona Curve and the Erie SeaWolves. The two divisions were restructured and renamed for the 2010 season as the Eastern Division and the Western Division because the Connecticut Defenders moved to Richmond, Virginia, after the 2009 season, becoming the Richmond Flying Squirrels.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled.

As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the league was temporarily renamed the &quot;Double-A Northeast&quot;; the Somerset Patriots, formerly an independent team, joined the league, while the Trenton Thunder were relegated to the newly-formed MLB Draft League. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Double-A Northeast was renamed the Eastern League effective with the 2022 season.

League champions have been determined by different means since the Eastern League&#x27;s formation in 1923. Before 1934, the champions were simply the league pennant winners. A formal playoff system to determine league champions was established in 1934.

The Binghamton Triplets have won 10 championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Elmira Colonels/Pioneers/Royals (8) and the Scranton Miners/Red Sox (7). Among active franchises, the Akron Aeros/RubberDucks and Harrisburg Senators have each won 6 championships, the most in the league, followed by the Reading Fightin Phils (4).

<text>The Southern League is a Minor League Baseball league that has operated in the Southern United States since 1964. Along with the Eastern League and Texas League, it is one of three circuits playing at the Double-A level, which is two grades below Major League Baseball (MLB). 

The league traces its roots to the original Southern League (1885–1899), the Southern Association (1901–1961), and the original South Atlantic League (1904–1963). The later circuit dissolved and refounded itself as the Southern League in 1964, maintaining a new set of records. Following MLB&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues in 2021, it operated as the Double-A South for one season before switching back to its previous moniker in 2022. In its inaugural 1964 season, the Southern League consisted of eight teams from Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Following contractions, expansions, and relocations, the league consists of eight teams in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.

A league champion is determined at the end of each season. The Birmingham Barons have won 8 Southern League titles, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Jacksonville Suns (6) and the Montgomery Rebels (5).

==History==

===Predecessor leagues (1885–1963)===

The original Southern League was formed prior to the 1885 season as an eight-team circuit playing in the Southern United States. It operated at various times as a Class B league. Fraught with financial problems, teams regularly dropped out before the season&#x27;s end. After being nonoperational in 1891, 1892, and 1897, it disbanded permanently after halting play during the 1899 season.

The Southern Association was formed in 1901 as a Class B circuit operating in nearly the same footprint as the first Southern League. It was elevated to Class A in 1902, Class A1 in 1936, and Double-A in 1946. The Southern Association remained a premier Southern baseball league until Major League Baseball radio and television broadcasts began to undercut attendance in the 1950s. The league disbanded after 1961.

The original South Atlantic League, nicknamed the &quot;SALLY League&quot; and not related to the current South Atlantic League (formerly the Western Carolinas League), was formed in 1904. It operated at Class C until it was elevated to Class B in 1921 and Class A in 1946. A year after the Southern Association&#x27;s disbandment, the SALLY League took its place at the Double-A level in 1963.

===The modern league (1964–present)===

The Double-A SALLY League dissolved after the 1963 season and refounded itself as the Southern League. It elected to start with a clean slate and not maintain records prior to the 1964 season. The newly minted league wanted to distance itself from the SALLY League&#x27;s past history in the low minors (Class C was roughly equivalent to an Advanced Rookie league in the pre-2021 classification system, while Class B was roughly equivalent to short-season Class A). Additionally, many leagues had contributed to its legacy. In its inaugural campaign, the six-team Southern League consisted of the Asheville Tourists, Birmingham Barons, Charlotte Hornets, Chattanooga Lookouts, Columbus Confederate Yankees, Knoxville Smokies, Lynchburg White Sox, and Macon Peaches. Sam C. Smith, previously president of the SALLY League, served as its president. 

From 1967 to 1969, the league was reduced to six teams. It went back to eight clubs in 1970, but dropped to seven in 1971. With an odd number of teams, the Southern League joined forces with the Double-A Texas League as the Dixie Association in 1971. The two leagues played an interlocking schedule with individual league champions determined at the end of the season. Up to this point, the Southern League champions had been simply the regular season pennant winners. For the first time, the top two Southern League teams met in a best-of-three series to determine champions. The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Asheville Tourists, 2–1, and then defeated the Texas League champion Arkansas Travelers, 3–0, to win the Dixie Association championship. The partnership was dissolved after the season.

President Smith died suddenly in April 1971, and Billy Hitchcock became the new president that August. Hitchcock introduced a number of changes that are still in use today. In 1972, the Southern League was split into two divisions, Eastern and Western. The playoffs, which began in the Dixie Association, were continued and expanded to a best-of-five series. The league also began selecting postseason All-Star teams and issuing awards for the Most Valuable Player, Most Outstanding Pitcher, and Manager of the Year. In 1976, it introduced a split-season format with the schedule divided in half and first and second half champions from each division being crowned. This expanded the playoffs to two rounds with the winners of each half competing for each division&#x27;s championship and those winners meeting for the league championship. With the addition of two teams in 1978, the Southern League grew to 10 teams. Other improvements under Hitchcock&#x27;s presidency included stadium refurbishments and efforts to make the league more family-friendly. Attendance figures rose dramatically during his tenure.

Jim Bragan became president in 1981 after Hitchcock&#x27;s retirement. Over his 14 years leading the Southern League, attendance continued to grow as several cities built new ballparks. In 1994, Arnie Fielkow succeeded Bragan as president, and Don Mincher took over in 2000. Lori Webb became president in 2012 after Mincher&#x27;s death that March.

===COVID-19 impact and takeover by Major League Baseball (2020–present)===
The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Southern League was reduced to eight teams and temporarily renamed the &quot;Double-A South&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the historical names of the minor leagues, the Double-A South was renamed the Southern League effective with the 2022 season.

==Structure and season==
The Southern League is currently divided into two divisions, North and South, of four teams each. Previously, from 1972 to 2004, the league was split into Eastern and Western divisions. There were no divisions in place from 1964 to 1970. As of 2020, each club had 140 games scheduled per season. Utilizing a split-season schedule, each half consisted of 70 games. The season typically began during the first or second week of April and concluded in the first week of September on Labor Day.

=== Players ===
The Southern League uses a salary cap. As of the 2025 season, clubs are required to spend a maximum of US$1,360,000 on player compensation, with a minimum salary of $30,250 per player. For players aged 23 and younger on standard contracts, only 50% of their salary counts towards the cap (up to $200,000 total). There is also a separate salary cap for coaches and technical staff. Rosters are limited to a size of 28 players on Opening Day weekend, although up to 9 players can be signed on the roster before the transactions date limit.

===All-Star Game===
The Southern League All-Star Game was an annual midsummer game between two teams of the league&#x27;s players, one made up of All-Stars from North Division teams and the other from South Division teams. First held in 1964, the event predominantly consisted of a single team of the league&#x27;s All-Stars versus a Major League Baseball team through 1998. The division versus division format was used continuously from 1999 to 2019. No game was held from 1991 to 1995 as the Southern League and the other two Double-A leagues, the Eastern League and Texas League, participated in the Double-A All-Star Game instead.

==Champions==
League champions have been determined by different means since the Southern League&#x27;s formation in 1964. Through 1970, champions were the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular season. The 1971 title was decided in a postseason series between the two teams with the best records. From 1972 to 1975, the winners of each of two divisions competed in a series to determine champions. The league operated using a split season format from 1976 to 2020. Under this format, the winners of each half within each division played for the division championship, and the division winners met to play for the SL title. The 2021 winner was crowned via a series between the two teams with the best full-season records. The 2022 championship will be decided through the same split-season divisional format used for most of the league&#x27;s existence.

The Birmingham Barons have won 8 Southern League championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Jacksonville Suns (6) and the Montgomery Rebels (5).

==Awards==
The SL recognizes outstanding players and team personnel annually near the end of each season.

===MVP Award===

The Most Valuable Player Award is given to honor the best player in the league.

===Pitcher of the Year Award===

The Pitcher of the Year Award, originally known as the Most Outstanding Pitcher Award, serves to recognize the league&#x27;s best pitcher.

===Manager of the Year Award===

The Manager of the Year Award is given to the league&#x27;s top manager.

===Top MLB Prospect Award===
The Top MLB Prospect Award, created in 2021, is given to the league&#x27;s top rookie prospect.

==Presidents==
Six presidents led the Southern League since its formation:
* 1964–1971: Sam C. Smith
* 1971–1980: Billy Hitchcock
* 1981–1994: Jim Bragan
* 1994–2000: Arnie Fielkow

<text>Extreme weather includes unexpected, unusual, severe, or unseasonal weather; weather at the extremes of the historical distribution—the range that has been seen in the past. Extreme events are based on a location&#x27;s recorded weather history. They are defined as lying in the most unusual ten percent (10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function). The main types of extreme weather include heat waves, cold waves and heavy precipitation or storm events, such as tropical cyclones. The effects of extreme weather events are economic costs, human casualties, droughts, floods, landslides. Severe weather is a particular type of extreme weather which poses risks to life and property.

Weather patterns can experience some variation, and so extreme weather can be attributed, at least in part, to the natural climate variability that exists on Earth. For example, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are climate phenomena that impact weather patterns worldwide. Generally speaking, one event in extreme weather cannot be attributed to any one single cause. However, certain system wide changes to global weather systems can lead to increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events. 

Climate change is making some extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. This applies in particular to heat waves and cold waves. The science of extreme event attribution looks at the reasons behind extreme events. Scientists are fairly sure that climate change makes heavy rainfall events as well as drought periods more severe. Climate models indicate that rising temperatures will make extreme weather events worse worldwide. 

Extreme weather has serious impacts on human society and on ecosystems. There is loss of human lives, damage to infrastructure and ecosystem destruction. For example, a global insurer Munich Re estimates that natural disasters cause more than 90 billion dollars in global direct losses in 2015. Some human activities can exacerbate the effects, for example poor urban planning, wetland destruction, and building homes along floodplains.

== Definition ==

Extreme weather describes unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given area. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as follows: &quot;An event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of &#x27;rare&#x27; vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.&quot; 

In comparison, the term &quot;severe weather&quot; is any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life, property or requires the intervention of authorities. Severe weather is thus a particular type of extreme weather.

== Types ==
Definitions of extreme weather vary in different parts of the community, changing the outcomes of research from those fields. 

===Heat waves===


Heat waves are periods of abnormally high temperatures and heat index. Definitions of a heatwave vary because of the variation of temperatures in different geographic locations. Excessive heat is often accompanied by high levels of humidity, but can also be catastrophically dry.

Because heat waves are not visible as other forms of severe weather, like hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, they are one of the less known forms of extreme weather. Severely hot weather can damage populations and crops due to potential dehydration or hyperthermia, heat cramps, heat expansion, and heat stroke. Dried soils are more susceptible to erosion, decreasing lands available for agriculture. Outbreaks of wildfires can increase in frequency as dry vegetation has an increased likelihood of igniting. The evaporation of bodies of water can be devastating to marine populations, decreasing the size of the habitats available as well as the amount of nutrition present within the waters. Livestock and other animal populations may decline as well.

During excessive heat, plants shut their leaf pores (stomata), a protective mechanism to conserve water but also curtails plants&#x27; absorption capabilities. This leaves more pollution and ozone in the air, which leads to higher mortality in the population. It has been estimated that extra pollution during the hot summer of 2006 in the UK, cost 460 lives. The European heat waves from summer 2003 are estimated to have caused 30,000 excess deaths, due to heat stress and air pollution. Over 200 U.S cities have registered new record high temperatures. The worst heat wave in the US occurred in 1936 and killed more than 5000 people directly. The worst heat wave in Australia occurred in 1938–39 and killed 438. The second worst was in 1896.

Power outages can also occur within areas experiencing heat waves due to the increased demand for electricity (i.e. air conditioning use). The urban heat island effect can increase temperatures, particularly overnight.

===Cold waves===


A cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection for agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year. Cold waves generally are capable of occurring at any geological location and are formed by large cool air masses that accumulate over certain regions, caused by movements of air streams.

A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach necessary food and water, and die of hypothermia or starvation. Cold waves often necessitate the purchase of fodder for livestock at a considerable cost to farmers. Human populations can be inflicted with frostbite when exposed for extended periods of time to cold and may result in the loss of limbs or damage to internal organs.

Extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipes to freeze. Even some poorly protected indoor plumbing may rupture as frozen water expands within them, causing property damage. Fires, paradoxically, become more hazardous during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making firefighting more difficult.

Cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth. This results in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically. Such cold waves have caused famines. Cold waves can also cause soil particles to harden and freeze, making it harder for plants and vegetation to grow within these areas. One extreme was the so-called Year Without a Summer of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions reduced incoming sunlight.

In some cases more frequent extremely cold winter weather – i.e. across parts of Asia and North America including the February 2021 North American cold wave – can be a result of climate change such as due to changes in the Arctic. However, conclusions that link climate change to cold waves are considered to still be controversial. The JRC PESETA IV project concluded in 2020 that overall climate change will result in a decline in the intensity and frequency of extreme cold spells, with milder winters reducing fatalities from extreme cold, even if individual cold extreme weather may sometimes be caused by changes due to climate change and possibly even become more frequent in some regions.
According to a 2023 study, &quot;weak extreme cold events (ECEs) significantly decrease in frequency, projection area and total area over the north hemisphere with global warming. However, the frequency, projection area and total area of strong ECEs show no significant trend, whereas they are increasing in Siberia and Canada.&quot;

== Causes and attribution ==
=== Attribution research ===
Generally speaking, one event in extreme weather cannot be attributed to any one cause. However, certain system wide changes to global weather systems can lead to increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.

Early research in extreme weather focused on statements about predicting certain events. Contemporary research focuses more on the attribution of causes to trends in events. In particular the field is focusing on climate change alongside other causal factors for these events.

A 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, recommended investing in improved shared practices across the field working on attribution research, improving the connection between research outcomes and weather forecasting.

As more research is done in this area, scientists have begun to investigate the connection between climate change and extreme weather events and what future impacts may arise. Much of this work is done through climate modeling. Climate models provide important predictions about the future characteristics of the atmosphere, oceans, and Earth using data collected in the modern day. However, while climate models are vital for studying more complex processes such as climate change or ocean acidification, they are still only approximations. Moreover, weather events are complex and cannot be tied to a singular cause—there are often many atmospheric variables such as temperature, pressure, or moisture to note on top of any influences from climate change or natural variability.

=== Natural variability ===
Aspects of our climate system have a certain level of natural variability, and extreme weather events can occur for several reasons beyond human impact, including changes in pressure or the movement of air. Areas along the coast or located in tropical regions are more likely to experience storms with heavy precipitation than temperate regions, although such events can occur. 

The atmosphere is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by several factors such as the natural tilt and orbit of the Earth, the absorption or reflection of solar radiation, the movement of air masses, and the water cycle. Due to this, weather patterns can experience some variation, and so extreme weather can be attributed, at least in part, to the natural climate variability that exists on Earth. 

Climatic phenomena such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) impact weather patterns in specific regions of the world, influencing temperature and precipitation. The record-breaking extreme weather events that have been catalogued throughout the past two hundred years most likely arise when climate patterns like ENSO or NAO work &quot;in the same direction as human‐induced warming.&quot;

=== Climate change===
Some studies assert a connection between rapidly warming arctic temperatures and thus a vanishing cryosphere to extreme weather in mid-latitudes. In a study published in Nature in 2019, scientists used several simulations to determine that the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could affect overall sea level and sea temperature. Other models have shown that modern temperature rise and the subsequent addition of meltwater to the ocean could lead to a disruption of the thermohaline circulation, which is responsible for the movement of seawater and distribution of heat around the globe. A collapse of this circulation in the northern hemisphere could lead to an increase in extreme temperatures in Europe, as well as more frequent storms by throwing off natural climate variability and conditions. Thus, as increasing temperatures cause glaciers to melt, mid-latitudes could experience shifts in weather patterns or temperatures.

There were around 6,681 climate-related events reported during 2000-2019, compared to 3,656 climate-related events reported during 1980–1999. In this report, a &#x27;climate-related event&#x27; refers to floods, storms, droughts, landslides, extreme temperatures (like heat waves or freezes), and wildfires; it excludes geophysical events such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or mass movements. While there is evidence that a changing global climate, such as an increase in temperature, has impacted the frequency of extreme weather events, the most significant effects are likely to arise in the future. This is where climate models are useful, for they can provide simulations of how the atmosphere may behave over time and what steps need to be taken in the present day to mitigate any negative changes.

The increasing probability of record week-long heat extremes occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level.

Some researchers attribute increases in extreme weather occurrences to more reliable reporting systems. A difference in what qualifies as &#x27;extreme weather&#x27; in varying climate systems could also be argued. Over or under reporting of casualties or losses can lead to inaccuracy in the impact of extreme weather. However, the UN reports show that, although some countries have experienced greater effects, there have been increases in extreme weather events on all continents. Current evidence and climate models show that an increasing global temperature will intensify extreme weather events around the globe, thereby amplifying human loss, damages and economic costs, and ecosystem destruction.

====Tropical cyclones and climate change====

In 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. government predicted that, over the 21st Century, the frequency of tropical storms and Atlantic hurricanes would decline by 25 percent while their maximum intensity would rise by 5 percent.

=== Human activities that exacerbate the effects ===
There are plenty of anthropogenic activities that can exacerbate the effects of extreme weather events. Urban planning often amplifies urban flooding impacts, especially in areas that are at increased risk of storms due to their location and climate variability. First, increasing the amount of impervious surfaces, such as sidewalks, roads, and roofs, means that less of the water from incoming storms is absorbed by the land. The destruction of wetlands, which act as a natural reservoir by absorbing water, can intensify the impact of floods and extreme precipitation. This can happen both inland and at the coast. However, wetland destruction along the coast can mean decreasing an area&#x27;s natural &#x27;cushion,&#x27; thus allowing storm surges and flood waters to reach farther inland during hurricanes or cyclones. Building homes below sea level or along a floodplain puts residents at increased risk of destruction or injury in an extreme precipitation event.

More urban areas can also contribute to the rise of extreme or unusual weather events. Tall structures can alter the way that wind moves throughout an urban area, pushing warmer air upwards and inducing convection, creating thunderstorms. With these thunderstorms comes increased precipitation, which, because of the large amounts of impervious surfaces in cities, can have devastating impacts. Impervious surfaces also absorb energy from the sun and warm the atmosphere, causing drastic increases in temperatures in urban areas. This, along with pollution and heat released from cars and other anthropogenic sources, contributes to urban heat islands.

== Effects ==
The effects of extreme weather includes, but are not limited to:
* Too much rain (heavy downpours), causing floods and landslides
* Too much heat and no rain (heatwave) causing droughts and wildfires
* Strong winds, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, causing damage to man made structures and animal habitats
* Large snowfalls, causing avalanches and blizzards

=== Economic cost ===
In the face of record breaking extreme weather events, climate change adaptation efforts fall short while economists are confronted with inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, and economic uncertainty. In 2011 the IPCC estimated, that annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few billion to above US$200 billion, with the highest economic losses occurring in 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina. The global weather-related disaster losses, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize, and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses.

The World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey 2023-2024 (GRPS) found that 66 percent of respondents selected extreme weather as top risk. The survey was conducted after the 2023 heat waves. According to the GRPS results, the perception of necessary short and long-term risk management varies. Younger respondents prioritize environmental risks, including extreme weather, in the short-term. Respondents working in the private sector prioritize environmental risks as long-term.

=== Loss of human lives ===
The death toll from natural disasters has declined over 90 percent since the 1920s, according to the International Disaster Database, even as the total human population on Earth quadrupled, and temperatures rose 1.3 °C. In the 1920s, 5.4 million people died from natural disasters while in the 2010s, just 400,000 did.

The most dramatic and rapid declines in deaths from extreme weather events have taken place in south Asia. Where a tropical cyclone in 1991 in Bangladesh killed 135,000 people, and a 1970 cyclone killed 300,000, the similarly-sized Cyclone Ampham, which struck India and Bangladesh in 2020, killed just 120 people in total.

On July 23, 2020, Munich Re announced that the 2,900 total global deaths from natural disasters for the first half of 2020 were a record-low, and &quot;much lower than the average figures for both the last 30 years and the last 10 years.&quot;

A 2021 study found that 9.4% of global deaths between 2000 and 2019 – ~5 million annually – can be attributed to extreme temperature with cold-related ones making up the larger share and decreasing and heat-related ones making up ~0.91% and increasing.

=== Droughts and floods===
Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and/or intensity of certain types of extreme weather. Storms such as hurricanes or tropical cyclones may experience greater rainfall, causing major flooding events or landslides by saturating soil. This is because warmer air is able to &#x27;hold&#x27; more moisture due to the water molecules having increased kinetic energy, and precipitation occurs at a greater rate because more molecules have the critical speed needed to fall as rain drops. A shift in rainfall patterns can lead to greater amounts of precipitation in one area while another experiences much hotter, drier conditions, which can lead to drought. This is because an increase in temperatures also lead to an increase in evaporation at the surface of the earth, so more precipitation does not necessarily mean universally wetter conditions or a worldwide increase in drinking water.

<text>The &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class was a class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines in service with the Royal Navy from the early 1970s until 2010.

Six boats were built and commissioned. &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was decommissioned in 1992 due to damage suffered to her pressure hull during trials. followed in 2004 after defence cuts caused a reduction in the size of the Royal Navy submarine fleet. was decommissioned in January 2006, with following on 12 September 2006. was decommissioned on 26 September 2008. The remaining boat in the class, , was decommissioned in December 2010. The six boats of the class were not replaced, although the seven boats of the successor &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class submarines are in the process of being replaced by seven boats of the &quot;Astute&quot;-class submarines.

A few were upgraded with the capability to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles in addition to their original armaments of torpedoes, mines and anti-ship missiles. They were also the first class of Royal Navy submarines to be built with shrouded pump-jet propulsors.

==Design history==
The , and classes all had a &quot;whale-shaped hull&quot;, of &quot;near-perfect streamlining giving maximum underwater efficiency&quot;. The hulls were of British design, &quot;based on the pioneering work of the US Navy in and .&quot; The hull of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class was a different shape and maintained its diameter for a much greater length than previous classes. Compared with the &quot;Valiant&quot;s the &quot;Swiftsure&quot;s were &quot;shorter with a fuller form, with the fore-planes set further forward, with one less torpedo tube and with a deeper diving depth.&quot;

A second major change was in propulsion. Rather than the seven/nine-bladed propeller used by the previous classes, all but the first of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot;-class submarines used a shrouded pump-jet propulsor. The prototype propulsor had powered . It is not clear why was the only one of the class not fitted with a propulsor. The propulsor was perhaps as much as 50% more efficient than a propeller, producing the same speed at lower revolutions, thus reducing the noise signature. In addition all pipework connections to equipment on the main machinery raft had expansion/flexible coupling connections, which also reduced noise. The US Navy secured a licence to copy the main shaft flexible coupling arrangement in US-built submarines.

==Construction programme==
==Operational history==

===Combat history===

Both &quot;Splendid&quot; and &quot;Spartan&quot; were ordered to sail south for the Falkland Islands two days before the Argentine invasion of the islands on 30 March 1982. &quot;Spartan&quot; was the first boat to arrive in the islands and began to enforce a maritime exclusion zone imposed by the British. Shortly after, &quot;Spartan&quot; sighted Argentine merchant shipping mining the harbour at Stanley, but was not ordered to attack. This was partly due to British concerns about escalating the war too early, but also to avoid scaring off more valuable targets such as the Argentine aircraft carrier . Unlike , neither &quot;Spartan&quot; nor &quot;Splendid&quot; during the Falklands War, but they did provide valuable reconnaissance to the British Task Force on Argentine aircraft movements and the submarines&#x27; presence effectively restricted the freedom of action of the Argentine Navy which spent most of the war confined to port.

In the late 1990s, &quot;Splendid&quot; became the first British vessel to be armed with American-built Tomahawk cruise missiles. In 1999 the BBC was allowed on board the boat to record her firing Tomahawks in battle against Yugoslav targets in Belgrade during the Kosovo War, becoming the first British submarine in the conflict to do so. She again fired these weapons against Iraqi targets in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Incidents===
In the early 1980s &quot;Sceptre&quot; collided with a Soviet submarine and her reactor&#x27;s protection systems would have performed an automatic emergency shutdown (scrammed the reactor), but her captain ordered the safety mechanisms overridden (battleshort enabled). The crew were told to say that they had hit an iceberg. This incident was disclosed when David Forghan, &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s former weapons officer, gave a television interview which was broadcast on 19 September 1991. The Soviet submarine involved was probably &quot;K-211 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky&quot; of the Delta III class, which on 23 May 1981 collided with an unknown submarine, identified at the time as an unknown American .

&quot;Sovereign&quot; underwent an extensive refit in the mid-1990s and was rededicated in January 1997. Cracks were discovered in the tailshaft during post-refit sea trials and she was sent to Rosyth for 14 weeks of emergency repairs in June 1998 before returning to Faslane.

On 6 March 2000 &quot;Sceptre&quot; suffered a serious accident while inside a drydock at the Rosyth yards while undergoing trials towards the end of a major refit. The test involved flooding the drydock, and running the main engines slowly with steam supplied from the shore. However, too much steam was used and the engines over-sped. &quot;Sceptre&quot; broke her moorings and moved forward off the cradle she rested on. The steam line ruptured, scaffolding buckled, a crane was pushed forward some , and the submarine moved forward some inside the dock.

On 26 May 2008, &quot;Superb&quot; hit an underwater pinnacle in the Red Sea, south of the Suez Canal. She remained watertight, and none of the 112 crew were injured; however, she was unable to resubmerge due to damage to her sonar. After undertaking initial repairs at the Souda Bay NATO base on Crete on 10 June 2008, she passed through the Mediterranean, with a pause (at night) some miles off Gibraltar to disembark some less critical crew. &quot;Superb&quot; then continued back to the UK, arriving at HMNB Devonport on 28 June 2008. After surveying the damage, the Royal Navy decided to decommission &quot;Superb&quot; slightly ahead of schedule on 26 September 2008.

==In fiction==
HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; acts as a &quot;nom de guerre&quot; for the &quot;Red October&quot; in Tom Clancy&#x27;s eponymous novel, as she enters the Norfolk Naval Station.

<text>Mithril is a fictional metal found in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings. It is described as resembling silver, but being stronger and lighter than steel. It was used to make armour, such as the helmets of the citadel guard of Minas Tirith, and &quot;ithildin&quot; alloy, used to decorate gateways with writing visible only by starlight or moonlight. Always extremely valuable, by the end of the Third Age it was beyond price, and only a few artefacts made of it remained in use.

Impenetrable armour occurs in Norse mythology in &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, a story that Tolkien certainly knew and could have used for his mithril mail-coat. Mithril is the only invented mineral in his Middle-earth writings. Chemists note mithril&#x27;s remarkable properties, strong and light like titanium, perhaps when made into alloys with elements such as titanium or nickel, and in its pure form malleable like gold.

The scholar Charles A. Huttar states that Tolkien treats mineral treasures as having the potential for both good and evil, recalling the association of mining and metalwork in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; with Satan. The scholar Paul Kocher interprets the Dwarves&#x27; intense secrecy around mithril as an expression of sexual frustration, given that they have very few dwarf-women.

The metal appears in many derivative fantasy works by later authors.

== Tolkien ==

=== Etymology ===

The name &quot;mithril&quot; comes from two words in Tolkien&#x27;s Sindarin language—&quot;mith&quot;, meaning &quot;grey&quot;, and &quot;ril&quot;, meaning &quot;glitter&quot;. The Dwarves kept their own name for the material secret.

=== Properties ===

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Thorin Oakenshield described some Dwarven treasures as &quot;coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable&quot; and &quot;a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel.&quot; A little later the narrator describes &quot;a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long ago. It was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril&quot;.

In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the wizard Gandalf explained mithril to the rest of the Fellowship in Moria:

The Noldor of Eregion, the Elvish land to the west of Moria, made an alloy from it called &quot;ithildin&quot; (&quot;star moon&quot;), used to decorate gateways, portals and pathways. It was visible only by starlight or moonlight. The West Gate of Moria bore inlaid &quot;ithildin&quot; designs and runes.

=== Abundance ===

In Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, mithril is extremely rare by the end of the Third Age, as it was now found only in Khazad-dûm. Once the Balrog destroyed Khazad-dûm, the kingdom of the Dwarves in Moria, the only source of new mithril ore was cut off. Before Moria was abandoned by the Dwarves, while it was still being actively mined, mithril was worth ten times its weight in gold. After the Dwarves abandoned Moria and production of new mithril stopped entirely, it became priceless.

Tolkien hints that mithril was found in the lost island kingdom of Númenor and the inaccessible continent of Aman.

=== The mithril-coat ===

The principal item made of mithril in the works of Tolkien is the &quot;small coat of mail&quot; that Thorin Oakenshield gave to Bilbo Baggins after it had been retrieved from the hoard of Smaug the dragon. Gandalf stated that the value of this mithril-coat was &quot;greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in it&quot;. The mail-shirt was first described in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1937, but without any mention of mithril. Tolkien first described the shirt as being made of mithril in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in 1954, and it was retrospectively mentioned in the third, revised edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1966. In the first 1937 edition, the mail shirt given to Bilbo Baggins is described as being made of &quot;silvered steel&quot;.

Bilbo wore the mithril shirt during the Battle of the Five Armies. He donated it to the Mathom-house, a museum in Michel Delving. However he later reclaimed it, and took it with him when he left the Shire for his journey to Rivendell. There, some years later, he gave the shirt to Frodo Baggins when the younger hobbit embarked on his quest in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Frodo wore the mail underneath his tunic and other shirt unbeknownst to the rest of the fellowship. The mail saved Frodo&#x27;s life when he was struck by an orc chieftain&#x27;s spear thrust during the battle in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and again when orc-arrows struck him while escaping Moria and while crossing the River Anduin.

When Sam Gamgee believed Frodo to be dead outside Shelob&#x27;s Lair, he left the shirt with Frodo. Frodo was taken by the orcs, who fought over the shirt. Frodo was saved, but one of the orcs escaped with the shirt. In both Tolkien&#x27;s and Peter Jackson&#x27;s versions, the shirt was, along with Frodo&#x27;s other possessions, shown to Frodo&#x27;s allies at the Battle of the Morannon to imply falsely that he was imprisoned in Barad-dûr. Gandalf took the shirt and other tokens, but refused any offer of parley.

At the end of the story, Frodo wore the shirt at the celebrations and on the trip home. The shirt saved his life one last time when Saruman, who had taken over the Shire, tried to stab Frodo after Frodo spared his life. When he left to sail to Elvenhome, he gave all his possessions to Sam.

=== Other objects ===

Nenya, the Ring of Power wielded by Galadriel, was made of mithril.

The guards of the citadel of Minas Tirith wore helmets of mithril, &quot;heirlooms from the glory of old days&quot;. They were the only soldiers in Gondor who still bore the emblems of the lost kings during the days of the stewards.

As Aragorn&#x27;s ships sailed up the Anduin to relieve the besieged Minas Tirith during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the standard flying on his ship showed a crown made of mithril and gold.

After Gimli became lord of Aglarond, he and his Dwarves forged great gates of mithril and steel to replace the gates of Minas Tirith, which had been broken by the Witch-king of Angmar.

The &quot;Elendilmir&quot;, the Star of Arnor, was a &quot;white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril&quot;. It was made for Silmariën, mother of Valandil; it passed down to Elendil. It was found in Orthanc when the Ents returned the tower to King Aragorn, evidence that Saruman had found and apparently destroyed Isildur&#x27;s remains.

Greatest of all, according to legend, was the ship of Eärendil, Vingilótë, which he sailed into the sky, making the gleam of &quot;truesilver&quot; visible to the world as the Evening and Morning Star. The &quot;Song of Eärendil&quot;, written by Bilbo and Aragorn, contains the lines &quot;A ship then new they built for him / of mithril and of elven-glass&quot;. The linguist of Elvish languages Anthony Appleyard wrote that this machine, with &quot;no shaven oar nor sail&quot;, was evidently of an advanced technology, &quot;sound[ing] suspiciously like most people&#x27;s image of a spaceship.&quot;

== Analysis ==

=== Origins ===

Norse culture contains myths of impenetrable armour, such as the shirt made by elves and used in battle by Örvar-Oddr (Ørvar Odd), as related in the &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;. The saga was translated by Christopher Tolkien, with a commentary, and his father was certainly familiar with the text.

The mining executive Danièle Barberis notes that Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in a busy mining region. She writes that it is &quot;impossible ... not to make parallels&quot; between Tolkien&#x27;s descriptions of the deep mines of Moria and the exceptional depth of South African mines, some as much as deep.

=== Metallurgy ===

The chemist Suze Kundu describes mithril as a metal, a pure chemical element with &quot;a range of amazing chemical and physical properties&quot; not matched by any real metal, and many applications. Of those that approach it, titanium is light (has a low density) and strong, but it is not malleable (able to be beaten into shape) like mithril. In Kundu&#x27;s view the nearest material would be a stainless steel alloy of iron with enough nano-scale carbon to make it hard.

The metallurgist James Owen suggests that Mithril could be &quot;an fcc [face-centred cubic] metal like aluminium or nickel, or possibly a bcc [body-centred cubic]&quot; metal like titanium&quot;. Owen comments that it could form &quot;strong, stiff, tough alloys&quot; with those elements, suitable for &quot;light sword blades and armour&quot;, or used as the pure element, when &quot;it would be soft and malleable&quot; like copper or gold. The geologist William Sarjeant, however, notes that mithril crystallises out &quot;at so high a temperature that it is only found in veins at great depths&quot;, and proposes that it may be a native alloy of platinum with another metal, which might be palladium.

=== Significance ===

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that &quot;mithril&quot; was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien&#x27;s underworld, whether the caves at Helm&#x27;s Deep or the mines of Moria, &quot;beauty and terror [were] side by side&quot;. Greed for &quot;mithril&quot; could unleash the terror of the Balrog, by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves&#x27; greed for &quot;mithril&quot; with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the dragons in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot; for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil &quot;inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth&quot;, just as mining and metalwork are associated with Satan in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (I, 670–751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien&#x27;s moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: &quot;Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane.&quot;

The Tolkien critic Paul Kocher interprets the Dwarves&#x27; intense secrecy around mithril and their devotion to artistry in metal and stone as &quot;a sublimation of their sexual frustration&quot;, given that they have very few dwarf-women and love beauty with a &quot;jealous possessiveness&quot;, or (quoting Tolkien) &quot;being engrossed in their crafts&quot;.

The name &quot;mithril&quot; (also spelt &quot;mith&quot;, &quot;mithral&quot;, or &quot;mythril&quot;) is used in multiple fictional contexts influenced by Tolkien. For example, the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game series, begun in 1987, involves dwarves and mithril.
