<text>Gilchrist County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state of Florida. Organized in 1925 from the western part of Alachua, it is the last county to be formed in the state. As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,864. The county seat is Trenton.

Gilchrist County is included in the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Gilchrist County was created in 1925, the last county organized in Florida. It was originally set to be named Melon County due to watermelons being one of the main exports from the area; however, the death of Albert W. Gilchrist, Governor of Florida from 1909 to 1913, prompted its renaming to Gilchrist County instead.

It was formed by residents of what was then western Alachua County, as they believed they were not getting adequate representation on the county commission. With the poor roads of the time, they felt it took too long to get to the county seat of Gainesville. They disagreed about a proposed law that would require fencing in cattle in the rural area. They also believed that they would be better off by getting their own share of racetrack revenues, which the state distributed by county.

Much of the county was farmland and timberland when formed, and it is largely rural. Several natural springs are adjacent to the Santa Fe River, including Ginnie Springs, Hart Springs, and Gilchrist Blue Springs, the last of which became a Florida state park in 2017.

<text>Glades County is a county located in the Florida Heartland region of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,126, making it the fourth-least populous county in Florida. Its county seat is Moore Haven. Glades County is in the Clewiston micropolitan area, a Micropolitan statistical area (μSA) which also includes Hendry County. These two counties, along with the Cape Coral-Fort Myers (Lee County) MSA and the Naples-Marco Island (Collier County) MSA, constitute the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

== Awards ==
* Gov. Jeb Bush acknowledged Muse winning the Florida&#x27;s Outstanding Rural Community of the Year 2002 award after &quot;providing a safe community shelter to be used during storms.&quot;
* Senior Ranger Danny Callahan, of the Florida Forest Service presented Jimmy Cianfrani and the Muse Community with a &quot;10 Year Firewise Service Award&quot; for &quot;its diligence and commitment to the National Firewise Communities USA program. From the smallest project of cleaning the debris off their roofs to the largest undertaking of clearing flammable vegetation 30 feet away from their houses, the Muse Community’s dedication to reducing wildfire risk is commendable.&quot;

==History==
Indigenous people lived in this area for thousands of years. Due to warfare and exposure to infectious diseases after European contact, native tribes became depopulated. In the eighteenth century, when the area was under Spanish rule, Native American peoples of Creek and other tribes migrated into present-day Florida from Georgia. Africans and African Americans who escaped from slavery and shipwrecks also migrated to the area, where they created maroon communities. Some were given freedom by the Spanish in exchange for serving with their militias. Gradually the Seminole nation formed out of these multi-ethnic people. Some African-descended people set up communities near the Seminole and became known as Black Seminole. In the nineteenth century, most of the Seminole and many blacks were removed to Indian Territory after the Seminole Wars, a result of pressure from increasing Anglo-American settlement.

Glades County was created, in 1921, from Desoto County. It was named for the Florida Everglades, though most of the county is prairie and pinelands.

It is one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail.

Glades County sponsors one of Florida&#x27;s oldest recurring festivals. &quot;Chalo Nitka&quot; Festival is a celebration of local history and culture, similar to a county fair. The festival also draws attention to the long and friendly relationship between the local Seminole groups and Glades County settlers. Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation is located in the county.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (18.3%) is water.

Fisheating Creek is a stream that flows into Lake Okeechobee in Florida. It is the only remaining free-flowing watercourse feeding into the lake and the second-largest natural source for the lake.

Glades was added to the Clewiston micropolitan area (μSA) in July 2023.

<text>Oscoda ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Iosco County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The CDP had a population of 916 at the 2020 census. The community is located within Au Sable Township and Oscoda Township at the mouth of the Au Sable River along Lake Huron.

==History==

The area was first settled as early as 1867 when the firm of Smith, Kelley, &amp; Dwight purchased land here and platted the community. A post office under the name Au Sable served the area until the Oscoda post office was established on July 1, 1875. The name Oscoda is believed to come from Henry Schoolcraft, who used a shortened form of ossin and muscoda, which means a pebbly prairie.

The Lumberman&#x27;s Monument is located nearby and was dedicated in 1932 in honor of the early lumberjacks that first populated the area. The state of Michigan designated Oscoda as the official home of Paul Bunyan due to early documented publications in the &quot;Oscoda Press&quot; on August 10, 1906, by James MacGillivray. The article was later revised and published in &quot;The Detroit News&quot; in 1910.

Wurtsmith Air Force Base was a United States Air Force commissioned in 1923 in Oscoda. During the Cold War, it was one of the state&#x27;s three Strategic Air Command bases that housed Boeing B-52 Stratofortress jets. The air base was decommissioned in 1993. The area is now an ongoing Superfund site due to extensive groundwater contamination. Parts of the defunct air base now serve as the Oscoda–Wurtsmith Airport with no future plans for the rest of the facility.

Oscoda was featured in the 2002 documentary film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, in which director Michael Moore interviewed two young residents. Eric Harris, one of the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, spent some of his early years in Oscoda while his father served in the U.S. Air Force.

==Geography==

The community is located on the northside of the Au Sable River at its river mouth at Lake Huron. The community of Au Sable is on the southside of the river, and the surrounding areas are part of the Huron National Forest. Au Sable is served by Oscoda Area Schools.

===Climate===

<text>Hardee County is a county located in the Florida Heartland of the Central Florida region in the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,327. Its county seat is Wauchula.

Hardee County comprises the Wauchula, FL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Hardee County was created by an act of April 23, 1921 in which the Florida Legislature divided &quot;old DeSoto County&quot; into five parts, forming the Counties of Hardee, DeSoto, Charlotte, Highlands and Glades.

The county is named after Cary A Hardee, the Governor of Florida who served from 1921 to 1925 and who signed the act creating the county.

The settlement of what is now Hardee County, Florida began with the establishment of the Kennedy-Darling Indian-trading post on Paynes Creek in April 1849. The enterprise came to a tragic end on July 17, 1849, when two of the clerks, George Payne and Dempsey Whidden, were killed by Indians. A third clerk, William McCullough, and his wife Nancy were also wounded, and the post was burned down.

Reports of the attack motivated the U.S. Army to establish a chain of fortifications across Florida, and construction began on Fort Chokonikla on October 26, 1849. The fort was subsequently abandoned in July 1850 due to an outbreak of sickness and never reoccupied.

During the Seminole Wars, Fort Green and Fort Hartsuff were both garrisoned in the area. Fort Hartstuff would later become the settlement and county seat of Wauchula.

The Florida Southern Railway arrived in 1886 and ushered in a new era of increased settlement for what is now Hardee County, with many new settlers finding employment working with the railroad, tending stores, farming, ranching and teaching.

At the dawn of the 20th century, the county seat Wauchula was incorporated in 1902, and the first bank was opened in 1904.

A community group of activists referred to as &quot;Divisionists&quot; first began lobbying for the creation of new counties with the area of &quot;old DeSoto County&quot; in 1907, and after a 15-year campaign, the Florida Legislature separated Desoto into five parts, creating the 638-square mile Hardee County.

On August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley went directly through Hardee County. Maximum sustained winds in downtown Wauchula were clocked at with higher gusts. Most buildings in the county sustained damage, and many were totally destroyed.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water.

Hardee County is located in a region colloquially referred to as &quot;Bone Valley.&quot; The region contains most of North America&#x27;s phosphate deposits and a large portion of the world&#x27;s accessible deposits. CommercialPhosphate mining in the region that is now the county has been ongoing since the late 19th century.

The Mosaic Company currently operates the only mines in the county with around 10,000 acres near Fort Green and 16,778 acres near Ona, FL.

There is controversy over the mining practice and the rezoning and conversion of agricultural land into open pit mines. Land is reclaimed after mining and leaves artificially-created lakes and wetlands.

Reclamation standards for phosphate lands include contouring to safe slopes, providing for acceptable water quality and quantity, revegetation, and the return of wetlands to pre-mining type, nature, function and acreage.

Opponents of mining say converting agricultural land to phosphate mining is harmful to the environment, increasing background radiation levels, harming water quality and rendering some areas poorly suited for agriculture.

Supporters of mining say it is critical to America&#x27;s food supply and economy, and that reclaimed mine land is better for the environment than agricultural land.

==Libraries==
Hardee County is part of the Heartland Library Cooperative which serves Hardee County and some of the surrounding counties, including Glades, Highlands, Okeechobee, and DeSoto. The seven-branch library system has one branch in Wauchula. Hardee County Public Library and the Heartland Library Cooperative are also members of the Tampa Bay Library Consortium.

Hardee County Public Library was established in the mid-1980s after a group of residents expressed concern that the current small local library was not enough for the growing county. In September 1984 the Board of County Commissioners adopted the Resolution 84-21 that allowed the creation of the Hardee County Public Library. Later in 1997, the Board of County Commissioners signed an inter-local agreement to become a member of the Heartland Library Cooperative. Becoming a member of the Heartland Library Cooperative allows the library more resources and materials for its members. In the summer of 2004, the library building was severely damaged by Hurricane Charley and managed to keep its doors open for a couple of years before ultimately closing in 2006 for much-needed repairs. The library reopened its doors in January 2007. The library went from 5,800 square feet in 1984 to 15,680 square feet in 2007. It circulates an average of 71,251 items per year to 27,652 residents.

In addition to traditional materials and online resources, the Hardee County Public Library contains archives from the Florida Advocate and Herald-Advocate (local newspapers) on microfilm as well as Wauchula City Directories from the 1970s-to 1980s. A library card is free for people who reside in Hardee County and other participating counties in the Heartland Library Cooperative.

<text>Hendry County is a county in the Florida Heartland region of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 39,619, a 1.2% increase from 39,140 at the 2010 census. The county is majority-Hispanic or Latino. Its county seat is LaBelle. Hendry County is in the Clewiston micropolitan area, a Micropolitan statistical area (μSA) which also includes Glades County. These two counties, along with the Cape Coral-Fort Myers (Lee County) MSA and the Naples-Marco Island (Collier County) MSA, constitute the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

==History==
Indigenous peoples migrated into Florida around 10000 B.C.E., while the Glades culture existed in southern Florida from approximately 500 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. Archaeological sites attesting to the presence of the Glades culture in modern-day Hendry County include Clewiston Mounds, Maple Mound, South Lake Mounds, and Tony&#x27;s Mound. When Europeans arrived in Florida in the 16th century, the Calusa and Mayaimi tribes resided in Southwest Florida and around Lake Okeechobee.

In the early 1800s, French trader Pierre Denaud established a trading post in the modern-day LaBelle area. During the Seminole Wars, United States troops built a fort along the Caloosahatchee River in 1838, named Fort Denaud in his honor. About three years later, Fort Thompson was established. These military posts became the first permanent settlements in modern-day Hendry County. Originally, the area now comprising Hendry County remained relatively inaccessible, as the Florida Everglades covered more than half of the county&#x27;s present-day boundaries. Further, nearly the entire area became submerged with water seasonally; thus, only cattle-grazing was a suitable industry. However, by 1881, the Atlantic and Gulf Coast and Okeechobee Land Company began draining the land after entering into a contract with the trustees of the internal improvement fund. The county&#x27;s first post office was established at Fort Thomson in 1884. The state of Florida established Lee County in 1887, which included land now part of Hendry County. Settlement in LaBelle began around 1889 or 1890, after the town was platted by Francis A. Hendry, a cattle rancher, politician, and officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, commercial fishermen began building fishing camps along Lake Okeechobee at Sand Point, later renamed Clewiston, though the city was not permanently settled until about 1920. In 1911, LaBelle became the oldest municipality in modern-day Hendry County after officially incorporating. That same year, the United States government established the Big Cypress Indian Reservation in present-day Hendry County via executive order by President William Howard Taft. By the early 1920s, residents in the eastern Lee County communities of Clewiston, Felda, Fort Denaud, and LaBelle began campaigning for the creation of a new county. Among their reasons for supporting the establishment of a new county was dissatisfaction with the distance between eastern Lee County settlements and the county seat, Fort Myers. Around that time, the &quot;Caloosahatchee Current&quot; was established to prove that the area could sustain a newspaper publication.

On May 11, 1923, just three days after neighboring Collier County was also created and partitioned from Lee County, the Florida Legislature voted to establish Hendry County, named after Francis A. Hendry. The first county commissioners were M.F. Boisclaire, M.E. Forrey, Thomas O&#x27;Brien, R.H. Magill, and L.N. Thomas. The town of LaBelle (chartered as a city in 1925) was designated as the county seat. A temporary jail was erected at a city park in LaBelle, while E.E. Goodno, who owned the Everett Hotel, allowed rooms and office space in the building to be used as a temporary courthouse.

Residents voted by a wide margin in favor of a $530,000 bond issue in November 1924, with $430,000 to be allotted towards improvement of roads and $100,000 for construction of a courthouse. The courthouse was finished in 1927, and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1990. In 1925, the only other incorporated municipality in Hendry County, Clewiston, became a city. In mid-1926, a cross-state highway (initially designated as State Road 25, but later renumbered 80) linking Fort Myers to Palm Beach was completed and passed through Hendry County. Around this time, the Gulf Atlantic Transportation, based in LaBelle, began providing transportation from Fort Myers to West Palm Beach. Another improvement to transportation occurred when the Seaboard–All Florida Railway started its rail service from LaBelle to Fort Myers in mid-1927. The 1926 Miami hurricane and 1928 Okeechobee hurricane both impacted Hendry County, though damage and loss of life was significantly less than in other areas around Lake Okeechobee.

The Number 5 British Flying Training School was operated at Riddle Field in Clewiston during World War II, with more than 1,800 Royal Air Force pilots trained there. Upon completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike in 1961, a dedication ceremony was held in Clewiston, which included a speech by former president Herbert Hoover.

<text>Hernando County () is a county located on the west central coast of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 194,515. Its county seat is Brooksville, and its largest community is Spring Hill. Hernando County is included in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of 2005, Hernando was the 35th fastest-growing county in the country.

==History==

In 1767, a group of Upper Creeks from Eufaula, Alabama, migrated to the Tampa Bay region and settled in what is now Hernando County. They would eventually become a part of the Muskogee speaking Seminole.

===Early European Pioneers and Founding===
Roughly 100 settlers and over 50 slaves arrived in what would become Hernando County in February 1842. Fort DeSoto was soon established in the northeast edge of present-day Brooksville to protect these settlers in the area from Native Americans. The fort became a small community center, trading post, and way station on the route to Tampa. Further settlements started to grow near the fort beginning around 1845; two towns developed, Melendez and Pierceville, which would later merge to create Brooksville in 1856.

Then encompassing a significantly larger area of west central Florida than it does today, Hernando County was officially established on February 27, 1843, two years prior to Florida&#x27;s admission into the Union. It was created from portions of Alachua, Hillsborough and Orange Counties and included all of present-day Citrus and Pasco Counties. Named for Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, whose name has also been honored in DeSoto County, Hernando County was briefly renamed Benton County in 1844 for Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a strong supporter of territorial expansion who aided in the county&#x27;s creation. However, Benton fell out of favor with the county&#x27;s residents later in the decade due to his decision to support the Missouri Compromise and the overall reversal of his stance on slavery, and the county&#x27;s name reverted in 1850.

In December 1854, the legislature designated the small port town of Bayport the county seat. Residents living in the eastern section of the county instead desired a more central place for the county government, and by 1855, voters had selected an inland site within of the center of the county at the town of Melendez. In 1856, the citizens of Hernando County chose to rename the town, their new County Seat, Brooksville in honor of South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks, who in the same year beat fierce abolitionist Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner with a cane in the Senate chambers, winning the Congressman great renown in the South.

In 1855, town founder Joseph Hale donated land for a county courthouse in the center of present-day Brooksville. Soon thereafter, the structure was completed.

===American Civil War===
During the Civil War, Hernando County primarily contributed foodstuffs, cotton, and lumber to the Confederacy. Although Union ships imposed a blockade on the port of Bayport, runners enjoyed a great deal of success—enough to lead the Union in June 1864 to order some 150–250 troop to destroy Confederate stockpiles in the county. In early July, the expeditions, including 2 companies from the 2nd U.S. Florida Cavalry, marched northward from Anclote River to Brooksville, meeting some resistance from assembled Confederate troops hastily organized to protect the city. The Federal troops won this engagement (known locally as the Brooksville Raid and marched to Bayport, where they and an auxiliary force landing from gunboats sacked Rebel operations. The skirmish between Union raiders and local Confederates is reenacted annually in the county.

At least one unit that fought in the Civil War was mustered in Hernando County. The Hernando County &quot;Wildcats,&quot; formed Company C of 3rd Florida Infantry Regiment. The unit was captained by Walter Terry Saxon who was reportedly well liked by his men. He was paid roughly $20,000 for work surveying the Everglades. He used most of this money to arm and equip the Wildcats.

===Reconstruction=== 
Despite many citizens&#x27;, including new immigrants, attempts at making Hernando an open and welcoming place, the county became one of the many Florida plantation counties that was a hotbed for Ku Klux Klan activity. Arthur St. Clair, a minister, was lynched in Hernando County, Florida, in 1877 for performing the wedding of a black man and white woman.

The county courthouse was destroyed by a fire on September 29, 1877. On June 2, 1887, the Florida State Legislature divided Hernando County into three independent counties: Pasco County to the south, Citrus County to the north, and Hernando County in the middle. Since then, Hernando County&#x27;s borders have remained unchanged.

===Mass transit===
Hernando THE Bus provides bus service in Brooksville and Spring Hill.

===Railroads===
CSX operates two rail lines within the county. Amtrak formerly provided passenger rail service along the old Seaboard Air Line Railroad line east of US 301 in Ridge Manor, but had no stops in the county, the nearest stops being Dade City on the segment that was originally part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, and its last train on the line, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; had its Florida service discontinued in late 2004. The other line is the Brooksville Subdivision, which runs close to US 41, and was previously also owned by the Seaboard Air Line. The last train directly serving the county, in Croom, was local Jacksonville - St. Petersburg service in 1955 or 1956 operated by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

Notable abandoned railroad lines include a former branch of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad spanning from southeast of Ridge Manor through Istachatta that became part of the Withlacoochee State Trail, and a spur of this line from Croom west into Brooksville, which was replaced by a new rail trail called the Good Neighbor Trail. Though originally the Good Neighbor Trail only existed within Brooksville itself, the extension to the Withlacoohee State Trail has existed since 2018.

===Major highways===

* is a major commercial highway running parallel to the Gulf of Mexico on the western edge of the county, and used as a primary connecting route to cities on the west coast of Florida, including Hudson, New Port Richey, Tarpon Springs, Clearwater, and St. Petersburg, as well as Homosassa and Crystal River to the north.
* runs parallel to US 19 through points in the center of the county, including downtown Brooksville, where it intersects with SR 50 and US 98. It is still a primary connecting route with Tampa. Between Brooksville and Garden Grove, US 41 is a six-lane highway, and between Garden Grove and Masaryktown it is a four-lane highway. To the northeast, US 41 runs through part of the Withlacoochee State Forest. Plans are currently under way to widen US 41 throughout Hernando County.
* runs diagonally across the county from the northwest to the southeast, where it exits into Pasco County, and runs concurrent with SR 50 in the eastern part of the county, intersects I-75 in Ridge Manor West and meets the Suncoast Parkway at the parkway&#x27;s current end near World Woods Golf Course north of Brooksville.
* is a north–south highway that crosses into the county briefly at its tapered eastern end, running parallel to I-75, and intersecting with SR 50 at Ridge Manor.
* runs north and south across the eastern part of the county, with one exit (Exit 301) at its intersection with US 98/SR 50. Once a major connecting point with Tampa, I-75 has been made obsolete for western residents of the county by the Suncoast Parkway.
* enters the county in the south slightly to the west of US 41, and ends in the far northern part of the county at US 98. The Suncoast Parkway is a toll road that connects Hernando County with Hillsborough County, where it becomes the Veterans Expressway and heads directly into Tampa International Airport before reaching Interstate 275. SR 589 has four Hernando County exits: County Line Road (Exit 37), Spring Hill Drive (Exit 41), SR 50 (Exit 46), and US 98 (Exit 55).
* (&quot;Cortez Boulevard&quot;) begins at US 19 in Weeki Wachee, runs through Brooksville, and exits into Sumter County at the eastern tip of the county. Along the way, it interchanges with the Suncoast Parkway, intersects with US 41 in Brooksville, runs concurrently with US 98, and intersects with I-75 in Ridge Manor West(Hernando County&#x27;s only interchange with I-75) and US 301 in Ridge Manor. A significant, well-developed highway in the county, SR 50 originally extended from US 19 to the Gulf Coast at Bayport. This section was given back to the county and is currently CR 550. Currently, S.R. 50 is used as a beeline route from the county to Orlando in the east.
* (&quot;Jefferson Street&quot;) is a spur of SR 50 that runs through downtown Brooksville, running concurrently with both US 41 and US 98 at points.
* (&quot;Spring Hill Drive / CR 574&quot;) is a major county road running roughly parallel to both SR 50 and the border with Pasco County beginning by US 19, intersects the Suncoast Parkway, and ends at US 41.
* (&quot;County Line Road / CR 578&quot;) is a major county road running entirely along the border with Pasco County beginning at US 19, intersects the Suncoast Parkway, and ends at US 41. Due to increased congestion, it is planned to be upgraded from two to four lanes, and possibly upgraded from a county road to a state road.

<text>Hillsborough County is located in the west-central portion of the U.S. state of Florida. In the 2020 census, the population was 1,459,762, making it the fourth-most populous county in Florida and the most populous county outside the Miami metropolitan area. A 2021 estimate has the population of Hillsborough County at 1,512,070 people with a yearly growth rate of 1.34%, which itself is greater than the populations of 12 states according to their 2019 population estimates. Its county seat and largest city is Tampa. Hillsborough County is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==


Hillsborough County was created on January 25, 1834, from Alachua and Monroe Counties, during the U.S. territorial period (1822–1845). The new county was named for Wills Hill, the Earl of Hillsborough, who served as British Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1768 to 1772. The County was created through efforts by Augustus Steele.

The county&#x27;s 1834 area was much larger and included eight other present-day counties: Charlotte County, DeSoto, Hardee, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, and Sarasota.

The last significant change in Hillsborough County&#x27;s borders was the separation of its western section to create Pinellas County in 1911.

On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1914, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line initiated the first scheduled commercial airline service in the world, from St. Petersburg to Tampa.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (19.4%) are covered by water. About of shoreline are on Tampa Bay.

The county&#x27;s unincorporated area is around , more than 84% of the total land area. Municipalities account for . The modern boundaries of the county place it midway along the west coast of Florida.

A narrow portion of Hillsborough County to the south, consisting almost exclusively of water, extends west to the Gulf of Mexico roughly along the Tampa Port Shipping Channel. This has the effect of keeping Hillsborough County from being technically landlocked. The central portion of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is in Hillsborough County. So is Egmont Key, at the entrance to Tampa Bay; this narrow strip of land separates Pinellas County from Manatee County. The northernmost tip of a spoil island just west of Port Manatee also lies in Hillsborough County.

Hillsborough is home to Alafia River State Park and Hillsborough River state parks, and to the C. W. Bill Young Regional Reservoir and Lithia Springs, one of the largest natural springs in Florida.

==Politics and government==
=== Voter registration ===
According to the Secretary of State&#x27;s office, Democrats are a plurality of registered voters in Hillsborough County.
=== Statewide and national elections ===
Hillsborough County tends to lean Democratic, having not been won by a Republican presidential candidate from 2004 until 2024. It is part of the politically important I-4 Corridor between Tampa Bay and Orlando, an area that historically decides most elections in Florida. Hillsborough was considered a bellwether county, voting for the statewide winner in every presidential election from 1964–2012. It has also voted for the winner of the presidency in every election since 1928 except twice, voting for the loser only in 1992 and 2016. The southern portion of the county, around Tampa, is powerfully Democratic, while the northern and eastern portions are heavily Republican.

On the statewide level, the county also tends to lean Democratic with Democrats Bill Nelson for senator and Andrew Gillum for governor both winning the county in the 2018 elections. However, Republican senator Marco Rubio did win the county in his 2010, 2016 and 2022 senatorial campaigns and Republican Governor Ron Desantis won it in his 2022 gubernatorial campaign after the county supported Democrats for the previous three gubernatorial elections since 2010.

In 2008, Barack Obama won the county by seven points, the first Democrat to capture the county since Bill Clinton&#x27;s re-election victory in 1996. Obama won Hillsborough again in 2012 over Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney by roughly the same margin.

In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 to win a presidential election without carrying the county.

Donald Trump broke the Democratic streak in the county in 2024, when he carried the county by a narrow majority. This reflects the general trend in Florida towards the Republican Party in recent elections.













=== Local politics ===
A home rule charter for Hillsborough County was approved by voters in a county-wide referendum held in September 1983, and the first county commissioners elected under this new charter took office on May 28, 1985.

The charter divides the power of county government between legislative and executive branches. The Board of County Commissioners, which composes the legislative branch, sets overall policy by means of ordinances, resolutions, and motions.

The executive powers of county government are vested in the county administrator, appointed by county commissioners and charged by the charter to faithfully implement the powers of the board. The charter provides for a county attorney, to be hired by the county administrator with the advice and consent of the county commissioners. The charter contains a provision for a charter review board appointed by County Commissioners every five years to conduct a study of county government and propose amendments to the charter. These amendments must be presented to voters for approval. One amendment was approved in November 2002, adding the position of County Internal Performance Auditor to the government structure. This position reports directly to the County Commission.

The current administrator is Bonnie M. Wise, who took office on July 1, 2020, replacing Mike Merrill, who had served as administrator since 2010. Wise previously served as the county&#x27;s deputy administrator and Tampa&#x27;s chief financial officer.

Of the seven members of the Board of County Commissioners for Hillsborough County, four are elected from single-member districts, and three are elected county-wide. The board approves the county&#x27;s operating and capital budgets and the county&#x27;s capital-improvement program. It may take action on any programs for the improvement of the county and the welfare of its residents.

=== Government officials ===
These five countywide elected positions have specific responsibilities under the county charter:
* Clerk of the Circuit Court: Cindy Stuart (D)
* Sheriff: Chad Chronister (R)
* Property Appraiser: Bob Henriquez (D)
* Tax Collector: Nancy Millan (D)
* Supervisor of Elections: Craig Latimer (D)

Under a charter ordinance that went into effect May 1985, seven county commissioners are directed to perform legislative functions of government by developing policy for the management of Hillsborough County. The county administrator, a professional appointed by the board, and the administrative staff are responsible for the implementation of these policies.

The board also serves as the Environmental Protection Commission. Individual board members serve on various other boards, authorities, and commissions such as the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, Tampa Bay Water, Aviation Authority, Expressway Authority, Sports Authority, Port Authority, Arts Council of Hillsborough County, Children&#x27;s Board, Metropolitan Planning Organization, and Council of Governments.

===Taxes===
Hillsborough County&#x27;s discretionary sales tax rate increased from 1% to 2.5% in January 2019. When combined with the state of Florida&#x27;s 6%, the rate is 8.5%, the highest in Florida. The rate includes two surcharges approved by voter referendum in November 2018, 1% for transportation and 1/2% for schools. It is only collected on the first $5000 of any large purchase.

==Economy==

In the early 20th century, Hillsborough&#x27;s economy was predominantly based on cigar-making and agriculture. In 2012, Hillsborough had the second-largest agricultural output among Florida&#x27;s counties. As of 2010, the average annual employment in Hillsborough County was 563,292.

==Hillsborough County Fire Rescue==
Hillsborough County Fire Rescue serves the unincorporated areas of Hillsborough County. Fire service began in the 1950s as an all-volunteer force consisting of about a dozen loosely associated community-based organizations. The first full-time career firefighters were hired in 1973. The department now has 1,019 career uniformed and support personnel who continue to set the pace in fire and emergency medical response, making it the fourth-largest department in the state. Since the 1997 consolidation of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue and Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the department has placed paramedics on each career, front-line apparatus. The department operates 35 ALS transport ambulances, 46 Engine Companies, 5 Truck Companies, 2 Heavy Rescue&#x27;s, 1 Hazardous Incident Unit, 1 Fire Boat and 1 Rescue Boat. These units operate out of 44 Fire Rescue stations located strategically throughout Hillsborough County. As of summer 2021, 2 additional stations are being constructed to bring that number up to 46. As nearly 85% of the department&#x27;s more than 137,000 (2021) emergency responses require some level of medical care, having paramedics assigned to each unit assures that the citizens of Hillsborough County are receiving rapid advanced life-support care.

Hillsborough County Fire Rescue and the Board of County Commissioners have implemented a plan to continue placing new fire rescue stations in areas where growth is occurring or gaps in coverage may exist. Fire Chief Dennis Jones leads a senior staff of two deputy chiefs (operations and administrative branches), the fire marshal, and the emergency manager. All fiscal functions, facilities maintenance and supply, apparatus/equipment procurement, emergency dispatch manager, personnel chief, and training chief are under the direction of the deputy chief of administration. The three Shift Commanders, as well as the Rescue Chief and the Special Operations Chief, report directly to the Deputy Chief of Operations. The Operations Chief is responsible for the overall response readiness of all front line personnel. The Emergency Manager oversees all Office of Emergency Management (OEM) planning and operations of the EOC.

===Hillsborough County Fire Rescue Office of Emergency Management===
The Office of Emergency Management is a division of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue that is directly responsible for planning and coordinating the evacuation and sheltering of all county residents in the event of a natural or manmade disaster. This agency is also responsible for planning, orchestrating and coordinating response actions and continuity of government in the aftermath of a major disaster. Preston Cook has been the Emergency Manager since 2011.

The Hurricane Evacuation Assessment Tool has been created to assist residents of Hillsborough County by providing evacuation and sheltering information in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster. This interactive program was designed to assist the public in easily determining if they are in one of the five evacuation zones. It also provides information on shelters, hospitals, fire stations, and sandbag locations.

The Office of Emergency Management also provides information to the public on: Hurricane information, procedures for hazardous-materials spills, and flooding, tornado, wildfire, and terrorism preparedness.

<text>Holmes County is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida, in the Panhandle. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,653. Its county seat is Bonifay.

==History==
Holmes County was created in 1848.

The county&#x27;s namesake is a point of debate. Holmes Creek – the county&#x27;s eastern boundary – bore that name before the county was created, but it was originally named Weekaywehatchee (a Creek Indian name meaning &quot;spring creek&quot;). One claim is that the county was named for Thomas J. Holmes, who came from North Carolina to settle in the area about 1830. Another is that it is named after Holmes, an American Indian chief who settled in the area with his band of Red Stick Creek Indians after 1814. He was subsequently killed in 1818 by a raiding party sent by Andrew Jackson during the First Seminole War.

Holmes County has had four county seats in its history. The first was Hewett&#x27;s Bluff (later renamed Bear Pen, then Cerro Gordo), then Pittman&#x27;s Ferry, then Westville, and finally Bonifay. Bonifay has been the county seat since 1905.

==Triracial people==

The so-called &quot;Dominickers&quot;, a number of related mixed-race (white, black, and Euchee Indian) families, lived for decades after the Civil War and well into the twentieth century in a rural area near Ponce de Leon, with a separate church and segregated public elementary school. Although considered a separate ethnicity from both whites and blacks, many Dominickers married into local white families, so that group boundaries blurred; some descendants still live in the area. The 1950 federal census identified 60 members of this group living in Holmes County at that time. Few facts are known about their origins, and little has been published about them.

==Politics==
Holmes County is an archetypically &quot;Solid South&quot; county in Florida. It gave the fifth-highest percentage of the vote for segregationist George Wallace of any county in the country during the 1968 election, and apart from Deep South native Jimmy Carter, no Democrat since 1964 has obtained as much as thirty-four percent of the county&#x27;s vote in any Presidential election.

Holmes County once had more registered Democrats than Republicans, but many were descendants of Dixiecrats, Southerners who registered as Democrats due to tradition but voted Republican in most elections. Barack Obama earned only 15.2% of the vote in 2012. Hillary Clinton earned less than 10% of the vote in 2016.











==Media==
The Holmes County Times-Advertiser is now owned by Halifax Media. The weekly newspaper publishes each Wednesday.

* Townsend Broadcasting began Holmes County first FM radio station in 1984 broadcasting a mere 3000 watts. WTBB (townsend broadcasting Bonifay) WTBB broadcast a sound 10 format soft rock and classic oldies. WTBB general manager was Larry Donaldson assisting Mr. Donaldson who later became a radio Hit D.J. was C.J. Newcomb who went on to stations like WJST and Sunny 98.5. in the Panama City Market. WTBB was sold to Pirate Radio and studios were moved to Panama City,Fl. call sign for frequency 97.7 are still in Holmes County however studios have long gone.

Holmes District School Board operates public schools. Holmes County High School and Ponce de Leon High School are its public high schools. Poplar Springs High School is a K-12 Combination School in Northeastern Holmes County and Bethlehem High School is a K-12 Combination School in the Bethlehem Community.

The Holmes County Public Library is the county&#x27;s library system. It is located at 303 North J. Harvey Etheridge Street, Bonifay, Florida 32425. The library is open Tuesday-Friday 8:00am–5:00pm, and Saturday 8:00am–12:00pm and offers public computers with internet access, free wi-fi, programming for all ages, and access to e-books, e-audiobooks, and numerous online databases and resources.

===Major highways===

* (Interstate 10) is the main west-to-east interstate highway in the county, and runs along southern Holmes County. It contains two interchanges within the county; SR 81 (Exit 94) in Ponce de Leon, then momentarily passes in and out of Washington County only to encounter the second interchange at SR 79 (Exit 112), in Bonifay.
* (U.S. Highway 90) was the main west-to-east highway in the county, until it was surpassed by I-10.
* is the west-to-east route that&#x27;s closest to the Alabama border beginning at SR 81 (&quot;see below&quot;). A tri-county extension runs west of SR 81 in Royal Crossroads through Walton and Okaloosa Counties.
* is a south-to-north highway running though eastern Holmes County. The road enters the county from Washington County to the south as passes through Bonifay, Holland Crossroads and Esto, before finally crossing the Florida-Alabama State Line where it turns into AL 167.
* is a south-to-north highway running through western Holmes County. The road enters the county from Walton County to the south as passes through Ponce De Leon, Prosperity, Hobbs Crossroads and Royal Crossroads, before finally crossing the Florida-Alabama State Line where it turns into AL 87.

===Railroads===
Holmes County has one railroad line. The primary one is the CSX P&amp;A Subdivision, a line formerly owned by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad that served Amtrak&#x27;s Sunset Limited. This service formerly went to New Orleans, but in 2005 service was truncated by the extensive damage in the Gulf area due to Hurricane Katrina. Another former L&amp;N line existed within the northeastern corner of the county. The Georgiana Branch entered the state and county from Highnote, Alabama then ran through Esto and later Eleanor before crossing SR 2 and leaving the county towards Graceville and Campbellton, where it had a junction with the Bay Line Railroad.

<text>Stag beetles comprise the family Lucanidae. It has about 1,200 species of beetles in four subfamilies. Some species grow to over , but most to about .

==Overview==

The English name is derived from the large and distinctive mandibles found on the males of most species, which resemble the antlers of stags.

A well-known species in much of Europe is &quot;Lucanus cervus&quot;, referred to in some European countries (including the United Kingdom) as &quot;the&quot; stag beetle; it is the largest terrestrial insect in Europe. Pliny the Elder noted that Nigidius called the beetle &quot;lucanus&quot; after the Italian region of Lucania where they were used as amulets. The scientific name of &quot;Lucanus cervus&quot; adds &quot;cervus&quot;, deer.

Male stag beetles are known for their oversize mandibles used to wrestle each other for favoured mating sites in a way that parallels the way stags fight over females. Fights may also be over food, such as tree sap and decaying fruits. Despite their often fearsome appearance, they are not normally aggressive to humans. During a battle between the two males, the main objective is to dislodge its opponent&#x27;s tarsal claws with its mandible, thus disrupting their balance. Because its mandibles are capable of exceeding its own body size, stag beetles are generally inefficient runners and are very slow, and typically feel the need to fly from one location to another. 

Female stag beetles are usually smaller than the males, with smaller mandibles that are much more powerful than the males&#x27;. As larvae, females are distinguished by their cream-coloured, fat ovaries visible through the skin around two-thirds of the way down their back.

The larvae feed for several years on rotting wood, growing through three larval stages until eventually pupating inside a pupal cell constructed from surrounding wood pieces and soil particles. In the final larval stage, &quot;L3&quot;, the surviving grubs of larger species, such as &quot;Prosopocoilus giraffa&quot;, may be the size of a human finger.

In England’s New Forest, it was once believed that the stag beetle, dubbed the &quot;devil&#x27;s imp&quot;, was sent to do some evil to the corn crops. The superstition led to stoning the insects on sight, as observed by a writer in the Notes and Queries. 
Along with rhinoceros beetles, stag beetles are often bought as pets in South Korea and Japan.

== Evolution ==
The oldest known fossil of the group is &quot;Juraesalus&quot; from the late Middle Jurassic (Callovian) Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia, China. While initially interpreted as a member of Aesalinae, it was later interpreted to be a basal member of the family. &quot;Litholamprima&quot;, the only genus in the subfamily Litholampriminae, is known from the Lower Cretaceous of Yixian Formation, China.

==Antler allometry==

The Lucanidae males have large antlers. Their size often varies among individuals. Such variation is termed a scaling relationship or static allometry. Environmental conditions and genetic factors affect antler size.

<text>Sir Constantijn Huygens, Lord of Zuilichem ( , , ; 4 September 159628 March 1687), was a Dutch Golden Age poet and composer. He was also secretary to two Princes of Orange: Frederick Henry and William II, and the father of the scientist Christiaan Huygens.

==Biography==
Constantijn Huygens was born in The Hague, the second son of Christiaan Huygens (senior), secretary of the Council of State, and Susanna Hoefnagel, niece of the Antwerp painter Joris Hoefnagel.

==Education==

Constantijn was a gifted child. His brother Maurits and he were educated partly by their father and partly by carefully instructed governors. When he was five years old, Constantijn and his brother received their first musical education.

===Music education===
They started with singing lessons, and they learned their notes using gold-coloured buttons on their jackets. It is striking that Christiaan senior imparted the &quot;modern&quot; system of 7 note names to the boys, instead of the traditional, but much more complicated hexachord system. Two years later the first lessons on the viol started, followed by the lute and the harpsichord. Constantijn showed a particular acumen for the lute. At the age of eleven he was already asked to play for ensembles, and later—during his diplomatic travels—his lute playing was in demand; he was asked to play at the Danish Court and for James I of England, although they were not known for their musical patronage. In later years he also learnt the more modern guitar. In 1647 he published in Paris his &quot;Pathodia sacra et profana&quot; with his compositions of airs de cour in French, madrigals in Italian and Psalms in Latin.

===Art instruction===
They were also schooled in art through their parents&#x27; art collection, but also their connection to the magnificent collection of paintings in the Antwerp house of diamond and jewellery dealer, Gaspar Duarte (1584–1653), who was a Portuguese Jewish exile.

===Language lessons===
Constantijn also had a talent for languages. He learned French, Latin and Greek, and at a later age Italian, German and English. He learned by practice, the modern way of learning techniques. Constantijn received education in maths, law and logic and he learned how to handle a pike and a musket.

In 1614 Constantijn wrote his first Dutch poem, inspired by the French poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas, in which he praises rural life. In his early 20s, he fell in love with Dorothea; however, their relationship did not last and Dorothea met someone else.

In 1616, Maurits and Constantijn started studies at Leiden University. Studying in Leiden was primarily seen as a way to build a social network. Shortly after, Maurits was called home to assist his father. Constantijn finished his studies in 1617 and returned home. This was followed by six weeks of training with Antonis de Hubert, a lawyer in Zierikzee. De Hubert was committed to the study of language and writing, having held consultations with Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, Laurens Reael and Joost van den Vondel concerning language and orthography in 1623.

==Early career==
In the Spring of 1618 Constantijn found employment with Sir Dudley Carleton, the English envoy at the Court in The Hague. In the summer, he stayed in London in the house of the Dutch ambassador, Noël de Caron. During his time in London his social circle widened and he also learned to speak English. In 1620, towards the end of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, he travelled as a secretary of ambassador François van Aerssen to Venice, to gain support against the threat of renewed war. He was the only member of the legation who could speak Italian.

===London===
In January 1621, he traveled to England as the secretary of six envoys of the United Provinces with the object of persuading James I to support the German Protestant Union. They lodged in Lombard Street and were taken by coach to Whitehall Palace to King James and then to Prince Charles at St James&#x27;s Palace where they realised they had delivered the letters for the prince to the king, and Huygens made an excuse of the poor light. On Shrove-Tuesday they saw a masque at Whitehall presented by the gentlemen of the Middle Temple. They returned in April of that year, Huygens with the king&#x27;s gift of a gold chain worth £45. In December 1621 he left with another delegation, this time with the aim of requesting support for the United Provinces, returning after a year and two months in February 1623. There was yet another trip to England in 1624.

===Muiderkring===
He is often considered a member of what is known as the Muiderkring, a group of leading intellectuals gathered around the poet Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, who met regularly at the castle of Muiden near Amsterdam. In 1619 Constantijn came into contact with Anna Roemers Visscher and with Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Huygens exchanged many poems with Anna. In 1621 a poetic exchange with Hooft also starts. Both would always try to exceed the other. In October of that year Huygens sent Jacob Cats a large poem in Dutch, entitled &quot; &#x27;t Voorhout&quot;, about a woodland near the Hague. In December he started writing &quot; &#x27;t Kostelick Mal&quot;, a satirical treatment of the nonsense of the current vogue. 

In 1623, Huygens wrote his &quot;Printen&quot;, a description of several characteristics of people. This satirical, moralising work was one of the most difficult of Huygens&#x27; poems. In the same year Maria Tesselschade and Allard Crombalch were married. For this occasion verses were written by Huygens, Hooft and Vondel. During the festival, Constantijn flirted with Machteld of Camps. As a result of this he wrote the poem &quot;Vier en Vlam&quot;. In 1625 the work &quot;Otia&quot;, or &quot;Ledige Uren&quot;, was published. This work showcased his collected poems.

===English knighthood and marriage===
In 1622, when Constantijn stayed as a diplomat for more than one year in England, he was knighted by King James I. This marked the end of Constantijn&#x27;s formative years, and of his youth. During his time in England, in December 1622, he was robbed of his papers and £200 in gold from his coach as he set out on the way to Newmarket.

Huygens was employed as a secretary to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, who—after the death of Maurits of Orange—was appointed as &quot;stadtholder.&quot; In 1626 Constantijn fell in love with Suzanna van Baerle after earlier courtship by the Huygens family to win her for his brother Maurits had failed. Constantijn wrote several sonnets for her, in which he calls her &quot;Sterre&quot; (Star). They wed on 6 April 1627.

Huygens describes their marriage in &quot;Dagh-werck&quot;, a description of one day. He worked on this piece, which contains almost 2000 lines, during the entire time they were married. In one of the preserved manuscripts of this work it appears Suzanna transcribed (or wrote herself) a substantial portion of the work, suggesting a close collaboration between husband and wife.

The couple had five children: in 1628 their first son, Constantijn Jr., in 1629 Christiaan, in 1631 Lodewijk and in 1633 Philips. In 1637 their daughter Suzanna was born; shortly after her birth their mother died.

===Education of his sons and the new royal Prince===
In 1645, his sons Constantijn Jr. and Christiaan began their studies in Leiden. In these years Prince Frederick Henry of Orange, Huygens&#x27; confidante and protector, became increasingly ill, and died in 1647. The new stadtholder, William II of Orange, greatly appreciated Huygens and gave him the estate of Zeelhem, but he died too in 1650.

The emphasis of Huygens&#x27; activities moved more and more to his presidency of the Council of the house of Orange, which was in the hands of the young Prince inheritor, a small baby. He traveled frequently during that time, in connection with his work. There were however strong disagreements between the baby&#x27;s widowed grandmother Amalia van Solms, and its widowed mother (her daughter in law) Mary, Princess Royal, (4 November 1631 – 24 December 1660, aged 29) on even the name for christening the Dutch-English Royal newborn.
In 1657, his son Philips died after a short sickness during his Grand Tour while in Prussia. In that same year Huygens became seriously ill, but healed in a miraculous manner.

In 1680, Constantijn Jr. moved with his family out of the house of his father. To stop the gossiping which started shortly afterwards, Huygens wrote the poem &quot;Cluijs-werck&quot;, in which he shows a glimpse of the latter stages of his life.

==Later career and French knighthood==

Huygens started a successful career despite his grief over the death of his wife (1638). In 1630 he was appointed to the Council and Exchequer, managing the estate of the Orange family. This job provided him with an income of about 1000 florins a year. In that same year he bought the heerlijkheid Zuilichem and became known as Lord of Zuilichem (in Dutch: Heer van Zuilichem). In 1632, Louis XIII of France - the protector of the famous exiled jurist Hugo Grotius - appointed him as Knight of the Order of Saint-Michel. In 1643 Huygens was granted the honor of displaying a golden lily on a blue field in his coat of arms.

In 1634 Huygens received from Prince Frederick Henry a piece of property in The Hague on the north side of the Binnenhof. The land was near the property of a good friend of Huygens, Count Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen, who built his house, the Mauritshuis, around the same time and using the same architect, Huygens&#x27; friend Jacob van Campen.

===Correspondence===
Aside from his &quot;membership&quot; in the Muiderkring (which was not as formerly supposed, an official club), at the start of the 1630s he was also in touch with René Descartes, with Rembrandt, and the painter Jan Lievens. He became friends with John Donne, and translated his poems into Dutch. He was unable to write poetry for months because of his anguish over his wife&#x27;s death, but eventually he composed, inspired by Petrarch, the sonnet &quot;Op de dood van Sterre&quot; (On the death of Sterre), which was well received. He added the poem to his &quot;Dagh-werck&quot;, which he left unfinished: the day he has described has not ended yet, but his Sterre is already dead. After sending the unfinished work to different friends for approval, he eventually published it in 1658 as part of his &quot;Koren-bloemen&quot;.

Huygens also corresponded with Margaret Croft and Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of Löwenstein, ladies in waiting to Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, and Mary Woodhouse, a friend made in London in 1622.

==Hofwijck==
After a couple of years as a widower, Huygens bought a piece of land in Voorburg and commissioned the building of Hofwijck. Hofwijck was inaugurated in 1642 in the company of friends and relatives. Here Huygens hoped to escape the stress at court in The Hague, forming his own &quot;court&quot;, indicated by the name of the house which has a double meaning: Hof (=Court or courtyard) Wijck (=avoid or township). In that same year, his brother Maurits died. Due to his grief Huygens wrote little Dutch poetry, but he continued to write epigrams in Latin. Shortly afterwards, he began writing Dutch pun poems, which are very playful by nature. In 1644 and 1645 Huygens began more serious work. As a new year&#x27;s present for Leonore Hellemans, he composed the &quot;Heilige Daghen&quot;, a series of sonnets on the Christian holidays. In 1644, a garlanded portrait of Huygens was painted by Daniel Seghers and Jan Cossiers: it is now in the Mauritshuis. In 1647 he published another work, in which play and seriousness are united, &quot;Ooghentroost&quot;, addressed to Lucretia of Trello, who was losing her sight and who was already half-blind. The poem was offered as consolation.

From 1650 to 1652 Huygens wrote the poem &quot;Hofwijck&quot; in which he described the joys of living outside the city. It is thought that Huygens wrote his poetry as a testament to himself, a &quot;memento mori&quot;, because Huygens lost so many dear friends and family during this time: Hooft (1647), Barlaeus (1648), Maria Tesschelschade (1649) and Descartes (1650).

==Writing==
He still tried to find time to publish more of his work. In 1647 a number of Huygens&#x27; musical creations, &quot;Pathodia sacra et profana,&quot; was published in Paris. It contained vocal compositions in Latin (Psalms), French, and Italian (secular texts). The work was dedicated to Utricia Ogle, a niece of an English diplomat.

In 1648 Huygens wrote &quot;Twee ongepaerde handen&quot; for harpsichord. This work was dedicated to Marietje Casembroot, a twenty-five-year-old harpsichord player, with whom he shared his love of music.

In 1657 the collected work of his Dutch poems, the &quot;Koren-bloemen&quot; appears. Some of its contents contain: &quot;Heilighe Daghen&quot; (1645), &quot;Ooghen-troost&quot; (1647), &quot;Hofwijck&quot; (1653) and &quot;Trijntje Cornelis&quot; (1653). This last work, &quot;Trijntje Cornelis&quot;, is an explosion of Huygens&#x27; creativity. It testifies to the rare language - and expressive capacity - of the author. Considering that the piece was written in a rather short time, it can be considered work of an enormous performance. Since his mother Suzanna was from Antwerp, he visited there often and &quot;Trijntje Cornelis&quot; takes place in Antwerp.

In 1660 his daughter Suzanna married her cousin, Philips Doublet, son of Huygens&#x27; sister Geertruijd. In 1661, a grandfather by now, Huygens was sent to France by the circle of tutors of William III, to recover possession of the county of Orange. The county was returned to the family of Orange-Nassau in 1665 and Huygens returned to the Netherlands.

On his return, Huygens designed the new sand road in The Hague, running through the dunes to Scheveningen. He had already planned this road in 1653, and wrote about it in his work the &quot;Zee-straet&quot;. The road was made according to Huygens&#x27; design.

In 1676 the second edition of the &quot;Koren-bloemen&quot; appeared, a collected work containing 27 books. New in this edition were the &quot;Zee-straet&quot;, the &quot;Mengelingh&quot; (a section of serious poems written after 1657) and seven books with &quot;snel-dichten&quot; (quick poems). As he was older now, Huygens found refuge in music. He wrote around 769 compositions during his lifetime.

==Legacy==

Constantijn Huygens died in The Hague on Good Friday, 28 March 1687 at the age of 90. A week later he was buried in the Grote Kerk in the Hague. His son, the scientist Christiaan Huygens was later buried with his father.

In 1947 a literary award was created, the Constantijn Huygens Prize, to honor his legacy.

==Constantijn Huygens in fiction==
Constantijn Huygens plays a major part in Brian Howell&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Curious Case of Jan Torrentius&quot; (Zagava, Düsseldorf, 2017), an expanded edition of his previous collection of novellas, &quot;The Stream and The Torrent: Jan Torrentius and The Followers of the Rosy Cross: Vol.1&quot; (Zagava/Les Éditions de L&#x27;Oubli, 2014)

<text>Jackson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Florida, on its northwestern border with Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 47,319. Its county seat is Marianna.

==History==
Jackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 out of Escambia County, at the same time that Duval County was organized from land of St. Johns County, making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, a General of the War of 1812, who had served as Florida&#x27;s first military governor for six months in 1821. Jackson County originally extended from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east. By 1840 the county had been reduced close to its present boundaries through the creation of new counties from its original territory, following an increase of population in these areas. Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however.

There were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Big Spring&quot; (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the &quot;Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee&quot; in 1823. The following year the county court met at &quot;Chipola Settlement&quot;, which is also known as Waddell&#x27;s Mill Pond.

The free labor of enslaved African Americans allowed European Americans to develop this area of Florida as part of the plantation belt in the antebellum years. Cotton was cultivated as a commodity crop by large workgangs, and so Florida became a slave society.

Gradually towns were developed. In January 1821, Webbville had been established as the first town in Jackson County. It was the first designated as the county seat. Marianna was founded in September 1821 by Robert Beveridge, a native of Scotland. It developed about southeast of Webbville. About 1828, Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee to lobby the state legislature to move the county seat to Marianna.

They enticed the Florida Legislature with offers of free land, locally paying for construction of a county courthouse and development of a related public square, and donating an additional $500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government, if the county seat was moved to Marianna. Beveridge and his supporters succeeded in their civic bribe. Marianna became the &quot;de facto&quot; county seat of the county justice and civil authority, although it was never officially proclaimed as such. Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829. It became the market and court town for the rural county.

Webbville&#x27;s prominent citizens moved to Marianna to follow the courts, as did numerous businesses. When the L&amp;N Railroad decided to bypass putting a station at Webbville, the town declined further and became defunct. 

===Jackson County war===
After the Civil War, the county was convulsed by violence as Confederate veterans and their allies attacked and intimidated freedmen and their sympathizers. The county faced the worst economic conditions in the state, as it had been most extensively developed for cotton plantations before the war, and was adversely affected by the international decline in the market. White planters resisted dealing with freedmen as free workers. Insurgent Confederate veterans formed a Ku Klux Klan chapter and carried out masked violence to exert power, intimidate freedmen and white sympathizers, suppress their voting, and restore white supremacy.

Planters were defaulting on tax payments due to the poor economic conditions, and Republican county officials began to sell thousands of acres in tax sales. In addition the two representatives of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, Charles Memorial Hamilton and William J. Purman, worked to break the cycle of black labor exploitation. Planters would throw sharecroppers off the land at the end of the season with no payment, claiming infractions that the Bureau deemed minor. The Bureau agents worked to enforce labor contracts.

Tensions broke out into violence and in 1869 Jackson County became the center of a guerrilla war extending through 1871; it became known as the Jackson County War. The local Ku Klux Klan, insurgent Confederate Army veterans, directed their violence at eradicating the Republican Party in the county, assassinating more than 150 Republican Party leaders and other prominent African Americans as part of a successful campaign to retain white Democratic power in the county. Another source says that in Jackson County, 200 &quot;leading Republicans&quot; were assassinated in 1869 and 1870 alone; no one was arrested or brought to trial for these crimes.

 In 1871 he resigned, saying given the &quot;lawlessness&quot;, he could not carry out the duties of sheriff. The last Republican official in the county, clerk of the circuit court John Dickenson, was assassinated in 1871. (The previous clerk, Dr. John Finlayson, was killed in 1869.)

In testimony to Congressional hearings about the KKK, state senator Charles H. Pearce, minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, said, &quot;Satan has his seat; he reigns in Jackson County.&quot;

===Post-Reconstruction era to present===
Violence by whites against blacks in the county continued after Reconstruction. Nine African Americans were lynched here after Reconstruction, most around the turn of the century. But notorious lynchings of individual men also took place later.

In 1934, Claude Neal, an African-American suspect in the murder of a young white woman, was tortured, shot and hanged in a spectacle lynching that was announced beforehand on the radio and in a local paper. It was covered by national newspapers, arousing condemnation. In addition, Neal&#x27;s lynching was followed by a white riot in Marianna, in which whites attacked the black section of town and blacks on the street, injuring 200, including two police officers, and causing much property damage. Howard Kester, a prominent Southern evangelical minister who tried to improve conditions, assessed the economic and class issues related to the racial violence. In 1943 the last lynching in the county was conducted. Cellos Harrison, an African-American man, had been twice convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. He was taken from the county jail in Marianna by a white mob and hanged while his case was being appealed.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.9%) is water. Jackson County is the only county in Florida that borders both Georgia and Alabama. Jackson County is in the Central Standard Time Zone. Its eastern border with Gadsden County forms the boundary in this area between the Central Standard and Eastern Standard Time Zones.

===Adjacent counties===

* Seminole County, Georgia - east (EST)
* Gadsden County, Florida - southeast (EST)
* Liberty County, Florida - southeast (EST)
* Calhoun County, Florida - south
* Washington County, Florida - southwest
* Bay County, Florida - southwest
* Holmes County, Florida - west
* Geneva County, Alabama - northwest
* Houston County, Alabama - north
===Rivers and water bodies===
Three water bodies form the eastern border of Jackson county. The Chattahoochee River forms the northeast boundary between Jackson County and Seminole County, Georgia. It flows into Lake Seminole. The Lake was formed by the Jim Woodruff Dam which was completed in 1952. The outflow at the dam becomes the Apalachicola River which is the eastern boundary of Jackson county with Gadsden county.

The Chipola River is formed in north central Jackson county from the confluences of Black Creek and Cowarts Creek. It continues south through the county and becomes a part of the border between Jackson county and the west side of the northern section of Calhoun county.

Holmes Creek forms the northern portion of the western border of Jackson county with Holmes County.

Blue Springs is a Jackson county recreation area east of Marianna located near the site of former Florida Governor John Milton&#x27;s Sylvania plantation.

Two other notable water bodies in the county are Compass Lake in the southwest and Ocheesee Pond in the southeast.

===Florida State Parks in Jackson County===
*Florida Caverns State Park is on the Chipola river. At Blue Hole Springs the river disappears underground for a few thousand feet and then resurfaces.
*Three Rivers State Park is located north of Sneads. It is at the junction of the Chattahoochee and the Flint (which flow into Lake Seminole from Georgia), and the Apalachicola which begins at the Lake Seminole Dam.

<text>Lafayette County is a county located in the north central portion of the state of Florida.

Lafayette County is a prohibition or partially dry county, allowing retail sales of beer.

==History==
Lafayette County was created on December 23, 1856, from part of Madison County on the same day as Taylor County was also split off from Madison County. At the time it comprised all the area of present-day Lafayette and Dixie counties. The county was named in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, the French general who rendered assistance to the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. The famed Suwannee River forms the entire eastern boundary. The county courts first met at the home of Ariel Jones near Fayetteville. The county seat was New Troy until the court house burned down on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1892. It was moved to Mayo in 1893, and Mayo is currently Lafayette&#x27;s only incorporated town. The moving of the courthouse was the end for New Troy. The &quot;Gainesville Sun&quot; states that houses were dismantled for their timber and bricks, hardwoods replaced the fields, steamboat traffic ended in 1899, and the ferry closed in 1917. In 1921 the lower part of the county was removed to create Dixie County.

<doc id="72387" wikidata="Q1136498" url="?curid=72387" title="Grenadine">
<text>Grenadine is a nonalcoholic bar syrup commonly used as a cocktail ingredient, distinguished by its sweetness, mild flavor, and red color. Popular in mixed drinks, grenadine syrup was traditionally made from pomegranate, but today is most prevalently made from commercially produced natural or artificial flavors, as well as substitute fruits (such as blackcurrant, elderberry, raspberry, gooseberry and their juices).

==Name==
Grenadine syrup was originally prepared from pomegranate juice, sugar, and water, with its name deriving from the French word &quot;grenade&quot;, for pomegranate (from the Latin &quot;grānātum&quot;, &quot;seeded&quot;).

It is not related to the Grenadines archipelago, which takes its name from Grenada, itself from Granada, Spain.

==Modern and commercial variants==
As grenadine is subject to minimal regulation, its basic flavor profile can vary widely from the original pomegranate to combinations of unspecified natural and artificial flavors, to the use of other fruits, such as blackcurrant, elderberry, raspberry, and gooseberry.

To reduce production costs, manufacturers have widely replaced fruit bases with artificial ingredients. The &quot;Rose&#x27;s&quot; brand (owned by Mott&#x27;s) is by far the most common grenadine sold in the United States, and is formulated from (in order of concentration) high fructose corn syrup, water, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, FD&amp;C Red #40, natural and artificial flavors, and FD&amp;C Blue #1.

==Use==

Grenadine is commonly used to mix both modern and classic cocktails, including:

* El Presidente – rum, orange curaçao, vermouth, and grenadine
* Mary Pickford – white rum, pineapple juice and grenadine
* Queen Mary – beer, grenadine and maraschino cherries, drizzled with cherry syrup
* Singapore sling – a gin-based sling cocktail
* Tequila sunrise – tequila, orange juice and grenadine
* Ward 8 – &quot;a whiskey sour with a few dashes of grenadine added&quot;
* Zombie – a rum-based Tiki cocktail

Grenadine is also a popular ingredient in such non-alcoholic drinks as the Shirley Temple, Roy Rogers, and pink lemonade. It also may simply be mixed with cold water or soda.

<text>Jefferson County is a county located in the Big Bend region in the northern part of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,510. Its county seat is Monticello. Jefferson County is part of the Tallahassee, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area but is the 3rd most rural county in Florida. There are no traffic signals within the entire county.

==History==
In the mid to late 18th century, a group of Native Americans from Chiaha chiefdom settled in what is now Jefferson County. This group would eventually become an element of the Mikasuki speaking Seminole.

Jefferson County was created in 1827. It was named for Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, who had died the year before the county&#x27;s establishment.

===Forts of Jefferson County===
* Fort Roger Jones (1839), Aucilla (Ocilla Ferry), north of US 90.
* Fort Noel (1839–1842), south of Lamont on the Aucilla River, northwest of Fort Pleasant in Taylor County. Also known as Fort Number Three (M).
* Camp Carter (1838), near Waukeenah.
* Fort Welaunee (1838), a settlers&#x27; fort on the Welaunee Plantation near Wacissa. Fort Gamble (1839–1843) was later established here.
* Fort Aucilla (1843), south-east of Fort Gamble, southwest of Lamont, between the Aucilla and Wacissa Rivers. Also spelled Ocilla.
* Fort Wacissa (1838), a settlers&#x27; fort located south of Wacissa on the Wacissa River, west of Cabbage Grove.

===American Civil War and Emancipation===
In the two decades leading up to the American Civil War, cotton was the primary source of income in the county, with about seventeen percent of all Florida cotton being grown in Jefferson County. It was also the county with the second most large plantations (fifty-five plantations with thirty or more slaves) in Florida, behind only Leon County. In 1860, the county had a population of 9,876 with sixty-four percent being black. Following emancipation, the black population of Jefferson County continued to grow. By 1870 the population had risen to 13,968 with seventy-two percent black. To serve the relatively large black population in the county, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau established an office in Monticello sometime around early 1866.

===Major highways===

* (Interstate 10) is the main west-to-east interstate highway in the county, and serves as the unofficial dividing line between northern and southern Jefferson County. It contains three interchanges within the county; the first being SR 59 in Lloyd (Exit 217), the second at US 19 in Drifton (Exit 225), and the third south of Aucilla at CR 257 (Exit 233). Beyond this point I-10 runs through Madison County.
* is the westernmost north-south US highway in the county. It enters from southwestern Madison County as the Georgia-Florida Parkway in a concurrency with US 27, then breaks away from US 27 in Capps to run straight north through Monticello where it encounters a traffic circle with US 90 around the historic Monticello Courthouse. North of the city it runs through the State of Georgia.
* is another north-south US highway in the county. It enters from Madison County in a concurrency with US 19, but unlike US 19 breaks away at Capps and runs west toward Tallahassee.
* is the westernmost north–south highway in Jefferson County and is the only roadway connection between U.S. 90 (at its intersection in Leon County) to the southernmost east–west route through Jefferson County, U.S. Route 98.
* was the main west-to-east highway in the county, until it was surpassed by I-10. It enters the county from Leon County twice, the second time from a causeway over the southern end of Lake Miccosukee, and eventually enters Monticello in a traffic circle with US 19. East of the city, it curves southeast through rural Jefferson County, then passes north of Aucilla before crossing the Madison County Line at a bridge over the Aucilla River.
* is the southernmost east–west route running through the Conservation Areas of the Gulf of Mexico from Wakulla to Taylor Counties. The sole major intersection is with SR 59.
* is the easternmost US highway in the county, running south and north through the northeastern portion of Jefferson County, including Ashville before crossing the Georgia State Line.
* is a west-east two-lane road known as the Waukeenah Highway in the county that runs from the Leon County line through Wacissa and terminates at US 19 south of the Monticello city limits.

<text>The Au Sable River ( ) is a river in the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. Rising in the Northern Lower Peninsula, the river flows in a generally southeasterly direction to its mouth at Lake Huron at the communities of Au Sable and Oscoda. It is considered one of the best brown trout fisheries east of the Rockies and has been designated a blue ribbon trout stream by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. A map from 1795 located in the United States Gazetteer calls it the Beauais River. In French, the river is called the , literally &quot;Sand River&quot;.

== Description ==
The Au Sable has a drainage basin of and an average flow of 1,100 ft3/s (31 m3/s) at its mouth. The river drops from its source at the junction of Kolka and Bradford Creeks.

The main stream of the river is formed at in Frederic Township in Crawford County by the confluence of Kolke and Bradford Creeks, which both rise in Otsego County. The river flows south then turns east through Grayling, where it is joined by the East Branch Au Sable River at . The East Branch rises in Lovells Township, Crawford County at .

The Au Sable continues eastward and is joined by the South Branch Au Sable River at in South Branch Township. The South Branch rises out of Lake St. Helen in Richfield Township, Roscommon County at and flows northwest into Roscommon then northeast to the main branch of the Au Sable. The North Branch Au Sable River joins within approximately in eastern Crawford County at 
near the boundary with Oscoda County. The North Branch rises in Bagley Township, Otsego County, near Lake Otsego.

The Au Sable then flows mostly east through Oscoda County, then south and east through Alcona County and Iosco County. The river&#x27;s watershed also drains portions of Montmorency County and Ogemaw County.

Most of the main branch of the Au Sable flows through or adjacent to the Huron-Manistee National Forest. of the river, from the Mio Pond downstream to the Alcona Pond, was designated as a National Wild and Scenic River on October 4, 1984. The watershed provides habitat for bald eagles and the endangered Kirtland&#x27;s warbler. Five percent of the land in the watershed is National Forest and 29% is state forest.

It is a designated trout stream, and many canoe liveries exist along the river, which offer canoe trips from a few hours to as long as a week. The river was originally a grayling fishery with brook trout being released in the 1880s. By 1908 the grayling were gone although they were reintroduced in 1987. (See Grayling, Michigan, for more information on the Grayling and the fish hatchery.) Brown trout is the current main catch. The Lumberman&#x27;s Monument, in honor of the lumberjacks that first populated the area, is located on the river about west of Oscoda. Lumbering along the river began in the 1860s and was finished by the 1910s.

The Au Sable River is also the site of a yearly pro-am canoe race, the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon, which begins at 9:00 p.m. on the last Saturday in July, and runs through the night into the next day. Winning times have ranged from 14 to 21 hours. The race was first run in 1947.

River Road, running parallel with the Au Sable River, is a designated National Scenic Byway.

There are six hydro-electric power plants in the Au Sable River basin, with a total installed capacity of 41 MW and an average annual energy output of 500 GJ. The six reservoirs were constructed between 1911 and 1924.

The Au Sable has about of tributary streams including the Pine River.

==River valley attractions and events==
*The Michigan AuSable Valley Railroad is located in Fairview. It is a 1/4 scale, gauge ridable miniature railway, which offers rides on a passenger train through the scenic Northern Michigan landscape. It operates in jack pine country during the summer months. Riders travel through parts of the Huron National Forest and overlook the Comins Creek Valley.
* Au Sable River Canoe Marathon, starts in Grayling and ends in Oscoda down the river. It is one of three marathon races that constitute canoe racing&#x27;s Triple Crown. The race is always held the last full weekend in July.
*First Dam Canoe Race (MCRA - Canoe Race) is a yearly event.
*Six miles west of Oscoda, on River Road Scenic Byway, the Au Sable River Queen offers paddle boat excursions.
*Within this area is Kirtland&#x27;s warbler habitat, so it is an important center for bird watchers.
*The Lumberman&#x27;s Monument is adjacent to the river. The 14-foot Lumberman&#x27;s Monument stands on a high bank with the Au Sable River providing a scenic backdrop since 1932.
*River Road, on the north bank and running parallel to the river, is a designated National Scenic Byway for the 23 miles that go into Oscoda.
*Canoer&#x27;s Memorial: The inscription on the memorial says &quot;The crossed paddles are a canoeist’s salute.  These paddles are erected as a tribute to those professional members of the Michigan Canoe Racing Association who were once active in the promotion and participation of canoe racing in Michigan.  As you view the waters of the AuSable or watch canoes racing on our Michigan streams, remember these departed members and their dedication to the sport of canoe racing.”
**Marathon canoe racing began in 1940 and has been an annual event since then. The first casualty happened in 1953 claiming the life of Jerry Curley, and the river has claimed over 100 racers in its murky depths since then. The Curley family spearheaded the efforts to erect the monument and it is now maintained by volunteers and the U.S. Forest Service.
*The Wolf Creek Trail system is a beautiful trail and boardwalk along the Au Sable River and around Wolf Creek. This trail does not have any mandatory fees for use making it free for everyone. The non-motorized trail is open to all hikers, mountain bikers, cross country skiers, snowshoers, with loops designed as long as 4.2 miles and as short as 1.8 miles. The Wolf Creek Trail, part of the Huron National Forest, has four separate loops with a total of 4.8 miles of walking paths with 3 of these miles running adjacent to the Au Sable River. This trail system is a popular hiking, walking, and cross country skiing spot for locals and tourists alike. Many hikers will use the main trailhead at the bustling Department of Natural Resources canoe launch and park, right off of M-72/33 on the east side of the bridge that crosses the Au Sable River. The park also has toilets, picnic tables, grills, a source for drinking water, and plenty of parking. Most cross country skiers will use the trailhead off of South River Road approximately 2 miles east of Mio. Skiers will encounter a few downhill slopes, but nothing too difficult, making for an overall easy ski trail.

<text>The Muiderkring (Muiden Circle) was the name given to a group of figures in the arts and sciences who regularly met at the castle of Muiden near Amsterdam during the first half of the 17th century, or the Golden Age of the Dutch Republic. The central figure of the Muiderkring was the poet Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft; Constantijn Huygens, Dirck Sweelinck, Vondel, Bredero and the poet sisters Anna Visscher and Maria Tesselschade Visscher were also considered part of the group.

Some music connected with the circle was recorded by the Utrecht ensemble Camerata Trajectina in 1994.

<text>Year 474 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Medullinus and Vulso (or, less frequently, year 280 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 474 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Vibulanus and Barbatus (or, less frequently, year 289 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 465 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>&quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1888) is a story by Rudyard Kipling about two British adventurers in British India who become kings of Kafiristan, a remote part of Afghanistan. The story was first published in &quot;The Phantom &#x27;Rickshaw and Other Tales&quot; (1888); it also appeared in &quot;Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories&quot; (1895) and numerous later editions of that collection. It has been adapted for other media a number of times.

==Plot summary==

The narrator of the story is a Victorian journalist, correspondent of &quot;The Northern Star&quot; in India during the British Raj: Kipling himself, in all but name. Whilst on a tour of some Indian native states, in 1886, he meets two scruffy adventurers, Daniel Dravot and Peachey Tolliver Carnehan. Softened by their stories, he agrees to help them in a small errand, but later he regrets this and informs the authorities about them, which prevents them from blackmailing a minor rajah. A few months later, the pair appear at the narrator&#x27;s newspaper office in Lahore, where they tell him of a plan they have hatched. They declare that, after years of trying their hands at all manner of things, they have decided that India is not big enough for them, so they intend to go to Kafiristan and set themselves up as kings. Dravot, disguised as a priest, and Carnehan, as his servant, will go to the unexplored region armed with twenty Martini-Henry rifles and their British military knowledge. Once there, they plan to find a king or chief and help him defeat his enemies before taking over for themselves. They ask the narrator to see books, encyclopedias, and maps about the area as a favour, both because they are fellow Freemasons and because he spoiled their blackmail scheme. In an attempt to prove that they are not crazy, they show the narrator a contract they have drawn up between themselves which swears loyalty between the pair and total abstinence from women and alcohol until they are kings.

Two years later, on a scorching hot summer night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator&#x27;s office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags who has trouble staying focused, but he tells an amazing story: he says he and Dravot succeeded in becoming kings. They traversed treacherous mountains, found the Kafirs, mustered an army, and took over villages, all the while dreaming of building a unified nation or even an empire. The Kafirs were impressed by the rifles and Dravot&#x27;s lack of fear of their pagan idols, and they soon began to acclaim him as a god and descendant of Alexander the Great; they exhibited a whiter complexion than the natives of the surrounding areas (&quot;so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends&quot;), implying an ancient lineage going back to Alexander and some of his troops themselves. Dravot and Carnehan were shocked to discover that the Kafirs practiced a form of Masonic ritual, and their reputations were cemented when they showed knowledge of Masonic secrets beyond those known by even the highest of the Kafir priests and chiefs.
The schemes of Dravot and Carnehan were dashed, however, when Dravot, against the advice of Carnehan, decided it was time to marry a Kafir girl—kingship going to his head, he decided he needed a queen to give him a royal son. Terrified by the idea of marrying a god, the girl bit Dravot when he tried to kiss her during the wedding ceremony. Seeing him bleed, the priests cried that he was &quot;Neither God nor Devil but a man!&quot; and most of the Kafirs turned against Dravot and Carnehan. A few of their men remained loyal, but the army defected and the two kings were captured. Dravot, wearing his crown, stood on a rope bridge over a gorge while the Kafirs cut the ropes, and he fell to his death. Carnehan was crucified between two pine trees, but, when he survived this torture for a whole day, the Kafirs considered it a miracle and let him go. He then slowly begged his way back to India over the course of a year.

As proof of his tale, Carnehan shows the narrator Dravot&#x27;s severed head and golden crown before he leaves, taking the head and crown, which he swears never to sell, with him. The following day, the narrator sees Carnehan crawling along the road in the noon sun with his hat off. He has gone mad, so the narrator sends him to the local asylum. When he inquires two days later, he learns that Carnehan has died of sunstroke. No belongings were found with him.

==Acknowledged sources==

Kafiristan was recognized as a real place by at least one early Kipling scholar, Arley Munson, who in 1915 called it &quot;a small tract of land in the northeastern part of Afghanistan,&quot; though she wrongly thought the &quot;only source of information is the account of the Mahomedan traders who have entered the country.&quot; By then, Kafiristan had been literally wiped off the map and renamed &quot;Nuristan&quot; in Amir Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s 1895 conquest, and it was soon forgotten by literary critics who, under the sway of the New Criticism, read the story as an allegory of the British Raj. The disappearance of Kafiristan was so complete that a 1995 &quot;New York Times&quot; article referred to it as &quot;the mythical, remote kingdom at the center of the Kipling story.&quot;

As the New Historicism replaced the New Criticism, scholars rediscovered the story&#x27;s historical Kafiristan, aided by the trail of sources left in it by Kipling himself, in the form of the publications the narrator supplies to Dravot and Carnehan: 
* &quot;Volume INF-KAN of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&quot;, which, in the ninth edition of 1882, contained Sir Henry Yule&#x27;s long &quot;Kafiristan&quot; entry. Yule&#x27;s entry described Kafiristan as &quot;land of lofty mountains, dizzy paths, and hair-rope bridges swinging over torrents, of narrow valleys laboriously terraced, but of wine, milk, and honey rather than of agriculture.&quot; He includes Bellew&#x27;s description of a Kafir informant as &quot;hardly to be distinguished from an Englishman&quot; and comments at length on the reputed beauty of Kafir women.
* &quot;Wood on the Sources of the Oxus&quot;, namely, &quot;A Personal Narrative of a Journey to the Source of the River Oxus by the Route of the Indus, Kabul, and Badakhshan&quot; (1841) by Captain John Wood (1811–1871), from which Dravot extracts route information.
* &quot;The file of the United Services&#x27; Institute&quot;, accompanied by the directive, &quot;read what Bellew says,&quot; refers, no doubt, to an 1879 lecture on &quot;Kafristan [sic] and the Kafirs&quot; by Surgeon Major Henry Walter Bellew (1834–1892). This account, like Wood&#x27;s, was based largely on second-hand native travellers&#x27; accounts and &quot;some brief notices of this people and country scattered about in the works of different native historians,&quot; for, as he noted, &quot;up to the present time we have no account of this country and its inhabitants by any European traveler who has himself visited them.&quot; The 29-page survey of history, manners and customs, was as &quot;sketchy and inaccurate&quot; as the narrator suggests, Bellew acknowledging that &quot;of the religion of the Kafirs we know very little,&quot; but noting that &quot;the Kafir women have a world wide reputation of being very beautiful creatures.&quot;
* The narrator smokes &quot;while the men pored over &quot;Raverty&quot;, &quot;Wood&quot;, the maps, and the &quot;Encyclopædia&quot;.&quot; Henry George Raverty&#x27;s &quot;Notes on Káfiristan&quot; appeared in the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; in 1859, and it is presumably this work, based on Raverty&#x27;s contact with some Siah-Posh Kafirs, that is being referenced.

==Possible models==
In addition to Kipling&#x27;s acknowledged sources, a number of individuals have been proposed as possible models for the story&#x27;s main characters.
* Alexander Gardner (1785–1877), American adventurer captured in Afghanistan in 1823. Gardner &quot;stated that he visited Kafiristan twice between 1826 and 1828, and his veracity was vouched for by … reliable authorities&quot; &quot;Only Gardner provides the three essential ingredients of the Kipling novel,&quot; according to John Keay.
* Josiah Harlan (1799–1871), American adventurer enlisted as a surgeon with the British East India Company&#x27;s army in 1824.
* Frederick &quot;Pahari&quot; Wilson (1817–1883), a British officer who deserted during the First Afghan War and later became &quot;Raja of Harsil.&quot;
* James Brooke, a Briton who in 1841 was made the first White Rajah of Sarawak in Borneo, in gratitude for military assistance to the Sultan of Brunei. Kipling alludes to Brooke twice in the story: when Dravot refers to Kafiristan as the &quot;only one place now in the world that two strong men can Sar-a-&quot;whack&quot;&quot; and when Dravot says &quot;Rajah Brooke will be a suckling to us.&quot;
* Adolf Schlagintweit (1829–1857) German botanist and explorer of Central Asia. Suspected of being a Chinese spy, he was beheaded in Kashgar by the amir, Wali Khan. A Persian traveler subsequently delivered his supposed head to colonial administrators, much as Carnehan had brought Dravot&#x27;s head to the narrator of the story.
* William Watts McNair (1849–1889), a surveyor in the Indian Survey Department who, in 1883, visited Kafiristan while on furlough disguised as a hakim or native doctor, disregarding Government regulations. His report to the Royal Geographical Society earned him the Murchison Award.

==Reception==

* As a young man, the would-be poet T. S. Eliot, already an ardent admirer of Kipling, wrote a short story called &quot;The Man Who Was King&quot;. Published in 1905 in the &quot;Smith Academy Record&quot;, a magazine of the school he was attending as a day-boy, the story explicitly shows how the prospective poet was concerned with his own unique version of the &quot;King&quot;.
* J. M. Barrie described the story as &quot;the most audacious thing in fiction&quot;.
* Kingsley Amis called the story a &quot;grossly overrated long tale&quot; in which a &quot;silly prank ends in predictable and thoroughly deserved disaster.&quot;
* Additional critical responses are collected in Harold Bloom&#x27;s &quot;Rudyard Kipling&quot;.

==Adaptations and cultural references==
===Literature===
* In H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot; (1910), the Sleeper identifies a cylinder (&quot;a modern substitute for books&quot;) with &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; written on the side in mutilated English as &quot;oi Man huwdbi Kin&quot;. The Sleeper recalls the story as &quot;one of the best stories in the world&quot;.
* The two main characters appear in Ian Edginton&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Scarlet Traces&quot; (2002).
* The 1975 film version figures in the plot of Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s book &quot;A Salty Piece of Land&quot; (2004).
* Garth Nix&#x27;s short story &quot;Losing Her Divinity&quot;, in the book &quot;Rags &amp; Bones&quot; (2013), is based on the story.

* A French Bande dessinée version by Jean-Christophe Derrien and Remi Torregrossa was published by Glénat Editions in 2023 as &quot;L&#x27;Homme qui voulut etre roi&quot;.

===Radio===
* A CBS Radio adaption of the story by Les Crutchfield was broadcast on the anthology series &quot;Escape&quot; on 7 July 1947. It was rebroadcast on 1 August 1948.
* An adaptation by Mike Walker was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 22 July 2018 as part of the &quot;To The Ends of the Earth&quot; series.

===Films===
* &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975), adapted and directed by John Huston and starring Sean Connery as Dravot and Michael Caine as Carnehan, with Christopher Plummer as Kipling. (As early as 1954, Humphrey Bogart expressed the desire to star in &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; and was in talks with Huston.)
* The DreamWorks 2D hand-drawn animated movie &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000) is loosely based on the story.

===Games===
* &quot;Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000) (the video game tie-in to The Road to El Dorado) was developed by Revolution Software and released on PlayStation, Game Boy Color, and Microsoft Windows.

===Music===
* The Libertines have a song called &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; on their self-titled second album (2004). It reflects on the story, as two friends—who seem to be at the top—drift away from each other and begin to despise each other, mirroring the bandmates&#x27; turbulent relationship and eventual splitting of the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release. Songwriters Pete Doherty and Carl Barât are known fans of Kipling and his work.

* The third song on Billy Woods’ album &quot;History Will Absolve Me&quot; (2012) takes its title from Kipling’s story. Woods uses Kipling as a colonial intertext in the song, whose speaker narrates the various imperial exploits of Europe (specifically England) in Africa.

==== Greece ====
* In Athens, Ephialtes and Pericles finally get agreement to the ostracism of Kimon, who had become unpopular for his unsuccessful pro-Spartan policy.
* Ephialtes, with the support of Pericles, reduces the power of the Athenian Council of Areopagus (filled with ex-archons and so a stronghold of oligarchy) and transfers them to the people, i.e. the Council of Five Hundred, the Assembly and the popular law courts. The office of Judge is made a paid position and is recruited by lot from a list to which every citizen can have his name added.
* Ephialtes is murdered by Aristodicus of Tanagra in Boeotia, who is said to have acted on behalf of members of the Athenian oligarchy.
* The ostracism of Kimon and the murder of Ephialtes leave Pericles as the most influential orator in Athens.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

* Ephialtes, leader of the radical democrats in Athens (assassinated)

==== Greece ====
* The Persian fleet moves against a rebellious Cyprus to restore order. Kimon, who returns to favour, though not to power, in Athens, plans an expedition to help Cyprus. He gains Pericles&#x27; support.
* An Athenian law sponsored by Pericles is passed giving citizenship only to those born of Athenian parents. This marks an end to the policy where residents who were from other cities could be given an honourable status.
* Hostilities among the Greek states come to a formal end with the agreement to the Five Years&#x27; Truce. Kimon negotiates a five year truce with Sparta, in which Athens agrees to abandon its alliance with Argos, while Sparta promises to give up its alliance with Thebes. During the same year Argos signs the first &quot;Thirty-Years Peace&quot; with Sparta.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Following the report of a three-man commission into the design of Roman law, the patricians set up in Rome a Board of Ten, the Decemviri. The first Decemviri, composed entirely of patricians is led by consuls Appius Claudius Crassus and Titus Genucius Augurinus. The first ten codes of the Roman Law of the Twelve Tables are completed by the first Decemvirate.

==Events==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

===By place===
====Greece====
* Achaea achieves its independence from Athens, while Euboea, crucial to Athenian control of the sea and food supplies, revolts against Athens. Pericles crosses over to Euboea with his troops.
* Megara joins the revolt against Athens. The strategic importance of Megara is immediately demonstrated by the appearance, for the first time in 12 years, of a Spartan army under King Pleistoanax in Attica. The threat from the Spartan army leads Pericles to arrange, by bribery and by negotiation, that Athens will give up its mainland possessions and confine itself to a largely maritime empire.
* The Spartan army retires, so Pericles crosses back to Euboea with 50 ships and 5,000 soldiers, cracking down any opposition. He punishes the landowners of Chalcis, who lose their properties, while the residents of Histiaea are uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers.
* After hearing that the Spartan army had accepted bribes from Pericles, Pleistoanax, the King of Sparta, is impeached by the citizens of Sparta, but flees to exile in Arcadia. His military adviser, Cleandridas also flees and is condemned to death in his absence.

==== Sicily ====
* Ducetius, the Hellenised leader of the Siculi, an ancient people of Sicily, returns from exile in Corinth to Sicily and colonises Cale Acte on the north coast with Greek and Siculi settlers.
* Acragas declares war on Syracuse because of the return of Ducetius and is defeated by Syracuse in the Battle of the Himera River.

==== Roman Republic ====
* In the Battle of Corbione, Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus leads Roman troops to a victory over the Aequi of north-east Latium and the Volsci of southern Latium.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Aristophanes, Greek playwright (approximate year) (d. c. 385 BC)
* Marcus Furius Camillus, Roman soldier and (traditional date) (d. 365 BC)

== Deaths ==
*Cleinias, a close relative of Roman politician and military commander Alcibiades. (approximate year) (b. disputed)

<doc id="72418" wikidata="Q211436" url="?curid=72418" title="Visayas">
<text>The Visayas ( ), or the Visayan Islands (Visayan: &quot;Kabisay-an&quot;, ; Filipino: &quot;Kabisayaan&quot; ), are one of the three principal geographical divisions of the Philippines, along with Luzon and Mindanao. Located in the central part of the archipelago, it consists of several islands, primarily surrounding the Visayan Sea, although the Visayas are also considered the northeast extremity of the entire Sulu Sea. Its inhabitants are predominantly the Visayan peoples.

The major islands of the Visayas are Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte and Samar. The region may also include the provinces of Palawan, Romblon, and Masbate, whose populations identify as Visayan and whose languages are more closely related to other Visayan languages than to the major languages of Luzon.

There are four administrative regions in the Visayas: Western Visayas (pop. 4.73 million), Negros Island Region (pop. 4.76 million), Central Visayas (6.54 million) and Eastern Visayas (4.5 million).

==Etymology==

The exact meaning and origin of the name of the Visayas is unknown. The first documented use of the name is possibly by Song-era Chinese maritime official Zhao Rugua as the &quot;Pi-sho-ye&quot;, who raided the coasts of Fujian and Penghu during the late 12th century using iron javelins attached to ropes as their weapons.

Visayans were first referred to by the general term &quot;Pintados&quot; (&quot;the painted ones&quot;) by the Spanish, in reference to the prominent practice of full-body tattooing (batok). The word &quot;Bisaya&quot;, on the other hand, was first documented in Spanish sources in reference to the non-Ati inhabitants of the island of Panay. However, it is likely that the name was already used as a general endonym by Visayans long before Spanish colonization, as evidenced by at least once instance of a place named &quot;Bisaya&quot; in coastal eastern Mindanao as reported by the Loaisa (c.1526), Saavedra (c.1528), and the Villalobos (c.1543) expeditions. It is likely that the reason the Spanish did not use the term generally until the later decades of the 1500s is due to the fact that people were more likely to identify themselves with more specific ethnic names like &quot;Sugbuanon&quot;.

In &quot;Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas&quot; (1609) by Antonio de Morga, he specifies that the name &quot;Biçaya&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Pintados&quot;.
===Speculations===
From the 1950s to 1960s there were spurious claims by various authors that &quot;Bisaya&quot; is derived from the historical empire of &quot;Sri Vijaya&quot; which came from the Sanskrit term &quot;Śrīvijaya&quot; (श्रीविजय), arguing that the Visayans were either settlers from Sri Vijaya or were subjects of it. This claim is largely based only on the resemblance of the word &quot;Bisaya&quot; to &quot;Vijaya&quot;. But as the linguist Eugene Verstraelen pointed out, &quot;Vijaya&quot; would evolve into &quot;Bidaya&quot; or &quot;Biraya&quot;, not &quot;Bisaya&quot;, based on how other Sanskrit-derived loanwords become integrated into Philippine languages.

The name has also been hypothesized to be related to the Bisaya ethnic group of Borneo, the latter incidentally recounted in the controversial &quot;Maragtas&quot; epic as the alleged origins of the ancestral settlers in Panay. However historical, archeological, and linguistic evidence for this are still paltry. The languages of the Bisaya of Borneo and of the Bisaya of the Philippines do not show any special correlation, apart from the fact that they all belong to the same Austronesian family. Similarly there are claims that it was the name of a folk hero (allegedly &quot;Sri Visaya&quot;) or that it originated from the exclamation &quot;Bisai-yah!&quot; (&quot;How beautiful!&quot;) by the Sultan of Brunei who was visiting Visayas for the first time. All these claims have been challenged and remain as mere speculations and folk etymologies.

==History==

After the defeat of the Magellan expedition at the Battle of Mactan by Lapu-Lapu, King Philip II of Spain sent Miguel López de Legazpi in 1543 and 1565 to colonize the islands for Spain. Subsequently, the Visayas region and many kingdoms began converting to Christianity and adopting western culture. By the 18th and 19th centuries, the effects of colonization on various ethnic groups turned sour and revolutions such as those of Francisco Dagohoy began to emerge.
Various personalities who fought against the Spanish colonial government arose within the archipelago. Among the notable ones are Teresa Magbanua, Graciano Lopez Jaena and Martin Delgado from Iloilo, Aniceto Lacson, León Kilat and Diego de la Viña from Negros, Venancio Jakosalem Fernandez from Cebu, and two personalities from Bohol by the name of Tamblot, who led the Tamblot Uprising in 1621 to 1622 and Francisco Dagohoy, the leader of the Bohol Rebellion that lasted from 1744 to 1829. Negros briefly stood as an independent nation in the Visayas in the form of the Cantonal Republic of Negros, before it was absorbed back to the Philippines because of the American takeover of the archipelago.

The short-lived Federal State of the Visayas was established as a revolutionary state during the Philippine Revolution. It designated Iloilo City as the Visayas capital and was composed of three governments: the Provisional Government of the District of Visayas (Panay), the Cantonal Government of Negros, the Cantonal Government of Bohol, and the island of Cebu, which was under revolutionary control.

On May 23, 2005, Palawan (including its highly urbanized capital city of Puerto Princesa) was transferred from Mimaropa (Region IV-B) to Western Visayas (Region VI) under &quot;Executive Order No. 429&quot;, signed by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was the president at that year. However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa and all Palawan municipalities but one, preferring to stay in Mimaropa (Region IV-B). Consequently, &quot;Administrative Order No. 129&quot; was issued on August 19, 2005, that the implementation of &quot;E.O. 429&quot; be held in abeyance, pending approval by the president of its Implementation Plan. The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results. , the abeyance was still in effect, with Palawan and its capital city remaining under Mimaropa (Region IV-B).

On May 29, 2015, the twin provinces of Negros Occidental (including its highly urbanized capital city, Bacolod) and Negros Oriental were joined to form the Negros Island Region under &quot;Executive Order No. 183&quot;, signed by President Benigno Aquino III. It separated both, the former province and its capital city from Western Visayas and the latter province from Central Visayas.

On August 9, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed &quot;Executive Order No. 38&quot;, revoking the &quot;Executive Order No. 183&quot; signed by his predecessor, President Benigno Aquino III, on May 29, 2015, due to the reason of the lack of funds to fully establish the NIR according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management.

On June 13, 2024, the Negros Island Region was re-established, with the inclusion of Siquijor.

===Mythical allusions and hypotheses===
Historical documents written in 1907 by Visayan historian Pedro Alcántara Monteclaro in his book &quot;Maragtas&quot; tell the story of the ten leaders (Datus) who escaped from the tyranny of Rajah Makatunaw from Borneo and came to the islands of Panay. The chiefs and followers were said to be the ancestors (from the collapsing empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit) of the Visayan people. The documents were accepted by Filipino historians and found their way into the history of the Philippines. As a result, the arrival of Bornean tribal groups in the Visayas (From Vijayapura a Srivijayan vassal state in Borneo) is celebrated in the festivals of the Dinagyang in Iloilo City, Ati-Atihan in Kalibo, Aklan, and Binirayan in San Jose de Buenavista, Antique. Foreign historians such as William Henry Scott maintains that the book contains a Visayan folk tradition.A contemporary theory based on a study of genetic markers in present-day populations is that Austronesian peoples from Taiwan populated the larger island of Luzon and headed south to the Visayas and Mindanao, and then to Indonesia and Malaysia, then to Pacific Islands and finally to the island of Madagascar, at the west of the Indian Ocean. The study, though, may not explain inter-island migrations, which are also possible, such as Filipinos migrating to any other Philippine provinces. There has even been backmigration to the island of Taiwan, as the historian Efren B. Isorena, through analysis of historical accounts and wind currents in the Pacific side of East and Southeast Asia, concluded that the Pisheye of Taiwan and the Bisaya of the Visayas islands in the Philippines, were closely related people as Visayans were recorded to have travelled to Taiwan from the Philippines via the northward windcurrents before they raided China and returned south after the southwards monsoon during summer.

== Culture and festivals ==

Visayans are recognized as hospitable, religious, fun, and robust people. They love to party and celebrate birthdays, graduation, baptism, weddings, and holidays. Visayans like to sing (Karaoke) while drinking and dancing during this celebration. They love to cook traditional foods like Suman, Sapin- Sapin, and Bibingka made with sticky rice during Halloween. They visited their dead loved ones at the cemetery. Aside from celebrations, Visayas has sweet and delicious mangoes that you can find in Guimaras near Iloilo City. White Beach Resort is called Boracay. It is a well-known beautiful beach located in Western Visayas at Caticlan Province. Many foreign people love to visit this beach, which is full of fun summer activities and beachside restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops. You can also find the Seafood Capital of the Philippines, located at Roxas, City Province of Capiz. You can taste fresh seafood daily, like shrimp, crabs, prawns, seashells, and fish.

Visayans honor their traditions and culture by celebrating festivals as they are known to be Roman Catholic or Christianity in religion. These festivals are celebrated in tribute to their saints, to share peace and happiness, to give thanks for the abundant harvest, and to advertise their products. Visayans are known for their different festivals celebrated in other cities of Visayan Island.

Sinulog Festival is celebrated every third Sunday in January in Cebu City. This festival is a tribute to their saint, Senior Santo Nino de Cebu. The Sinulog festival includes parades, fluvial processions, dances, Cebu beauty pageants, and sometimes arts contests. Some other parts of Cebu provinces participated in the celebration by performing traditional dances and decorating a float, or Higantes, to represent their patron.Ati-Atihan Festival is celebrated every third Sunday in January, like Sinulog Festival. It is held in Kalibo, Aklan, on Panay Island, where the first indigenous people settled, called Aestas, or Ati&#x27;s. This festival devotes to the mystery of baby Jesus and Indigenous people. The people who participated painted their bodies and face and wore indigenous costumes and props. This festival plays music, drums, and parades for several days.

Dinagyang Festival is celebrated in Iloilo City on the fourth Sunday of January.  This festival marked the baby Jesus Senior Sto. Nino. At Ati-Atihan Festival in Aklan, Dinagyang also has Ati&#x27;s dancing to celebrate the entry of Malay in Panay Island, colorful costumes, and a Pageant for Miss Iloilo; Sadsad is a procession with a decorated float. Schools and businesses in Barangays in this city participate in dancing competitions at this festival.

==Administrative divisions==

Administratively, the Visayas is divided into 4 regions, namely Western Visayas, Negros Island Region, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas.

The Visayas is composed of 16 provinces, each headed by a Governor. A governor is elected by popular vote and can serve a maximum of three terms consisting of three years each.

===Western Visayas (Region VI)===
Western Visayas consists of the islands of Panay and Guimaras. The regional center is Iloilo City. Its provinces are:
* Aklan
* Antique
* Capiz
* Guimaras
* Iloilo

=== Negros Island Region (NIR) ===
Negros Island Region consists of the islands of Negros and Siquijor. The interim regional centers are Bacolod and Dumaguete. Its provinces are:

* Negros Occidental
* Negros Oriental
* Siquijor

===Central Visayas (Region VII)===
Central Visayas includes the islands of Cebu and Bohol. The regional center is Cebu City. Its provinces are:
* Bohol
* Cebu

===Eastern Visayas (Region VIII)===
Eastern Visayas consists of the islands of Leyte, Samar and Biliran. The regional center is Tacloban City. Its provinces are:
* Biliran
* Leyte
* Southern Leyte
* Eastern Samar
* Northern Samar
* Samar

Scholars have argued that the region of Mimaropa and the province of Masbate are all part of the Visayas in line with the non-centric view. This is contested by a few politicians in line with the Manila-centric view.

==Demographics==
===Languages===

Languages spoken at home are primarily Visayan languages despite the usual misconception that these are dialects of a single macrolanguage. Cebuano is the largest native language spoken on Visayas Island, where approximately 20 million natives speak it. Major languages include Hiligaynon or Ilonggo in Western Visayas, Cebuano in Central Visayas, and Waray in Eastern Visayas. Other dominant languages are Aklanon, Kinaray-a, and Capiznon. Filipino, the &#x27;national language&#x27; based on Tagalog, is widely understood but occasionally used. English, another official language, is more widely known and is preferred as the second language most especially among urbanized Visayans. For instance, English rather than Tagalog is frequently used in schools, public signs, and mass media.

==&quot;Cebuano&quot; versus &quot;Bisaya&quot;==

There has been ongoing contention regarding the use of the word Bisaya among speakers of Visayan languages. The term &quot;Bisaya&quot; broadly refers to the people of the Visayas region in the Philippines, as well as those who have migrated to other parts of the country, including Luzon and Mindanao. The Visayas region encompasses several ethnolinguistic groups and languages, including Hiligaynon, Cebuano, Waray, and others, which are distinct and not mutually intelligible, despite belonging to the same language family.

Over the years, &quot;Bisaya&quot; has often been used interchangeably with Cebuano in many parts of the country, though this practice is context-dependent and varies across regions. Cebuano-speaking settlers in Mindanao and other areas outside Cebu frequently refer to themselves and their language as Bisaya to distinguish themselves from the people of Cebu and their dialect. To address this ambiguity, some propose using the term Sinugbuanong Binisaya (which has been the term used in basic education) to specify Cebuano, while others suggest Binisaya as a broader term. Surveys, such as those conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), often separate Bisaya and Cebuano, despite the two being mutually intelligible. Ethnologue, however, only lists Cebuano as a language. In Western Visayas, &quot;Bisaya&quot; may refer to Hiligaynon or Kinaray-a speakers, whereas in Eastern Visayas, it may denote Waray speakers.

In Mindanao, migrant ethnic groups from Luzon and indigenous peoples have assimilated into predominantly Cebuano-speaking societies (or Hiligaynon-speaking communities in the case of Soccsksargen) over the years. Many of these individuals now identify as Visayans after learning Cebuano, though they often retain knowledge of their non-Visayan roots and may still speak their ancestral languages fluently as a second or third language.

<text>Edremit is a municipality and district of Balıkesir Province, Turkey. Its area is 682 km2, and its population is 167,901 (2022).

It is situated at the tip of the gulf with the same name (Gulf of Edremit), with its town centre a few kilometres inland, and is an important centre of trade, along with the other towns that are situated on the same gulf (namely Ayvalık, Gömeç, Burhaniye and Havran). It is also one of the largest district centres of Balıkesir Province. The district of Edremit, especially around Kazdağı, is largely covered with forests. The mayor of Edremit municipality is Selman Hasan Arslan.

== History ==

The modern city of Edremit is named after the ancient Greek city of Adramyttion () or Adramytteion (Ἀδραμύττειον), a city of Asia Minor on the coast of Aeolis which is in near city Modern Burhaniye

Tahtacı Turkmen, descendants of the army of Shah Ismail I, settled in the mountains near Edremit after their defeat in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.

By 1819, Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn recorded that Edremit was only populated by &quot;a few Greek fishermen&quot;. In 1912, the town had 6200 inhabitants, 1200 of which were Greeks. At this time, the district had 19 Greek schools and roughly 600 pupils.

In May 1914, thousands of Muslim refugees who had fled from the Balkans arrived in the town of Edremit and proceeded to ransack the shops and homes of the town&#x27;s Greek community. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, the Ottoman government armed and organised the refugees. Many Greek refugees found refuge in the town church before fleeing to the harbour where they were then granted passage to the nearby Greek island of Lesbos. Turks continued to massacre or expel Greeks in the following months in surrounding villages as part of the wider Greek genocide throughout Turkey.

Amidst the Greek Summer Offensive of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, Edremit was seized by the Army of Asia Minor on 19 June 1920 and a Turkish Nationalist counterattack near the town was repelled. It remained under Greek control until their withdrawal in late August 1922, following which all remaining Greeks fled or were killed by the Turkish army.

==Climate==

== Economy ==
Edremit&#x27;s economy relies largely on the production of olives, as well as on tourism. Edremit is known as the olive capital of Turkey. Kaz Dağı National Park, extending around the ancient Mount Ida (mentioned in Homer&#x27;s epic poems such as the Iliad), is situated within the boundaries of Edremit district and is an important tourist attraction with its natural scenery and a number of picturesque small villages around it.

== Demographics ==
In ethno-cultural terms, the population of Edremit is a mixture of Balkan Turks and Balkan Albanians, descendants of immigrants from Balkans, Aegean Islands, some Circassians, as well as Tahtacı Turkmens, who pursue their own traditions and life-style to this day. A private museum of ethnography in the village of Tahtakuşlar is one of the rare institutions in Turkey focusing on Tahtacı culture.

<text>Year 429 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tricipitinus and Fidenas (or, less frequently, year 325 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 429 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* The Athenians under Xenophon march into Thrace to attack Chalcis. They destroy crops outside Spartolus and begin negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcis, but the anti-Athenian factions ask for help from Olynthus. An army from Chalcis, Spartolus, and Olynthus meet the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites are defeated. Reinforcements soon arrive from Olynthus, and they launch a second attack on the Athenians. The Athenians are routed, with all of their generals and 430 other men killed.
* The Athenian admiral Phormio has two naval victories, the Naupactus and the Battle of Rhium at the mouth of the Corinthian Gulf. In the first battle, his 20 ships defeat 47 Corinthian ships commanded by Machaon, Isocrates, and Agatharchidas that were advancing to reinforce the Spartan general, Cnemus&#x27;s campaign in Acarnania. In the second battle, Phormio routs Cnemus&#x27;s 77-vessel fleet.
* The Athenians, in alliance with Polichne, destroy the Cretan city of Kydonia.
* The Macedonian king, Perdiccas II, once again betrays the Athenians and sends 1000 troops to support a Spartan assault on Acarnania but they arrive too late to help. In response to this, King Sitalkes of Thrace invades Macedonia with a vast army that includes independent Thracian tribes (such as the Dii) and Paionian tribes (Agrianes and Laeaeans). His progress is slowed when the promised support from Athens fails to materialise. So Perdiccas once again uses diplomacy to ensure the survival of Macedonia. He promises the hand of his sister in marriage to the nephew of Sitalkes, who then persuades Sitalkes to leave Macedonia.
* The plague in Athens that is killing thousands of the city&#x27;s inhabitants, claims Pericles. Cleon, who has headed the opposition to Pericles&#x27;s rule, succeeds to power in Athens following Pericles&#x27;s death.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Ateas, king of Scythia (d. 339 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Pericles, Athenian (epidemic) (born 495 BC)

<doc id="72423" wikidata="Q204735" url="?curid=72423" title="Jules Dumont d'Urville">
<text>Jules Sébastien César Dumont d&#x27;Urville (; 23 May 1790 – 8 May 1842) was a French explorer and naval officer who explored the south and western Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica. As a botanist and cartographer, he gave his name to several seaweeds, plants and shrubs and to places such as d&#x27;Urville Island in New Zealand.

==Childhood==

Dumont was born at Condé-sur-Noireau in Lower Normandy. His father, Gabriel Charles François Dumont, sieur d&#x27;Urville (1728–1796), Bailiff of Condé-sur-Noireau, was, like his ancestors, responsible to the court of Condé.

His mother Jeanne Françoise Victoire Julie (1754–1832) came from Croisilles, Calvados, and was a rigid and formal woman from an ancient family of the rural nobility of Lower Normandy. The child was weak and often sickly.

After the death of his father when he was six, his mother&#x27;s brother, the Abbot of Croisilles, played the part of his father and from 1798 took charge of his education. The Abbot taught him Latin, Greek, rhetoric and philosophy. From 1804 Dumont studied at the &quot;lycée Impérial&quot; in Caen.

In the library of Caen, he read the Encyclopédistes and the reports of travel of Bougainville, Cook and Anson, and he became passionate about these matters.

At the age of 17 years he failed the physical tests of the entrance exam to the École polytechnique and he therefore decided to enlist in the navy.

==Early years in the Navy==

In 1807, Dumont was admitted to the École navale at Brest where he presented himself as a timid young man, very serious and studious, little interested in amusements and much more interested in studies than in military matters. In 1808, he obtained the grade of first-class candidate.

At the time the neglected French navy was of a much lower quality than Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée, and its ships were blockaded in their ports by the absolute domination of the British Royal Navy. Dumont was confined to land like his colleagues and spent the first years in the navy studying foreign languages.

In 1812, after having been promoted to ensign and finding himself bored with port life and disapproving of the dissolute behaviour of the other young officers, he asked to be transferred to Toulon on board the &quot;Suffren&quot;; but this ship was also blockaded in port.

During this period, Dumont built on his already substantial cultural knowledge. He already spoke, in addition to Latin and Greek, English, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese and Hebrew. During his later travels in the Pacific, thanks to his prodigious memory, he would acquire some knowledge of an immense number of dialects of Polynesia and Melanesia. Meanwhile, ashore at Toulon, he learnt about botany and entomology in long excursions in the hills of Provence and he studied in the nearby naval observatory.

Finally in 1814, when Napoleon had been exiled to Elba, Dumont undertook his first short navigation of the Mediterranean Sea. In 1815, he married Adèle Pépin, daughter of a clockmaker from Toulon. who was openly disliked by Dumont&#x27;s mother, who thought her inappropriate for her son and refused to meet her.

==In the Aegean Sea==
In 1819, Dumont d&#x27;Urville sailed on board &quot;Chevrette&quot;, under the command of Captain Gauttier-Duparc, to carry out a hydrographic survey of the islands of the Greek archipelago. During a pause near the island of Milos, the local French representative brought to Dumont&#x27;s attention the rediscovery of a marble statue a few days before (8 April 1820) by a local peasant. The statue, now known as the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, dates from around the year 130 BC.

Dumont recognised its value and would have acquired it immediately, but the ship&#x27;s commander pointed out that there was not enough space on board for an object of its size. Moreover, the expedition was likely to proceed through stormy seas that could damage it. Dumont then wrote to the French ambassador to Constantinople about its discovery. &quot;Chevrette&quot; arrived in Constantinople on 22 April and Dumont succeeded in convincing the ambassador to acquire the statue.

Meanwhile, the peasant had sold the statue to a priest, Macario Verghis, who wished to present it as a gift to an interpreter for the Sultan in Constantinople. The French ambassador&#x27;s representative arrived just as the statue was being loaded aboard a ship bound for Constantinople and persuaded the island&#x27;s primates (chief citizens) to annul the sale and honour the first offer. This earned Dumont the title of &quot;Chevalier&quot; (knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, the attention of the French Academy of Sciences and promotion to lieutenant; and France gained a new, magnificent statue for the Louvre in Paris.

==Voyage of &quot;Coquille&quot;==
On his return from the voyage of &quot;Chevrette&quot;, Dumont was sent to the naval archive, where he encountered Lieutenant Louis-Isidore Duperrey, a past acquaintance. The two began to plan an expedition of exploration in the Pacific, an area out of which France had been forced during the Napoleonic Wars. France considered it might be able to regain some of its losses by taking over part of New South Wales. On 11 August 1822, the ship &quot;Coquille&quot; sailed from Toulon with the objective of collecting as much scientific and strategic information as possible on the area to which it was dispatched. Duperrey was named Commander of the expedition because he was four years older than Dumont. Dumont discovered the Adélie penguin, which is named after his wife.

René-Primevère Lesson travelled on &quot;Coquille&quot; as a naval doctor and naturalist. On the return to France in March 1825, Lesson and Dumont brought an imposing collection of animals and plants collected on the Falkland Islands, on the coasts of Chile and Peru, in the archipelagos of the Pacific and New Zealand, New Guinea, and Australia. Dumont was now 35 and in poor health. On board &quot;Coquille&quot;, he had behaved as a competent official, but disinclined to military discipline and subordination. On the return to France, Duperrey and Dumont were promoted to commander.

===Collection===
On &quot;Coquille&quot;, Dumont tried to reconcile his responsibilities as second in command with his need to carry out scientific work. He was in charge of carrying out research in the fields of botany and entomology. &quot;La Coquille&quot; brought back to France specimens of more than 3,000 species of plants, 400 of which were previously unknown, enriching moreover the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in Paris with more than 1,200 specimens of insects, covering 1,100 insect species (including 300 previously unknown species). The scientists Georges Cuvier and François Arago analysed the results of his searches and praised Dumont.

As a botanist and cartographer, Dumont d&#x27;Urville left his mark on New Zealand. He gave his name to the genus of seaweeds &quot;Durvillaea&quot;, which includes southern bull-kelp; the seaweed &quot;Grateloupia urvilleana&quot;; the species of grass tree &quot;Dracophyllum urvilleanum&quot;; the shrub &quot;Hebe urvilleana&quot; and the buttercup &quot;Ranunculus urvilleanus&quot;.

==First voyage of &quot;Astrolabe&quot;==

Two months after Dumont d&#x27;Urville returned on &quot;La Coquille&quot;, he presented to the Navy Ministry a plan for a new expedition, which he hoped to command, as his relationship with Duperrey had deteriorated. The proposal was accepted and &quot;La Coquille&quot; was renamed the in honour of one of the ships of La Pérouse, and sailed from Toulon on 22 April 1826, towards the Pacific Ocean, for a circumnavigation of the world that was destined to last nearly three years.

The new &quot;Astrolabe&quot; skirted the coast of southern Australia, carried out new relief maps of the South Island of New Zealand, including improved surveys of the Marlborough Sounds in which he navigated through the narrow and treacherous French Pass and mapped d&#x27;Urville Island, which James Cook had mapped as being part of the mainland.
&quot;Astrolabe&quot; sailed up the east coast of the North Island, creating comprehensive coastline maps of New Zealand. The ship spent six days in the Bay of Islands taking on food and water before sailing for Tonga.

&quot;Astrolabe&quot; visited Fiji, then Dumont executed the first relief maps of the Loyalty Islands (part of French New Caledonia) and explored the coasts of New Guinea. He identified the site of La Pérouse&#x27;s shipwreck in Vanikoro (one of the Santa Cruz Islands, part of the archipelago of the Solomon Islands) and collected numerous remains of his boats. The voyage continued with the mapping of part of the Caroline Islands and the Moluccas. &quot;Astrolabe&quot; returned to Marseille on 25 March 1829, with an impressive load of hydrographical papers and collections of zoological, botanical and mineralogical reports, which were destined to strongly influence the scientific analysis of those regions. Following this expedition, he invented the terms Malaisia, &quot;Micronesia&quot; and &quot;Melanesia&quot;, distinguishing these Pacific cultures and island groups from Polynesia.
Dumont&#x27;s health was by now weakened by years of a poor diet.
He suffered from kidney and stomach problems and from intense attacks of gout. During the first thirteen years of their marriage, half of which passed far apart, Adélie and Jules had two sons. The first one died at a young age while his father was aboard &quot;La Coquille&quot; and the second, also called Jules, on the return of his father after four years away.

Dumont d&#x27;Urville passed a short period with his family before returning to Paris, where he was promoted to captain and he was put in charge of writing the report of his travels. The five volumes were published at the expense of the French government between 1832 and 1834. During these years d&#x27;Urville, who was already a poor diplomat, became more irascible and rancorous as a result of his gout, and lost the sympathy of the naval leadership. In his report, he criticised harshly the military structures, his colleagues, the French Academy of Sciences and even the King – none of whom, in his opinion, had given the voyage of &quot;Astrolabe&quot; due acknowledgment.

In 1835, Dumont was directed to return to Toulon to engage in &quot;down to earth&quot; work and spent two years, marked by mournful events (notably the loss of a daughter from cholera) and happy events (notably the birth of another son, Émile) but with the constant and nearly obsessive thought of a third expedition to the Pacific, analogous to James Cook&#x27;s third voyage. He looked again at &quot;Astrolabe&quot;″s travel notes, and found a gap in the exploration of Oceania and, in January 1837, he wrote to the Navy Ministry suggesting the opportunity for a new expedition to the Pacific.

==Second voyage of &quot;Astrolabe&quot;==

King Louis Philippe approved the plan, but he ordered that the expedition aim for the South Magnetic Pole and to claim it for France; if that was not possible, Dumont&#x27;s expedition was asked to equal the most southerly latitude of 74°34&#x27;S achieved in 1823 by James Weddell. Thus France became part of the international competition for polar exploration, along with the United States and the United Kingdom.
Dumont was initially unhappy with the modifications made to his proposal. He had little interest in polar exploration and preferred tropical routes. But soon his vanity took over and he saw the opportunity for achieving a prestigious objective. The two ships, &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Zélée&quot; were prepared for the voyage at Toulon. The Astrolabe was commanded by Dumont d&#x27;Urville, and Gaston de Roquemaurel as second, and La Zélée by Charles Hector Jacquinot. In the course of the preparation Dumont also went to London to acquire documentation and instrumentation, meeting the British Admiralty&#x27;s oceanographer, Francis Beaufort and the President of the Royal Geographical Society, John Washington, both strong supporters of the British expeditions to the South Pole.

===First contact with Antarctica===

&quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Zélée&quot; sailed from Toulon on 7 September 1837, after three weeks of delay compared to Dumont&#x27;s plans. His objectives were to reach the most southerly point possible at this time in the Weddell Sea; to pass through the Strait of Magellan; to travel up the coast of Chile in order to head for Oceania with the objective of inspecting the new British colonies in Western Australia; to sail to Hobart; and to sail to New Zealand to find opportunities for French whalers and to examine places where a penal colony might be established. After passing through the East Indies, the mission would have to round the Cape of Good Hope and return to France.

Early in the voyage, part of the crew was involved in a drunken brawl and arrested in Tenerife. A short pause was made in Rio de Janeiro to disembark a sick official. During the first part of the voyage there were also problems of provisioning, particularly rotten meat, which affected the health of the crew. At the end of November, the ships reached the Strait of Magellan. Dumont thought there was sufficient time to explore the strait for three weeks, taking into account the precise maps drawn by Phillip Parker King in between 1826 and 1830, before heading south again.

In the Strait of Magellan Dummont surveyed the coast trying to find out the ruins of Ciudad Rey Don Felipe, a city founded in 1584 as part of a failed Spanish colonization attempt to control the passage through the strait. An expedition report recommended that a French colony be established at the strait to support future traffic along the route. The strait was eventually settled by Chile in 1843.

Two weeks after seeing their first iceberg, &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Zélée&quot; found themselves entangled again in a mass of ice on 1 January 1838. The same night the pack ice prevented the ships from continuing to the south. In the next two months Dumont led increasingly desperate attempts to find a passage through the ice so that he could reach the desired latitude. For a while the ships managed to keep to an ice-free channel, but shortly afterwards they became trapped again, after a wind change. Five days of continuous work were necessary in order to open a corridor in the pack ice to free them.

After reaching the South Orkney Islands, the expedition headed directly to the South Shetland Islands and the Bransfield Strait separating them from Antarctica. In spite of thick fog they located some land only sketched on the maps, which Dumont named &quot;Terre de Louis-Philippe&quot; (now called Graham Land), the Joinville Island group and &quot;Rosamel Island&quot; (now called Andersson Island). Conditions on board had rapidly deteriorated: most of the crew had obvious symptoms of scurvy and the main decks were covered by smoke from the ships&#x27; fires and bad smells and became unbearable. At the end of February 1838, Dumont accepted that he was not able to continue further south, and he continued to doubt the actual latitude reached by Weddell. He therefore directed the two ships towards Talcahuano, in Chile, where he established a temporary hospital for the crew members affected by scurvy.

===Pacific===
During months of exploration in the Pacific, the ship visited many islands in Polynesia. On their arrival in the Marquesas Islands, the crews found ways &quot;to socialise&quot; with the islanders. Dumont&#x27;s moral conduct was irreproachable, but he provided a highly summarised description of some incidents of their stay in Nuku Hiva in his reports. During the voyage from the East Indies to Tasmania some of the crew were lost to tropical fevers and dysentery (14 men and 3 officials); but for Dumont the worst moment during the expedition was at Valparaíso, where he received a letter from his wife that informed him of the death of his second son from cholera. Adélie&#x27;s sorrowful demand that he return home coincided with a deterioration in his health: Dumont was more and more often hit by attacks of gout and stomach pains.

On 12 December 1839 the two corvettes landed at Hobart, where the sick and the dying were treated. Dumont was received by John Franklin, Governor of Tasmania and an Arctic explorer who later perished on the infamous Franklin Expedition, from whom he learned that the ships of the American expedition led by Charles Wilkes were berthed in Sydney waiting to sail south.

Seeing the consistent reduction of the crews, decimated by misfortunes, Dumont expressed his intention to leave this time for the Antarctic with &quot;Astrolabe&quot; only, in order to attempt to reach the South Magnetic Pole around longitude 140°. A deeply wounded Captain Jacquinot urged the hiring of a number of replacements (generally deserters from a French whaler anchored in Hobart) and convinced him to reconsider his intentions; &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Zelée&quot; both left Hobart on 1 January 1840. Dumont&#x27;s plan was very simple: to head south, wind conditions permitting.

===Turning south===

The first days of the voyage mainly involved the crossing of twenty degrees and a westerly current; on board there were further misfortunes, including the loss of a man. Crossing the 50°S parallel, they experienced unexpected falls in the air and water temperatures. After completing the crossing of the Antarctic Convergence, on 16 January 1840, at 60°S they sighted the first iceberg and two days later the ships found themselves in the middle of a mass of ice. On 20 January the expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle, with celebrations similar to crossing of the Equator ceremonies, and they sighted land the same afternoon.

The two ships slowly sailed to the West, skirting walls of ice, and on 22 January, just before 9 in the evening, some members of the crew disembarked on the north-westernmost and highest islet of the rocky group of Dumoulin Islands, at 500–600 m from the icy coast of the Astrolabe Glacier Tongue of the time, today about 4 km north from the glacier extremity near Cape Géodésie, and hoisted the French tricolour. Dumont named the archipelago Pointe Géologie and the land beyond, Terre Adélie The map of the coast drawn under sail by the hydrographer is remarkably accurate given the means of the time.

In the following days the expedition followed the coast westward then led for the first time some experiments to determine the approximate position of the South magnetic pole. They sighted the American schooner &quot;Porpoise&quot; of the United States Exploring Expedition commanded by Charles Wilkes on 30 January 1840, but failed to communicate due to a misunderstanding. On 1 February, Dumont decided to turn to the north heading for Hobart, which the two ships reached 17 days later. They were present for the arrival of the two ships of James Ross&#x27;s expedition to Antarctica, HMS &quot;Terror&quot; and HMS &quot;Erebus&quot;.

On 25 February, the schooners sailed towards the Auckland Islands, where they carried out magnetic measurements and they left a commemorative plate of their visit (as had the commander of &quot;Porpoise&quot; previously), in which they announced the discovery of the South Magnetic Pole. They returned via New Zealand, the Torres Strait, Timor, Réunion, Saint Helena and finally Toulon, returning on 6 November 1840, the last French expedition of exploration to sail.

===Return to France===
On his return Dumont d&#x27;Urville was promoted to rear admiral and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Société de Géographie (Geographical Society of Paris), later becoming its president. He then took over the writing of the report of the expedition, &quot;Voyage au pôle Sud et dans l&#x27;Océanie sur les corvettes l&#x27;Astrolabe et la Zélée 1837–1840&quot;, which was published between 1841 and 1854 in 24 volumes, plus seven more volumes with illustrations and maps.

==Death and legacy==
On 8 May 1842, Dumont and his family boarded a train from Versailles to Paris after seeing water games celebrating the king. Near Meudon the train&#x27;s locomotive derailed, the wagons rolled and the tender&#x27;s coal ended up on the front of the train and caught fire. Dumont&#x27;s whole family died in the flames of the first French railway disaster, generally known as the Versailles rail accident. Dumont&#x27;s remains were identified by Pierre-Marie Alexandre Dumoutier, a doctor on board the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and a phrenologist.

Dumont was buried in the cemetery of Montparnasse in Paris. This tragedy led to the end of the practice in France of locking passengers in their train compartments.

He is the author of &quot;The New Zealanders: A story of Austral lands&quot; – likely to be the first novel written about fictional Maori characters. Later, in honour of his many valuable chartings, the D&#x27;Urville Sea off Antarctica; D&#x27;Urville Island in the Joinville Island group in Antarctica; D&#x27;Urville Wall on the David Glacier in Antarctica, Cape d&#x27;Urville, Irian Jaya, Indonesia; Mount D&#x27;Urville, Auckland Island; and D&#x27;Urville Island in New Zealand were named after him. The Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station on Antarctica is also named after him, as is the Rue Dumont d&#x27;Urville, a street near the Champs-Élysées in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, and the Lycée Dumont D&#x27;Urville in Caen.

Dumont d&#x27;Urville himself named Pepin Island in New Zealand and Adélie Land in Antarctica after his wife, and Croisilles Harbour for his mother&#x27;s family. 

A French naval transport ship employed in French Polynesia is named after him; as was a 1931 sloop which served in World War II.

<text>Year 424 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Crassus, Fidenas, Rutilus and Iullus (or, less frequently, year 330 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 424 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian empire ====
* Xerxes II rules as King of Persia for only about 45 days until he is killed. He is reportedly murdered, while drunk, by Pharnacyas and Menostanes on the orders of Sogdianus, the son of one of Artaxerxes I&#x27;s concubines, Alogyne of Babylon.

==== Greece ====
* At the Congress of Gela, the statesman Hermocrates of Syracuse persuades the cities of Sicily to agree to make peace and urges the exclusion of foreign powers. As a result, the three-year war between his city and Sicily&#x27;s pro-Athenian town ends and the Athenian forces, which had been sent to Sicily to support Greek settlements, are forced to withdraw.
* Demosthenes and Hippocrates attempt to capture Megara, but they are defeated by the Spartans under their general Brasidas. Demosthenes then marches to Naupactus to assist in a democratic revolution, and to gather troops for an invasion of Boeotia. However, Demosthenes and Hippocrates are unable to coordinate their attacks and Hippocrates is defeated at the Battle of Delium by Pagondas of Thebes. During the battle, Socrates is said to have saved the life of Alcibiades. Demosthenes attacks Sicyon and is defeated as well.
* After he frustrates the Athenian attack on Megara, Brasidas marches through Boeotia and Thessaly to Chalcidice at the head of 700 helots and 1000 Peloponnesian mercenaries to join the Macedonian king Perdiccas II. Refusing to be made a tool for the furtherance of Perdiccas&#x27; ambitions, Brasidas wins over the important cities of Acanthus, Stagirus, Amphipolis, and Torone as well as several minor towns. An attack on Eion is foiled by the arrival of Thucydides at the head of an Athenian squadron.
* Brasidas&#x27; capture of the city of Amphipolis is a major reverse for Athens, for which the Athenian general (and future historian) Thucydides is held responsible and banished. This gives Thucydides the opportunity for undistracted study for his &quot;History&quot; and travel and wider contacts, especially on the Peloponnesian side (Sparta and its allies).
* Nicias captures the Peloponnesian island of Cythera, from which to harry the Spartans.
* Aristophanes produces the comedy, &quot;Knights&quot;

=== By topic ===

==== Architecture ====
* The temple to Athena Nike (also known as the Wingless Victory) on the Athenian Acropolis is completed. It has been designed by the Athenian architect Callicrates.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Literature ====
Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;Knights&quot; was first produced in the late winter of 424 B.C. at the Lenaean Dionysia and took first prize, defeating Cratinus, who came in second with Satyrs.( From: Roche, Paul. “Aristophanes: The Complete Plays.” The New American Library)

== Births ==

424/423 BC - estimated birth of Plato, a famous philosopher.

== Deaths ==
* The Achaemenid king Artaxerxes I and his wife Damaspia
* Xerxes II, King of Persia.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* Artaxerxes I, Achaemenid king of Persia, is succeeded by his son Xerxes II. 

==== Greece ====
* Aristophanes produces the comedy, Archanians.
* Demosthenes captures and fortifies the port of Pylos in the Peloponnesus, giving Athens a strong base close to Sparta. Meanwhile, a Spartan army, commanded by Brasidas, lands on the nearby island of Sphacteria, but is repulsed by the Athenians. An Athenian fleet summoned by Demosthenes bottles up the Spartan navy in Navarino Bay.
* Cleon joins Demosthenes in the invasion by Athenian troops of Sphacteria. The resulting Battle of Pylos results in an Athenian victory leading to the surrender of many of the Spartan troops. Pylos remains in Athenian hands, and is used as a base for raids into Spartan territory and as a refuge for fleeing Spartan helots.
* Following the failure of peace negotiations between Athens and Sparta, a number of Spartans stranded on the island of Sphacteria after the Battle of Pylos are attacked by an Athenian force under Cleon and Demosthenes. The resulting Battle of Sphacteria leads to a further victory by the Athenians over the Spartans. The Spartans sue for peace, but the Athenian leader Cleon persuades Athens to refuse.

==== Greece ====
* Nicias, the leader of the aristocratic and peace party in Athens and Pleistoanax, King of Sparta, negotiate the Peace of Nicias between Athens and Sparta, which brings a temporary end to the Peloponnesian War. The essence of the Peace of Nicias is a return to the antebellum period with most wartime gains being returned. Seventeen representatives from each side swear an oath to uphold the treaty, which is meant to last for one generation (30 years: meaning they are not responsible for the next generation&#x27;s decision). All of Sparta&#x27;s allies agree to sign the peace except for the Boeotians, Corinth, Elis, and Megara.
* Alcibiades engineers an anti-Spartan alliance between Athens and the democracies of Argos, Mantinea and Elis.

<text>Do-Aklin or Gangnihessou (Ganye Hessou) or Dogbari is claimed as the founder of the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin and the first person in the royal lineage of the Kings of Dahomey (the Aladaxonou dynasty). In many versions he is considered the first king of Dahomey even though the kingdom was founded after his death. Very little is known about Do-Aklin and most of it is connected to folklore, but it is generally claimed that he settled a large group of Aja people from Allada on the Abomey plateau amongst the local inhabitants in &quot;c.&quot; 1620. His son Dakodonu would eventually build a palace on the plateau and began forming the Kingdom of Dahomey.

==Symbols and motto==
Gangnihessou had a bird, a drum and a club as his symbol. His motto was that he was the biggest bird and sonorous drum, that nobody can prevent him.

==Settled in Abomey==
According to oral tradition, the Aja were led to Allada by King Agassu from the city of Tado. Agassu was the son of a Tado princess and a leopard (or in some versions a brave Yoruba hunter). When Agassu tried to take over Tado he was defeated and so instead moved with his followers to found the city of Allada.

Around 1600, three brothers (two in some versions) in the lineage of Agassu fought over the succession to the throne and it was decided that each would settle a new territory. The agreement was reached at Houégbo that Teagbanlin would found a state at what is now Porto-Novo, another son would take control in Allada, and Do-Aklin would settle on the Abomey plateau to the north. It is said that Do-Aklin brought significant gifts for the local population and so was allowed to live amongst them, and the mixing of the local population with the Aja from Allada created the new ethnic group, the Fon.

Do-Aklin&#x27;s son (or grandson in some versions) Dakodonu became the founder of the palace and the kingdom of Dahomey around 1640 by defeating a local chieftain. Anthropologist J. Cameron Monroe contends that the lineage connections to royalty at Allada is probably a later creation used to legitimate the conquest of Allada and other aspects like Dahomey&#x27;s rivalry with Porto-Novo.

<text>Year 419 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Lanatus, Rutilus, Tricipitinus and Axilla (or, less frequently, year 335 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 419 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==== Greece ====
* Despite the Peace of Nicias still being in effect, Sparta&#x27;s King Agis II gathers a strong army at Philus and descends upon Argos by marching at night from the north. His allied Boeotian forces fail him, but he is able to conclude a treaty with Argos. In 419 BC, the Argives, at the instigation of Alcibiades, attacked Epidaurus; and Agis with a large force from Lacedaemon set out and marched to the frontier city of Leuctra. No one, Thucydides tells us, knew the purpose of this expedition. It was probably to make a diversion in favour of Epidaurus.

<text>Henri Fantin-Latour (; 14 January 1836 – 25 August 1904) was a French painter and lithographer best known for his flower paintings and group portraits of Parisian artists and writers.

==Early life==
Born in Grenoble, Isère, Ignace Henri Jean Théodore Fantin-Latour first had drawing lessons with his father Théodore Fantin-Latour (1805-1875), who was a painter. In 1850 he moved to Paris where he enrolled in the small Paris School of Drawing, where he studied with Louis-Alexandre Péron and Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, an innovative and non-traditional instructor who developed his own teaching method based on painting and drawing from memory.

He entered the École des Beaux-Arts, in Paris, in 1854, where he had for classmates, Edgar Degas, Alphonse Legros and Jean-Charles Cazin. After studying there, he spent long time copying the works of the old masters in the Musée du Louvre. Although Fantin-Latour befriended several of the young artists who would later be associated with Impressionism, including Whistler and Manet, his own work remained conservative in style.

In 1861, he briefly frequented the studio of Gustave Courbet. A painting from this period represents him with the painter and caricaturist Oulevay.

At the start of his career, between 1854 and 1861, he produced a large number of self-portraits in chalk, charcoal and oil. He had one of them refused at the Salon of 1859. He participated again with &quot;La Liseuse&quot; in 1861.

A member of the so-called Cénacle des Batignolles, or group of 1863, from where from Impressionism originated, he was, according to Gustave Kahn, a kind of the link between their painters and romantic painting.

In 1862, one of his still lifes was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. It was the first of a long series, for thereafter he presented several almost every year and which invariably occupied a prominent place in the exhibition building. During his third trip to England, from July to October 1864, he once again painted still lifes there. He had commercial success.

==The 1860s and his still lifes==
Encouraged by American painter James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858 at the Louvre, he made several stays in London from 1859 to 1881. In the 1860s, he cultivated the genre of the still life, who would play a capital role in his career. Fantin-Latour would find recognition in England for his compositions of flowers and fruits, at a time when French Impressionist painting was still not very widely there. It was said that his still lifes were &quot;practically unknown in France during his lifetime&quot;. Thanks to Whistler he met his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden and the engraver Edwin Edwards, and it was in London that he learned engraving.

His decision to make still lifes may seem surprising at the time of Impressionism, however, the choice of such a subject wasn&#x27;t innocent. In the hierarchy of genres enacted by the Academy of Fine Arts since the 17th century, the still life of fruit or flowers was considered a minor category. By ignoring any literary, religious or historical context, supposed to confer value and nobility on the work, he adopted the opposite stance of academicism. Edwin and Ruth Edwards, his English patrons and merchants, recommended that he always used simple vases and table tops in order to exhibit his great talent in rendering texture and color.

Fantin-Latour still lifes were also very appreciated in the Netherlands at his time. At the Living Masters Exhibition in Amsterdam, in 1889, one of his still lifes with roses sold by 2,000 guilders, a considerable sum back then. Dutch art dealers from Amsterdam regularly sold works by Fantin-Latour well into the 1930s. Many of these works would end in Dutch museums such as the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, in Otterlo.

==Artistic universe==
After his first Salon submissions were rejected in 1859, he began exhibiting with his friend Édouard Manet and the future Impressionists Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. In 1865, he wrote to Edwin Edwards : “We form a group and make noise because there are many painters and one is easily forgotten. When we come together... we grow in numbers and become more adventurous. I thought it could last, it was my mistake”.

In 1867, he was also one of the nine members of the Japanese Jinglar Society, with Carolus-Duran, who painted his portrait twice in 1861, and the ceramists Bracquemond and Solon, who they met to dinner at the Japanese style. “One always felt when approaching him, a small feeling of fear, because of these rough manners which the artists of his generation often affected as inseparable from a noble independence”, would say Jacques-Émile Blanche, a friend painter of the following generation.

Fantin renovated the collective portraiture with paintings who served as large manifestos: &quot;Homage to Delacroix&quot; (1864), &quot;A Studio at Les Batignolles&quot; (1870), a tribute to Manet, &quot;The Corner of the Table&quot; (1872), a homage to the Parnassian poets, including Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud, and &quot;Around the Piano&quot; (1885), a tribute to musicians and musicologists of his time.

In &quot;A Studio at Les Batignolles&quot;, Manet is depicted in the center in the act of painting, while he is surrounded of several important painters and writers, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Zacharie Astruc, Emile Zola, Frédéric Bazille and Claude Monet. This canvas testifies to the links he maintained with the artistic and literary avant-garde of the time and to Manet in particular; it also seems to be an echo of Zola s opinion of Manet: &quot;Around the painter reviled by the public, a common front has been created of painters and writers claiming him as a master&quot;.

In addition to his realistic paintings, Fantin-Latour created imaginative lithographs inspired by the music of some of the great classical composers. In 1876, Fantin-Latour attended a performance of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at Bayreuth, which he found particularly moving. He would later publish lithographs inspired by Richard Wagner in &quot;La revue wagnérienne&quot;, which helped solidify his reputation among Paris&#x27; avant-garde as an anti-naturalist painter.

In 1876, Fantin-Latour married a fellow painter, Victoria Dubourg, whom he met when both were copying the same painting at the Louvre. He would spend his summers on the country estate of his wife&#x27;s family at Buré, Orne in Lower Normandy, where he died on 25 August 1904.

Like many painters of his time, he became interested in photography, taking pictures for his work. He was also a big collector of erotic photographs; his estate lists more than 1,400 which are kept in the Museum of Grenoble.

He was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris, France.

==Legacy==
Marcel Proust mentions Fantin-Latour&#x27;s work in &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;:
&quot;Many young women&#x27;s hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,&quot; said the Prince, pointing to Mme de Villeparisis&#x27;s unfinished watercolours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower painting by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited. (&quot;The Guermantes Way&quot;)

His first major UK gallery exhibition in 40 years took place at the Bowes Museum in April 2011. Musée du Luxembourg presented a retrospective exhibition of his work in 2016–2017 entitled &quot;À fleur de peau&quot;.

A reproduction of the painting &quot;A Basket of Roses&quot; was used as the cover of New Order&#x27;s album &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; by Peter Saville in 1983.

Nine artworks by Fantin-Latour are listed concerning their Nazi-era provenance on the Lost Art Foundation website.

<text>Year 418 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Fidenas, Axilla and Mugillanus (or, less frequently, year 336 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 418 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* King Agis II of Sparta escapes being fined 10,000 drachmae and having his house razed for his failure to press his advantage by promising more successful outcomes in the future.
* The Battle of Mantinea is the largest land battle of the Peloponnesian War (with as many as 10,000 troops on each side). Sparta under King Agis II has a major victory over Argos (and its allies Athens, Ellis and Mantinea), which has broken its treaty with Sparta&#x27;s King Agis II at the insistence of Alcibiades. Agis II&#x27;s major victory makes amends with the Spartans for his earlier truce with Argos. The commander of the Athenian forces, Laches, is killed in the battle.
* Impressed with the Spartan victory, the inhabitants of Argos change their government from democracy to oligarchy and end their support for Athens in favour of an alliance with Sparta. Many of Argos&#x27; allies do the same. Athens becomes increasingly isolated.
* Alcibiades urges the Athenians to conquer Syracuse, subdue Sicily and Carthage and thus gain added forces that will enable them to finish the war against Sparta. His bold offensive plan wins the support of the Athenians.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Epaminondas of Thebes, Theban general and statesman (d. 362 BC)
* Iphicrates, Athenian general (approximate date) (d. c. 353 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Laches, Athenian aristocrat and general (b. c. 475 BC)

<text>Dakodonou, &quot;Dakodonu&quot;, &quot;Dako Donu&quot; or &quot;Dako Danzo&quot; was an early king of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, ruling from around 1620 until 1645. Oral tradition recounts that Dakodonu was the son (or grandson) of Do-Aklin, the founder of the royal dynasty of Dahomey, and the father to Houegbadja, often considered the founder of the Kingdom of Dahomey. In addition, it is said that Dakodonu killed a local chieftain and founded the capital city upon the site. However, some recent historical analysis contends that Dakodonu was added into the royal line in the 18th century to legitimize the ruling dynasty over the indigenous inhabitants of the Abomey plateau.

==Name==
One legend tells that Dakodonou&#x27;s original name was Dako but he adopted his new name Dakodonou after killing Donou (who was either a farmer or an indigo painter) in a pot of indigo and rolling his corpse around its blue tomb.

==Founding of Abomey Kingdom==
Oral tradition holds that a succession struggle in Allada resulted in Do-Aklin moving a large population onto the Abomey plateau, an area settled by the Gedevi. When Do-Aklin died (or in some versions was deposed), Dakodonu became the leader of the group and was given permission by the Gedevi chiefs to settle on the plateau. Dakodonu requested additional land for settlement from a prominent Gedevi chief named Dan (or Da). In Gbe languages, Da or Dan means snake . To this request, the chief responded &quot;Should I open up my belly and build you a house in it.&quot; The tradition contends that Dakodonu killed Dan on the spot and ordered that his new palace be built on the site and derived the kingdom&#x27;s name from the incident: Dan=chief, xo=Belly, me=Inside of. From this beginning, Dakodonu began establishing the basic structure of the Dahomey kingdom and is reported to have conquered two additional villages. Oral tradition of the ruling lineage of the kingdom says that Dakodonu&#x27;s son Houegbadja, often considered the first king of Dahomey, took over after Dakodonu&#x27;s reign.

==Dakodonu and legitimation of the royal lineage==
Dahomey historian Edna Bay argues that Dakodonu was actually himself a Gedevi, the local population of the area, and that he was added into the royal lineage story by Agaja in order to establish the legitimate rule of the Kingdom over the local population. Evidence of this is suggested through the fact that the head priest of the kingdom, the &quot;agasunon&quot; in Fon, was always from the lineage of Dakodonu. In addition, oral tradition of lineages not associated with the ruling group claim that Houegbadja was an adopted son of Dakodonu. Dakodonu&#x27;s inclusion in royal lists then was a means of creating recognition for the local population in a powerful position (the head priest) and legitimating the rule of the Fon kingdom over the territory. In addition, Monroe contends that the story of the founding, the killing of Dan, is likely not based on a single incident and Bay contends that Dahomey meaning &quot;In the belly of Dan&quot; is likely a false etymology.

==Constructions by Dakodonu==
As an early king of Dahomey, the reign of Dakodonu coincided with some significant construction projects including the start of the Royal Palaces of Abomey, although the structures were probably replaced by construction by Houegbadja, and Agongointo-Zoungoudo Underground Town.

<text>Maximilian Kaller (10 October 1880 – 7 July 1947) was Roman Catholic Bishop of Ermland () in East Prussia from 1930 to 1947. However, &quot;de facto&quot; expelled from mid-August 1945, he was a special bishop for the homeland-expellees until his death.

==Early life==
Kaller was born in Beuthen (Bytom), Prussian Silesia, into a merchant family, the second of eight children. With the population of Beuthen being of German and Polish ethnicity he grew up bilingual in German and Polish. He graduated from the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in 1899 with &quot;Abitur&quot; and started theological studies in Breslau (today&#x27;s Wrocław) at the episcopal see of his then home Prince-Bishopric of Breslau. There he was consecrateda priest in 1903.

He was the chaplain in the parish of Groß Strehlitz (today&#x27;s Strzelce Opolskie) in the Breslau diocese. Between 1905 and 1917, he practised as a missionary priest at St. Boniface parish in Bergen on Rügen Island in the Hither Pomeranian Catholic diaspora within Breslau&#x27;s Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania. He raised the necessary donations to erect St. Boniface Church there in 1912. From 1917, he was the priest at Berlin&#x27;s second oldest Catholic Church, Saint Michael&#x27;s Garrison Church.

==Career as prelate and bishop==
In 1926, he succeeded Robert Weimann (1870–1925) as Apostolic Administrator of Schneidemühl (today&#x27;s Piła). Kaller&#x27;s jurisdiction comprised Catholic parishes of the dioceses of Chełmno and of Gniezno-Poznań, which had been separated from their episcopal sees by the new Polish border in 1918 and 1920, respectively. On Kaller&#x27;s instigation, the seat of the apostolic administration had been moved from Tütz (Tuczno) to Schneidemühl on 1 July 1926.

Following the Prussian Concordat () of 1929, some Catholic dioceses and jurisdictions in Northern, Middle and Eastern Germany had been reorganised. In 1930, the Apostolic Administration of Tütz was reconstituted as the Territorial Prelature of Schneidemühl (, , existing until 1972, and from 1945 under apostolic administrators) with Kaller being promoted to prelate.

On 2 September 1930, Kaller was invested as bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ermland (an archdiocese since 1992) by Pope Pius XI and consecrated in Schneidemühl, afterwards taking the episcopal see in Frauenburg (today&#x27;s Frombork). Franz Hartz succeeded Kaller as Prelate of Schneidemühl.
From 1925, Ermland diocese comprised all of the Prussian Province of East Prussia in its borders of 1938. In the year of Kaller&#x27;s investiture, his diocese, which had turned exempt in 1566 when its original metropolitan Archbishopric of Riga, had become Lutheran and was &quot;de jure&quot; dissolved, became again suffragan to an archdiocese. Ermland diocese, together with the new Berlin diocese and Schneidemühl prelature joined the new Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province () under the newly elevated Metropolitan Archbishop Adolf Bertram of Breslau.

In 1932, Kaller consecrated the new diocesan seminary for priests in Braunsberg in East Prussia (today&#x27;s Braniewo). Under his jurisdiction, Ermland diocese issued a new diocesan hymnal and a diocesan ritual (cf. Rituale Romanum) in Latin and the three native languages of the diocesan parishioners (German, Lithuanian and Polish). Kaller was also appointed apostolic visitator to the then 8,000 Catholic faithful in Memelland, a Lithuanian-annexed formerly East Prussian area, whose then four Catholic parishes had been seceded from Ermland diocese and subsequently formed part of the Territorial Prelature of Memel (Klaipėda)]], ; ; ) existing between 1926 and 1991.

Kaller and other members of the German Catholic and Protestant Churches formulated their opposition to the policy of Nazi mysticism early on (cf. Struggle of the churches). German clergy who opposed Adolf Hitler or supported refugees were strongly persecuted under the Nazi dictatorship. On 10 June 1939, Pope Pius XII appointed Kaller apostolic administrator of the Territorial Prelature of Memel, after Lithuania had ceded Memelland under German pressure to Nazi Germany in March the same year. In 1942, Kaller applied to Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo to resign from episcopate in order to administer services at Theresienstadt, but his wish was not granted.

On 7 February 1945, during World War II, the Nazi Schutzstaffel forced Kaller out of his episcopal office while the Soviet Red Army was overrunning Ermland diocese. Kaller had appointed Frauenburg&#x27;s Cathedral dean Aloys Marquardt (1891–1972) as vicar general to the see.

==After World War II==
After World War II, most Germans were expelled to Allied-occupied Germany, including Marquardt who had to leave in July. Frauenburg&#x27;s cathedral chapter then elected the aged Canon Johannes (Jan) Hanowski, a German of Polish ethnicity and long-term archpriest of Allenstein (today&#x27;s Olsztyn), as capitular vicar, i.e. provisional head of the see, on 28 July 1945.

Kaller, who had been stranded by the end of the war in Halle upon Saale, made his -long way back to his see and arrived on one of the first nights of August 1945 in Allenstein/Olsztyn, taking on the jurisdiction from Hanowski. He started to develop new plans for his diocese especially aiming at overcoming the nationalist antagonism between Catholics of the German and Polish languages, reshaping the diocese in the spirit of German-Polish reconciliation. He appointed Franciszek Borowiec, his close collaborator, as new vicar general for the Diocesan area under Polish occupation and Paul Hoppe (1900–1988), Königsberg in Prussia (today&#x27;s Kaliningrad), as vicar general for the diocesan area under Soviet occupation.

Kaller further appointed an ethnic Pole as new cathedral provost, since his predecessor provost, Franz Xaver Sander (also official), and five more fellow cathedral canons had been killed by the invading Soviets. (The other killed canons were Andreas Hinzmann, Dr. Franz Heyduschka, Dr. Wladislaus Switalski, Anton Krause and Dr. Bruno Gross.) Addressing the Polish authorities in the annexed area of his diocese, Kaller declared that he wanted to continue his episcopate within Poland, but officials said it was for neither him nor them, but Warsaw to decide that. Kaller chose four ethnic Poles as canon candidates to replenish the chapter so that ethnic Poles and Germans would each have half the seats. With these activities and plans Kaller was unique among the German bishops in the eastern territories.

On 14 August, he received a telegramme from August Hlond for the expelled Marquardt. Polish Primate Hlond had invited the vicar general for a meeting on the diocesan future to Pelplin, not knowing that the Polish authorities had expelled him, let alone that the deported Kaller had managed to return. A Polish government car was provided and Kaller and Borowiec travelled the next day to Pelplin. When, on coming for the general vicar, the Polish government representatives learned the bishop himself was coming, they sent an advance party to Pelplin in order to inform Hlond.

As Pelplin&#x27;s canon and chancellor, Franciszek Kurland recalled, Kaller was not welcomed in priestly fraternity. It was difficult enough to urge a general vicar to resign, but the papally-invested bishop was another task. In fluent Polish, Kaller and Hlond, his chaplain Bolesław Filipiak, his brother Antoni Hlond SDB, Leon Kozłowski (Chełmno&#x27;s vicar general) and Kurland conversed while taking lunch, discussing the situation. Kaller explained that he wanted to stay with his diocese in Poland and talked about his plans. Hlond replied that Kaller was no Polish citizen and thus unacceptable as bishop in the Polish area, avoiding the term &quot;state&quot;, since Ermland diocese was only Polish-occupied German territory. Afterwards, in a private conversation, Hlond urged Kaller to resign which he did for the jurisdiction in the Polish-occupied diocesan area, but retained the office of Bishop of Ermland, which rather turned quite void, especially since in the Soviet-occupied diocesan area no Catholic ecclesiastical activity whatsoever was tolerated. Later in Poznań, Hlond praised Kaller for how he had complied with the demanded resignation from jurisdiction.

On his way back, accompanied by Borowiec, Kaller cried and told him that the jurisdiction in the Polish-occupied diocesan area would be passed on to Teodor Bensch, a German-born naturalised Pole, who would arrive within days officiating as apostolic administrator. They returned home in the evening on 16 August. Kaller could not appoint the four new canons for the chapter any more but was expelled the next day, transferred by lorry to Warsaw, accompanied by Borowiec, who also joined him on the train to Poznań on 18 August. Then Borowiec, who had not been expelled, returned to the diocese, while Kaller had to leave via Stettin for Allied-occupied Germany.

==Kaller&#x27;s last years==
Kaller found asylum in what became Bizone in 1947. On 26 September 1946, Pius XII appointed him Papal Special Commissioner for the homeland-expelled Germans (). In November 1946, Pius XII invited Kaller to Rome. Both were personally acquainted since their common time in Berlin (Pius as Nuncio to Germany and Kaller as priest), and the latter reported to the pope on the destitute situation of the expellees from eastern Europe. On 7 July 1947, Kaller died suddenly of a heart attack in Frankfurt am Main and was buried besides St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Königstein im Taunus.

==Succession of Kaller until 1972==
On 11 July 1947, the Ermland chapter, residing in the Allied Bizone, then elected Provost Arthur Kather (1883–1957), officiating before his exile at St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Elbing (today&#x27;s Elbląg), capitular vicar, as provided by canon law in case of &quot;sede vacante&quot;. The Holy See later confirmed him and thereafter Kather represented Ermland diocese in the Fulda Conference of Bishops until his death. 

On 29 July 1957, the Ermland chapter, with the surviving capitulars living in what had become West Germany, elected Hoppe as capitular vicar, who had been expelled from the Soviet-occupied Ermland diocesan area (Kaliningrad Oblast) in 1947. Hoppe held that post until Pope Paul VI terminated the apostolic administration of Ermland diocese and finally appointed again a bishop to the see on 28 June 1972, then named Warmia (Polish for Ermland), however, not comprising the former diocesan area within the Soviet Union. Paul VI then elevated Hoppe to Apostolic Visitator of Ermland taking care of Ermland&#x27;s diocesans living in Germany.

==Legacy==
In July 1979, Kaller&#x27;s successor, Warmia&#x27;s Bishop Józef Glemp, visited Straelen, where he had earlier improved his German. On his way to Nuremberg, Glemp stopped in Königstein to visit Kaller&#x27;s grave. On 10 October 1980, Kaller&#x27;s 100th birthday, Glemp celebrated a pontifical requiem in honour of Kaller in Frombork&#x27;s Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Andrew, Frombork, commemorating in his preaching Kaller&#x27;s personality as priest and his benedictory work for the diocese. In 1997, Archbishop Edmund Michał Piszcz of Warmia and the community of Ermlanders in Western Germany commemorated Kaller and placed busts of him in Germany and Poland. On 4 May 2003, the procedure for his beatification started.

<text>Houegbadja or Wegbaja or Aho was a King in the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from around 1645 until 1685. Houegbadja followed his father Dakodonou to the throne and formed much of the administration and religious practices for the Kingdom of Dahomey. Because of this he is often credited as the First King of Dahomey.

==Rise to power==
The rise of Houegbadja to the throne is a story based largely on oral traditions. The primary oral tradition claims that Houegbadja was the son (or in some adopted son) of Dakodonu and that a Gedevi woman (the Gedevi were the native people of the Abomey Plateau) named Adanon was betrothed to Dakodonu. Although the woman was betrothed to his father, Houegbdaja got the woman pregnant and the result was that Dakodonu disinherited him. Houegbadja and Dakodonu only reconciled when Houegbadja killed a strong rival of Dakodonu, and Houegbadja was then named the heir apparent. With the death of Dakodonu, Houegbadja became the King of Dahomey.

==Administration==
Houegbadja plays a primary role in the ceremonies of the Kingdom of Dahomey and as such is often attributed with many administrative developments that he is unlikely to have solely created. However, various oral traditions hold that Houegbadja established the current Royal Palaces of Abomey, the general structure of the royal administration, poll taxes, death taxes, and made it so that the King&#x27;s sacrifices to ancestors were primary within the kingdom. Militarily, Houegbadja is often credited with the first expansions of the kingdom outside of the Abomey Plateau and is sometimes credited with creating the Dahomey Amazons (although this claim is considered unlikely).

==Legacy==
Houegbadja is often considered the first king of Dahomey because of the establishment of the palace and creation of many rules that defined the administration of the kingdom. During the Annual Customs of Dahomey, a ceremony centered on tributes given to royal ancestors, Houegbadja was the first king recognized. He named his oldest son Akaba as his heir and upon his death around 1685, Akaba came to power.

<text>Renate Stecher (, ; née Meißner, born 12 May 1950) is a German (former East German) sprint runner and a triple Olympic champion. She held 34 world records and was the first woman to run 100 metres within 11 seconds.

==Biography==
Born as Renate Meißner, she was a very talented athlete, also competing in the high jump and pentathlon. She debuted internationally at the 1969 European Championships, where she – as a last minute substitute – won a silver medal in the 200 m and a gold in the 4 × 100 m relay.

In 1970 she was the World Student Games Champion in both the 100 and 200 metres.

At the next European Championships, in 1971, she won both the 100 and 200 m and the silver in the relay. At that time, she was already competing as Renate Stecher, having married hurdler Gerd Stecher the previous year.

At the 1972 Summer Olympics, Stecher repeated that performance. She won the 100 m in time of 11.07, which was only in 1976 recognised as world record, which had been measured in tenths of seconds before (the times in tenths were later corrected). She also equalled the world record in the 200 meters with a time of 22.40. The following year, Stecher set (hand timed) world records in both sprint events, also becoming the first woman to beat 11 seconds. She clocked 10.9 and 10.8 for the 100 metres and 22.1 for the 200 metres.

Stecher also won the 200 m. Wilma van den Berg of the Netherlands had qualified for the semifinals, and the 23.22 that she ran in the quarterfinals was faster than the time in the quarterfinals of Stecher. However, after the killing of 11 Israeli athletes in the Munich Massacre, and the Olympics not being cancelled, van den Berg withdrew from the competition in sympathy with the Israeli victims. She said that she was leaving in protest of the &quot;obscene&quot; decision to continue with the Olympic Games.

In Rome at the 1974 European Championships she was defeated in both the 100 m and 200 m, by Irena Szewińska of Poland and had to settle for silver in both distances. However the GDR 4 × 100 m relay team, in which Stecher ran the second leg, won the gold medal in a world record time.

At the 1976 Summer Olympics, Stecher again competed in the three sprint events, winning medals in all three once again. She was beaten for the 100 m title by Annegret Richter, and came third in a 200 m race with five German women in the first five positions. With the 4 × 100 m relay team they beat West Germany, taking revenge for the race four years earlier.

==Retirement==
Following the release of East German secret service files, it was revealed that many of the country&#x27;s athletes were involved with a state-sponsored drug program. The files document that Stecher had wanted to step down her drug use after the 1972 Olympics, so that she could safely have children. Raelene Boyle, who had finished second to Stecher in both the 100 and 200 metres at the Olympics, stated that she felt cheated, as she believed it unlikely that Stecher would have beaten her without the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

In 2011 Stecher was inducted into the Germany&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="72438" wikidata="Q561733" url="?curid=72438" title="Akaba of Dahomey">
<text>Akaba also known as Adahunzo or Housseou was an early King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1685 until &quot;c.&quot;1716. King Houegbadja had created the basic structure of the kingdom on the Abomey plateau. His first children were the twins of Akaba and Hangbe and they were followed by another son of Houegbadja who would become King Agaja. As the oldest son, Akaba became the king upon Houegbadja&#x27;s death and ruled until 1716 when he died during battle in the Ouémé River Valley, either of small pox or in battle. When he died his sister, Hangbe, became the ruler and began preparing Akaba&#x27;s oldest son, Agbo Sassa, for the throne. In 1718, Agaja, the next oldest son after Akaba from Houegbadja, fought with Agbo Sassa and Hangbe and became the next King of Dahomey.

==Symbol==
The chameleon symbolized his adaptability of policies.It was also a symbol of his patience to wait to ascend to the throne (as he ascended the throne in such an old age), inspired from the quote &quot;The chameleon walks slowly but can go far, and he will never break even the finest branch he walks on the bombax tree&quot;.The king was also symbolized by a boar.

==King of Dahomey==
Oral tradition records that Akaba was the eldest born child of Houegbadja with a twin sister named Hangbe. In addition, Houegbadja also had a younger son named Dosu (the traditional name for the first male born after twins in Fon) who would later take the name Agaja. As the oldest son, Houegbadja named Akaba his heir before he died and Akaba assumed the throne in 1685 upon his father&#x27;s deaths. In some versions, Akaba is the king who kills the chieftain &quot;Dan&quot; to establish the dominance of the Dahomey Kingdom over the Abomey plateau, rather than Houegbadja.

Akaba&#x27;s administration continued military expansion off the Abomey plateau and increasing centralization of the kingdom over the region. Some of his most significant military activity was in the Ouémé River valley. During this campaign in around 1715–1716, Akaba died either of smallpox, poisoning, or in battle. Because his death was quite sudden, and his heir was still young, Edna Bay contends that his twin sister Hangbe became the regent until Agaja forcibly replaced her and the oldest son of Akaba, Agbo Sassa, to take over the throne.

<doc id="72440" wikidata="Q95029" url="?curid=72440" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen">
<text>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (LoEG) is a multi-genre, cross-over comic book series co-created by writer Alan Moore and artist Kevin O&#x27;Neill which began in 1999. The comic book spans four volumes, an original graphic novel, and a spin-off trilogy of graphic novellas. &quot;Volume I&quot; and &quot;Volume II&quot; (released as two six-issue limited series) and the graphic novel &quot;Black Dossier&quot; were published by the America&#x27;s Best Comics imprint of DC Comics. After leaving the America&#x27;s Best imprint, the series moved to Top Shelf and Knockabout Comics, which published &quot;Volume III: Century&quot; (released as three graphic novellas), the &quot;Nemo Trilogy&quot; (a spin-off of three graphic novellas centered on the character of Nemo), and &quot;Volume IV: The Tempest&quot; (originally released as a six-issue limited series). According to Moore, the concept behind the series was initially a &quot;Justice League of Victorian England&quot; but he quickly developed it as an opportunity to merge elements from numerous works of fiction into one world, in a matter akin to the shared fictional universes of Marvel and DC Comics.

Elements of &quot;Volume I&quot; were used in a loosely adapted feature film of the same name, released in 2003 and starring Sean Connery in his last live-action role.

==Plot==

The year is 1898, and Mina Murray is recruited by Campion Bond on behalf of British Intelligence and asked to assemble a league of other extraordinary individuals to protect the interests of the Empire: Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll, and Hawley Griffin the Invisible Man. They help stop a gang war between Fu Manchu and Professor Moriarty, nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. Following this they take part in the events of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Two members of the League (Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain) achieve immortality, and are next seen in an adventure in 1958. This follows events that take place after the fall of the Big Brother government from George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot;.

Following this, Mina and Allan team up with fellow immortal Orlando and are shown in an adventure which spans a century, from 1910 to 2009, concerning a plot by evil magicians to create a Moonchild that might well turn out to be the Antichrist. During this adventure Captain Nemo&#x27;s daughter Janni Dakkar is introduced, and some of her adventures are chronicled subsequently. The final volume of the series ends with an immortal Mina escaping an Earth dominated by magical entities and various alien invasions to live out her immortal life on a space station with Orlando, Jack Nemo (great-grandson of Captain Nemo) and a clone of Mr. Hyde.

==Overview of the series==
In a 1997 interview with Andy Diggle for the now defunct Comics World website, Alan Moore gave the title of the work as &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlefolk&quot;. Moore changed the name to &quot;Gentlemen&quot; to better reflect the Victorian era. Simon Bisley was originally going to be the artist for the series before being replaced by Kevin O&#x27;Neill.

The Victorian setting allowed Moore and O&#x27;Neill to insert &quot;in-jokes&quot; and cameos from many works of Victorian fiction, while also making contemporary references and jibes. The works bear numerous steampunk influences. In the first issue, for example, there is a half-finished bridge to link Britain and France, referencing problems constructing the Channel Tunnel.

Most characters in the series, from the dominatrix schoolmistress Rosa Coote to minor characters such as Inspector Dick Donovan, are either established characters from existing works of fiction or ancestors of the same, to the extent that individuals depicted in crowd scenes in Volume I have been said (both by Moore, and in annotations by Jess Nevins) to be visually designed as the ancestors of the cast of the British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. This has lent the series considerable popularity with fans of esoteric Victoriana, who have delighted in attempting to place every character who makes an appearance.

Moore said:
==Publisher change==
Moore&#x27;s longstanding, outspoken criticism of DC Comics (stemming in large part from what he perceives as mistreatment at their hands over the rights to &quot;Watchmen&quot;) made his position with DC-owned subsidiary Wildstorm Comics (of which &quot;LoEG&quot; publisher America&#x27;s Best Comics is an imprint) tenuous from the start. Moore&#x27;s initial agreement was with WildStorm owner Jim Lee, who sold his studio to DC after dealing with Moore, but before any of the ABC projects were published. Moore agreed to honor his contracts with Lee, but made it clear that he wished to continue to have no dealings with DC directly.

The fifth issue of the first volume contained an authentic vintage advertisement for a douche with the brand name Marvel Douche. The entire initial print run was destroyed and reprinted because the publisher felt that this could be perceived as an attack on Marvel Comics, DC&#x27;s main competition.

After several additional complaints over DC interference, Moore decided to wind up his ABC projects, intending to only continue with &quot;League&quot; (the only title he, with O&#x27;Neill, actually owned). He subsequently took offense at inaccurate comments made by the producer of the film version of his &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, which stated that the author—who had distanced himself completely from film adaptations of his work, particularly after &quot;LXG&quot;—had commented favorably on a draft of the script. Moore requested that someone involved with the film&#x27;s production company—and DC Comics parent company, Warner Bros.—officially retract the comments and apologize. He also claims that his lack of support from DC regarding a minor lawsuit related to the film adaptation of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; was instrumental in his departure.

When no such apology was forthcoming, both Moore and O&#x27;Neill decided to withdraw future volumes of the &quot;League&quot; from DC in protest. Since the duo was still working on the &quot;Black Dossier&quot; at the time, it was agreed that it would become the last &quot;League&quot; project published by DC/WildStorm, with subsequent projects published jointly by Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout Comics in the US and UK respectively, who published both &quot;Volume III: Century,&quot; and the &quot;Nemo Trilogy&quot;, as graphic novella trilogies. Top Shelf and Knockabout later released &quot;Volume IV: The Tempest&quot; first as a six-issue limited series. Reprints of &quot;Volumes I-II&quot; and the &quot;Dossier&quot; were published by Vertigo until its shutdown in January 2020.

==World of the &quot;League&quot;==
Volume II has an extensive appendix, most of which is filled with an imaginary travelers&#x27; account of the alternate universe the &quot;League&quot; is set in, called &quot;The New Traveler&#x27;s Almanac&quot;. This Almanac provides background information – much of which is taken from the pre-existing literary works or mythology and may be difficult to fully appreciate without an esoteric knowledge of literature. It shows the plot of the comic to be just a small section of a world inhabited by what appears to be the entirety of all fiction ever created.

==History of the League==

Moore&#x27;s work includes references to previous leagues and suggests there will be others subsequently. In much the same way that the &quot;New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, an appendix to the trade paperback collection of &quot;The League Vol. 2&quot;, detailed much of the geography of the League&#x27;s world, the third volume, &quot;The Black Dossier&quot;, set out an extensive history of the world of the League and each of its various incarnations, threading together hundreds of disparate works of fiction into a cohesive timeline.

==Awards and recognition==
&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; won the 1999 UK National Comics Award for Best New Comic (International).

Volume I won the 2000 Bram Stoker Award for Best Illustrated Narrative. 

Volume II was nominated for the 2003 award, but lost to &quot;The Sandman: Endless Nights&quot;. Volume II received the 2003 Eisner Award for Best Finite Series/Limited Series. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; listed Volume II as the 9th best comic of 2003. It was included in the 2005 edition of &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Graphic Novels, Comics, &amp; Manga&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; also listed &quot;Black Dossier&quot; as the second-best comic of 2007.

==Influence==
===Music===
The steampunk band Unextraordinary Gentlemen was inspired by this comic.

On &quot;75 Bars (Black&#x27;s Reconstruction)&quot; off the &quot;Rising Down&quot; album, Black Thought refers to The Roots as &quot;gentlemen of an extraordinary league&quot;.

===Books===

Neil Gaiman cited &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; as one of the influences for his award-winning short story &quot;A Study in Emerald&quot;.

===Comics===
Warren Ellis has cited &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; as an inspiration for his comic &quot;Ignition City&quot;.

The comic &quot;The Chimera Brigade&quot; by science-fiction writer Serge Lehman has been regarded by critics as the French reply to &quot;The League&quot;. It uses proto-superhumans and supervillains from European pulp literature of the early twentieth century, but in a whole different perspective as Lehman is not mainly focused on English literature (as Moore does), mixes those real fictional characters equally with real prominent historical figures and builds a crepuscular alternate history story whose aim is to explain on a historical and psychoanalytical level why all European super-heroes disappeared from popular culture and European collective memory with World War II.

==Annotations==
Jess Nevins has produced a series of annotations for each volume which are available online and have also been expanded into book form:
** &quot;Heroes &amp; Monsters&quot; (UK) (Titan Books, 2006), 
* &quot;A Blazing World: The Unofficial Companion to the Second League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (MonkeyBrain Books, 2004) 
** &quot;A Blazing World&quot; (UK) (Titan Books, 2006) 
* &quot;Impossible Territories: An Unofficial Companion to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen The Black Dossier&quot; (MonkeyBrain Books, 2008) 

==In other media==
===Film===
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen appear in a self-titled film, consisting of Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, an original Invisible Man named Rodney Skinner, Dr. Jekyll and Edward Hyde, Dorian Gray, and Tom Sawyer.

In May 2015, 20th Century Fox announced that a reboot is being developed. John Davis said that the reboot will be a female-centric film. As of May 2022, the film is on track by 20th Century Studios, scheduled to stream on Hulu, with Justin Haythe writing and Don Murphy, who produced the 2003 film, will return as a producer alongside Susan Montford and Erwin Stoff of 3 Arts Entertainment.

===TV series===
In 2013, Fox was ordering a pilot for the television version of &quot;LoEG&quot; with Michael Green serving as writer and executive producer. Erwin Stoff would also executive produce. Neither Moore nor O&#x27;Neill are producers on the series. It had also been reported that the pilot episode would still be broadcast, even if Fox opted not to green-light the series.

===Interviews===
The DVD release of &quot;The Mindscape of Alan Moore&quot; contains an interview with the artist Kevin O&#x27;Neill that involves the collaboration with Alan Moore, &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century&quot;, and his involvement with censorship.

<text>Agaja (also spelled Agadja and also known as Trudo Agaja or Trudo Audati) was a king of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, who ruled from 1718 until 1740. He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba. During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727). Wars with the powerful Oyo Empire to the east of Dahomey resulted in Agaja accepting tributary status to that empire and providing yearly gifts. After this, Agaja attempted to control the new territory of the kingdom of Dahomey through militarily suppressing revolts and creating administrative and ceremonial systems. Agaja died in 1740 after another war with the Oyo Empire and his son Tegbessou became the new king. Agaja is credited with creating many of the key government structures of Dahomey, including the &quot;Yovogan&quot; and the &quot;Mehu&quot;.

The motivations of Agaja and his involvement with the slave trade remain an active dispute among historians of Dahomey with some arguing that he was resistant to the slave trade but agreed to it because of the need to defend his kingdom, while others argue that no such motivation existed and the wars against Allada and Whydah were simply for economic control.

== History ==
Agaja served a crucial role in the early development of the Kingdom of Dahomey. The kingdom had been founded by Agaja&#x27;s father Houegbadja who ruled from 1645 until 1685 on the Abomey plateau. Although there were some limited military operations outside of the plateau, the kingdom did not significantly expand before the eighteenth century.

===Rise to power===
Oral tradition says that Agaja was born around 1673, the second oldest son to Houegbadja. Houegbadja&#x27;s first two children were the twins Akaba and Hangbe. Agaja was originally called Dosu, a traditional Fon name for the first son born after twins. When Houegbadja died, Akaba became the king and ruled from 1685 until about 1716. Akaba died during a war in the Ouémé River valley and since his oldest son, Agbo Sassa, was a minor, his twin sister Hangbe may have ruled for a brief period of time (alternatively given as either three months or three years). Hangbe supported a faction that wanted Agbo Sassa to be the next king, but Agaja contested this and became the ruler in 1718 after a brief, violent struggle.

===Conquest of Allada and Whydah===

Agaja led the most important expansions of the kingdom in the 1720s with the conquest of the Kingdom of Allada in 1724 and the Kingdom of Whydah in 1727. Allada and Whydah, both Aja kingdoms, had become important coastal trading centers in the early 1700s, with trade connections to multiple European countries. The two powers made a 1705 agreement where both agreed not to interfere in the trade of the other kingdom. The King of Whydah, Huffon, grew increasingly connected through trade with the British Royal African Company while the king of Allada, Soso, made his ports outposts for the Dutch West India Company. In 1712, a British ship attacked a Dutch ship in the harbor at Allada, triggering economic warfare between Allada and Whydah that lasted until 1720. Upon coming to the throne, Agaja and Soso made an agreement to attack Whydah and remove Huffon from power; however, this plan was halted for unknown reasons.

In 1724, Soso died and a contest for the throne in Allada followed. On March 30, 1724, Agaja&#x27;s army entered Allada in support of the defeated candidate, named Hussar. After a three-day battle Agaja&#x27;s army killed the king and set the palace on fire. Rather than place Hussar on the throne, though, Agaja drove him out of the city after establishing his own power. Agaja then turned his forces against the other Aja kingdoms. In April 1724, Agaja conquered the town of Godomey and in 1726 the King of Gomè transferred his allegiance from the King of Whydah to Agaja.

Agaja planned his attack on Whydah in February 1727. He conspired with his daughter, Na Gueze, who was married to Huffon, to pour water on the gunpowder stores in Whydah. He also sent a letter to all of the European traders in the port of Whydah encouraging them to remain neutral in the conflict, in return for which he would provide favorable trade relations at the conclusion of the war. On February 26, 1727, Agaja attacked Whydah and burned the palace, causing the royal family to flee from the city. During the five-day battle, reports say that five thousand people in Whydah were killed and ten to eleven thousand were captured. In April, he burned all of the European factories in the Whydah capital.

In the three years between 1724 and 1727, Agaja had more than doubled the territory of Dahomey, had secured access to the Atlantic coast, and had made Dahomey a prominent power along the Slave Coast.

===Wars with the Oyo Empire===

The Aja kingdoms had been tributaries to the Oyo Empire since the 1680s. After Agaja had conquered Allada, it appears that he sent a smaller tribute and so on April 14, 1726, the Oyo Empire sent its army against Dahomey. The Oyo conquered Abomey and burned the city while Agaja and his troops escaped into the marshes and hid until the Oyo armies returned home.

Agaja rebuilt Abomey and when he conquered Whydah the next year he provided many gifts to the King of Oyo. Despite these gifts, tributary terms acceptable to Oyo were not agreed to and so the Oyo Empire returned on March 22, 1728. As part of a strategy, Agaja buried his treasure, burned food resources, and made all the residents of Abomey abandon the city. The Oyo army found it difficult to remain in that situation and so they returned to Oyo in April. This strategy was repeated in 1729 and 1730, with Oyo sending increasingly larger armies and Agaja and his troops retreating into the marshes. The 1730 invasion was particularly devastating as the Oyo feigned acceptance of gifts from Agaja but then ambushed Dahomey&#x27;s forces when they returned to Abomey. With the regular destruction of Abomey, Agaja moved the capital to Allada and ruled from there (his son Tegbessou would later move the capital back to Abomey while appointing a puppet king in Allada).

After the 1730 attack by the Oyo Empire, Agaja&#x27;s forces were particularly depleted. Huffon and the deposed royal family of Whydah, with support from the British and the French, attempted to reconquer the city. With depleted forces, Agaja created a special unit of women dressed in war armor to assemble at the back of his remaining army to make his forces look larger. The ploy worked as the Whydah forces saw a huge force marching toward the city and fled before any fighting happened. After this attack, Agaja asked the Portuguese leader in the area to negotiate a peace agreement between Dahomey and Oyo. The agreement set the boundaries between Oyo and Dahomey at the Ouémé River and made Dahomey a tributary state of Oyo, a status which would remain until 1832. As a guarantee, Agaja had to send a son, Tegbessou, to Oyo.

===Centralization===
For the last ten years of his reign, from 1730 until 1740, Agaja worked on consolidating his kingdom and increasing trade with Europeans.

Having come to terms with the Oyo empire, Agaja sought to militarily destroy other rivals in the region. This started in 1731 with a successful war against the Mahi people to the north of Abomey for supplying the Oyo with food and support during the wars. Attempts by the Portuguese and the Dutch to establish forts in Godomey, which Agaja had conquered in 1724 but whose leader had recently renounced his allegiance to Dahomey, caused a large war in 1732 in which Agaja burned the town and took thousands of people captive. In addition, regular warfare continued between Agaja and the exiled Whydah population under Huffon. In July 1733 Huffon died and a civil war broke out in the exiled community. A defeated prince went to Agaja to ask for assistance and seeing the opportunity, Agaja agreed to support the prince against the leadership of Whydah and allowed the prince to resettle after the war was successful. The other Whydah faction was defeated by Agaja in 1734 with assistance of the French.

Agaja also undertook significant administrative reforms to govern the newly conquered areas. Many of the chiefs and officers in Allada were retained, while Agaja dispatched his trade officers and kept active military control over Whydah. The old chiefs, retained for necessity, often caused problems for Agaja by resisting his rule or even revolting. Agaja also appointed three different trade directors, one to manage relations with each different European power (Britain, France, and Portugal). When the Europeans complained about these directors in 1733, Agaja replaced them with one person, thus creating the important position of &quot;Yovogan&quot;. The Dutch, in contrast, were held in high contempt by Agaja and he spent much of this period trying to destroy their interests in the region. This led the Dutch to organize a significant army of many tribes to the west of Dahomey which destroyed Agaja&#x27;s forces in 1737 but did not destroy the kingdom.

Starting in 1730 but becoming formal in 1733 all slaves could only be sold through representatives of the king. This royal monopoly led to some revolts by important chiefs who were not receiving full prices for their goods and Agaja crushed multiple rebellions between 1733 and 1740. The royal monopoly proved unpopular and, following the defeat of Agaja&#x27;s forces in 1737, he was forced to allow the free trade of slaves through Dahomey.

As part of his efforts against the Dutch, Agaja organized a war against Badagry in 1737. This war, while marginally successful, was possibly considered by the Oyo Empire to be against the terms of the 1730 agreement. Conversely, it is possible that Agaja simply refused to continue paying the tribute to Oyo. Whatever the reason, war between Oyo and Dahomey resumed in 1739 and Agaja repeated his earlier strategy of withdrawing into the wild to wait for the Oyo troops to leave.

===Contacts with Europeans===
Agaja was the first king of Dahomey to have significant contact with European traders. Although Dahomey had been known to European traders in the 1600s, largely as a source for slaves, because it was an inland kingdom contact was limited. When Agaja expanded the kingdom, he came into contact with the Dutch, British, French, and Portuguese traders. Agaja opposed the Dutch and largely excluded them from trade along the coast after he had conquered it. However, he created direct officers to manage contacts with the other European powers.

One important contact began in 1726 when Agaja sent Bulfinch Lambe (a British trader captured in the 1724 attack on Godomey) and a Dahomey ambassador known as Adomo Tomo or Captain Tom on a mission to Britain. Lambe was meant to deliver a &quot;Scheme of Trade&quot; to King George I. The &quot;Scheme of Trade&quot; outlined a plan for King George I to work with King Agaja in the creation of a plantation in Dahomey, exporting goods such as sugar, cotton, and indigo. However, Lambe was aware that the English had already abandoned plans to set up a plantation in Dahomey; he left Dahomey with no intention of following through on Agaja&#x27;s plan. Lambe initially sold Adomo Tomo into slavery in Maryland, but after a few years came back to free Tomo and bring him to England. Lambe and Tomo carried a letter claimed to be from Agaja and received an audience with King George II. The letter from Agaja was dismissed as a fraud and Tomo was returned to Dahomey where Agaja appointed him the assistant to the chief of trade with the British.

===Death===
Agaja died in Allada a few months after returning following the war with Oyo in 1740. Oral traditions say that Tegbessou, who was the fifth oldest son of Agaja, was told by Agaja earlier that because he had saved Dahomey from the Oyo Empire he was going to be the king rather than any of his older brothers, although that tradition may have been created by Tegbessou to legitimize his rule. Regardless, the result was a contest between him and his brothers upon Agaja&#x27;s death. In the end, Tegbessou was victorious and became the new king of Dahomey.

== Agaja and the slave trade ==
Agaja&#x27;s motivations for taking over Allada and Whydah and his involvement in the slave trade have been a topic for debate among historians. The debate centers largely around Agaja&#x27;s conquest of Allada and Whydah and an observed decrease in the slave trade in the area after this conquest. Complicating attempts to discern motivation is that Agaja&#x27;s administration ended by creating a significant infrastructure for the slave trade and participated actively in it during the last few years of his reign.

The debate over Agaja&#x27;s motivations goes back to John Atkins&#x27; 1735 publication of &quot;A Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies&quot;. In that book, Atkins argued that Allada and Whydah were known for regular slave raiding on the Abomey plateau and that Agaja&#x27;s attacks on those kingdoms were primarily to release some of his people who had been captured. A key piece of evidence for Atkins was a letter purported to be from Agaja and carried by Bulfinch Lambe to England in 1731 which expressed the willingness of Agaja to establish agricultural exports to Great Britain as an alternative to the slave trade. The authenticity of this letter is disputed and it was widely used in abolition debates in Great Britain as a letter by a purported indigenous African abolitionist.

Later historians have continued this debate about the role of Agaja in the slave trade, but with the need to account for the fact that in the last years of Agaja&#x27;s life (and after Atkins&#x27; book was published) the Kingdom of Dahomey was a major participant in the Atlantic slave trade.

Robert W. Harms writes that Agaja&#x27;s participation in the slave trade was a self-perpetuated necessity. Agaja had increasingly made his kingdom more and more dependent on foreign wares that could only be paid for by slaves. He writes:

Basil Davidson contended that Dahomey was drawn into the slave trade only as a means of self-defense against slave raiding by the Oyo Empire and the kingdoms of Allada and Whydah. He argued that Agaja took over the coastal cities to secure access to European firearms to protect the Fon from slave raiding. He writes: 
I.A. Akinjogbin has pushed the argument the farthest arguing that Agaja&#x27;s primary motivation was to end the slave trade in the region. He writes that although Agaja participated in the slave trade, this was primarily a means of self-defense and that his original motives were to end the slave trade. The Bulfinch Lambe letter plays a prominent role in Akinjogbin&#x27;s analysis as a declaration of Agaja&#x27;s willingness to stop the slave trade. Akinjogbin writes:
Historian Robin Law, in contrast, argues that there is no clear evidence of motivation by Agaja opposing the slave trade and that the conquests of Allada and Whydah may have been simply done to improve Agaja&#x27;s access to economic trade. Law contends that the disruption in slave trade that followed the rise of Dahomey was not necessarily related to any efforts on their part to slow the slave trade, but was simply due to the disruption caused by their conquests. Law believes in the authenticity of the Bulfinch Lambe letter, but contends that Atkins misinterprets it. In addition, Law doubts the self-defense motivation highlighted by Davidson and Akinjogbin, writing:
Similarly, David Henige and Marion Johnson question Akinjogbin&#x27;s argument. While agreeing with the evidence from Akinjogbin that trade did slow after Agaja&#x27;s rise, they find that the evidence does not support any altruistic or moral opposition to the slave trade as the reason for this. In terms of the Bulfinch Lambe letter, they maintain that its authenticity remains &quot;not proven&quot; but that since Lambe was provided 80 slaves when he was released, it is unlikely that Agaja&#x27;s motivations were clear. Instead, they argue that the evidence supports Agaja trying to get involved in the slave trade but being unable to do so because of war with the exiled royal family of Whydah and the Oyo Empire. They write:
Edna Bay assesses the debate by writing:
== Legacy ==

Agaja is credited with introducing many features of the Dahomey state that became defining characteristics for future kings. It is often said that Agaja created the &quot;Mehu&quot; (a prime minister), the &quot;Yovogan&quot; (chief to deal with Europeans), and other administrative positions. However, oral traditions sometimes ascribe these developments to other kings. In addition, Agaja is sometimes credited as the king who created the Dahomey Amazons, a military unit composed entirely of women. Multiple histories account that Agaja did have armed female bodyguards in his palace and that he did dress women in armor in order to attack Whydah in 1728; however, historian Stanley Alpern believes that the Amazons were not likely fully organized during his reign.

Agaja also had a large impact on the religion of Dahomey, largely by increasing the centrality of the Annual Customs (&quot;xwetanu&quot; or &quot;huetanu&quot; in Fon). Although the Annual Customs already existed and each family had similar celebrations, Agaja transformed this by making the royal Annual Customs the central religious ceremony in the kingdom. Family celebrations could not occur until after the royal Annual Customs had occurred.

Agaja is often considered one of the great kings in Dahomey history and is remembered as the &quot;great warrior&quot;. His expansions of Dahomey and connections with European traders led to his depiction in Dahomey art as a European caravel boat.

<doc id="72443" wikidata="Q167262" url="?curid=72443" title="Tegbesu">
<text>Tegbesu (French: Tegbessou) or Bossa Ahadee was a king of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. While not the oldest son of King Agaja (1718-1740), he became king after Agaja&#x27;s death following a succession struggle with a brother.

==Rise to power==
Oral traditions hold that Tegbesu was the son of Agaja and Hwanjile, a woman reported to have brought &quot;Vodun&quot; to the kingdom. King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Allada in 1724 and Whydah in 1727. This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent (with the royal aristocrats of both Allada and Whydah opposing Dahomey from fortified islands off the coast) and regional opposition (mainly with semi-regular warfare between Dahomey and the Oyo Empire). According to one oral tradition, as part of the tribute owed by Dahomey to Oyo, Agaja had to give to Oyo one of his sons. The story claims that only Hwanjile of all of Agaja&#x27;s wives was willing to allow her son to go to Oyo. This act of sacrifice, according to the oral tradition made Tegbesu favored by Agaja. Agaja reportedly tells Tegbesu that he is the future king, but his brother Zinga is still the official heir.

One oral history contends that with the death of Agaja, Tegbesu&#x27;s brothers quickly plot to kill him. His brothers surrounded his house to prevent him from reaching the Palace and claiming the throne, but he miraculously escapes and reaches the palace. Despite challenges, the Great Council appoints Tegbesu the new king. Historian Edna Bay notes that oral histories disagree about precisely &quot;who&quot; appointed Tegbesu as the new king.

==Administration==
Tegbesu ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those who it had recently conquered. As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom.

Since he had spent significant time during his youth in Oyo, much of the kingdom was fashioned along administrative aspects of that empire. Tegbesu returned the capital from Allada to Abomey, while creating a puppet king to rule in Allada. He increased the number of wives of the king in order to establish wide family connections throughout the kingdom. The Palace complex was styled along those of Oyo and a number of administrative positions were created that had existed in Oyo. Most notably, Tegbesu had multiple traitors in Ouidah put to death and replaced with individuals loyal to him. In addition, instead of having different administrative positions to deal with each different European power, he created the &quot;Yevogan&quot; in 1745, a central bureaucrat to deal with all European trade.

In addition, Tegbesu&#x27;s rule is the one with the first significant &quot;kpojito&quot; or &quot;mother of the leopard&quot; with Hwanjile in that role. The &quot;kpojito&quot; became a prominently important person in Dahomey royalty. Hwanjile, in particular, is said to have changed dramatically the religious practices of Dahomey by creating two new deities and more closely tying worship to that of the king.

The slave trade increased significantly during Tegbesu&#x27;s reign and begun to provide the largest part of the income for the king, reportedly earning him £250,000 per year (over £56 million adjusted for inflation as of 2020 according to the Bank of England Inflation Calculator).

<doc id="72444" wikidata="Q320976" url="?curid=72444" title="Kpengla">
<text>Kpengla was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1774 until 1789. Kpengla followed his father Tegbessou to the throne and much of his administration was defined by the increasing Atlantic slave trade and regional rivalry over the profits from this trade. His attempts to control the slave trade generally failed, and when he died of smallpox in 1789, his son Agonglo came to the throne and ended many of his policies.

==Rise to power==
The Kingdom of Dahomey had increased significantly in power since the 1720s. King Agaja (1718-1740) had expanded the kingdom to the key Atlantic ports of Whydah and Allada. Agaja&#x27;s son King Tegbessou (1740-1774) had similarly expanded the kingdom. However, the kingdom remained a tributary to the Oyo Empire, owing yearly gifts to the Oyo Empire. The slave trade had increased substantially along the coast with European traders. During the last years of Tegbessou&#x27;s reign, the Oyo Empire began restricting the slave trade through Dahomey and channeling slaves to other ports or to charge high prices through Dahomey. The shortage became so problematic that Tegbessou was forced to sell his own slaves to keep the trade going.

It is not entirely clear whether Kpengla was the named heir of Tegbessou; regardless, upon Tegbessou&#x27;s death, he rushed with armed companions to the Royal Palace to make a claim to the throne. Large scale fighting occurred in the palace and it is reported that 285 women in the palace fighting died. Following this struggle, Kpengla was named king. Kpengla made attempts to improve relations with the Ashanti Empire. Diplomatic missions were exchanged between Asantehene Osei Kwadwo and Kpengla. It may have been through these missions that the Togo hills became recognized as the neutral zone between both states.

==Slave trade policy==
Kpengla became king at a particularly difficult period of history for the kingdom. The slave trade was the major economic resource for the kingdom and the king&#x27;s personal finances, but Oyo and other inland traders had begun raising rates and playing port cities against one another. Kpengla had the opportunity to either improve the kingdom&#x27;s position as middleman or to start slave raiding which would cause anger by Oyo and others. At Kpengla&#x27;s coronation, he vowed to free Dahomey from the Oyo Empire in terms of both ending the tributary status of Dahomey to Oyo and breaking their control over the slave trade.

Kpengla initially attempted to negotiate a situation with the Oyo Empire that would cement the position of Dahomey as middleman between Oyo and the Europeans. The proposal was that Dahomey would destroy eastern slave ports which were taking trade away from Dahomey and Oyo ports, forcing the Europeans to trade with their ports. Kpengla believed that this situation would result in the Oyo moving their trade from rival ports like Porto-Novo into the Dahomey port of Whydah. As a result, Kpengla destroyed Epe in 1782 and Badagry in 1784. Having fulfilled his part of the agreement, Kpengla grew angry when Oyo and Porto-Novo continued to trade actively as a rival port to Whydah.

As a result, Kpengla reformed trade policy to ban all trade in slaves with Oyo in 1786. The next year, he created a royal monopoly over trade at Whydah, controlling all English and French imports (except for Brazilian tobacco). In addition, he set price controls significantly decreasing the price of slaves into the kingdom. Traders who attempted to work around the price controls were executed or sold as slaves themselves. Traders resisted this and decided not to sell slaves at all. Kpengla responded by forcing sale by the traders. These policies resulted in significant movement of trade away from Dahomey and to other ports and so in 1788, he began slave raiding once again.

==Construction==
Kpengla was crucial in significant amount of construction in Abomey and the kingdom. Kpengla may have been the king to establish the royal road of Dahomey, a wide road from Whydah to Cana and then to Abomey. This width of this road and its maintenance were unique in West Africa for the time and the Cana to Abomey stretch was maintained and impressed European visitors for the next century. Lionel Abson, head of the English fort at Whydah, first reported of the project in the 18th century. According to Abson, in 1779 the king;
==Death==
Kpengla died in 1789 from smallpox and his son Agonglo became the new king after a violent struggle in the palace that resulted in hundreds of deaths. Agonglo largely ended Kpengla&#x27;s slave trade restrictions and allowed slave traders to set their own rate.

<text>Agonglo was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1789 until 1797. Agonglo took over from his father King Kpengla in 1789 and inherited many of the economic problems that developed during Kpengla&#x27;s reign. Because of the poor economy, Agonglo was often constrained by domestic opposition. As a response, he reformed many of the economic policies (lowered taxes and removed constrains on the slave trade) and did military expeditions to try to increase the supply for the Atlantic slave trade. Many of these efforts were unsuccessful and European traders became less active in the ports of the kingdom. As a final effort, Agonglo accepted two Portuguese Catholic missionaries which resulted in a large outcry in royal circles and resulted in his assassination on May 1, 1797. Adandozan, his second oldest son, was named the new king.

==Rise to power==
Agonglo was the oldest son of King Kpengla (ruled 1774–1789), who had ruled over a long-term economic crisis in Dahomey. The Oyo empire still had suzerainty over the kingdom and in the time of Kpengla this power of Oyo over the kingdom had resulted in decreased slave trading by Dahomey. Kpengla responded in a variety of ways: first trying to defeat common competitors of both Oyo and Dahomey, then when this failed he ended slave trade with Oyo entirely, raised harsh taxes on slave traders through Dahomey, and resumed slave raiding. These policies largely did not work and the slave trade, which had become the primary trade for Dahomey, slowed significantly.

Political factions were also developing in Dahomey under Kpengla. When Tegbessou (ruled 1740–1774) became king in a contentious selection, two older sons of King Agaja were passed over for selection. The heirs of these two other brothers had slowly increased their power into a distinct rival claim to the throne at Dahomey.

When Kpengla died in 1789, four rival claimants came to the throne: two younger brothers of Kpengla, Fraku or Don Jeronimo (the son of one of the older sons of Agaja), and Agonglo (the oldest son of Kpengla. The Migan and Mehu of Dahomey, who were tasked with selecting the new king, choose Agonglo, but there remained significant political opposition to Agonglo. The selection of Agonglo resulted in such widespread opposition that the political functions of the kingdom largely halted for a year. Agonglo then did a series of conciliatory moves to try to end the opposition: promised to give citizens back some rights, ended constraints on slave traders, reduced taxes, reassigned some of the aggressive tax collectors into the army, and recognized other powerful individuals.

==Administration==
As king, Agonglo attempted a variety of efforts to get the Dahomey economy started but was often constrained by domestic opposition and a major smallpox epidemic. The Oyo empire which had exercised power over Dahomey since 1730 had grown significantly weak in the early 1790s. This culminated in the suicide of the king of Oyo in 1796, which provided Agonglo with the ability to end the tributary status of Dahomey to Oyo. However, while Agonglo was able to act independently, domestic dissent prevented him from directly challenging Oyo power.

Although he reduced many of the restrictions on slave traders that Kpengla had created, he still followed some of the other policies of Kpengla: including slave raiding and attacking rival ports. However, these were generally not successful with multiple unsuccessful raids against the Mahi people to the north and unsuccessful attacks on Little Popo and Porto-Novo. However, in 1795 he was able to lead a successful slave raid against the Mahi, largely by rewarding soldiers with wives before the war, and allied with Grand-Popo was able to successfully disrupt Little Popo&#x27;s slave trade.

Unfortunately these efforts to improve the domestic supply of slaves were of limited impact because of developments impacting the different European countries involved in the slave trade. The British commander in the port city of Whydah had become very slow and unresponsive to British regional efforts and so the British had slowed their trade in the port. At the same time, the French Revolution resulted in France banning the trade on slaves in 1794 (to be restored in 1802) and began an active effort to stop the trade by other countries. In November 1794, the French seized all Portuguese slave ships in the port of Whydah and would continue this practice for the next few years. The result was that Whydah no longer was a safe harbor for the trade and Portuguese slowed their trade.

Agonglo responded by sending three ambassadors to Maria I of Portugal to try to convince her to resume trade with Dahomey. Instead of resuming the trade, Maria sent two Catholic missionaries to Agonglo and encouraged him to convert for continued trade relations. Agonglo accepted the missionaries and expressed a willingness to be converted which caused a significant uproar amongst different factions within the kingdom. It is unknown whether he was sincere in his willingness to be converted or whether it was merely to appease the Portuguese. Agonglo did know about Catholicism, having married the former wife of the commander of the French fort in Whydah, a Dutch-African woman named Sophie who had introduced a Christian shrine into the pantheon of deities worshiped.

Regardless, the willingness for conversion resulted in Dogan, a brother of Agonglo, starting serious efforts to remove Agonglo from power. Lengthy debates in the palace followed and when these efforts failed, on May 1, 1797, Dogan and a woman named Na Wanjile assassinated Agonglo in the palace. According to Akingjogbin, she shot and killed Agonglo, but Edna Bay says that the assassination happened through poisoning. Dogan and Na Wanjile were buried alive for the assassination.

==Succession==
With the execution of Dogan, the Migan and Mehu of Dahomey named Adandozan, the second oldest son of Agonglo, as the new king. Although Adandozan was quite young, he started his reign by punishing all members of the faction that had killed his father executing hundreds and selling the rest into slavery. Those sold into slavery included the future mother of King Ghezo who would replace Adandozan.

<text>Jean-Pierre Louis Rampal (7 January 1922 – 20 May 2000) was a French flautist. Rampal popularised the flute in the post–World War II years, recovering flute compositions from the Baroque era, and spurring contemporary composers, such as Francis Poulenc, to create new works that have become modern standards in the flautist&#x27;s repertoire.

==Early years==
Born in Marseille, the only child of Andrée (née Roggero) and flautist Joseph Rampal. His father Joseph was taught by Hennebains, who also taught Rene le Roy and Marcel Moyse. 

Under the tutelage of his father, Rampal began playing the flute at the age of 12. He studied the Altès method at the Conservatoire, where he won first prize in the school&#x27;s annual flute competition in 1937 at age 16. This was also the year of his first public recital at the Salle Mazenod in Marseille. By then, Rampal was playing second flute alongside his father in the Orchestre des Concerts Classiques de Marseille.

His career in music began without the full encouragement of his parents. Rampal&#x27;s mother and father encouraged him to become a doctor or surgeon as they felt those professions were more reliable than becoming a professional musician. At the beginning of the Second World War, Rampal duly entered medical school in Marseille, studying there for three years. In 1943, authorities of the Nazi Occupation of France drafted him for forced labour in Germany. To avoid this, he fled to Paris, where it was easier to avoid detection, by frequently changing his lodgings.

While in Paris, Rampal auditioned to study flute at the Paris Conservatoire, where he was taught by Gaston Crunelle from January 1944. Years later, he succeeded Crunelle as flute professor at the Conservatoire. After four months, Rampal&#x27;s performance of Jolivet&#x27;s &quot;Le chant de Linos&quot; won him the coveted first prize in the conservatory&#x27;s annual flute competition.

== Post-war success ==
In 1945, following the liberation of Paris, Rampal was invited by the composer Henri Tomasi—then conductor of the Orchestre National de France—to perform the Flute Concerto by Jacques Ibert, written for Marcel Moyse in 1934, live on French National Radio. It launched his concert career and was the first of many such broadcasts.

With the war over, Rampal embarked on a series of performances: at first, within France; and then, in 1947, in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. Almost from the beginning, he was accompanied by pianist and harpsichordist Robert Veyron-Lacroix, whom he had met at the Paris Conservatoire in 1946. By contrast with, as Rampal saw it, his own somewhat emotional Provençal temperament, Veyron-Lacroix was a more refined character (a &quot;true upper class Parisian&quot;), but each found with the other a balanced musical partnership. The appearance of this duo after the war has been described as a &quot;complete novelty&quot;, allowing them to make a rapid impact on the music-going public in France and elsewhere. In March 1949, in the face of some scepticism, they hired the Salle Gaveau in Paris to perform what then seemed the radical idea of a recital programme made up solely of chamber music for flute. It was one of the first flute/piano recitals the city had seen, and caused a &quot;sensation&quot;. The success encouraged Rampal to continue along that track. The recital was repeated the following year in Paris. Throughout the early 1950s, the duo made regular radio broadcasts and gave concerts within France and elsewhere in Europe. Their first international tour came in 1953: an island-hopping journey through Indonesia to ex-pat audiences. From 1954 onwards came his first concerts in eastern Europe—most significantly in Prague, where he premiered Jindrich Feld&#x27;s &quot;Flute Concerto&quot; in 1956. In the same year, he appeared in Canada—where, at the Menton festival, he played for the first time in concert with violinist Isaac Stern, who not only became a lifelong friend but also proved a considerable influence on Rampal&#x27;s own approach to musical expression.

On 14 February 1958, Rampal and Veyron-Lacroix made their US debut with a recital of Poulenc, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Prokofiev in Washington, D.C. at the Library of Congress. In 1959, Rampal gave his first concert in New York City, at the Town Hall. Rampal&#x27;s successful partnership with Veyron-Lacroix produced their 1962 double LP of the complete Bach flute sonatas. They performed and toured together for some 35 years, until the early 1980s, when Veyron-Lacroix was forced to retire owing to ill-health. Rampal then formed a new and also long-running musical partnership with American pianist John Steele Ritter.

While he pursued his career as a soloist, Rampal remained a ensemble player throughout his life. In 1946, he and oboist Pierre Pierlot founded the Quintette a Vent Francais (French Wind Quintet), formed of a group of musical friends who had made their way through the war: Rampal, Pierlot, clarinetist Jacques Lancelot, bassoonist Paul Hongne, and horn-player Gilbert Coursier. Early in 1944, they had played together, broadcasting at night from a secret &quot;cave&quot; radio station at the Club d’essai in rue de Bec, Paris—a programme of music outlawed by the Nazis, including works with Jewish links by composers such as Hindemith, Schoenberg and Milhaud. The Quintet remained active until the 1960s.

Between 1955 and 1962, Rampal took up the post of Principal Flute at the Paris Opera, traditionally the most prestigious orchestral position open to a French flautist. Having been married in 1947 and now a father of two, the post offered him a regular income.

== Recovering the Baroque ==
Rampal&#x27;s first commercial recording, made in 1946 for the Boite a Musique label in Montparnasse, Paris, was of Mozart&#x27;s Flute Quartet in D, with the Trio Pasquier. A key element in Rampal&#x27;s success in the years immediately after World War II—aside from his evident ability—was his passion for the music of the Baroque era. Aside from a few works by Bach and Vivaldi, Baroque music was still largely unrecognised when Rampal started out. He was well aware that his determination to promote the flute as a prominent solo instrument required a wide and flexible repertoire to support the endeavour. Accordingly, he seems to have been clear in his own mind from the beginning about the importance, as a ready-made resource, of the so-called &quot;Golden Age of the Flute&quot;, as the Baroque era had become known. Hundreds of concertos and chamber works written for the flute in the 18th century had fallen into obscurity, and he recognised that the sheer abundance of this early material might offer long-term possibilities for an aspiring soloist.

Even before World War II, he had begun collecting obscure sheet music from the Baroque—making himself familiar with original publishers and catalogues, even though very few published editions were then available. He went on to research in libraries and archives in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Turin, and every other major city he performed in, and corresponded with others across the musical world. From original sources, he developed a detailed understanding of the Baroque style. He studied Quantz and his famous treatise &quot;On Playing The Flute&quot; (1752), and later acquired an original copy of it. For Rampal, the Baroque legacy was fuel to set alight a renewed interest in the flute, and it was his energy in pursuing this goal that set him apart from his forebears. Whereas Le Roy, Laurent and Barrère had all recorded two or three of Bach&#x27;s flute sonatas between 1929 and 1939, between 1947 and 1950 Rampal recorded all of them for Boîte à Musique, and was beginning to regularly perform the complete Bach sonatas in recital, organising them across two evenings. As early as 1950–51 he became the first to record all six of Vivaldi&#x27;s Op.10 concertos, an exercise he was to repeat several times in later years.

In an interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, he offered one explanation for the appeal of Baroque music after the war: &quot;With all this bad mess we had in Europe during the war, people were looking for something quieter, more structured, more well balanced than Romantic music.&quot;
In the process of excavating forgotten works for performance, Rampal also had to discover new ways of playing that era&#x27;s music. He applied his own bright tone and the liveliness and freedom of his style to the original texts, developing along the way a very individual approach to interpretation and, after the Baroque style, to improvised ornamentation. Throughout, Rampal was never tempted to perform on a period instrument; the movement that championed &quot;authentic&quot; instruments for &quot;true&quot; performance of Baroque music had not yet emerged. Instead, he drew on the full range of effects offered by the modern flute to reveal fresh elegance and nuance to Baroque compositions. It was this modernity–the richness and clarity of his sound and the freedom and personality in his expression–combined with a sense of hidden treasures being shared that caught the attention of a wider musical public. &quot;Enchantment is the best possible word to describe this concert&quot;, said one Canadian reviewer for &quot;Le Devoir&quot; in 1956; &quot;Rampal&#x27;s playing struck me through its variety, its flexibility, its colour and above all its liveliness.&quot; This striking effect can be heard on his earliest recordings, between 1946 and 1950. During this period, Rampal quickly benefited from the birth of the long-playing gramophone record. Before 1950, all of his recordings were on 78 rpm discs. After 1950, the 33⅓ rpm long-playing era allowed much greater freedom to accommodate the rate at which he was committing performances to record. At the same time, the birth of the television age ensured Rampal a wider prominence in France than any previous flute-player, through his many concert and recital appearances in the late 1950s and beyond.

A great deal of the material Rampal performed and recorded he also published, supervising sheet music collections in both Europe and the US. In his autobiography, he remarked that he had felt it part of his &quot;duty&quot; to expand as much as possible the repertoire for fellow flautists as well as for himself. In trying to keep the flute before the musical public in the widest sense possible, Rampal also played in as many groups and combinations as he could, a habit he continued for the rest of his life.

In 1952 he founded the Ensemble Baroque de Paris, featuring Rampal himself, Veyron-Lacroix, Pierlot, Hongne, and violinist Robert Gendre. Remaining together over almost three decades, the ensemble proved one of the first musical groups to bring to light the chamber repertoire of the 18th century.

=== Collaborations ===
Through his recordings for labels including L&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre and, from the mid-1950s, Erato, Rampal continued to give new currency to many &quot;lost&quot; concertos by Italian composers such as Tartini, Cimarosa, Sammartini, and Pergolesi (often collaborating with Claudio Scimone and I Solisti Veneti), and French composers including Devienne, Leclair, and Loeillet, as well as other works from the Potsdam court of the flute-playing king Frederick the Great. His 1955 collaboration in Prague with Czech flautist, composer, and conductor Milan Munclinger resulted in a recording of flute concertos by Benda and Richter. In 1956, with Louis Froment, he recorded concertos in A minor and G major by C.P.E. Bach. Other composers of the era, such as Haydn, Handel, Stamitz, and Quantz, also figured significantly in his repertoire. He was open to experimentation; once, through laborious over-dubbing, he played all five parts in an early recording of a flute quintet by Boismortier. Rampal was the first flautist to record most, if not all, of the flute works by Bach, Handel, Telemann, Vivaldi, and other composers who now comprise the core repertoire for flute players.

Rampal extended his researches into the Classical and Romantic eras in order to establish some continuity to the repertoire of his instrument. For example, his first &quot;recital&quot; LP, released in both America and Europe, featured music from Bach, Beethoven, Hindemith, Honegger, and Dukas. Aside from recording familiar composers such as Mozart, Schumann, and Schubert, Rampal also helped bring the works of composers such as Reinecke, Gianella, and Mercadante back into view. From the start, his recital programmes included modern compositions as well. In 1948, as part of his debut recital in Paris, Rampal gave the first Western performance of Prokofiev&#x27;s Sonata for Flute and Piano in D, which in the 1940s was in danger of being co-opted for the violin despite originally having been written for flute. Later, when preparing a new sheet music edition published by the International Music Company of New York, Rampal consulted Russian violinist David Oistrakh to achieve the best result; the piece has since become established as a flute favourite. Over his career, he performed all of the flute masterpieces that were composed in the first half of the 20th century, including works by Debussy, Ravel, Roussel, Ibert, Milhaud, Martinů, Hindemith, Honegger, Dukas, Françaix, Damase, and Feld.

As a chamber musician, he continued to collaborate with numerous other soloists, forming collaborations with violinist Isaac Stern and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. A number of composers wrote especially for Rampal, including Henri Tomasi (&quot;Sonatine pour flûte seule&quot;, 1949), Jean Françaix (&quot;Divertimento&quot;, 1953), André Jolivet (&quot;Concerto&quot;, 1949), Jindřich Feld (&quot;Sonata&quot;, 1957), and Jean Martinon (&quot;Sonatine&quot;). Others included Jean Rivier, Antoine Tisné, Serge Nigg, Charles Chaynes, and Maurice Ohana. In addition, he premiered a works by contemporary composers such as Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Ezra Laderman, David Diamond, and Krzysztof Penderecki. His transcribing in 1968, at the composer&#x27;s own suggestion, of Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s Violin Concerto (recorded 1970) showed Rampal&#x27;s willingness to broaden the flute repertoire further by borrowing from other instruments. In 1978, the Armenian-American composer Alan Hovhaness wrote his Symphony No. 36, which contained a melodic flute part tailored especially for Rampal, who gave the premiere performance of the work in concert with the National Symphony Orchestra.

The only piece dedicated to Rampal that he never publicly performed was the &quot;Sonatine&quot; (1946) by Pierre Boulez, which—with its spiky, explosive figures and extravagant use of flutter-tonguing—he found too abstract for his taste. Elsewhere, when sometimes criticised for not playing enough contemporary avant-garde work—&quot;Avant garde of what?&quot; he would ask—Rampal confirmed his aversion to music that looked &quot;like the blueprints for a plumber... pieces that go tweak, twonk, thump, snort—this doesn&#x27;t inspire me.&quot;

One piece in particular, written with Rampal in mind, has since become a modern standard in the essential flute repertoire. Rampal&#x27;s compatriot Francis Poulenc was commissioned by the Coolidge Foundation of America in 1957 to write a new flute piece. The composer consulted with Rampal regularly on shaping the flute part, and the result, in Rampal&#x27;s own words, is &quot;a pearl of the flute literature&quot;. The official world premiere of Poulenc&#x27;s Sonata for Flute and Piano was performed on 17 June 1957 by Rampal, accompanied by the composer, at the Strasbourg Festival. Unofficially, however, they had performed it a day or two earlier to a distinguished audience of one: the pianist Artur Rubinstein, a friend of Poulenc&#x27;s, was unable to stay in Strasbourg for the evening of the concert itself, and so the duo obliged him with a private performance. Poulenc was then unable to travel to Washington for the US premiere on 14 February 1958, so Veyron-Lacroix took his place, and the sonata became a key offering in Rampal&#x27;s US recital debut, helping launch his long-lived trans-Atlantic career.

== &quot;L&#x27;homme à la flûte d&#x27;or&quot; ==
Rampal was the owner of the only solid gold flute (No. 1375) made, in 1869, by the great French craftsman Louis Lot. Rumours of the survival of the 18-carat gold Lot had been circulating in France for years before the Second World War, but no one knew where the piece had gone. In 1948, almost by chance, Rampal acquired the instrument from an antiques dealer who had wanted to melt the instrument down for the gold—evidently unaware that he was in possession of the flute equivalent of a Stradivarius. With family help, Rampal raised enough funds to rescue the instrument, and went on to perform and record with it for 11 years. In interviews, Rampal said he thought the gold—by contrast with silver—made his naturally bright, sparkling sound &quot;a little darker; the colour is a little warmer, I like it&quot;. Only in 1958, when presented during his debut US tour with a 14-carat gold instrument made after the Lot pattern by the William S. Haynes Flute Company of Boston, did Rampal stop using the 1869 original. After one final recording in London, he consigned the golden Lot to the safety of a bank vault in France, and thereafter made the Haynes his concert instrument of choice.

== Celebrity ==

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Rampal remained especially popular in the US and Japan (where he had first toured in 1964). He toured America annually and was a regular presence at the Mostly Mozart Festival at the Lincoln Center in New York. At his busiest, he performed between 150 and 200 concerts a year.
His range extended well beyond the orthodox: alongside the classical recordings, he recorded Catalan and Scottish folk songs, Indian music with sitarist Ravi Shankar, and, accompanied by the French harpist Lily Laskine, an album of Japanese folk melodies that was named album of the year in Japan. He also recorded Scott Joplin rags and Gershwin, and collaborated with French jazz pianist Claude Bolling. The Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano (1975), written by Bolling especially for Rampal, topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and remained there for ten years. This raised his profile with the American public even further and led, in January 1981, to a TV appearance on Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, where he played &quot;Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark&quot; with Miss Piggy—and, suitably attired, &quot;Ease on Down the Road&quot; in a scene loosely based on the folktale of the Pied Piper.

Back on the classical stage, he was not afraid to be, as he put it, &quot;a bit of a ham&quot;; when performing Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime Dance and Stomp&quot; as a concert hall encore, for example, he provided extra percussion by stamping his feet rhythmically on stage in time to the music.
Meanwhile, Bolling and Rampal came together again for Bolling&#x27;s &quot;Picnic Suite&quot; (1980) with guitarist Alexander Lagoya, the &quot;Suite No. 2 for Flute and Jazz Piano&quot; (1987), and also to perform the instrumental theme song &quot;Goodbye For Now&quot; by Stephen Sondheim for &quot;Reds&quot;, Warren Beatty&#x27;s 1981 movie about the Communist revolution in Russia. His reputation as a celebrity soloist in America became such that, as &quot;Esquire&quot; reported, one critic dubbed him &quot;the Alexander of the flute, with no new worlds to conquer.&quot; Following a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra with the New York Philharmonic in 1976, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote &quot;Mr. Rampal, with his effortless long line, his sweet and pure tone and his sensitive musicianship, is of course one of the great flutists in history.&quot; Throughout these years of mounting celebrity, Rampal continued to research and edit sheet-music editions of flute works for publishing houses including Georges Billaudot in Paris and the International Music Company in the US.

== Achievement ==
Of the primal appeal of the flute, Rampal once told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;For me, the flute is really the sound of humanity, the sound of man flowing, completely free from his body almost without an intermediary[...] Playing the flute is not as direct as singing, but it&#x27;s nearly the same.&quot;

Calling Rampal &quot;an indisputably major artist&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;Rampal&#x27;s popularity was grounded in qualities that won him consistent praise from critics and musicians in the first decades of his career: solid musicianship, technical command, uncanny breath control, and a distinctive tone that eschewed Romantic richness and warm vibrato in favor of clarity, radiance, focus and a wide palette of colorings. Younger flutists assiduously studied and tried to copy his approaches to tonguing, fingering, embouchure (the position of the lips on the mouthpiece) and breathing.&quot;

Throughout the busiest years of his concert career, Rampal continued to find time to teach others, encouraging his students to listen not only to other flute players, but also to take inspiration from other great musical interpreters—be they pianists, violinists, or singers. He maintained a clear opinion about the right balance between &quot;virtuosity&quot; and aspiring to real musical expressiveness. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said, &quot;you have to master all the problems of technique to be free to express yourself through your instrument. You can have a big imagination and a big heart but you cannot express it without technique. But the first quality you must have to be good, to be inspiring, is the sound. Without the sound you cannot achieve anything. The tone, the sound, the sonorité is most important. Otherwise, with the fingers alone it is not enough... everyone these days has the fingers, the virtuosity... but the sound, the tone, that&#x27;s not so easy.&quot;

Following the foundation of the Nice Summer Academy in 1959, Rampal held classes there annually until 1977. In 1969, he succeeded Gaston Crunelle as flute professor at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held until 1981. William Bennett, too, has commented on Rampal&#x27;s infectious enthusiasm for music-making: &quot;his repute came more from his musical sparkle and the happy personality which radiated to the audience&quot;. Bennett had also sought Rampal out for lessons in Paris and was &quot;instantly delighted with him—his humour, and his generosity—especially for his sharing my enthusiasm for other great players such as Moyse, Dufrene &amp; Crunelle&quot;.

Rampal&#x27;s principal American students include concert and recording artist Robert Stallman and Ransom Wilson, who has followed in his mentor&#x27;s footsteps as conductor as well as flautist.

==Family life==

Rampal and his harpist wife Françoise, née Bacqueryrisse, were married on 7 June 1947. They made their home in Paris, living in the Avenue Mozart. They had two children, Isabelle and Jean-Jacques. Each year, they holidayed at their house on Corsica, where Jean-Pierre was able to indulge his passion for boating, fishing and photography. Well known for his love of good food, he liked to maintain a private rule wherever he went on tour that he would eat &quot;only the cuisine of the country&quot; he was in and he looked forward to his post-concert dinners with relish. He developed a particular fondness for Japanese cuisine, and in 1981 wrote an introduction to &quot;The Book of Sushi&quot; written by a chef and a master sushi teacher.
Rampal&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Music, My Love&quot; appeared in 1989 (published by Random House).

== Leaving the stage ==
In later years, Rampal took up the conductor&#x27;s baton with more frequency but he continued to play well into his late 70s. The last work of importance dedicated to him was Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s Flute Concerto which he premiered in Switzerland in 1992, followed by its first performance in America at Lincoln Center. Rampal&#x27;s last public recital was held at the Theatre Villamarta in Jerez de la Frontera (Spain) in November 1999, when he was 77; he performed works by Bach, Mozart, Kuhlau and Mendelssohn. His last recording was made with the Pasquier Trio and flautist Claudi Arimany (trio and quartets by Mozart and Hoffmeister) in Paris in December 1999.

After Rampal died in Paris of heart failure in May 2000 at age 78, French President Jacques Chirac led the tributes, saying &quot;his flute spoke to the heart. A light in the musical world has just flickered out.&quot; Flautist Eugenia Zukerman observed: &quot;He played with such a rich palette of color in a way that few people had done before and no one since. He had an ability to imbue sound with texture and clarity and emotional content. He was a dazzling virtuoso, but more than anything he was a supreme poet.&quot; The trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall in New York, where Rampal had performed 45 times over a 29-year period, hailed him as &quot;one of the greatest flutists of the 20th Century and one of the greatest musical spirits of our time.&quot; The obituary in &quot;Le Monde&quot; claimed him to be no less than &quot;L&#x27;inventeur de la flute&quot; and celebrated all the musical characteristics that charmed audiences worldwide: &quot;la sonorite sublime, la vivacite des phrases, la virtuosite laissaient une impression de bonheur, de joie a ses auditeurs&quot;.

James Galway, Rampal&#x27;s globally known successor as &quot;The Man with the Golden Flute&quot;, dedicated performances to him and recalled elsewhere how as a teenager he had been captivated by the sound of Rampal&#x27;s &quot;fluid technique&quot; and &quot;the beauty of his tone&quot;. For a young musician in the 1960s, he said, listening to Rampal&#x27;s recordings &quot;was a step into the stars as far as flute playing was concerned.&quot; He recalled also the generous encouragement Rampal gave him following their meetings in Paris. Of the passing of his &quot;hero&quot;, Galway added: &quot;He was the first major influence in my life and I am still grateful for everything he ever did for me. He was a great influence on the flute world and the musical world in general, bringing to ordinary folk through his music making a charm which enhanced their everyday lives.&quot;

At Rampal&#x27;s funeral, fellow flautists played the Adagio from Boismortier&#x27;s Second Flute Concerto in A Minor in recognition of his lifelong passion for Baroque music in general and Boismortier in particular.

Jean-Pierre Rampal is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris.

==Honours==
Rampal&#x27;s honours include his Grand Prix du Disques from l&#x27;Académie Charles Cros which included awards for his recording of Vivaldi&#x27;s Op. 10 flute concertos (1954), his recording of concertos by Benda and Richter (1955) with the Chamber Orchestra of Prague (Milan Munclinger), and in 1976 the Grand Prix ad honorem du Président de la République for his overall recording career to date. He also received the &quot;Réalité&quot; Oscar du Premier Virtuose Francais (1964), the Edison Prize; the Prix Mondial du Disque; the 1978 Leonie Sonning Prize (Denmark), the 1980 Prix d’Honneur of the 13th Montreux World Recording Prize for all his recordings; and the Lotos Club Medal of Merit for his lifetime&#x27;s achievement. In 1988, he was created President d’honneur of the French Flute Association &quot;La Traversière&quot;, while in 1991 the National Flute Association of America gave him its inaugural Lifetime Achievement award.

State honours included being made Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur (1966) and Officier de la Légion d’Honneur (1979). He was also made a Commandeur de l’Ordre National du Mérite (1982) and Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et Lettres (1989). The City of Paris presented him with the Grande Médaille de la Ville Paris (1987), and in 1994 he received the Trophée des Arts from the Franco-American French Institute Alliance Française &quot;for bridging French and American Cultures through his magnificent music&quot;. In 1994 the Ambassador of Japan presented Rampal with the Order du Tréasor Sacre, the highest distinction presented by the Japanese government, in recognition of having inspired a new generation of aspiring flute-players in that country. Strangely, with his enduring international fame assured, Rampal himself came to feel in later years that his own reputation within his native France had in some way diminished. It was &quot;curious&quot;, he wrote in &quot;Le Monde&quot; in 1990, that no French music critics appeared to take any notice of his latest recordings: &quot;Everything continues as if I didn&#x27;t exist&quot;, he said; &quot;This doesn&#x27;t matter; I still play to full houses.&quot;
But after his death, there was no shortage of public accolades to reflect the fact that he was indeed a source of national pride.

The Jean-Pierre Rampal Flute Competition, begun in his honour in 1980 and open to flautists of all nationalities born after 8 November 1971, is held tri-annually as part of the Concours internationaux de la Ville de Paris.

In June 2005, the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal was founded in France to perpetuate the study and appreciation of Rampal&#x27;s contribution to the art of flute-playing. Among other projects, which include maintaining the Jean-Pierre Rampal Archive, the association has collaborated in the re-release on the Premier Horizons label of a number of early Rampal performances on CD.

== Discography ==
Throughout his life Rampal was prolific when it came to committing performances to record. He recorded for a wide range of labels in Europe, America and Japan. In his autobiography (&quot;Music My Love&quot;, 1989) Rampal admitted that he himself found it difficult to keep track of the number of recordings he had made over his lifetime. In its obituary of Rampal (June Emerson, 24 May 2000), &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper offered up the customary claim that Rampal “became one of the world&#x27;s most recorded artists, with more than 400 records spanning the essential flute repertoire, quantities of new discoveries and first recordings of hitherto unknown works”. The &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary (Anthony Tommasini, 21 May 2000) agreed, pronouncing him “one of the most-recorded and best-selling classical instrumentalists in history.” Rampal&#x27;s last record label, Sony Classical, went a little further, describing the flutist as perhaps the world&#x27;s single most-recorded classical musician of all.

Rampal&#x27;s earliest recordings, 1946–1950, were on 78 rpm discs, many for the Parisian &quot;Boite a Musique&quot; label. With the opening of the 33 rpm LP era, he recorded for over 20 different labels between 1950 and 1970. Among the most significant of these was the French Erato label, founded in 1953, for whom he made approximately 100 recordings (several issued in the US on the RCA Red Seal label). In 1964 alone he recorded 17 albums, including three complete sets of flute pieces by Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven, in addition to concertos and other works. In 1978, with Ensemble Lunaire, he recorded &quot;Japanese Folk Melodies&quot;, which included three folk songs transcribed by Akio Yashiro but primarily featured music by late 19th and early 20th-century Japanese doyo composers: Tamezō Narita, Kōsaku Yamada, Megumi Ohnaka, Rentarō Taki, Ryūtarō Hirota, Kozaburo Hirai, Nagayo Motohori, and Shin Kusakawa, on CBS Records. In 1979, he signed an exclusive contract with the CBS label (later Sony Classical), and he made over 60 albums for them.

In the years following Rampal&#x27;s death in 2000 many of his recordings spanning more than half a century were re-issued. Of particular note are the several collections produced by the recording companies he was most associated with. 

Jean-Pierre Rampal: Le premier virtuose moderne - The compact disc set, issued in France in 2002 in collaboration with the Association Française de la Flûte, contains rare early performances from 78 rpm records made from 1946 to 1959. Charting the emergence of the young Rampal on record in the post-war years, this 3xCD &quot;Traversieres Flute Collection&quot; collection (Patrimoine, Vol.1) includes a set of five Bach Sonatas (BWV 1030, 1031, 1032, 1020, 1034 – recorded 1947–50); sonatas by Telemann (rec 1949) and Leclair (rec 1950); pieces by Couperin (rec 1950) and Haydn (rec 1950); a concerto for five flutes by Boismortier (rec 1949); a duet in G by Beethoven played with his father Joseph Rampal (rec 1951); and three Mozart quartets (KV 285, 285a and 285b – recorded 1946–50); alongside these are contemporary works by Roussel (rec 1950), Milhaud (rec 1949), Honegger (rec 1949), Dukas (rec 1950), Hindemith (rec 1950), Feld (rec 1959) and Francaix (rec 1955), and Rampal’s earliest recording of Debussy’s ‘Syrinx’ (rec 1949). The accompanying notes by Dennis Verroust of the French Flute Association, June 2002, reveal that in the 1949 Boismortier recording Rampal is not yet the star but plays the third flute part alongside Fernand Dufrene, Robert Rochut, Alphonse Kenvyn and Georges Lussagnet; it also confirms what Rampal himself declared in his autobiography ‘Music, My Love’ that the D major flute quartet (KV 285) by Mozart, with the Trio Pasquier in April 1946, was in fact his first ever recording.

The Association Jean-Pierre Rampal has re-issued a number of early recordings (on the Premier Horizons label and elsewhere), including his 1954 recording of the concerto by Feld, and a range of recordings he made between 1954 and 1966 with orchestras conducted by Karl Ristenpart, with whom he enjoyed a close collaboration. These include works by Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, Tartini, Mozart, Arma, and Jolivet.

Jean-Pierre Rampal: The Complete Erato Recordings (3 vols) - 
In 2015, the &quot;Complete Erato Recordings&quot; made by Rampal were reissued, containing a wealth of material on the label for which he recorded extensively from the early 1950s to the early 1980s. These three volumes, comprising over 40 CDs (vo.1: 1954–63, vol.2: 1963–69, vol.3: 1970–82), stand alongside the Complete HMV Recordings (1951–76 on 12 CDs) also re-issued under the Erato label. 

In 2017 the release of the double CD Jean-Pierre Rampal in Prague: the Complete Supraphon Recordings specifically marked his landmark collaboration in the mid-1950s with Czech conductor and flutist Milan Munclinger, and contains the first recordings of concertos by Benda, Richter, Stamitz and Feld, together with the Prokofiev sonata and other pieces.

Jean-Pierre Rampal: The Complete CBS Masterworks Recordings - 
In 2022, to mark the centenary of Rampal&#x27;s birth, Sony Classical, in collaboration with Association Jean-Pierre Rampal, issued its collection &quot;Jean-Pierre Rampal: The Complete CBS Masterworks Recordings&quot;. Across 56 CDs, this box-set features recordings that Rampal made through the second half of his career, between 1969 and 1996, a period that saw his recording interests transferred to the American company CBS after his earlier and lengthy partnership with the French label Erato. Although the bulk of the CBS recordings are from the classical repertoire, there are also several cross-over albums (e.g. music by Bolling, Gershwin, Joplin, etc). Among many highlights, the collection charts Rampal&#x27;s collaboration with American pianist John Steele Ritter, who in the late 1970s took over as his principal accompanist once illness had caused long-time recital partner Robert Veyron Lacroix to step back from touring.

== Rampal on TV and DVD ==
Rampal made a great number of television concert appearances in France from the late 1950s onwards, and later elsewhere—especially in America and Japan, where his reputation and following remained highest. As the first televised flute-player of any age, the medium contributed to his worldwide popularity in the decades after World War II:

;&quot;Jean-Pierre Rampal&quot;
:&quot;EMI &quot;Classic Archive&quot; DVB 51089991; released 2007 in collaboration with the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal&quot;
: This presents a collection of fine early performances filmed for French TV between 1958 and 1965 and still held in the Institut National de l&#x27;Audiovisuel, the national French television archive. The earliest footage was broadcast on 17 March 1958, in the musical TV series &quot;Les Grandes Interprètes&quot;, soon after Rampal had returned from his successful debut tour of the US.
:He begins with Handel&#x27;s Sonata in F (HWV.369), then plays Debussy&#x27;s &quot;The Little Shepherd&quot; and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Pièce en forme de habanera&quot;, both transcribed for flute and piano; and also Jolivet&#x27;s &quot;Incantation C&quot; for unaccompanied flute. For the Handel, Debussy, and Ravel pieces, he is accompanied by the programme&#x27;s presenter, pianist Bernard Gavoty. After a performance of Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;La Notte&quot; concerto in G minor RV 439 with the Collegium Musicum de Paris (broadcast 8 October 1963) comes a rendition of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Suite in C minor BWV 997 (Paris, 16 April 1963) and the opening Allegro from Bach&#x27;s Sonata in G minor BWV 1020 (Paris, broadcast 28 December 1964), both with Veyron-Lacroix at the harpsichord. More of this duo in recital at the Salle Gaveau in Paris (19 March 1964) appears from the TV series the Jeunesses musicales de France, featuring Couperin&#x27;s Concert Royal No. 4, parts of J. S. Bach&#x27;s Partita in A minor for solo flute and a sonata in B flat, K.15, by Mozart. The two concerto performances that complete the collection, both with the Orchestre Philharmonique de l&#x27;ORTF conducted by Rampal&#x27;s long-time collaborator Louis de Froment, are of Mozart&#x27;s Concerto No. 1 in G, K.313 (Paris, 5 May 1965), and the Ibert flute concerto (Paris, 8 April 1962). Of the Mozart concertos, Rampal said in a BBC Radio 4 interview that he did not like his 1966 recording with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for ERATO because his playing was adversely affected by the uncomfortably high orchestral pitch insisted upon in Vienna. By contrast, he said he preferred his 1978 recording with the ‘Israel Symphony Orchestra’, even though it does not compare particularly well with the earlier TV performance.
;&quot;Francis Poulenc and Friends&quot;
:&quot;EMI &#x27;Classic Archive&#x27; DVB 3102019&quot;
: Rampal, playing the Poulenc flute sonata, is featured twice in this compilation, once with Poulenc himself in 1959 and again after the composer&#x27;s death in 1963. The initial footage, preserved in the national French TV archive, is of a televised concert given by Poulenc in Paris at the Salle Gaveau in 1959. After a brief interview with the composer, Poulenc is joined on set by Rampal to perform the slow &quot;Cantilena&quot; from the flute Sonata. Rampal is seen again later in footage from a TV broadcast in which he plays the complete Flute Sonata, this time accompanied by Veyron-Lacroix. Additional performances of Poulenc&#x27;s music are provided by artists including pianist Jacques Février, cellist Maurice Gendron, baritone Gabriel Bacquier, organist Jean-Jacques Grunenwald, soprano Denise Duval and others, together with the ORTF National Orchestra conducted by Georges Prêtre.
;&quot;The Art of Jean-Pierre Rampal 1956–1966&quot;
:&quot;Video Artists International&quot;
: This is a two-volume DVD compilation featuring a series of Radio-Canada &quot;Telecasts&quot;, broadcast and recorded during the years when Rampal was at the peak of his fame. In this rare footage, retrieved from the archives of CBC Montreal, Rampal is accompanied by Veyron-Lacroix and the McGill Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Brott. The first volume of this set of live broadcasts includes: Boccherini&#x27;s Concerto for Flute and Orchestra in D major (broadcast 1 March 1956); Haydn&#x27;s Concerto for flute, harpsichord and string orchestra in F major, with Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Syrinx for unaccompanied flute&quot; (broadcast 28 March 1957); Couperin&#x27;s Concert Royal IV, with J. S. Bach&#x27;s Sonata for flute and harpsichord in G minor, BWV 1020 (broadcast 27 December 1961). Volume two features Mozart&#x27;s Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K.314, together with the Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K.313 (broadcast 24 February 1966).
;&quot;Bolling: Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano&quot;
: This features a live televised performance from 1976 of Claude Bolling&#x27;s cross-over &quot;Suite&quot; (1973), written for Jean-Pierre Rampal (who plays a classical line to Bolling&#x27;s jazz piano) and which by then had become a runaway success in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Special guest double-bass player Max Hediguer is also featured.

== Radio ==
Apart from the many French Radio broadcasts of performances by Rampal, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute profile, &quot;Rampal–&quot;Prince of Flute Players&quot;&quot;, on 11 October 1983 in the 20:20–21:05 documentary slot. It contained extracts from an interview with Rampal himself, rare for the fact that Rampal gave very few interviews of any length in English. Rampal talks about his life and times and his approach to music-making. Also featured are interviews with English flautist William Bennett, American flautist and Rampal&#x27;s sometime-pupil Elena Duran, and violinist Isaac Stern—who was Rampal&#x27;s long-time friend and musical collaborator. The programme is kept in the BBC Sound Archive, together with the two unedited original interviews with Rampal that it draws on (both recorded by BBC producer Peter Griffiths in London, in January 1981 and November 1982, at the Westbury Hotel, Conduit Street, off Regent Street, where Rampal normally stayed in London).

==Films==
&quot;L. Subramaniam: Violin From the Heart&quot; (1999), directed by Jean Henri Meunier, includes a scene of Rampal performing with L. Subramaniam.

Rampal also makes an appearance in the 1977 educational film &quot;The Joy of Bach&quot;, playing his flute on a rooftop in France.

<text>Adandozan was a king of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1797 until 1818. His rule ended with a coup by his brother Ghezo who then erased Adandozan from the official history resulting in high uncertainty about many aspects of his life. Adandozan took over from his father Agonglo in 1797 but was quite young at the time and so there was a regent in charge of the kingdom until 1804. Dealing with the economic depression that had defined the administrations of his father Agonglo and grandfather Kpengla, Adandozan tried to reduce slavery to decrease European trade, and when these failed reform the economy to focus on agriculture. Unfortunately, these efforts did not end domestic dissent and in 1818 at the Annual Customs of Dahomey, Ghezo and Francisco Félix de Sousa, a powerful Brazilian slave trader, organized a coup d&#x27;état and replaced Adandozan. He was left alive and lived until the 1860s hidden in the palaces while he was largely erased from official royal history.

==Rise to power==
Agonglo&#x27;s (1789-1797) reign had been very contentious ending in his assassination by a brother, Dogan. The slave trade had been largely disrupted for two decades by the Oyo empire, the lack of military success by Dahomey, and European traders changing their focus (the French abolished slavery in 1794 and the British and Portuguese had stopped relying on Dahomey&#x27;s ports). The result was that when Agonglo died there was a large scale upheaval led by various factions, but this ended on May 5, 1797 with the appointment of Adandozan, the second oldest son of Agonglo as the new king. However, because Adandozan was young at the time, the first seven years of his rule were held by a regency of various elder statesmen. In 1804, he became old enough to formally rule with his own authority but the regency members retained importance.

One story contends that Adandozan&#x27;s younger brother Ghezo had actually been named the heir to Agonglo and that Adandozan was merely a regent. However, that Adondozan refused to relinquish the throne when Ghezo was old enough. This story is doubted by historian Akinjogbin as an invention by Ghezo to justify his coup against Adandozan.

==Administration==
Adandozan followed Agonglo&#x27;s policies of trying to revive the slave trade through slave raiding of the Mahi people to the north and disrupting the trade at rival ports (namely Porto-Novo). However, these attempts were generally unsuccessful and with the recovery of the Oyo empire by 1805, they reasserted power and stopped these activities by Adandozan.

Unable to foster the slave trade through military action, he turned to improving diplomacy with European traders. In 1804, he sent ambassadors to Portugal and to the British at Cape Coast Castle. Unlike his father who had received Catholic missionaries from the Portuguese, Adandozan made clear that he had no interest in conversion but requested the Portuguese help him in building mining operations and a gun manufacturing facility in Dahomey. The Portuguese received these requests politely to secure the release of some Portuguese prisoners, but did not agree to the terms. The British had grown highly suspicious of Adandozan when the British officer in the port city of Whydah, who had become a citizen of Dahomey, had died in 1803 and, as per the customs, his wives were taken by the king. His assistant wrote to the British calling Adandozan a tyrant and this increased tension with the British. Adandozan, worried that the British would abandon their fort in Whydah, passed a law that any British person in Dahomey could not leave without a substitute which only ended increasing tensions.

Adandozan responded to the slowing of the slave trade by trying to reform the economy to focus on agricultural production. He increased opportunities for agriculture and made the Corn Customs a primary festival held publicly. While attempting these reforms, changed policies in Europe largely undermined his efforts. The British abolished the slave trade in 1807 and began pressuring other countries in Europe to do the same. As part of these efforts they signed an agreement in 1810 with the Portuguese which allowed slave trade only at ports where the Portuguese already traded slaves and no new ports, Whydah was specifically mentioned as a port which could have trade while Porto-Novo, Badagry, and Little Popo (all rival slave trade ports) could not. The result was a sudden increase in the Portuguese slave trade in Whydah.

The increased slave trade simultaneously undermined the agricultural reforms of Adandozan and increased the power of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a powerful Brazilian slave trader. By 1810, de Sousa had become the wealthiest trader in the city of Whydah and loaned significant amounts of money to Adandozan. When he requested repayment for this loan, Adandozan publicly insulted de Sousa and imprisoned him causing de Sousa to flee to Little Popo. One of Adandozan&#x27;s younger brothers, Ghezo (then called Madogungun), befriended de Sousa and together the plotted a coup to replace Adandozan.

==Coup==
There is little evidence about the last years of Adandozan&#x27;s reign and the specifics of the coup to replace him are detailed very differently in different sources; even the year of the coup is not agreed upon.

In general, it is contended that during the Annual Customs of Dahomey in 1818, Ghezo replaced Adandozan with the help of Adandozan&#x27;s Migan and Mehu (prime ministers). Maurice Ahanhanzo Glélé says that Adandozan was replaced because he had failed economically and then decided to sacrifice his sister, Sinkutin, to have her plead his case to the ancestors. Civil war erupted in the palace and Ghezo was able to bring the various factions together. Edouard Dunglas provides details about the coup saying that Ghezo took the war drum from the palace and then entered the palace standing in the position of the king over the drum. The Migan of Adandozan announces that &quot;two suns cannot shine at the same time&quot; and removes the royal sandals from Adandozan&#x27;s feet. In reality there was apparently significant violence in the coup between different factions and many of Adandozan&#x27;s sons and his entire group of female bodyguards were executed by Ghezo.

==Legacy==
Evidence of Adandozan after the coup are not clear but there were reports in the 1860s that he was left alive and lived until 1861 (three years after Ghezo). He lived much of his later life confined to the palaces, while his descendants changed their name to avoid association, and when he died he was buried quickly but with full royal honors. Historian Edna Bay writes that after the coup &quot;Adandozan suffered a bizarre punishment that was perhaps worse than assassination--to watch history be reworked as though he had never lived.&quot;

Adandozan&#x27;s legacy was reworked significantly by Ghezo and Glele who depicted the former king as a cruel and incompetent ruler who had usurped his throne and erased all official history of Adandozan. His name was largely erased from the history of Dahomey, and to this day is generally not spoken aloud in the city of Abomey. He is not referred to in kings&#x27; lists and is not included in the cloth applique of the kingdom. The traditional stories about Adandozan&#x27;s rule (which are retold, with some changing of names, in Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s novel The Viceroy of Ouidah) portray him as extremely cruel: he is said to have raised hyenas to which he would throw live subjects for amusement; he is pictured slitting a pregnant woman&#x27;s abdomen open on a bet to see whether he could predict the sex of the fetus.

Many historians question the negative portrayal of Adandozan in the official history and common stories about the king and believe that it is the attempt to remove his claim to history. A similar process may have occurred earlier with Queen Hangbe who may have ruled for a brief period in the 1700s.

Although tradition has not been kind to Adandozan, the letters he wrote to various outsiders, especially the kings and other officials of Portugal (who fled to Brazil following the conquest of Portugal by Napoleon) have shown a different picture of his rule. In these letters, Adandozan outlines substantial military campaigns, which he presents as victories, as well as detailing his negotiations with Europeans. Some of these letters were published in work by Pierre Verger in the 1960s. A large cache, found in the Instituto Historico e Geografico Brasileiro and Biblioteca Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, and several of the letters in this collection were examined in an article published by historian Ana Lucia Araujo in the British journal &quot;Slavery and Abolition.&quot; The full text of Adandozan&#x27;s letters, both from the Institute cache and other repositories, as well as a few from his predecessor Agongolo and his successor Gezo were published in (the original) Portuguese in 2013.

<text>The term Ibero-Caucasian (or Iberian-Caucasian) was proposed by Georgian linguist Arnold Chikobava for the union of the three language families that are specific to the Caucasus mountains region of Eurasia. 
* Ibero-Caucasian languages include:
** [[Kartvelian Languages|South Caucasian]], also called Kartvelian.
** [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], also called Abkhazo-Adyghean.
** [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], also called Nakh–Dagestanian.
The Ibero-Caucasian phylum would also include three extinct languages: Hattic, connected by some linguists to the Northwest (Circassian) family, and Hurrian and Urartian, connected to the Northeast (Nakh–Dagestanian) family as Alarodian languages.

== Family status ==
The affinities between the three families are disputed. A connection between the Northeast and Northwest families is seen as likely by many linguists; see the article on the North Caucasian languages for details.

On the other hand, there are no known affinities between South Caucasian and the northern languages, which are two unrelated phyla even in Greenberg&#x27;s deep classification of the world&#x27;s languages. &quot;Ibero-Caucasian&quot; therefore remains at best a convenient geographical designation.

== Family name ==
The &quot;Iberian&quot; in the family name refers to Caucasian Iberia — a kingdom centered in Eastern Georgia which lasted from the 4th century BC to the 5th century AD, and is not related to the Iberian Peninsula.

<doc id="72451" wikidata="Q880285" url="?curid=72451" title="Ghezo">
<text>Ghezo, also spelled Gezo, was King of Dahomey (present-day Republic of Benin) from 1818 until 1858. Ghezo replaced his brother Adandozan (who ruled from 1797 to 1818) as king through a coup with the assistance of the Brazilian slave trader Francisco Félix de Sousa. He ruled over the kingdom during a tumultuous period, punctuated by the British blockade of the ports of Dahomey in order to stop the Atlantic slave trade.

Ghezo ended Dahomey&#x27;s tributary status to the Oyo Empire. Afterwards, he dealt with significant domestic dissent, as well as pressure from the British Empire, to end the slave trade. He promised to end the slave trade in 1852, but resumed slave efforts in 1857. Ghezo was assassinated in 1858, and his son Glele became the new king.

==Rise to power==

Ghezo was a son born with the name Gakpe to King Agonglo and was a younger brother to Adandozan. When Agonglo died, there was a succession struggle between his sons before Adandozan was enthroned. An oral tradition which developed during Ghezo&#x27;s rule, to largely erase Adandozan from official history, says that Adandozan was merely named regent and that he refused to step down for Ghezo when the latter was old enough. This is generally doubted by historians.

Information about the final years of Adandozan&#x27;s administration is very limited, providing only a partial understanding of the situation that resulted in Ghezo&#x27;s rule. What is known is that around 1818, Adandozan imprisoned Francisco Félix de Sousa, a powerful Afro-Brazilian slave trader, when the latter demanded repayment for money loaned to Adandozan. With the help, reportedly, of Nicola d&#x27;Olveira, the son of the Afro-Dutch wife of Agonglo, de Sousa escaped from imprisonment and relocated to Grand-Popo.

While in exile, de Sousa sent gifts and money to Ghezo that Ghezo used to establish support for a challenge to the throne. In the 1818 Annual Customs, it is said that Ghezo appeared holding the war drum in the palace. Upon seeing this, the &quot;Migan&quot; and &quot;Mehu&quot; (prime ministers) removed the royal sandals from Adandozan and named Ghezo the king. It is quite likely that the initial struggle was more violent than this story relates.

According to some versions, Ghezo was not named the ruler at this point, but instead was named the regent to rule until Adandozan&#x27;s son Dakpo was old enough to rule. The story says that this understanding lasted until 1838, when Ghezo instead named his own son, the future king Glele, as the crown prince. At that point Dakpo and Adandozan led a brief fight within the palaces. The fight resulted in a fire that burned part of a palace and killed Dakpo, making Ghezo the clear king of Dahomey.

==Rule==

Ghezo&#x27;s rule was defined by some important military victories, domestic dissent, and transformation of the slave trade economy. Ghezo&#x27;s rule is often remembered as one of the most significant in terms of reform and change to the political order of the kingdom (although some of this is ascribing reforms that happened under Adandozan to Ghezo as part of the erasure of Adandozan&#x27;s rule). In addition to the military victories, domestic dissent, and slave trade, Ghezo is also credited with expanding the arts significantly and giving royal status to many artisans to move to the capital of Abomey.

===Military expansion===

His most significant military victory was over the depleted Oyo empire in 1823. Since 1730, Dahomey had provided yearly tribute to the Oyo empire and some of its economic and military policy was controlled by Oyo interests. However, the Oyo empire had been significantly weakened over the previous 30 years and, with the rise of the Islamic jihad to the north in the Sokoto Caliphate, the empire was unable to secure its tribute from Dahomey.

In the early 1820s, Ghezo refused to pay the annual tribute to Oyo. Oyo and Dahomey fought a small war early in the 1820s. Violence escalated in 1823 when Oyo sent an ambassador to demand tribute and Ghezo killed him. The Oyo responded by organizing a force made up of the Mahi and other regional forces to attack Dahomey. Ghezo defeated these forces at a battle near Paouingnan. Oyo then sent a larger force that was 4,000 strong, including cavalry, and camped near the village of Kpaloko. Ghezo defeated this force by organizing a night raid which resulted in the death of the Oyo leader, Ajanaku, and caused the Oyo troops to retreat.

Although the victories over the Oyo were important, other military engagements in the early years of Ghezo&#x27;s reign were less effective. He suffered losses to the Mahi people to the north of Dahomey and was unable to secure enough individuals to meet slave demands, leading him to sell citizens of Dahomey, a quite unpopular decision.

With the further reduction of Oyo power in the region, Ghezo was more able to expand militarily against the Mahi and the Gbe people to the southwest of Dahomey after the mid-1820s. Following victories in these areas, Ghezo focused the military power on a region which had been between the Oyo empire and Dahomey and had been the target of significant slave raiding. After some significant victories in this area by Dahomey, the city of Abeokuta was founded as a safe-haven for people to be free of slave raiding in an easily defended location. By the 1840s, Abeokuta had become a major power in the area and wars between Abeokuta and Dahomey became regular.

In 1849–50, under the direction of British Governor William Winniett, British naval officer Frederick E. Forbes went on two missions to the court of King Ghezo &quot;in an unsuccessful attempt to convince him to end involvement in the slave trade.&quot;

In 1851, Ghezo organized a direct attack on the city of Abeokuta, but it did not succeed. Ghezo suspended large-scale military operations when he ended the slave trade (1852). However, by 1858, a conservative faction pressured Ghezo to begin large-scale military operations again with an assault on Abeokuta to follow. It is possible that this renewed warfare between the two states led to Ghezo&#x27;s death, with some accounts stating that Abeokuta paid for an assassination of Ghezo (other accounts disagree).

Ghezo is credited with the formation of the Mino as an actual war fighting force. Although the female bodyguard for the king had existed for many kings, Ghezo is said often as the king who transformed them into a force for battle. Historian Edna Bay contends that this may have been a result of a need to gain the support of the female palace guard after they had opposed Ghezo&#x27;s coup against Adandozan. Ghezo did this by raising the status of the female guards, providing them uniforms, giving them additional weapons, and making them a crucial part of war policy.

===Domestic dissent===
Domestic dissent was a significant problem throughout Ghezo&#x27;s reign with different forces contesting his rule. Initially, after the coup against Adandozan, Ghezo had to secure support from a number of different individuals who helped bring him to power. Although he had initially presented himself as able to restore militaristic practices to Dahomey, which he argued Adandozan was unable to do, the early losses in his reign to the Mahi made him very unpopular. It is even reported that in 1825, he offered to return Adandozan to power but that Adandozan refused, hoping for a popular uprising against Ghezo.

To secure the support of different powerful people, Ghezo provided many of them with important positions. To secure the support of other princes, he appointed two of his brothers as the &quot;Migan&quot; and &quot;Mehu&quot; and transformed these into hereditary positions which they could pass to their sons. Since de Sousa was of crucial importance in Ghezo&#x27;s rise to power, he named de Sousa the &quot;Chacha&quot; at Whydah, a position which would be the principal trade official in that port (and would also be passed to de Sousa&#x27;s son). As a symbolic strike against Adandozan&#x27;s legacy, Ghezo appointed Agontime his &quot;Kpojito&quot; (or queen-mother, an important post in the Kingdom of Dahomey). Agontime was a wife of Agonglo, sometimes claimed to be the mother of Ghezo, who was sold into slavery when Adandozan came to power because she supported a rival to the throne. In São Luís, in the state of Maranhão, she would have founded the Casa das Minas (House of Minas), an important temple that originated the Tambor de Mina, an Afro-Brazilian religion, establishing the cult of the ancestors of the royal family (voduns). According to some versions, Ghezo was able to secure her release from Brazil and bring her back to the kingdom, although evidence of this is not clear.

When ending the slave trade became the crucial issue in the 1840s and 1850s, there developed two distinct factions which historian John C. Yoder has called the &quot;Elephant&quot; and the &quot;Fly&quot; parties. Ghezo was the head of the Elephant faction which supported opposition to the British demands to end the slave trade and was supported by key officials and the representatives of de Sousa. The Fly faction, in contrast, supported ending the slave trade and accommodating British demands. The Fly faction grew more powerful with the British naval blockade of 1852 and Ghezo eventually agreed to end the slave trade; however, the Elephant faction and the interests of de Souza&#x27;s family remained important for the rest of his reign. Historian Robin Law largely believes that the elite factionalism to Ghezo developed in 1856 when he had reduced the slave trade. In that year, a faction for the resumption of the slave trade formed, headed by the &quot;Migan&quot; and &quot;Yovogan&quot; (governor of Whydah) which pushed Ghezo toward resuming the slave trade in 1857.

One additional way that Ghezo maintained domestic support was by lengthening the ceremony cycle in the 1850s with additions to the Annual Customs including a ceremony for the palm oil trade, one to celebrate ending tribute to the Oyo empire, and one dedicated to Ghezo himself (but to the time when he was a prince).

==Slave trade==
When King Ghezo ascended the throne in 1818, he was confronted by two immediate obstacles: the Kingdom of Dahomey was in political turmoil, and it was financially unstable. First, he needed to gain political independence by removing the hold that the Yoruba empire of Oyo had over the Dahomey since 1748. Secondly, he needed to revitalize the Dahomey economy. Both of these objectives relied on the slave trade. King Ghezo implemented new military strategies, which allowed them to take a physical stand against the Oyo, who were also a major competitor in the slave trade. He also put stipulations on Dahomey&#x27;s participation in the slave trade. Under his reign, no longer would the Dahomey be traded, as they were under his brother&#x27;s, Adandozan, leadership. Dahomey would focus on capturing people from enemy territories and trading them instead. 

While Brazil&#x27;s demand for slaves increased in 1830, the British started a campaign to abolish the slave trade in Africa. The British government began putting significant pressure on King Ghezo in the 1840s to end the slave trade in Dahomey. King Ghezo responded to these requests by saying he was unable to end the slave trade because of domestic pressure. Ghezo added:
The slave trade is the ruling principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth…the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery He additionally explained to the British that the entire region had become dependent on the trans-Atlantic slave trade for profit, so ending it in one day would destabilize his kingdom and lead to anarchy. King William Dappa Pepple of Bonny and Kosoko took the same stance towards the British requests. Instead, King Ghezo proposed an expansion of palm oil trade, which according to historian Augustus Adeyinka, would have led to the gradual abolishment of the slave trade. However, Dahomey&#x27;s palm oil production ran on domestic slavery.

His domestic support had shifted as well, with the declining power of Francisco Felix de Sousa and his death in 1849. By 1850, King Ghezo was on the verge of war with the Egbas of Abeokuta, the new Yoruba capital that arose after the Oyo Empire dissolved. The Egbas, who did not participate in slavery, had set their sights on becoming the new palm oil capital of the region; a title King Ghezo needed to steer the Dahomey Kingdom away for slavery. Ebgas gained the advantage by welcoming Europeans, including missionaries and traders, into Abeokuta. This strategy allowed the Egba to obtain new firearms and other weapons that the Dahomey Amazons did not yet possess. Jealous of the attention and goods that the Egba were received from the British and fearful of what it would mean for Dahomey, King Ghezo decided to act. That same year, he told Consul Beecroft and Commander Forbes that he planned to attack Abeokuta, and if the British didn&#x27;t help him end the palm oil trade in Abeokuta by evacuating the capital, Dahomey would also see the British as an enemy. The issue with this demand is that Abeokuta and Badagry had become headquarters for British missionaries, who sought to &quot;civilize&quot; the Yoruba locals. Thus, Britain sided with the Egba, effectively undermining King Ghezo and the Dahomey&#x27;s ability to flourish in the palm oil trade and leaving them no means to end their involvement in the slave trade without dissolving the Kingdom of Dahomey.

Vastly outnumbered and outgunned, King Ghezo joined forces with King Kosoko, the Oba of Lagos. Together, they created a plan for the Dahomey to attack Abeokuta while Lagos attacked Badagry simultaneously. In March 1851, the attack was carried out, and the Egba triumphed with British support. It became known as the Battle of Abeokuta. Following the defeat of Dahomey against Abeokuta and the establishment of a British naval blockade on the ports of Dahomey, King Ghezo appealed to the British government and proposed to end the slave trade immediately if the British were willing to pay reparations to Dahomey for their loss of income from slave trading, as Britain had done to slave owners in its Caribbean colonies for freeing their slaves. After they rejected his offer, King Ghezo continued to trade slaves, since palm oil was no longer a lucrative option.

By January 1852, British pressure forced Ghezo to sign an agreement (along with both the &quot;Migan&quot; and the &quot;Mehu&quot;) with the British. The agreement specified that Ghezo was to end the slave trade from Dahomey. The British believed that Ghezo never implemented the provisions of this treaty, although he believed he did comply by stopping slave trade through Dahomey&#x27;s ports even though he allowed slaves to be traded from Dahomey to other ports and then sold into the slave trade.

The decrease in the slave trade resulted in additional reforms during the last years of Ghezo&#x27;s rule. He significantly reduced the wars and slave raids by the kingdom and in 1853 told the British that he reduced the practice of human sacrifice at the Annual Customs (possibly ending sacrifice of war captives completely and only sacrificing convicted criminals) However, these positions were reversed dramatically in 1857 and 1858 as Ghezo became hostile to the British; he revived slave trade through the port of Whydah, and in 1858, Dahomey attacked Abeokuta. The decision to attack Abeokuta had been resisted by Ghezo, but there was significant domestic pressure on Ghezo that the attack had been allowed to happen.

==Death and succession==
The details of Ghezo&#x27;s death are different depending on the historical source. It is claimed that there was a prophecy made in the early 1850s that if Ghezo attacked the city of Ekpo, under the control of Abeokuta, he would die as a result. This may explain his resistance to the war against them in 1858. Regardless, he died very soon after the campaign in 1859. Various causes of death have been suggested, including poisoning by Dahomey priests upset at the ending of human sacrifice, smallpox, or death in battle. However, he was likely assassinated by a sniper hired by his enemies from Abeokuta.

During the last years of his life, his heir Glele became the leader of the faction that wanted the resumption of the slave trade. Glele was the official heir, but he was not the oldest son; he was challenged in his attempt to rule but was supported by the conservative faction. Many of the reforms attempted by Ghezo were partially undermined by Glele, who began slave trading, warfare, and human sacrifice to some extent.

==In popular culture==
Ghezo is featured in the novel &quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser, as well as in Frank Yerby&#x27;s 1971 novel, &quot;The Dahomean.&quot; He is also mentioned in the historical novel &quot;Segu&quot; by Maryse Condé, which notes the prophecy that he would die of smallpox. King Gezo is mentioned in Anni Dominguez’s 2021 novel &quot;Breaking the Maafa Chain&quot;, in which the Royal Navy rescues a young slave from sacrifice in his kingdom. In the 1957 film &quot;Band of Angels&quot;, former slave trader Hamish Bond (Clark Gable) tells stories about Ghezo&#x27;s exploits, referring to the origins of the slave trade in Dahomey.

Today, a major Benin Armed Forces base in Cotonou is named &#x27;Camp Ghezo&#x27; after the former king.

Actor John Boyega portrays a fictionalized Ghezo in the 2022 American historical epic film &quot;The Woman King&quot;.

<text>Glele, or Badohou (died December 29, 1889), was the tenth King of Dahomey, ruling from 1858 until his suicide in 1889.
==Life==
Badohou, who took the throne name Glele, is considered (if Adandozan is not counted) to be the tenth King of the Aja kingdom of Dahomey (part of modern-day Benin). He succeeded his father, Ghezo, and ruled from 1858 to 1889. 

Glele continued his father&#x27;s successful war campaigns, in part to avenge his father&#x27;s death, and to capture slaves. During his rule he sustained Dahomey&#x27;s renaissance as a center of palm oil sales and slave trade. Glele also signed treaties with the French, who had previously acquired a concession in Porto-Novo from its king. The French were successful in negotiating with Glele and receiving a grant for a customs and commerce concession in Cotonou during his reign. Glele resisted British diplomatic overtures, however, distrusting their manners and noting that they were much more activist in their opposition to the slave trade: though revolutionary France itself had outlawed slavery at the end of the 18th century it allowed the trade to continue elsewhere; Britain outlawed slavery in the United Kingdom and its overseas possessions in 1833, and had its navy make raids against slavers along the West African coast starting in 1840.

Glele&#x27;s symbols are the lion and the ritual knife of the adepts of Gu (Vodou of fire, iron, war, and cutting edges). His favorite wife was Visesegan. Another wife was the Yoruba-speaking high official Miagbe, with whom he had three sets of twin offspring, the eldest of whom was Yaya Migansi; Miagbe was rewarded by being honoured with an independent household, land and servants.

Glele, despite the formal end of the slave trade and its interdiction by the Europeans, and New World powers, continued slavery as a domestic institution: his fields were primarily cared for by slaves, and slaves became a major source of &#x27;messengers to the ancestors&#x27; (sacrificial victims) in ceremonies. In 1860, he met with William Foster, captain of the &quot;Clotilda&quot;, the final ship to (illegally) take slaves to the United States, presumably to approve the sale.

Near the end of Glele&#x27;s reign, relations with France deteriorated due to Cotonou&#x27;s growing commercial influence and differences of interpretation between Dahomey and France over the extent and terms of the Cotonou concession grant. Glele died suddenly just before the French arrived for negotiations, possibly by suicide. Glele&#x27;s son Prince Kondo handled negotiations with the French.

Glele died on December 29, 1889, to be succeeded by his son Kondo, who took the name Béhanzin.

<text>Signs is a 2002 American science fiction horror thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and produced by Shyamalan, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Sam Mercer. The film was produced by Blinding Edge Pictures and The Kennedy/Marshall Company. It was distributed by Buena Vista Pictures through the Touchstone Pictures label theatrically, and by Touchstone Home Entertainment in home media format. Starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, the story focuses on a former Episcopal priest named Graham Hess who discovers a series of crop circles in his cornfield and that the phenomenon is a result of extraterrestrial life. &quot;Signs&quot; explores the themes of faith, kinship, and extraterrestrials.

&quot;Signs&quot; premiered in theaters on August 2, 2002. The film was a financial success, grossing $408 million on a $72 million budget, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2002, and was met with positive reviews from critics, with many praising its atmosphere, cinematography, score and story, but others criticizing aspects of the script. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including those from the Online Film Critics Society and the Empire Awards. The film also won an award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. The high definition Blu-ray Disc edition of the film featuring the director&#x27;s audio commentary, the making of the film and deleted scenes was released in the United States on June 3, 2008. The original motion picture soundtrack, which was composed by James Newton Howard, was released on the opening day by the Hollywood Records label.

==Plot==

Former Episcopal priest Graham Hess lives on a rural farm in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, with his asthmatic preteen son, Morgan, and young daughter, Bo. Graham&#x27;s younger brother Merrill, a failed minor league baseball player, has been helping the family since Graham&#x27;s wife Colleen died in a traffic collision six months earlier. Graham abandoned the church in the aftermath of the incident.

When large crop circles appear in the Hess&#x27; cornfield, they are initially attributed to vandals. However, other crop circles, and lights from invisible objects hovering over many of Earth&#x27;s cities, begin appearing globally. One night, Graham and Merrill chase a figure into the field. Over the next several days, Graham glimpses another among the corn stalks, followed by strange clicking noises broadcast through Bo&#x27;s old baby monitor. To the family&#x27;s continued terror, news footage emerges out of Brazil showing, undeniably at that point, an alien that can blend into its surroundings.

After receiving a phone call from Ray Reddy, the man responsible for his wife&#x27;s death, Graham travels to Reddy’s home, finding him sitting in his car outside. Expressing remorse for Colleen&#x27;s death, he warns Graham that one of the aliens is locked inside his pantry. Believing the aliens avoid water, he leaves for a lakeside. Graham enters the house and uses a kitchen knife to peer under the pantry door. A clawed hand emerges and swipes at Graham; he cuts off the fingers in a panic.

As the aliens’ worldwide invasion begins, the family barricades themselves inside their house, taking shelter in the basement when the aliens break in. Morgan has an asthma attack but survives the night. The family emerges the next morning after the radio reports the aliens have abruptly abandoned Earth as if something scared them off.

The alien previously trapped inside Reddy&#x27;s pantry enters the house and takes Morgan hostage. Recalling Colleen&#x27;s dying words, Graham tells Merrill to &quot;swing away&quot; using his baseball bat. The alien sprays Morgan with toxic gas from its wrist. Graham recovers his stricken son as Merrill engages the creature, discovering during the fight that water is toxic to the aliens. Merrill gradually weakens the alien by smashing several glasses of water, left by Bo throughout the house, at the creature, eventually killing it with a strike to the head that spills water from a glass on the creature’s face. Outside, Graham administers Morgan&#x27;s medication, realizing that his son&#x27;s constricted lungs prevented him from inhaling the toxins; an act that Graham attributes to the intervention from a higher power.

Months later, the Hess family has recovered from the ordeal and Graham returns to the church.

==Production==

M. Night Shyamalan was a fan of the film &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; and cast Rory Culkin and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo required surgery for a tumor behind his ear and was unable to work on the film, so a week before filming the role was recast with Joaquin Phoenix. The role of Graham was originally written to be an older man. Shyamalan approached Paul Newman for the role, but he declined due to lack of interest, and he also approached Clint Eastwood, who declined due to scheduling conflicts.

Shyamalan has said that the film&#x27;s concept is the combination of two ideas – a family finding a crop circle on their property, and an &quot;end of the world&quot; premise.
&quot;Signs&quot; was filmed in 2001. All scenes shot on location were filmed in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The scenes of the house and cornfield were shot inside the campus of Delaware Valley University, an agricultural college, where they had of land to use. The scenes in the bookstore and the pizza shop were filmed in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and the pharmacy scene was shot in Morrisville, Pennsylvania.

==Soundtrack==
All music was composed by James Newton Howard. The score was conducted by Pete Anthony and performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony.

===Critical reception for soundtrack===
The soundtrack generally received positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic stated in his review that: With &quot;Signs&quot;, composer James Newton Howard again joins director M. Night Shyamalan for their third collaboration following &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, and clearly the film presents another thrilling encounter with the supernatural. From his opening &quot;Main Theme,&quot; Howard ratchets up the tension, and his music thereafter alternates only between the ominous and the suspenseful. He overloads his lower tones, employing eight basses, five percussionists, and even a tuba, but also uses a large string section for short, fast, repetitive figures meant to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. This is not particularly imaginative music, just good old Saturday afternoon scary movie fare, the only distinguishing characteristic about it – consistent with Shyamalan&#x27;s style – that it is so relentless. There&#x27;s just no let up; dread pervades every moment of the director&#x27;s films, to the point of emotional exhaustion for some, and the score has to have the same uncompromising approach, which can make it a little hard to take when listened to all the way through. 

==Reception==
===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 237 critics, with an average rating of 6.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With &quot;Signs&quot;, Shyamalan proves once again an expert at building suspense and giving audiences the chills.&quot; On Metacritic, the film scored 59 out of 100 based on 36 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, writing: &quot;M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;Signs&quot; is the work of a born filmmaker, able to summon apprehension out of thin air. When it is over, we think not how little has been decided, but how much has been experienced ... At the end of the film, I had to smile, recognizing how Shyamalan has essentially ditched a payoff. He knows, as we all sense, that payoffs have grown boring.&quot; Geoff Pevere of The Toronto Star gave the film a scoring of three out of five stars, saying &quot;Ultimately, &quot;Signs&quot; -- as original, interesting and ambitious as it is -- is a post-9/11 movie of possibly the most dubious sort.&quot; Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars; she praised the casting and Shyamalan&#x27;s direction, saying his &quot;only flaw was not leaving anything to the audience&#x27;s imagination&quot;.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film one star out of four, thinking that the film had &quot;few thoughts and no thrills.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy criticized the film for its lack of originality, writing: &quot;After the overwrought &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and now the meager &quot;Signs&quot;, it&#x27;s fair to speculate whether Shyamalan&#x27;s persistence in replicating the otherworldly formula of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; might not be a futile and self-defeating exercise.&quot; A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions&quot; and that the theme of paternal grief &quot;is articulated here with a heavy-handed, incoherent sentimentality that smothers real emotion.&quot; On the theme of faith, he concludes: &quot;Mr. Shyamalan never gives us anything to believe in, other than his own power to solve problems of his own posing, and his command of a narrative logic is as circular – and as empty – as those bare patches out in the cornfield.&quot;

In 2004, the Brazilian birthday party scene was ranked at No. 77 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.&quot;

In a 2007 interview, Bong Joon-ho cited the film as an inspiration for his 2006 monster film &quot;The Host&quot;. He added: &quot;Even though it deals with the alien invasion rather than creatures, I liked the fact that the film focused on the Mel Gibson‘s family not on the aliens.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Signs&quot; grossed $60,117,080 from 3,264 theaters in its opening weekend. At the time of its release, the film had the second-highest August opening weekend, behind &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. It was the biggest opening weekend of Mel Gibson&#x27;s career, surpassing &quot;Ransom&quot;, and earned more than Disney&#x27;s previous best for a live-action non-sequel, not based on existing popular source material, held by &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. The film went on to gross $227,966,634 domestically and $180,281,283 internationally, for a total of $408,247,917 worldwide. It ranked only behind &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in Shyamalan&#x27;s box office success and grossing more than &quot;The Village&quot; and &quot;Split&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Signs&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on January 7, 2003.

The DVD release includes some deleted scenes:
* &quot;Flashbacks 1 and 2&quot;: Two scenes with Graham&#x27;s wife, Colleen. In the first, she sits with a toddler Morgan and baby Bo in a rocking chair while Graham watches. In the second, she dances with him. She hums the same tune in both scenes.
* &quot;The dead bird&quot;: With no sound, this scene shows Graham going back home from Ray&#x27;s, and after a short time, a dead bird near the road (after supposedly hitting an invisible forcefield) is shown.
* &quot;The attic door and the third story&quot;: The longest deleted scene, it starts with Merrill finding out about the not-boarded attic door. Despite Graham&#x27;s efforts to call him back, Merrill goes up the stairs and manages to hold the door by climbing up a chair and putting his hands at the door. Trying to help, Graham looks for a way to hold the door. He gets a tall shelf and places it under the door. Knowing this is only a temporary solution, Graham gets his family and takes them to the kitchen and puts some chairs at the door to hold the aliens out of the room. There, he tells the &quot;third story&quot;, about Merrill, in which he dislocated his arm. While Graham is telling the story, the shelf is destroyed from the attic door slamming on top of it repeatedly and the aliens gain access to the house. Everyone goes down to the basement, the only safe room available, as the aliens begin forcing the kitchen door open.

In addition to being a THX certified release, the DVD also featured a documentary and storyboards. It was the second top DVD video rental in the United States during the first quarter of 2003, earning in US DVD rental revenue by March 2003.

<doc id="72458" wikidata="Q2366953" url="?curid=72458" title="Béhanzin">
<text>Gbehanzin also known as Béhanzin ( – 10 December 1906) is considered the eleventh (if Adandozan is not counted) King of Dahomey, modern-day Republic of Benin. Upon taking the throne, he changed his name from Kondo.

Following his father Glele&#x27;s suicide, Béhanzin ascended the throne in January 1890 and ruled until 1894, when he was defeated by the French in the Second Franco-Dahomean War and exiled to Martinique. Béhanzin was Dahomey&#x27;s last independent ruler established through traditional power structures. He led the resistance to French colonization of his kingdom, during the Dahomey Wars.

==Biography==
Béhanzin was seen by his people as intelligent and courageous. He saw that the Europeans were gradually encroaching on this section of the West African Coast, and as a result attempted a foreign policy of isolating the Europeans and rebuffing them. As prince just before the death of his father Glele, Béhanzin declined to meet French envoy Jean Bayol, claiming conflicts in his schedule due to ritual and ceremonial obligations.

=== First Franco-Dahomean War ===
In March 1889, Dahomey attacked a village on the Ouémé whose chief was under the protection of the French. After remarking that the flag of the tricolour would protect him, the Fon commanded one of his Dahomey Amazons to behead him and wrap his head in the flag. France responded by fortifying the city of Cotonou, which had been ceded to them by a Dahomey representative in Ouidah, increasing its forces with French Senegalese and Gabonese soldiers, and arresting local Dahomey officials who had been continuing to collect customs in the port. Skirmishes also broke out with local militias. On March 4, 1890, a Dahomey army of several thousand charged the log stockade around Cotonou at approximately 5 in the morning. The French army stood fast due to superior weaponry, strategy and the advantageous position they had prepared. Eventually Béhanzin&#x27;s forces were forced to withdraw. While there were few losses on the French side, the Dahomey suffered the loss of several hundred soldiers (129 within French lines).

After regrouping, Dahomey sent its forces south to attack the French-protected city of Porto-Novo ruled by King Toffa I. A force of 350 French soldiers assisted by 500 of King Toffa&#x27;s soldiers intercepted Béhanzin&#x27;s force of 9000 warriors in the Battle of Atchoukpa. While the local Porto-Novo soldiers were routed during the initial Dahomey charge, the French forces formed infantry squares to protect themselves and successfully repelled the Dahomey, suffering only 8 casualties to the Dahomey&#x27;s 1500.

On 3 October 1890, Dahomey signed a treaty recognizing the kingdom of Porto-Novo as a French protectorate. Béhanzin was also forced to definitely cede Cotonou.

=== Second Franco-Dahomean War ===
The peace lasted two years, but both sides continued to buy arms in preparation for another battle. In 1892, the soldiers of Abomey attacked villages near Grand Popo and Porto-Novo in an effort to reassert the older boundaries of Dahomey. King Béhanzin rejected complaints by the French, who proceeded to declare war.

The French further justified the annexation of Dahomey by characterizing the Dahomeans as savages in need of civilizing, and pointing to the human sacrifice of slaves made to the royal ancestors at the annual ceremonies known as annual customs and at a king&#x27;s death, as evidence of this savagery. Dahomey was already at odds with other colonial empires for their practice of attacking and enslaving neighboring kingdoms, both for domestic slaves (including human sacrifice), and trans-atlantic trade, which came at odds with the British Empire&#x27;s anti-slavery campaign during the 19th century.

The French also pointed to the existence of the women&#x27;s militia that protected the king, whom the Fon referred to simply as &quot;Minon&quot; (or &quot;mothers&quot;), but the French called Amazons after the fierce women warriors of Greek mythology. These women soldiers were thought to have become common in the Fon army due to the extreme losses suffered by Dahomey during wars with neighboring kingdoms. Some official French propaganda from the period may be seen in prints depicting these so-called Amazons. One source claims that in one of the battles an Amazon killed a French officer by ripping out his throat with her sharpened teeth. Parallel accounts of the event handed down in Benin describe the Amazon as a trusted wife of Béhanzin who had sworn to avenge members of the royal family who had been executed by Béhanzin for treachery after divulging battle plans in return for bribes from French agents. The French officer she is said to have killed was allegedly the head of French military intelligence who committed the &#x27;savage&#x27; act of corrupting family members to betray their own. The Amazon was reduced to using her teeth after her ammunition ran out at the battle&#x27;s peak.

Through superior intelligence gathering, superior strategy, superior weaponry, bribery, and a campaign of psychological warfare that included cutting down most of the sacred trees in the Oueme and Zou, the French defeated Dahomey, one of the last African kingdoms to succumb to European colonization, with very few French losses. Instead of attacking Abomey directly by marching straight north from Calavi just north of Cotonou, French General Alfred Dodds attacked from Porto-Novo, moving up the Oueme valley until he was within striking distance of Abomey, via Cove and Bohicon, while the Fon continued to pattern their attacks in predictable melee combat style just before dawn, with shorter machete weapons and swords that had difficulty breaking disciplined French Bayonet lines.

Over a series of battles and guerilla warfare by the Fon attempting to slow the French march towards the Dahomey capital of Abomey, the French were victorious, sustaining only 85 casualties to the estimated 2000 to 4000 killed among the Fon. On November 5, 1892, following the loss of the royal palace, Béhanzin sent a truce mission to the French forces, but it failed. King Béhanzin, refusing to let the capital fall into enemy hands, burned and evacuated the city. He and the remnants of the Dahomey army fled north as the French entered the capital on 17 November, and installed Béhanzin&#x27;s brother Agoli-agbo as the new King. After failing to rebuild his army, King Béhanzin eventually surrendered to the French on 15 January 1894. He lived out the remainder of his life in exile in Martinique and Algeria. 

After his death, his remains were returned to Abomey. His throne and his sculptures of wood, copper, iron and silver are now in the Musee Quai Branly, and have been the topic of important discussions about their return to the Republic of Benin.

Béhanzin was succeeded by Agoli-agbo, his brother and one-time Army Chief of Staff, the only potential ruler with whom the French were willing to negotiate.

== Artistic representation ==
Each of Dahomey&#x27;s kings was represented in sculpture with images that referred to the proverbs, associations, and wordplay attached to his royal name. The images that symbolize Behanzin (or Gbehanzin) include an egg held by a hand, as the words for these in the Fon language form a rebus, or pun, of the royal name. As may be seen in the large wooden statue from the royal palace at Abomey, the shark is a metaphor for Behanzin; as does the shark, the king guards the coast of the kingdom of Dahomey. 

A captive hanging from a flagpole is a reference to a man from the Nago, or Yoruba, city of Ketou, a powerful rival state. This prisoner had boasted that he could attack the king with magic, but Behanzin hanged him from a flagpole as punishment for his rebellion. The king&#x27;s most famous symbol is the smoking pipe. This is because he claimed that there wasn&#x27;t a minute in his life, even when he was a baby, that he was not smoking tobacco.

<doc id="72459" wikidata="Q45105" url="?curid=72459" title="Oswald von Wolkenstein">
<text>Oswald von Wolkenstein (1376 or 1377 in Pfalzen – August 2, 1445, in Meran) was a poet, composer and diplomat. In his diplomatic capacity, he traveled through much of Europe to as far as Georgia (as recounted in &quot;Durch Barbarei, Arabia&quot;).

He was dubbed a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre and was also inducted into the Order of the Jar and the Order of the Dragon. He lived for a time in Seis am Schlern.

==Life==
Oswald&#x27;s father was Friedrich von Wolkenstein and his mother was Katharina von Villanders. When he was ten years old, Oswald left his family and became a squire of a knight errant. Oswald described the journeys undertaken by him in the following 14 years in his autobiographical song &quot;Es fügt sich...&quot;. He mentioned his travels to Crete, Prussia, Lithuania, Crimea, Turkey, the Holy Land, France, Lombardy (i.e. what is known today as Northern Italy) and Spain, as well as being shipwrecked in the Black Sea.
After the death of his father in 1399, Oswald returned to the County of Tyrol and began a quarrel with his older brother Michael about their inheritance. From 1401 to 1402, Oswald participated in the failed Italian expedition of King Rupert of Germany. In 1407 he and his brother agreed on how to split the inheritance: Oswald received a third of Castle Hauenstein and the accompanying estates in Seis am Schlern. The other two-thirds of the castle belonged to a knight named Martin Jäger, but Oswald did not respect the property situation, occupying the entire castle and appropriating Jäger&#x27;s share of the tithe. In 1408, in preparation for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Oswald paid for a memorial stone to be installed on the wall of the cathedral in Brixen. The stone has survived and shows him in the garb of a Crusader, with the long beard associated with pilgrims. Before he left, he wrote several songs for his beloved, Anna Hausmann, the wife of the Brixner burgher Hans Hausmann. After his return in 1410, he acquired the right to take up residence in Neustift Monastery, an Augustiner-Chorherren cloister near Brixen.

In 1414 Oswald became a member of the entourage of Friedrich IV, Duke of Austria and Count of Tyrol, at the Council of Constance (1414–18); a portrait of Oswald can be found in the council&#x27;s chronicle (by Ulrich von Richental). Oswald entered as a diplomat in the service of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary. His first diplomatic voyage brought him to England, Scotland and Portugal, where he participated in the conquest of the Moorish city of Ceuta. In 1416 he joined King Sigismund in France and they traveled together back to Constance.
In 1417 Oswald married Margarete von Schwangau, with whom he would have seven children. Later that year he returned to Tyrol, where he joined the &quot;Elefantenbund&quot;, an alliance of noblemen against Friedrich IV, who had been banned by King Sigismund for aiding the flight of Antipope John XXIII from the Council of Constance. With the help of the local population, especially the peasants, Friedrich was able to resist the King and the nobles and from 1418 onwards Friedrich pursued his enemies within Tyrol vigorously. In September 1421 Oswald was lured by his lover Anna Hausmann into a trap and apprehended by Martin Jäger, who brought Oswald to Innsbruck and handed him over to Count Friedrich. In March 1422 Friedrich, in exchange for a surety of 6,000 ducats and an oath to abjure all vengeance, released Oswald for five months so that Oswald could settle his debts with Martin Jäger and other nobles. Oswald could not reach an agreement with his enemies and did not show up in Tirol Castle on August 24, 1422, opting rather to ride to Hungary, where he met King Sigismund. Together they plotted a war against Friedrich. The war was started by Oswald&#x27;s brother Michael who wrote to Friedrich on September 5, 1422: &quot;Therefore I want to be your enemy and be in an alliance with your enemies.&quot;

In 1423 open hostilities culminated in the siege of Castle Greifenstein, during which Oswald with both his brothers was part of the castle&#x27;s garrison. The siege was lifted in November 1423 through a successful sally. However, because the burghers and peasants of Tyrol and the bishop of Brixen supported Count Friedrich, most of the nobles, including both brothers of Oswald, surrendered on December 17, 1423. Few nobles chose to continue to fight. The most prominent were Hans von Villanders, the brothers Ulrich and Wilhelm von Starkenberg, who successfully defended Castle Greifenstein for years to come, and Oswald, who was the last to surrender.

In 1424 things calmed down and Oswald commissioned the Neustift Monastery to create a manuscript of his songs. The calmness of the year was due to the new &quot;Binger Kurverein&quot; (Alliance of Bingen) by the Empire&#x27;s Kurfürsten against Sigmund, who could not afford to fight three wars at once: the planned one against Friedrich, the brewing one against the &quot;Kurverein&quot; and the ongoing one against the Hussites. On February 17, 1425, King and Count made peace at Castle Hornstein; Oswald was present.

Oswald returned to Tyrol to find himself completely penniless. Count Friedrich insisted on the payment of the 6,000 ducat surety. Oswald tried in vain to get hold of the money and fled Tyrol. In 1425 he resided in Castle Neuhaus near Gais, which at this point was not yet part of the County of Tyrol, but part of the County of Görz. Friedrich immediately used the peace with King Sigismund to renew the siege of Castle Greifenstein.

After Wilhelm von Starkenberg&#x27;s capitulation on November 26, 1426, Oswald was the last nobleman feuding with Count Friedrich, and was summoned to the Landtag in Bolzano. Oswald again fled Tyrol, but his flight was discovered. He was apprehended near Wasserburg on Lake Constance, brought back to Tyrol, and imprisoned in Castle Vellenberg (later Castle Sonnenburg) in Innsbruck. Oswald now had no choice but to make peace with Count Friedrich, who forced him to pay Martin Jäger a compensation in exchange for the stolen tithes, and in the process allowed Oswald to acquire full ownership of Castle Hauenstein and its estates. Furthermore, Oswald had to swear to refrain from any contact with nobles from outside Tyrol unless sanctioned by Count Friedrich.

In 1428, Oswald broke his oath and traveled to Heidelberg to meet Kurfürst Ludwig von der Pfalz, Archbishop of Cologne, Count Dietrich II von Moers and Duke Adolf VII von Jülich, with the aim to garner the help of the League of the Holy Court in a dispute with his cousin Hans von Villanders, who owed Oswald 2,200 ducats. While there, Oswald entered into a fray between the Domkapitel of Brixen and the new Prince-Bishop of Brixen, Ulrich Putsch (died 1437), who was a friend of Martin Jäger, a confidante of Count Friedrich, and soon-to-be bishop chancellor of the County of Tyrol. The clash culminated in a coup on October 30, 1429, supported by Friedrich and led by Oswald against the bishop, who while being a prisoner of Oswald was beaten publicly by him. Initially, King Sigismund backed Oswald, but when informed by the other side in the dispute, both Sigismund and Friedrich switched sides and reinstated bishop Ulrich.

In 1430 King Sigismund summoned the nobles of the Holy Roman Empire to a Reichstag in the city of Nuremberg and Oswald with his brother Michael immediately left Tyrol to meet the King, who instead of going directly to Nuremberg undertook a two-month detour to the South German cities of Überlingen and Constance to celebrate Christmas. During this period, Oswald wrote many songs of an erotic nature, the most famous being &quot;Ain Graserin&quot; (KL 76) about a bathing maid, whose &quot;frizzy hair&quot; between her legs leads a man to have sex with her on the spot. In Nuremberg, Oswald became a member of the first rank of the Order of the Dragon, a rank King Sigismund awarded only to two dozen nobles. Along with the honor came the obligation to participate in Sigismund&#x27;s disastrous expedition against the Hussites in Bohemia in 1431. Oswald experienced firsthand the mass flight of the 130,000-strong Imperial army on August 14, 1431, when the entire army panicked after sighting the 50,000-strong Hussite army approaching and singing.

Sigismund sent Oswald back to Tyrol to prepare the county for an expected Hussite invasion of the Empire and invited the Hussites to the Council of Basel to negotiate. Sigismund himself fled to Milan and later to Piacenza under the pretext that he had to go to Rome to be crowned emperor. During this time Oswald commissioned the Neustift Monastery to create a second manuscript collection of his songs. Sigismund called him to join him in Piacenza and Oswald obliged. The unpleasantness of his visit inspired him to write the complaint-song &quot;Wer die ougen vil verschüren&quot;, which he set to a French melody. In May of the same year, Oswald was sent by Sigismund to Basel. After over a year of negotiations, Sigismund was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on May 31, 1433, by Pope Eugenius IV, with Oswald probably in attendance.

During the next years, Oswald&#x27;s life settled down, and almost no reports of fights, brawls or trials are preserved. This changed with the death of Count Friedrich on June 24, 1439. As the heir Sigismund was only twelve years old at the time, a guardian had to be found until Sigismund came of age. The Landstände of Tyrol choose Sigismund&#x27;s uncle Friedrich V, Duke of Austria. The contracts of the guardianship were put in Oswald&#x27;s care. Oswald used the opportunity to seek the assistance of Friedrich V in his eighteen-year-long legal wrangling with Hans von Villanders over bonds Oswald had given his cousin to hold.

When the guardianship of Sigismund ended on July 25, 1443, and Friedrich, now King Friedrich III of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to prolong it for another six years, the Landstände of Tyrol organized an open revolt. Oswald became one of five military commanders and was tasked with the defense of the most important of all positions, the &quot;Mühlbacher Klause&quot; (Mühlbach fortress), which blocked the most likely invasion route from Styria, where King Friedrich had taken up residence. The cities of Merano and Bolzano provided funds and troops to reinforce the fortress, and all other passes and entrances into Tyrol were blocked by troops. As the city of Trento backed the King, an army of 3,000 men was sent south to besiege the city. On December 10, a Tyrolean delegation arrived in Graz to demand the release of Sigismund and the return of the county&#x27;s treasures, taken by Friedrich in 1440. Friedrich refused and threatened war. The Tyroleans responded by sacking Trento and electing Johann Röttel as the new bishop on January 4, 1440. Röttel&#x27;s first declaration was to fully support the Landstände against the King. Oswald was one of the electors and the main instigator of this election. The next session by the Landstände began in Merano on May 16, 1445, and as it was now clear that King Friedrich was not planning an attack, options were discussed on how to bring Sigismund to Tyrol.
Oswald died on August 2, 1445, in Merano, succumbing to an intense heatwave. His offices were taken over by Ulrich von Matsch. His body was brought to Neustift Monastery in Vahrn and buried near the font in the monastery&#x27;s church, where his grave was rediscovered in 1973.

==Oswald&#x27;s right eye==
All extant portraits of Oswald depict him with a closed right eye. An examination of his skull from a 1973 exhumation revealed that this was due to a congenital defect: his right eye socket was smaller than the left, which meant that his right eyeball was under constant pressure, resulting in ptosis, or a withering of the right eyelid muscles. However, Franz Daxecker concludes that the ptosis was probably caused by an injury sustained in childhood. Dieter Kühn&#x27;s biography of Oswald, which attributes the &quot;loss&quot; of the right eye to an archery mishap when the boy was eight years old, is now generally discredited. A popular theory that the eye was lost during the siege of Greifenstein Castle in 1423 is also implausible, as portraits of Oswald from 1408 already depict him with a drooping eyelid.

==Distinctions==
* Knight of the Holy Sepulchre
* Order of the Jar
* Order of the Dragon

==Compositions==

He is one of the most important German composers of the Middle Ages. There are three main topics of his work: travel, God and sex.
Oswald&#x27;s poems are preserved in three manuscripts:
* MS A (Vienna), 42 songs completed in 1425, with an addition of another 66 poems from 1427 to 1436.
* MS B (Innsbruck): 1432
* MS C (Innsbruck-Trostburg): 1450, a copy of B.

MSs A and B were completed under the supervision of Oswald himself, and both contain a depiction of the author, qualifying as one of the earliest authentic depictions of a German author.

<doc id="72462" wikidata="Q33852" url="?curid=72462" title="Northwest Caucasian languages">
<text>The Northwest Caucasian languages, also called West Caucasian, Abkhazo-Adyghean, Abkhazo-Circassian, Circassic, or sometimes Pontic languages (from Ancient Greek, &quot;pontos&quot;, referring to the Black Sea, in contrast to the Northeast Caucasian languages as the &quot;Caspian languages&quot;), is a family of languages spoken in the northwestern Caucasus region, chiefly in three Russian republics (Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay–Cherkessia), the disputed territory of Abkhazia, Georgia, and Turkey, with smaller communities scattered throughout the Middle East.

The group&#x27;s relationship to any other language family is uncertain and unproven. One language, Ubykh, became extinct in 1992, while all of the other languages are in some form of endangerment, with UNESCO classifying all as either &quot;vulnerable&quot;, &quot;endangered&quot;, or &quot;severely endangered&quot;.

The Northwest Caucasian languages possess highly complex sets of consonant distinctions paired with a lack of vowel distinctions, often providing archetypical cases of vertical vowel systems, also known as &quot;linear&quot; vowel systems.

== Main features ==

=== Phonetics ===

Linguistic reconstructions suggest that both the richness of the consonantal systems and the poverty of the vocalic systems may be the result of a historical process, whereby vowel features such as labialization and palatalization were reassigned to adjacent consonants. For example, ancestral may have become and may have become , losing the old vowels and but gaining the new consonants and . The linguist John Colarusso has further postulated that some instances of this may also be due to the levelling of an old grammatical class prefix system (so may have become ), on the basis of pairs like Ubykh vs. Kabardian and Abkhaz &quot;heart&quot;. This same process is claimed by some to lie behind the development of labiovelars in Proto-Indo-European, which once neighboured Proto-NWC.

==== Lack of distinctive vowels and wealth of distinctive consonants ====

The entire family is characterised by a paucity of phonemic vowels (two or three, depending upon the analysis) coupled with rich consonantal systems that include many forms of secondary articulation. Ubykh (Ubyx), for example, had two vowels and probably the largest inventory of consonants outside Southern Africa.

===Grammar===
Northwest Caucasian languages have rather simple noun systems, with only a handful of cases at the most, coupled with highly agglutinative verbal systems that can contain almost the entire syntactic structure of the sentence. All finite verbs are marked for agreement with three arguments: absolutive, ergative, and indirect object, and there are also a wide range of applicative constructions. There is a split between &quot;dynamic&quot; and &quot;stative&quot; verbs, with dynamic verbs having an especially complex morphology. A verb&#x27;s morphemes indicate the subject&#x27;s and object&#x27;s person, place, time, manner of action, negative, and other types of grammatical categories.

All Northwest Caucasian languages are left-branching, so that the verb comes at the end of the sentence and modifiers such as relative clauses precede a noun.

Northwest Caucasian languages do not generally permit more than one finite verb in a sentence, which precludes the existence of subordinate clauses in the Indo-European sense. Equivalent functions are performed by extensive arrays of nominal and participial non-finite verb forms, though Abkhaz appears to be developing limited subordinate clauses, perhaps under the influence of Russian.

==Classification==


There are five recognized languages in the Northwest Caucasian family: Abkhaz, Abaza, Kabardian or East Circassian, Adyghe or West Circassian, and Ubykh. They are classified as follows:
* Northwest Caucasian family
** Abkhaz–Abaza (Abazgi)
*** Abaza (49,800 speakers)
*** Abkhaz (190,110 speakers)
** Circassian
*** Adyghe (590,000)
*** Kabardian (1,685,000)
** Ubykh †
===Circassian dialect continuum===

Circassian (Cherkess) is a cover term for the series of dialects that include the literary languages of Adyghe and Kabardian.

====Adyghe====
Adyghe is one of the more widely spoken Northwest Caucasian languages. It has 500,000 speakers spread throughout Russia and the Middle East: 280,000 in Turkey; 125,000 in Russia, where it is official in the Republic of Adygea; 45,000 in Jordan, 25,000 in Syria, 20,000 in Iraq, and 4,000 in Israel. There is even a small community in the United States. Four main dialects are recognised: Temirgoy, Abadzekh, Shapsugh and Bzhedugh, as well as many minor ones such as Hakuchi spoken by the last speakers of Ubykh in Turkey. Adyghe has many consonants: between 50 and 60 consonants in the various Adyghe dialects but it has only three phonemic vowels. Its consonants and consonant clusters are less complex than the Abkhaz–Abaza dialects.
====Kabardian====
Kabardian has just over one million speakers: 550,000 in Turkey and 450,000 in Russia, where it is an official language of the republics of Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay–Cherkessia. Kabardian has the fewest consonants of any North-Western Caucasian language, with 48, including some rather unusual ejective fricatives and a small number of vowels. Kabardian itself has several dialects, including Terek, the literary standard, and Besleney, which is intelligible with both Terek and Adyghe. Unlike the Adyghe, Kabardian lost many of the consonants that existed in the Proto-Circassian language, for example, the consonants became .

===Abkhaz–Abaza (Abazgi) dialect continuum===
====Abkhaz====
Abkhaz has 100,000 speakers in Abkhazia (a &quot;de facto&quot; independent republic, but a &quot;de jure&quot; autonomous entity within Georgia), where it is the official language, and an unknown number of speakers in Turkey. It has been a literary language from the beginning of the 20th century. Abkhaz and Abaza may be said to be dialects of the same language, but each preserves phonemes which the other has lost. Abkhaz is characterised by unusual consonant clusters and one of the world&#x27;s smallest vowel inventories: It has only two distinctive vowels, an open vowel /a/ and a mid vowel /ə/. Next to palatalized or labialized consonants, /a/ is realized as [e] or [o], and /ə/ as [i] or [u]. There are three major dialects: Abzhuy and Bzyp in Abkhazia and Sadz in Turkey.

====Abaza====
Abaza has some 45,000 speakers, 35,000 in Russia and 10,000 in Turkey. It is a literary language, but nowhere official. It shares with Abkhaz the distinction of having just two phonemic vowels. Abaza is phonologically more complex than Abkhaz, and is characterised by large consonant clusters, similar to those that can be found in Georgian. There are two major dialects, Tapant and Ashkhar. Some are partially intelligible with Abkhaz.

===Ubykh===
Ubykh forms a third branch, with parallels to both Adyghe and Abkhaz. The population switched to speaking Adyghe, and Ubykh became extinct on 7 October 1992, with the death of Tevfik Esenç. A dialectal division within Ubykh was suspected by Georges Dumézil, but the divergent form he described in 1965 was never investigated further. With eighty-one consonants, Ubykh had perhaps the largest inventory in the world aside from the Kx&#x27;a and Tuu families of southern Africa with their extensive system of clicks. There are pharyngealised consonants and a four-way place contrast among sibilants. It was the only Northwest Caucasian language never to have a literary form.

== Relationship to other language families ==
A number of factors make the reconstruction of the Northwest Caucasian proto-language problematic:
* most roots in Northwest Caucasian languages are monosyllabic, and many are single consonants;
* the sound changes are often intricate, and the numerous consonants and sibilant contrasts provide further complexity;
* ablaut was extensive and still plays some part in the modern languages;
* borrowings between languages of the family were frequent;
* extensive homophony occurs in the modern languages.

For these reasons, Proto–Northwest Caucasian is widely accepted as being one of the most difficult proto-languages to deal with, and it is therefore more difficult than most to relate to other families.

===Connections to Hattic===
Some scholars have seen affinities between the Northwest Caucasian (Circassian) family and the extinct Hattic language. Hattic was spoken in Anatolia (Turkey), in the area around ancient Hattusa (modern Boğazköy), until about 1800 BCE, when it was replaced by the Indo-European Hittite language. The name Hetto-Iberian (or Proto-Iberian) was proposed by Georgian historian Simon Janashia for a superfamily comprising the North and South Caucasian languages, Hattic and other languages of ancient Anatolia. (The &quot;Iberian&quot; in the name refers to Caucasian Iberia, a kingdom centered in eastern Georgia which existed from the 4th century BCE to the 5th century CE; it is not related to the Iberian Peninsula.)

Many Northwest Caucasian (Adygean) family names have prefixes like &quot;Hath&quot; or &quot;Hatti&quot;, and one Adyghe tribe has the name &quot;Hatuqwai&quot; () (From Хьаты (&quot;Hatti&quot;) + Кхъуэ (&quot;male or son&quot;); meaning &quot;HattiSon&quot;).

===Connections to Indo-European===
It has been conjectured that the North-West Caucasian languages may be genetically related to the Indo-European family, at a time depth of perhaps 12,000 years before the present. This hypothesised proto-language is called Proto-Pontic, but is not widely accepted.

There does at least appear to have been extensive contact between the two proto-languages, and the resemblances may be due to this influence.

===Higher-level connections===

A few linguists have proposed even broader relationships, of which the Dene–Caucasian hypothesis is perhaps the most popular. Dene–Caucasian links the North Caucasian (including Northwest Caucasian), Basque, Burushaski, Yeniseian, Sino-Tibetan, and Na–Dene families. However, this is an even more tentative hypothesis than Nostratic, which attempts to relate Kartvelian, Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic, etc., and which is widely considered to be undemonstrated.

<text>Agoli-agbo is considered to have been the twelfth and final King of Dahomey. He was in power from 1894 to 1900.

==Biography==
He took the throne after the previous king, Béhanzin, went into exile after being defeated in the invasion of Dahomey by France in the Second Franco-Dahomean War.

The exile of Béhanzin did not legalize the French colonization. The French general Alfred-Amédée Dodds offered the throne to every one of the immediate royal family, in return for a signature on a treaty establishing a French protectorate over the Kingdom; all refused.

Finally, on January 15, 1894, Béhanzin&#x27;s Army Chief of Staff Prince Agoli-agbo (whose name meaning &quot;the dynasty has not fallen&quot;), brother of Béhanzin and son of King Glélé, signed. He was appointed to the throne, as a &#x27;traditional chief&#x27; rather than head of state of a sovereign nation, by the French when he agreed to sign the instrument of surrender.

He &#x27;reigned&#x27; for only six years, assisted by a French Viceroy. The French prepared for direct administration, which they achieved on 12 February 1900. As the Indigénat exacerbated the exploitation, Agoli-agbo went into exile in Gabon.

In 1910, he was allowed to return and to live in the Save Region. He occasionally returned to Abomey in order to perform ancestor worship for the departed kings.

Agoli-agbo&#x27;s symbols are a leg kicking a rock, a bow (a symbol of the return to traditional weapons under the new rules established by the colonial administrators), and a broom, and the last king of Dahomey.

At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Papirius, Fidenas, Mamercinus, Lanatus and Poplicola (or, less frequently, year 367 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 387 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* End of the Corinthian War:
:* Peace of Antalcidas (or &quot;the king&#x27;s peace&quot;) is brokered by Artaxerxes II. Under the Peace, all the Asiatic mainland and Cyprus remain under Persian control, Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros remain Athenian dependencies, and all the other Greek states are to receive autonomy. By the King&#x27;s Peace, the Persians become key players in Greek politics.
:* Under the threat of Spartan intervention, Thebes disbands its league, and Argos and Corinth end their shared government. Corinth is incorporated back into Sparta&#x27;s Peloponnesian League.
*Plato founds the Platonic Academy in Athens, where he teaches Aristotle until 347 BC.

==== Sicily and Adriatic ====
* With the aid of the Lucanians, Dionysius I of Syracuse devastates the territories of &quot;Thurii&quot;, &quot;Crotone&quot;, and &quot;Locri&quot; in mainland Italy. When Rhegium falls, Dionysius becomes the chief power in Greek Southern Italy. He then turns his attention to the Adriatic and founds the colonies of Ancona (Ankon) and Adria (Adrìa).
* Plato is forced by Dionysius to leave Syracuse after having exercised the right of free speech too broadly. Plato returns to Athens, outside which he founds a school.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Rome begins to rebuild after being invaded by the Gauls under Brennus.
* Marcus Furius Camillus introduces the Capitoline Games (Ludi Capitolini) in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus, and in commemoration of Rome&#x27;s Capitol not being captured by the Gauls.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="72465" wikidata="Q159675" url="?curid=72465" title="Tributary">
<text>A tributary, or an affluent, is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream (&quot;main stem&quot; or &quot;parent&quot;), river, or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries, and the main stem river into which they flow, drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean.

The Irtysh is a chief tributary of the Ob river and is also the longest tributary river in the world with a length of .
The Madeira River is the largest tributary river by volume in the world with an average discharge of .

A confluence, where two or more bodies of water meet, usually refers to the joining of tributaries.

The opposite to a tributary is a distributary, a river or stream that branches off from and flows away from the main stream. Distributaries are most often found in river deltas.

==Terminology==
&quot;Right tributary&quot;, or &quot;right-bank tributary&quot;, and &quot;left tributary&quot;, or &quot;left-bank tributary&quot;, describe the orientation of the tributary relative to the flow of the main stem river. These terms are defined from the perspective of looking downstream, that is, facing the direction the water current of the main stem is going. In a navigational context, if one were floating on a raft or other vessel in the main stream, this would be the side the tributary enters from as one floats past; alternately, if one were floating down the tributary, the main stream meets it on the &quot;opposite&quot; bank of the tributary. This information may be used to avoid turbulent water by moving towards the opposite bank before approaching the confluence.

An &quot;early tributary&quot; is a tributary that joins the main stem river closer to its source than its mouth, that is, before the river&#x27;s midpoint; a &quot;late tributary&quot; joins the main stem further downstream, closer to its mouth than to its source, that is, after the midpoint.

In the United States, where tributaries sometimes have the same name as the river into which they feed, they are called forks. These are typically designated by compass direction. For example, the American River in California receives flow from its North, Middle, and South forks. The Chicago River&#x27;s North Branch has the East, West, and Middle Fork; the South Branch has its South Fork, and used to have a West Fork as well (now filled in).

Forks are sometimes designated as right or left. Here, the handedness is from the point of view of an observer facing upstream. For instance, Steer Creek has a left tributary which is called Right Fork Steer Creek.

These naming conventions are reflective of the circumstances of a particular river&#x27;s identification and charting: people living along the banks of a river, with a name known to them, may then float down the river in exploration, and each tributary joining it as they pass by appears as a new river, to be given its own name, perhaps one already known to the people who live upon its banks. Conversely, explorers approaching a new land from the sea encounter its rivers at their mouths, where they name them on their charts, then, following a river upstream, encounter each tributary as a forking of the stream to the right and to the left, which then appear on their charts as such; or the streams are seen to diverge by the cardinal direction (north, south, east, or west) in which they proceed upstream, sometimes a third stream entering between two others is designated the &quot;middle&quot; fork; or the streams are distinguished by the relative height of one to the other, as one stream descending over a cataract into another becomes the &quot;upper&quot; fork, and the one it descends into, the &quot;lower&quot;; or by relative volume: the smaller stream designated the &quot;little&quot; fork, the larger either retaining its name unmodified, or receives the designation &quot;big&quot;.

==Ordering and enumeration==
Tributaries are sometimes listed starting with those nearest to the source of the river and ending with those nearest to the mouth of the river. The Strahler stream order examines the arrangement of tributaries in a hierarchy of first, second, third and higher orders, with the first-order tributary being typically the least in size. For example, a second-order tributary would be the result of two or more first-order tributaries combining to form the second-order tributary.

Another method is to list tributaries from mouth to source, in the form of a tree structure, stored as a tree data structure.

<text>A distributary, or a distributary channel is a stream channel that branches off and flows a main stream channel. It is the opposite of a &quot;tributary&quot;, a stream that flows another stream or river. Distributaries are a result of river bifurcation and are often found where a river approaches a lake or an ocean and divides into distributary networks; as such they are a common feature of river deltas. They can also occur inland, on alluvial fans, or where a tributary stream bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream. In some cases, a minor distributary can divert so much water from the main channel that it can later become the main route.

==Related terms==
Common terms to name individual river distributaries in English-speaking countries are &quot;arm&quot; and &quot;channel&quot;. These terms may refer to a distributary that does not rejoin the channel from which it has branched (e.g., the North, Middle, and South Arms of the Fraser River, or the West Channel of the Mackenzie River), or to one that does (e.g. Annacis Channel and Annieville Channel of the Fraser River, separated by Annacis Island).

In Australia, the term &quot;anabranch&quot; is used to refer to a distributary that diverts from the main course of the river and rejoins it later. In North America such a branching river is called a &quot;braided river&quot;.

==North America==
In Louisiana, the Atchafalaya River is an important distributary of the Mississippi River. Because the Atchafalaya takes a steeper route to the Gulf of Mexico than does the Mississippi, over several decades the Atchafalaya has captured more and more of the Mississippi&#x27;s flow, after the Mississippi meandered into the Red River of the South. The Old River Control Structure, a dam which regulates the outflow from the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya, was completed by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1963. The dam is intended to prevent the Atchafalaya from capturing the main flow of the Mississippi and stranding the ports of Baton Rouge and New Orleans.

In British Columbia, Canada, the Fraser River has numerous sloughs and side-channels which may be defined as distributaries. This river&#x27;s final stretch has three main distributaries: the North Arm and the South Arm, and a few smaller ones adjoining them.

Examples of inland distributaries:
* Teton River—a tributary of Henrys Fork in Idaho—splits into two distributary channels, the North Fork and South Fork, which join Henrys Fork miles apart.
* Parting of the Waters National Landmark within Wyoming&#x27;s Teton Wilderness on the Continental Divide where North Two Ocean Creek splits into two distributaries, Pacific Creek and Atlantic Creek, which ultimately flow into their respective oceans.
* Kings River (California) has deposited a large alluvial fan at the transition from its canyon in the Sierra Nevada mountains to the flat Central Valley. Distributaries flow north into the Pacific Ocean via the San Joaquin River and south into an endorheic basin surrounding Tulare Lake.
* The Qu&#x27;Appelle River, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, is a distributary of the South Saskatchewan River. Its flow is controlled by the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam. This dam forms the southern arm of Lake Diefenbaker.

==South America==
The Casiquiare canal is an inland distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, forming a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and Amazon river systems. It is the largest river on the planet that links two major river systems.

==Europe==

*The IJssel, the Waal and the Nederrijn (Lower Rhine) are the three principal distributaries of the Rhine. These are formed by two separate bifurcations within the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta.
*The Akhtuba River is a major distributary of the Volga. The bifurcation occurs close to, but before, the Volga Delta.
* The Tärendö River in northern Sweden is an inland distributary, far from the mouth of the river. It begins at the Torne River and ends at the Kalix River.
* The Little Danube in Slovakia branches off from the Danube near Bratislava, and flows into the Vah before rejoining the main river near Komárno. The area in the middle is the largest freshwater island in Europe.
* The Abbey River, Limerick, in Ireland is a distributary arm of the River Shannon. It rejoins the Shannon to form an island upon which King John&#x27;s Castle is built. 
==Asia==
===Eastern Asia===

The Huai River in China splits into three streams. The main stream passes through the Sanhe Sluice, goes out of the Sanhe river, and enters the Yangtze River through Baoying Lake and Gaoyou Lake. On the east bank of Hongze Lake, another stream goes out of Gaoliangjian Gate and enters the Yellow Sea at the port of Bidan through Subei Guan&#x27;gai Zongqu, the main irrigation channel of Northern Jiangsu); its total length is 168 kilometers. The third stream leaves the Erhe lock on the northeast bank of Hongze Lake, passes the Huaishuhe River to the north of Lianyungang city, and flows into Haizhou Bay through the Hongkou.

===Southeast Asia===

The Tha Chin River and Noi River are distributaries of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand, splitting off from the latter about 200 kilometers upstream from the Bay of Bangkok.

The Brantas River in East Java, Indonesia, branches off into two distributaries, Mas River, also known as Surabaya River, and Porong River.

The Hong River in Northern Vietnam has notable distributaries such as the Day River, Ninh Co River and the Luoc River. All of these rivers empty into the Gulf of Tonkin.

===Indian Subcontinent===

* Kollidam River is a distributary of the Kaveri River.
* Himalayan rivers including Ganges, Brahmaputra and Indus plus many tributaries form inland distributaries over vast alluvial fans as they transition from the mountain region to the flat Indo-Gangetic Plain. These areas are highly flood-prone, for example the 2008 Bihar flood on the Kosi River.
* Padma River is the main distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh.
* Hoogli River is a Ganges distributary that flows through India, whereas most of the Ganges-Brahmaputra complex enters the sea through Bangladesh.
* Nara River is a distributary of the Indus River.

==Africa==
* The Nile River has two distributaries, the Rosetta and the Damietta branches. According to Pliny the Elder it had in ancient times seven distributaries (east to west):
** The Pelusiac
** The Tanitic
** The Mendesian
** The Phatnitic
** The Sebennytic
** The Bolbitine
** The Canopic
:See History of the Nile Delta.
* The Okavango River ends in many distributaries in a large inland delta called the Okavango Delta. It is an example of distributaries that do not flow into any other body of water.

A number of the rivers that flow inland from Australia&#x27;s Great Dividing Range form distributaries, most of which flow only intermittently during times of high river levels and end in shallow lakes or simply peter out in the deserts. Yarriambiack Creek, which flows from the Wimmera River into Lake Coorong, and Tyrrell Creek, which flows from the Avoca River into Lake Tyrrell, are two distributaries in Victoria. The Narran River flows from the Balonne River in Queensland into Narran Lake in New South Wales.

===Papua New Guinea===
Many of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s major rivers flow into the Gulf of Papua through marshy, low-lying country, allowing for wide, many-branched deltas. These include the Fly River, which splits into three major and several minor rivers close to its mouth. The Bamu River splits into several channels close to its mouth, among them the &quot;Bebea&quot;, &quot;Bina&quot;, &quot;Dibiri&quot;, and &quot;Aramia&quot;. The Kikori River also splits into a multitude of channels as it crosses the plains close to the Gulf of Papua. The Purari River splits into three major channels as it approaches its mouth.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand&#x27;s second-longest river, the Clutha River, splits into two arms, the &quot;Matau&quot; and the &quot;Koua&quot;, some 10 kilometres from the South Island&#x27;s Pacific Coast. A large island, Inch Clutha, lies between the two arms. Many of the rivers crossing the Canterbury Plains in the central South Island are braided rivers, and several of these split into separate branches before reaching the coast. Notable among these is the Rangitata River, the two arms of which are separated by the low-lying Rangitata Island.

<text>Year 384 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

The denomination 384 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

* King Amyntas III of Macedon, forms a temporary alliance with the Chalcidian League, a confederation of cities of the Chalcidice peninsula, east of Macedonia. Sparta, whose policy is to keep Greeks disunited, sends an expedition northwards to disrupt the Chalcidian League.
* The Spartan commander Phoebidas, who is passing through Boeotia on campaign, takes advantage of civil strife within Thebes to gain entrance to the city for his troops. Once inside, he seizes the Cadmeia (the citadel of Thebes), and forces the anti-Spartan party to flee the city. The government of Thebes is placed in the hands of the pro-Spartan party, backed by a Spartan garrison based in the Cadmeia. Many of the previous leaders of Thebes are driven into exile. Epaminondas, although associated with the anti-Spartan faction, is allowed to remain.

<text>Agbome or Abomey is the capital of the Zou Department of Benin. The commune of Abomey covers an area of 142 square kilometres and, as of 2012, had a population of 90,195 people.

Abomey houses the Royal Palaces of Abomey, a collection of small traditional houses that were inhabited by the Kings of Dahomey from 1600 to 1900, and which were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.

== History ==

Abomey was founded in the 17th century as the capital of the Kingdom of Dahomey (1600–1904), on the site of the former village of Kana. Traditional legends state that the town was founded by Do-Aklin, a son of the king of Allada who ventured north to found his own kingdom; the name is thought to come from Danhomé, also spelled Danxomé, meaning &quot;belly of Dan&quot;, Dan being the original chief of the village. 

Dahomey expanded rapidly in the 1700s, absorbing many of the surrounding kingdoms, and growing rich from the slave trade. In the late 18th century, Abomey was surrounded only by dry ditch which was crossed by bridges that were protected by a garrison. The royal palaces were fortified with a nearly square mudbrick wall that was 20 feet high. The flanks reached almost 1 mile as blockhouses were built on each wall.

After several attempts, the French conquered the kingdom on 16 November 1892, prompting King Béhanzin to torch the city and flee northward. Thereafter the town declined in importance, a process hastened when the French built the new administrative centre of Bohicon immediately to the east. Today, the city is of less importance, but is still popular with tourists and as a centre for crafts. Since 1985, Abomey has maintained its complex of royal palaces as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== The Royal Palaces of Abomey ==

The Royal Palaces of Abomey are a group of earthen structures built by the Fon people between the mid-17th and late 19th Centuries. One of the most famous and historically significant traditional sites in West Africa, the palaces form a UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

During the reign of Béhanzin, the palaces covered some 44ha and it was surrounded by a 10 meter high wall reaching 4km in length. Only 2 of the original 12 palace survived the 1892 burning by Béhanzin, Dahomey&#x27;s last king. The French colonial administration rebuilt the town and connected it with the coast by a railroad.

When UNESCO designated the royal palaces of Abomey as a World Heritage Site in 1985 it stated:
:From 1625 to 1900 twelve kings succeeded one another at the head of the powerful Kingdom of Abomey. With the exception of King Akaba, who used a separate enclosure, they each had their palaces built within the same cob-wall area, in keeping with previous palaces as regards the use of space and materials. The royal palaces of Abomey are a unique reminder of this vanished kingdom.

From 1993, 50 of the 56 bas-reliefs that formerly decorated the walls of King Glèlè (now termed the &quot;Salle des Bijoux&quot;) have been located and replaced on the rebuilt structure. The bas-reliefs carry an iconographic program expressing the history and power of the Fon people.

===Threats===
As reported by UNESCO, on 21 January 2009 the Royal Palaces of Abomey suffered from a fire &quot;which destroyed several buildings.&quot; The fire was the most recent disaster to have plagued the site, coming after a powerful tornado damaged the site in 1984.

<text>Annegret Richter (born 13 October 1950) is a German (former West German) athlete and the 1976 Olympic 100 m champion.

==Biography==
Born Annegret Irrgang, she won her first international title at the 1971 European Championships, as a part of her country&#x27;s 4×100 m relay team. The next year, at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, she finished 5th in the 100 m, in front of her home crowd. As she had married hurdler Manfred Richter, she now ran under that name. With the relay team, Richter ran a new world record, beating rivals East Germany for the gold medal.

She took the 60 meter title at the European Indoor Championships in 1973. After taking a bronze in 1971 and a silver in 1972 (over 50 meters).

At the 1974 European Championships in Rome she was again a member of the national 4×100 m relay team, this time winning the silver medal. She was fourth in the 100 metre final.

Before the 1976 Summer Olympics, everybody&#x27;s attention was not directed at Richter, but at fellow Dortmunder Inge Helten, who had set a new world record of 11.04 just prior to the Games. Richter beat the defending champion Renate Stecher of East Germany in the first round, and ran 11.05 in the second round and set a world record of 11.01 in the semifinals. In the final, Richter, Stecher and Helten finished within one metre of each other, with Richter winning the gold and vanquishing Stecher. Three days later she won a silver medal in the 200 m and another one in the 4×100 m relay, being beaten by East Germany this time.

Richter ran the 3rd leg of the winning relay squad at the first World Cup of Track and Field in 1977, she had the second fastest time of the year for the 100 meters of 11.03. She would finish 3rd in the 100 meters and 4th in the 200 meters at the second World Cup in 1979, again running the 3rd leg of the victorious European relay squad, and retired after the boycott of the 1980 Moscow games. During her career she won 28 national titles. Her daughter Daniela and son Marcus also competed in athletics, at the national level.

<text>Year 356 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ambustus and Laenas (or, less frequently, year 398 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 356 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* Having blamed their defeats to Philip II in Thessaly and Chalcidice on his colleagues (Iphicrates and Timotheus), Chares is left in sole command of the Athenian fleet. Chares, in need of money for his war effort, frowns upon asking it from Athens, so, partly compelled by his mercenaries, he enters the service of the insurgent Achaemenid satrap of Phrygia Artabazus who rewards Chares very generously.
* Artabazus is also supported by the Thebans, who send him 5,000 men under one of their generals Pammenes. With the assistance of these and other allies, Artabazus defeats his Achaemenid enemies in two great battles.
* The Achaemenid King Artaxerxes III orders all the satraps (governors) of his empire to dismiss their mercenaries. The Athenians, who have originally approved their mercenaries&#x27; collaboration with Artabazus of Phrygia, order them to leave due to their fear of Achaemenid support for the rebellion of Chios, Rhodes, and Cos. Thebes follows suit and withdraws its mercenaries.
* With King Artaxerxes III succeeding in depriving Artabazus of his Athenian and Theban allies, Artabazus is defeated by the Persian King&#x27;s general, Autophradates.

==== Greece ====
* Philip II of Macedon secretly offers the city of Amphipolis back to the Athenians in exchange for the valuable port of Pydna. Despite the Athenians being willing to comply, both Pydna and Potidaea are conquered by the Macedonians (along with other Athenian strongholds in Thessaly and Chalcidice) despite being defended by Athenian forces led by general and mercenary commander, Chares, as well as generals Iphicrates and Timotheus.
* With Pydna and Potidaea occupied, Philip II decides to keep Amphipolis anyway. He also takes the city of Crenides from the Odrysae and renames it Philippi.
* The Phocians capture and sack Delphi in whose territory the famous temple and oracle stand. A &quot;sacred war&quot; is declared against them by the other members of the Great Amphictyonic League. The Phocians, led by two capable generals, Philomelus and Onomarchus, use Delphi&#x27;s riches to hire a mercenary army to carry the war into Boeotia and Thessaly.
* The Social War begins between the Second Athenian League, led by Athens, and its revolting allies of Chios, Rhodes, and Kos as well as the independent state Byzantium. Mausolus, the tyrant of Caria, instigates the rebellion against the Athenian control of these states. The revolting allies ravage the islands of Lemnos and Imbros which are loyal to Athens.
* The Athenian generals Chares and Chabrias are given command of the Athenian fleet with the aim of defeating the rebellious cities. However, Chabrias&#x27; fleet is defeated and he is killed in its attack on the island of Chios, off the coast of Ionia.
* Chares is given sole command of the Athenian fleet and withdraws to the Hellespont to move against Byzantium. The generals Timotheus, Iphicrates and his son Menestheus are sent with 60 ships to help him when the enemy fleet is sighted on the Hellespont. Timotheus and Iphicrates refuse to engage due to a severe gale, but Chares does engage and lose many of his ships. Timotheus and Iphicrates are accused by Chares and put on trial, however only Timotheus is condemned to pay a fine.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Gaius Marcius Rutilus is the first plebeian to be chosen as a dictator in Rome.

==== China ====
* With his reforms initiated in this year, the Chinese prime minister Shang Yang starts to transform the once marginal and frontier State of Qin to become the most dominant military force amongst the Warring States of China by the 3rd century BC.

=== By topic ===

==== Architecture ====
* July 21 (traditional date) – The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus is burned down by a madman named Herostratus, destroying one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The great temple was built by Croesus, king of Lydia, in about 550 BC and was famous not only for its great size (110 metres by 55 metres), but also for the magnificent works of art that adorned it.

== Births ==

* July 20/21 – Alexander the Great, King of Macedonia (d. 323 BC).
* Hephaestion, Macedonian general, soldier, aristocrat, and companion of Alexander the Great (d. 324 BC).
