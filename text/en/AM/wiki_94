<text>Lee County is located in southwestern Florida, United States, on the Gulf Coast. As of the 2020 census, its population was 760,822. In 2022, the population was 822,453, making it the eighth-most populous county in the state. The county seat is Fort Myers, with a population of 86,395 as of the 2020 census, and the largest city is Cape Coral, with an estimated 2020 population of 194,016.

The county comprises the Cape Coral–Fort Myers Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which, along with the Naples-Marco Island (Collier County) MSA and the Clewiston (Hendry County, Glades County) Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA), is included in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

Lee County was established in 1887 from Monroe County. Fort Myers is the county seat and a center of tourism in Southwest Florida. It is about south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Lee County is the home for spring training of the Boston Red Sox and the Minnesota Twins Major League Baseball teams.

==History==
===Protohistory and European contact (500–1799)===
The area that is now Lee County has several archaeological sites that show evidence of habitation by peoples belonging to the Caloosahatchee culture (500 to 1750 AD). By the time of European contact, the area was more specifically occupied by the Calusa. After European contact, fishermen from Cuba and other Spanish colonies set up fishing camps, known as &quot;ranchos&quot; in Spanish, on the southern portion of the Gulf Coast of Florida. These &quot;ranchos&quot; extended from Charlotte Harbor south to San Carlos Bay and the mouth of the Caloosahatchee. Likely established in the latter part of the 1600s, they were precursors to the larger European settlements that would be established in the following centuries. As the 18th century came to an end, the Calusa who had once inhabited the area were replaced with the Seminole. In particular, in 1799, an Indian agent noted the existence of a Seminole town on the &quot;Cull-oo-saw-hat-che&quot; or Caloosahatchee River.

===Fort established (1850s–1860s)===
After Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, a number of settlers moved into Florida, causing conflict with the local Seminole Indians. Fort Myers was built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians during the Seminole Wars. The fort was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fort&#x27;s establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, Chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billy&#x27;s Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west. In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865, in the Battle of Fort Myers, the fort was attacked by a small group of Confederates. The Union&#x27;s garrison, led by Captain James Doyle, successfully held the fort and the Confederate forces retreated. After the war, the fort was again deserted. The fort was later disassembled and some of its wood was used to build parts of downtown Fort Myers.

===Settlement and early growth (1860s–1920s)===
During the Civil War, Fort Myers was occupied by federal troops with the intention of disrupting the Confederate cattle supply from Florida. In February 1865, it was the site of the Battle of Fort Myers. The first settlers in Fort Myers arrived in 1866. In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and &quot;ranchos&quot; that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood – fishing. When the government claimed his land, he was disinclined to set up another ranch, so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded. The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county, mainly around the Pine Island area.

In 1882, the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. In 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, its population of 349 residents made it the second-largest city only to Tampa on Florida&#x27;s west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time. Lee County was formed in 1887 from Monroe County, with Fort Myers serving as the county seat. It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War. Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the opening of the Royal Palm Hotel in 1898, built by New York City department store magnate Hugh O&#x27;Neill. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford. In 1911, Fort Myers was incorporated as a city. In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County. Construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge, built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924, sparked the city&#x27;s growth. After the bridge&#x27;s construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city. In 1927, a property purchased by the City of Fort Myers was turned into an airport, eventually called Page Field.

===Modern growth (1940s–present)===

During World War II, Page Field served as an advanced fighter training base and home to the several bomber groups. Following the war, a small terminal was built in the mid-1950s as the airport transitioned to commercial use. Another airfield was constructed in 1942 called Buckingham Army Airfield. The base was closed down in 1945, after which the barracks served as classrooms for Edison College until 1948. Following the end of World War II, the Royal Palm Hotel was closed permanently, and in 1947, the hotel on the corner of First and Fowler was torn down.

Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for spring training over the past several decades.

The county received a boost in 1983 when Southwest Florida Regional Airport (now known as Southwest Florida International Airport) opened.

On September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall on Lee County as a category 4 storm, causing major damage to Sanibel, Pine Island, and surrounding areas. Sanibel Causeway partially collapsed in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. 71 deaths occurred in Lee County as of October 4.

Fort Myers is home to Florida Gulf Coast University. Its teams, the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles, play in NCAA Division I in the ASUN Conference. The Eagles&#x27; men&#x27;s basketball team had an average attendance of 2,291 in 2013.

===MLB spring training===

The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park at Fenway South in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, which conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.

The Red Sox&#x27; lease with Fort Myers ran through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3–1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. That stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 season.

City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox&#x27; spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training. The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Kansas City Royals.

<text>Leon County () is a county in the Panhandle of the U.S. state of Florida. It was named after the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León. As of the 2020 census, the population was 292,198. The county seat is Tallahassee, which is also the state capital and home to many politicians, lobbyists, jurists, and attorneys. Leon County is included in the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Tallahassee is home to two of Florida&#x27;s major public universities, Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University, as well as Tallahassee Community College. Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students. It was an area of cotton cultivation. About 30 percent of Leon County is African American. The area includes rolling hills.

==History==

Originally part of Escambia and later Gadsden County, Leon County was created in 1824. It was named after Juan Ponce de León, the Spanish explorer who was the first European to reach Florida.
The United States finally acquired this territory in the 19th century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct Indian Removal of the Seminole and Creek peoples, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the Seminole Wars, planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.

By the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the Deep South&#x27;s &quot;cotton kingdom&quot;. It ranked fifth of all Florida and Georgia counties in cotton production from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the Mississippi River, in the American Civil War Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the Reconstruction Era.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which are land and (5.0%) are water. Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, as part of Florida&#x27;s Red Hills Region. The highest point is , in the northern part of the county.

===Geology===
Leon County encompasses basement rock composed of basalts of the Triassic and Jurassic from ~251 to 145 million years ago interlayered with Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. The layers above the basement are carbonate rock created from dying foraminifera, bryozoa, mollusks, and corals from as early as the Paleocene, a period of ~66—55.8 Ma.

During the Eocene (~55.8—33.9 Ma) and Oligocene (~33.9—23 Ma), the Appalachian Mountains began to uplift and the erosion rate increased enough to fill the Gulf Trough with quartz sands, silts, and clays via rivers and streams. The first sedimentation layer in Leon County is the Oligocene Suwannee Limestone in the southeastern part of the county as stated by the United States Geological Survey and Florida Geological Survey.

The Early Miocene (~23.03—15.7 Ma) sedimentation in Leon County is Hawthorn Group, Torreya Formation and St. Marks Formation and is found in the northern two-thirds of the county.

The Pliocene (~5.332—2.588 Ma) is represented by the Miccosukee Formation scattered within the Torreya Formation.

Sediments were laid down from the Pleistocene epoch (~2.588 million—12 000 years ago) through the Holocene epoch (~12,000—present) and are designated Beach ridge and trail and undifferentiated sediments.

====Terraces and shorelines====
During the Pleistocene, what would be Leon County emerged and submerged with each glacial and interglacial period. Interglacials created the county&#x27;s topography.

==Law, government, and politics==

===Politics===

Leon County is governed by an elected seven-member board of county commissioners.

Following Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power in Leon County and voters have historically voted for Democratic candidates at the national level. Tallahassee is one of the few cities in the South known for progressive activism.

The county has voted Democratic in 24 of the past 29 presidential elections since 1904. (Until the late 1960s, blacks were essentially disenfranchised in Florida and other Southern states.) Since the civil rights era, Tallahassee has elected black mayors and black state representatives. Its political affiliations likely draw from the high number of students, staff, and faculty associated with Florida State University, Florida A&amp;M University, and Tallahassee Community College in Tallahassee, as well as the concentration of government employees.

Leon County has had the highest voter turnout of any Florida county. In the 2008 general election, it had a record-setting voter turnout of 85%, including early voting and voting by mail.

As of March 31, 2024, there were 98,612 Democrats, 54,464 Republicans, and 43,600 voters with other affiliations in Leon County.

===Consolidation===
Leon County voters have gone to the polls four times to vote on consolidation of the Tallahassee and Leon County governments into one jurisdiction. This proposal would combine police and other city services with the already shared (consolidated) Tallahassee Fire Department, Tallahassee/Leon County Planning Department, and Leon County Emergency Medical Services. Tallahassee&#x27;s city limits would (at current size) increase from to . Roughly 36 percent of Leon County&#x27;s 250,000 residents live outside the Tallahassee city limits.

Proponents of consolidation have claimed that the new jurisdiction would attract business by its very size. Merging of governments would cut government waste, duplication of services, etc. Professor Richard Feiock of Florida State University found in a 2007 study that he could not conclude that consolidation would benefit the local economy.

====History of library services====

The Carnegie Library of Tallahassee provided library services to the black community before desegregation. It was the first and only public library in Tallahassee until 1955. Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie offered Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, the library was built on the FAMU campus because the city refused the donation because it would have to serve the black citizens. &quot;The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and social groups, as well as, public and private businesses throughout Florida and the nation.&quot; The building was designed by noted architect William Augustus Edwards and was built in 1908. On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

The Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which served only the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955. According to the Leon County Public Library&#x27;s website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954. The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that &quot;Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.&quot; A year later, the library was established by legislative action and developed by citizens and civic groups. The first Leon County free public library opened on March 21, 1956. The first building to house the library was The Columns, one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area, at Park Avenue and Adams Street (now the home of the James Madison Institute).

In order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff&#x27;s Office to be used as a paddywagon for its Road Prison. In 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, but the public library system was only integrated several years later.

In the early 1970s, Jefferson and Wakulla Counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library&#x27;s website, &quot;Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon&#x27;s administrative costs.&quot; In 1975 the system started a branch library in Bond, a predominantly black community on the city&#x27;s south side. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to Tallahassee&#x27;s Northwood Mall. Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library. In 1989, &quot;ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library&#x27;s original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.&quot; The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.

<text>In computer science, binary space partitioning (BSP) is a method for space partitioning which recursively subdivides a Euclidean space into two convex sets by using hyperplanes as partitions. This process of subdividing gives rise to a representation of objects within the space in the form of a tree data structure known as a BSP tree.

Binary space partitioning was developed in the context of 3D computer graphics in 1969. The structure of a BSP tree is useful in rendering because it can efficiently give spatial information about the objects in a scene, such as objects being ordered from front-to-back with respect to a viewer at a given location. Other applications of BSP include: performing geometrical operations with shapes (constructive solid geometry) in CAD, collision detection in robotics and 3D video games, ray tracing, virtual landscape simulation, and other applications that involve the handling of complex spatial scenes.

==History==

*1969 Schumacker et al. published a report that described how carefully positioned planes in a virtual environment could be used to accelerate polygon ordering. The technique made use of depth coherence, which states that a polygon on the far side of the plane cannot, in any way, obstruct a closer polygon. This was used in flight simulators made by GE as well as Evans and Sutherland. However, the creation of the polygonal data organization was performed manually by the scene designer.

*1980 Fuchs et al. extended Schumacker&#x27;s idea to the representation of 3D objects in a virtual environment by using planes that lie coincident with polygons to recursively partition the 3D space. This provided a fully automated and algorithmic generation of a hierarchical polygonal data structure known as a Binary Space Partitioning Tree (BSP Tree). The process took place as an off-line preprocessing step that was performed once per environment/object. At run-time, the view-dependent visibility ordering was generated by traversing the tree.
*1981 Naylor&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis provided a full development of both BSP trees and a graph-theoretic approach using strongly connected components for pre-computing visibility, as well as the connection between the two methods. BSP trees as a dimension-independent spatial search structure were emphasized, with applications to visible surface determination. The thesis also included the first empirical data demonstrating that the size of the tree and the number of new polygons were reasonable (using a model of the Space Shuttle).
*1983 Fuchs et al. described a micro-code implementation of the BSP tree algorithm on an Ikonas frame buffer system. This was the first demonstration of real-time visible surface determination using BSP trees.
*1987 Thibault and Naylor described how arbitrary polyhedra may be represented using a BSP tree as opposed to the traditional b-rep (boundary representation). This provided a solid representation vs. a surface based-representation. Set operations on polyhedra were described using a tool, enabling constructive solid geometry (CSG) in real-time. This was the forerunner of BSP level design using &quot;brushes&quot;, introduced in the Quake editor and picked up in the Unreal Editor.
*1990 Naylor, Amanatides, and Thibault provided an algorithm for merging two BSP trees to form a new BSP tree from the two original trees. This provides many benefits including combining moving objects represented by BSP trees with a static environment (also represented by a BSP tree), very efficient CSG operations on polyhedra, exact collisions detection in O(log n * log n), and proper ordering of transparent surfaces contained in two interpenetrating objects (has been used for an x-ray vision effect).
*1990 Teller and Séquin proposed the offline generation of potentially visible sets to accelerate visible surface determination in orthogonal 2D environments.
*1991 Gordon and Chen [CHEN91] described an efficient method of performing front-to-back rendering from a BSP tree, rather than the traditional back-to-front approach. They utilized a special data structure to record, efficiently, parts of the screen that have been drawn, and those yet to be rendered. This algorithm, together with the description of BSP Trees in the standard computer graphics textbook of the day (&quot;Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice&quot;) was used by John Carmack in the making of &quot;Doom&quot; (video game).
*1992 Teller&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis described the efficient generation of potentially visible sets as a pre-processing step to accelerate real-time visible surface determination in arbitrary 3D polygonal environments. This was used in &quot;Quake&quot; and contributed significantly to that game&#x27;s performance.
*1993 Naylor answered the question of what characterizes a good BSP tree. He used expected case models (rather than worst-case analysis) to mathematically measure the expected cost of searching a tree and used this measure to build good BSP trees. Intuitively, the tree represents an object in a multi-resolution fashion (more exactly, as a tree of approximations). Parallels with Huffman codes and probabilistic binary search trees are drawn.
*1993 Hayder Radha&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis described (natural) image representation methods using BSP trees. This includes the development of an optimal BSP-tree construction framework for any arbitrary input image. This framework is based on a new image transform, known as the Least-Square-Error (LSE) Partitioning Line (LPE) transform. H. Radha&#x27;s thesis also developed an optimal rate-distortion (RD) image compression framework and image manipulation approaches using BSP trees.

==Overview==
Binary space partitioning is a generic process of recursively dividing a scene into two until the partitioning satisfies one or more requirements. It can be seen as a generalization of other spatial tree structures such as &quot;k&quot;-d trees and quadtrees, one where hyperplanes that partition the space may have any orientation, rather than being aligned with the coordinate axes as they are in &quot;k&quot;-d trees or quadtrees. When used in computer graphics to render scenes composed of planar polygons, the partitioning planes are frequently chosen to coincide with the planes defined by polygons in the scene.

The specific choice of partitioning plane and criterion for terminating the partitioning process varies depending on the purpose of the BSP tree. For example, in computer graphics rendering, the scene is divided until each node of the BSP tree contains only polygons that can be rendered in arbitrary order. When back-face culling is used, each node, therefore, contains a convex set of polygons, whereas when rendering double-sided polygons, each node of the BSP tree contains only polygons in a single plane. In collision detection or ray tracing, a scene may be divided up into primitives on which collision or ray intersection tests are straightforward.

Binary space partitioning arose from computer graphics needing to rapidly draw three-dimensional scenes composed of polygons. A simple way to draw such scenes is the painter&#x27;s algorithm, which produces polygons in order of distance from the viewer, back to front, painting over the background and previous polygons with each closer object. This approach has two disadvantages: the time required to sort polygons in back-to-front order, and the possibility of errors in overlapping polygons. Fuchs and co-authors showed that constructing a BSP tree solved both of these problems by providing a rapid method of sorting polygons with respect to a given viewpoint (linear in the number of polygons in the scene) and by subdividing overlapping polygons to avoid errors that can occur with the painter&#x27;s algorithm. A disadvantage of binary space partitioning is that generating a BSP tree can be time-consuming. Typically, it is therefore performed once on static geometry, as a pre-calculation step, prior to rendering or other real-time operations on a scene. The expense of constructing a BSP tree makes it difficult and inefficient to directly implement moving objects into a tree.

==Generation==
The canonical use of a BSP tree is for rendering polygons (that are double-sided, that is, without back-face culling) with the painter&#x27;s algorithm. Each polygon is designated with a front side and a backside which could be chosen arbitrarily and only affects the structure of the tree but not the required result. Such a tree is constructed from an unsorted list of all the polygons in a scene. The recursive algorithm for construction of a BSP tree from that list of polygons is:
# Choose a polygon &quot;P&quot; from the list.
# Make a node &quot;N&quot; in the BSP tree, and add &quot;P&quot; to the list of polygons at that node.
# For each other polygon in the list:
## If that polygon is wholly in front of the plane containing &quot;P&quot;, move that polygon to the list of nodes in front of &quot;P&quot;.
## If that polygon is wholly behind the plane containing &quot;P&quot;, move that polygon to the list of nodes behind &quot;P&quot;.
## If that polygon is intersected by the plane containing &quot;P&quot;, split it into two polygons and move them to the respective lists of polygons behind and in front of &quot;P&quot;.
## If that polygon lies in the plane containing &quot;P&quot;, add it to the list of polygons at node &quot;N&quot;.
# Apply this algorithm to the list of polygons in front of &quot;P&quot;.
# Apply this algorithm to the list of polygons behind &quot;P&quot;.

The following diagram illustrates the use of this algorithm in converting a list of lines or polygons into a BSP tree. At each of the eight steps (i.-viii.), the algorithm above is applied to a list of lines, and one new node is added to the tree.

The final number of polygons or lines in a tree is often larger (sometimes much larger) than the original list, since lines or polygons that cross the partitioning plane must be split into two. It is desirable to minimize this increase, but also to maintain reasonable balance in the final tree. The choice of which polygon or line is used as a partitioning plane (in step 1 of the algorithm) is therefore important in creating an efficient BSP tree.

==Traversal==
A BSP tree is traversed in a linear time, in an order determined by the particular function of the tree. Again using the example of rendering double-sided polygons using the painter&#x27;s algorithm, to draw a polygon &quot;P&quot; correctly requires that all polygons behind the plane &quot;P&quot; lies in must be drawn first, then polygon &quot;P&quot;, then finally the polygons in front of &quot;P&quot;. If this drawing order is satisfied for all polygons in a scene, then the entire scene renders in the correct order. This procedure can be implemented by recursively traversing a BSP tree using the following algorithm. From a given viewing location &quot;V&quot;, to render a BSP tree,
# If the current node is a leaf node, render the polygons at the current node.
# Otherwise, if the viewing location &quot;V&quot; is in front of the current node:
## Render the child BSP tree containing polygons behind the current node
## Render the polygons at the current node
## Render the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of the current node
# Otherwise, if the viewing location &quot;V&quot; is behind the current node:
## Render the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of the current node
## Render the polygons at the current node
## Render the child BSP tree containing polygons behind the current node
# Otherwise, the viewing location &quot;V&quot; must be exactly on the plane associated with the current node. Then:
## Render the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of the current node
## Render the child BSP tree containing polygons behind the current node
Applying this algorithm recursively to the BSP tree generated above results in the following steps:
* The algorithm is first applied to the root node of the tree, node &quot;A&quot;. &quot;V&quot; is in front of node &quot;A&quot;, so we apply the algorithm first to the child BSP tree containing polygons behind &quot;A&quot;
** This tree has root node &quot;B1&quot;. &quot;V&quot; is behind &quot;B1&quot; so first, we apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of &quot;B1&quot;:
*** This tree is just the leaf node &quot;D1&quot;, so the polygon &quot;D1&quot; is rendered.
** We then render the polygon &quot;B1&quot;.
** We then apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons behind &quot;B1&quot;:
*** This tree is just the leaf node &quot;C1&quot;, so the polygon &quot;C1&quot; is rendered.
* We then draw the polygons of &quot;A&quot;
* We then apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of &quot;A&quot;
** This tree has root node &quot;B2&quot;. &quot;V&quot; is behind &quot;B2&quot; so first, we apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of &quot;B2&quot;:
*** This tree is just the leaf node &quot;D2&quot;, so the polygon &quot;D2&quot; is rendered.
** We then render the polygon &quot;B2&quot;.
** We then apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons behind &quot;B2&quot;:
*** This tree has root node &quot;C2&quot;. &quot;V&quot; is in front of &quot;C2&quot; so first, we would apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons behind &quot;C2&quot;. There is no such tree, however, so we continue.
*** We render the polygon &quot;C2&quot;.
*** We apply the algorithm to the child BSP tree containing polygons in front of &quot;C2&quot;
**** This tree is just the leaf node &quot;D3&quot;, so the polygon &quot;D3&quot; is rendered.

The tree is traversed in linear time and renders the polygons in a far-to-near ordering (&quot;D1&quot;, &quot;B1&quot;, &quot;C1&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;D2&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;, &quot;D3&quot;) suitable for the painter&#x27;s algorithm.

== Application ==
BSP trees are often used by 3D video games, particularly first-person shooters and those with indoor environments. Game engines using BSP trees include the Doom (id Tech 1), Quake (id Tech 2 variant), GoldSrc and Source engines. In them, BSP trees containing the static geometry of a scene are often used together with a Z-buffer, to correctly merge movable objects such as doors and characters onto the background scene. While binary space partitioning provides a convenient way to store and retrieve spatial information about polygons in a scene, it does not solve the problem of visible surface determination. 
BSP trees have also been applied to image compression.

<doc id="73614" wikidata="Q323426" url="?curid=73614" title="Exocytosis">
<text>Exocytosis () is a form of active transport and bulk transport in which a cell transports molecules (e.g., neurotransmitters and proteins) out of the cell (&quot;&quot; + &quot;cytosis&quot;). As an active transport mechanism, exocytosis requires the use of energy to transport material. Exocytosis and its counterpart, endocytosis, are used by all cells because most chemical substances important to them are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the hydrophobic portion of the cell membrane by passive means. Exocytosis is the process by which a large amount of molecules are released; thus it is a form of bulk transport. Exocytosis occurs via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called porosomes. Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structures at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.

In exocytosis, membrane-bound secretory vesicles are carried to the cell membrane, where they dock and fuse at porosomes and their contents (i.e., water-soluble molecules) are secreted into the extracellular environment. This secretion is possible because the vesicle transiently fuses with the plasma membrane. In the context of neurotransmission, neurotransmitters are typically released from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis; however, neurotransmitters can also be released via reverse transport through membrane transport proteins.

Exocytosis is also a mechanism by which cells are able to insert membrane proteins (such as ion channels and cell surface receptors), lipids, and other components into the cell membrane. Vesicles containing these membrane components fully fuse with and become part of the outer cell membrane.

==History==
The term was proposed by De Duve in 1963.

==Types==
In eukaryotes, there are two types of exocytosis:
1) Ca2+ triggered non-constitutive (i.e., regulated exocytosis) and
2) non-Ca2+ triggered constitutive (i.e., non-regulated).

&quot;Ca2+ triggered non-constitutive&quot; exocytosis requires an external signal, a specific sorting signal on the vesicles, a clathrin coat, as well as an increase in intracellular calcium. In multicellular organisms, this mechanism initiates many forms of intercellular communication such as synaptic transmission, hormone secretion by neuroendocrine cells, and immune cells&#x27; secretion. In neurons and endocrine cells, the SNARE-proteins and SM-proteins catalyze the fusion by forming a complex that brings the two fusion membranes together. For instance, in synapses, the SNARE complex is formed by syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 at the plasma membrane and VAMP2 at the vesicle membrane. Exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is Ca2+ triggered and serves interneuronal signalling. The calcium sensors that trigger exocytosis might interact either with the SNARE complex or with the phospholipids of the fusing membranes. Synaptotagmin has been recognized as the major sensor for Ca2+ triggered exocytosis in animals. However, synaptotagmin proteins are absent in plants and unicellular eukaryotes. Other potential calcium sensors for exocytosis are EF-hand proteins (Ex: Calmodulin) and C2-domain (Ex: Ferlins, E-synaptotagmin, Doc2b) containing proteins. It is unclear how the different calcium sensors can cooperate together and mediate the calcium triggered kinetics of exocytosis in a specific fashion.

&quot;Constitutive exocytosis&quot; is performed by all cells and serves the release of components of the extracellular matrix or delivery of newly synthesized membrane proteins that are incorporated in the plasma membrane after the fusion of the transport vesicle. There is no clear consensus about the machinery and molecular processes that drive the formation, budding, translocation and fusion of the post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane. The fusion involves membrane tethering (recognition) and membrane fusion. It is still unclear if the machinery between the constitutive and regulated secretion is different. The machinery required for constitutive exocytosis has not been studied as much as the mechanism of regulated exocytosis. Two tethering complexes are associated with constitutive exocytosis in mammals, ELKS and Exocyst. ELKS is a large coiled-coil protein, also involved in synaptic exocytosis, marking the &#x27;hotspots&#x27; fusion points of the secretory carriers fusion. Exocyst is an octameric protein complex. In mammals, exocyst components localize in both plasma membrane, and Golgi apparatus and the exocyst proteins are colocalized at the fusion point of the post-Golgi vesicles. The membrane fusion of the constitutive exocytosis, probably, is mediated by SNAP29 and Syntaxin19 at the plasma membrane and YKT6 or VAMP3 at the vesicle membrane.

&quot;Vesicular exocytosis&quot; in prokaryote gram negative bacteria is a third mechanism and latest finding in exocytosis. The periplasm is pinched off as bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for translocating microbial biochemical signals into eukaryotic host cells or other microbes located nearby, accomplishing control of the secreting microbe on its environment - including invasion of host, endotoxemia, competing with other microbes for nutrition, etc. This finding of membrane vesicle trafficking occurring at the host–pathogen interface also dispels the myth that exocytosis is purely a eukaryotic cell phenomenon.

==Steps==

Five steps are involved in exocytosis:

===Vesicle trafficking===
Certain vesicle-trafficking steps require the transportation of a vesicle over a moderately small distance. For example, vesicles that transport proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface area, will be likely to use motor proteins and a cytoskeletal track to get closer to their target. Before tethering would have been appropriate, many of the proteins used for the active transport would have been instead set for passive transport, because the Golgi apparatus does not require ATP to transport proteins. Both the actin- and the microtubule-base are implicated in these processes, along with several motor proteins. Once the vesicles reach their targets, they come into contact with tethering factors that can restrain them.

===Vesicle tethering===
It is useful to distinguish between the initial, loose &quot;tethering&quot; of vesicles to their objective from the more stable, &quot;packing&quot; interactions. Tethering involves links over distances of more than about half the diameter of a vesicle from a given membrane surface (&gt;25 nm). Tethering interactions are likely to be involved in concentrating synaptic vesicles at the synapse.

===Vesicle docking===
Secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse at the porosome at the cell plasma membrane, via a tight t-/v-SNARE ring complex.

===Vesicle priming===
In neuronal exocytosis, the term &quot;priming&quot; has been used to include all of the molecular rearrangements and ATP-dependent protein and lipid modifications that take place after initial docking of a synaptic vesicle but before exocytosis, such that the influx of calcium ions is all that is needed to trigger nearly instantaneous neurotransmitter release. In other cell types, whose secretion is constitutive (i.e. continuous, calcium ion independent, non-triggered) there is no priming.

===Vesicle fusion===
Transient vesicle fusion is driven by SNARE proteins, resulting in release of vesicle contents into the extracellular space (or in case of neurons in the synaptic cleft).

The merging of the donor and the acceptor membranes accomplishes three tasks:
*The surface of the plasma membrane increases (by the surface of the fused vesicle). This is important for the regulation of cell size, e.g., during cell growth.
*The substances within the vesicle are released into the exterior. These might be waste products or toxins, or signaling molecules like hormones or neurotransmitters during synaptic transmission.
*Proteins embedded in the vesicle membrane are now part of the plasma membrane. The side of the protein that was facing the &quot;inside&quot; of the vesicle now faces the &quot;outside&quot; of the cell. This mechanism is important for the regulation of transmembrane and transporters.

==Vesicle retrieval==
Retrieval of synaptic vesicles occurs by endocytosis. Most synaptic vesicles are recycled without a full fusion into the membrane (kiss-and-run fusion) via porosome. Non-constitutive exocytosis and subsequent endocytosis are highly energy expending processes, and thus, are dependent on mitochondria.

Examination of cells following secretion using electron microscopy demonstrate increased presence of partially empty vesicles following secretion. This suggested that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular content is able to exit the cell. This could only be possible if the vesicle were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane at porosomes, expel a portion of its contents, then detach, reseal, and withdraw into the cytosol (endocytose). In this way, the secretory vesicle could be reused for subsequent rounds of exo-endocytosis, until completely empty of its contents.

<text>The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is a University of Alaska Fairbanks program which researches the ionosphere – the highest, ionized part of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The most prominent instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency (HF) band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region. Work on the HAARP facility began in 1993. Initially HAARP was jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It was designed and built by BAE Advanced Technologies. Its original purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. Since 2015 it has been operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

The current working IRI was completed in 2007; its prime contractor was BAE Systems Advanced Technologies. As of 2008, HAARP had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs. In May 2014, it was announced that the HAARP program would be permanently shut down later in the year. After discussions between the parties, ownership of the facility was transferred to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in August 2015.

HAARP is a target of conspiracy theorists, who claim that it is capable of weather manipulation and mind control. Scientists and other critics point out that these claims fall well outside the abilities of the facility, and often outside the scope of current natural science.

==History==

The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program began in 1990. Ted Stevens, Republican U.S. senator from Alaska, helped win approval for the facility, and construction began in 1993.

In early May 2013, HAARP was temporarily shut down, awaiting a change between contractors to operate the facility. In July 2013, HAARP program manager James Keeney said, &quot;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is expected on site as a client to finish up some research in fall 2013 and winter 2014.&quot; The temporary shutdown was described as being due to &quot;a contractor regime change.&quot; Ahtna, Incorporated, the Alaska Native corporation serving the region of Alaska where the HAARP site is located, was reportedly in talks to take over the facility administration contract from Marsh Creek, LLC.

In May 2014, the Air Force announced that the HAARP program would be shut down later in 2014. While experiments ended in the summer of 2014, the complete shutdown and dismantling of the facility was postponed until at least May 2015. In mid-August 2015 control of the facility and its equipment was turned over to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which is making the facilities available for researchers on a pay-per-use basis.

==Project overview==
HAARP began operating in 1999 as a 6 × 8 (= 48) antenna array at 0.96 MW, expanding in 2007 to a 12 × 15 (=180) array of 180 antennas with 360 radio transmitters at 9.6 MW. It covers 14 ha near Gakona, about 250 km northeast of Anchorage. Its beam direction is anywhere within 30° of zenith.
The HAARP project directs a 3.6 MW signal, in the 2.8–10 MHz region of the HF band, into the ionosphere. The signal may be pulsed or continuous. Effects of the transmission and any recovery period can be examined using associated instrumentation, including VHF and UHF radars, HF receivers, and optical cameras. According to the HAARP team, this will advance the study of basic natural processes that occur in the ionosphere under the natural but much stronger influence of solar interaction. HAARP also enables studies of how the natural ionosphere affects radio signals.

The insights gleaned at HAARP will enable scientists to develop methods to mitigate these effects to improve the reliability or performance of communication and navigation systems which would have a wide range of both civilian and military uses, such as an increased accuracy of GPS navigation and advances in underwater and underground research and applications. This may lead, among other things, to improved methods for submarine communication or an ability to remotely sense and map the mineral content of the terrestrial subsurface, and perhaps underground complexes, of regions or countries. The current facility lacks range to be used in regions like the oil-rich Middle East, according to one of the researchers involved, but the technology could be put on a mobile platform.

The project was originally funded by the Office of Naval Research and jointly managed by the ONR and Air Force Research Laboratory, with principal involvement of the University of Alaska Fairbanks; other US universities and educational institutions involved in the development of the project and its instruments include Stanford University, Penn State University (ARL), Boston College, UCLA, Clemson University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Massachusetts Amherst, MIT, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Virginia Tech and the University of Tulsa. The project&#x27;s specifications were developed by the universities, who continued to play a major role in the design of future research efforts.

According to HAARP&#x27;s original management, the project strove for openness, and all activities were logged and publicly available, a practice which continues under the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Scientists without security clearances, even foreign nationals, were routinely allowed on site, which also continues today. HAARP hosts an open house annually, during which time any civilian can tour the entire facility. In addition, scientific results obtained using HAARP are routinely published in major research journals (such as &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; and &quot;Journal of Geophysical Research&quot;), written both by university scientists (American and foreign) and by U.S. Department of Defense research lab scientists.

==Research==
HAARP&#x27;s main goal is basic science research in the uppermost portion of the atmosphere, termed the ionosphere. Essentially a transition between the atmosphere and the magnetosphere, the ionosphere is where the atmosphere is thin enough that the Sun&#x27;s X-rays and UV rays can reach it, but thick enough that there are enough molecules present to absorb those rays. Consequently, the ionosphere consists of a rapid increase in density of free electrons, beginning at 70 km, reaching a peak at ~300 km, and then falling off again as the atmosphere disappears entirely by ~1,000 km. Various aspects of HAARP can study all of the main layers of the ionosphere.

The profile of the ionosphere is highly variable, changing constantly on timescales of minutes, hours, days, seasons, and years. This profile becomes even more complex near Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles, where the nearly vertical alignment and intensity of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field can cause physical effects like the aurora.

The ionosphere is traditionally very difficult to measure. Balloons cannot reach it because the air is too thin, but satellites cannot orbit there because the air is too thick. Hence, most experiments on the ionosphere give only small pieces of information. HAARP approaches the study of the ionosphere by following in the footsteps of an ionospheric heater called EISCAT near Tromsø, Norway. There, scientists pioneered exploration of the ionosphere by perturbing it with radio waves in the 2–10 MHz range, and studying how the ionosphere reacts. HAARP performs the same functions but with more power and a more flexible and agile HF beam.

Some of the main capabilities of HAARP include:
# Generating very low frequency (VLF) radio waves by modulated heating of the auroral electrojet, useful because generating VLF waves ordinarily requires gigantic antennas
# Generating artificial airglow, which is typically subvisual but routinely detectable.  Under certain geophysical conditions and transmitter configurations, it can be bright enough to observe with the unaided eye.
# Generating extremely low frequency (ELF) waves in the 0.1 Hz range. These are next to impossible to produce any other way, because the length of an antenna is dictated by the wavelength of the signal it emits or receives.
# Generating whistler-mode VLF signals that enter the magnetosphere and propagate to the other hemisphere, interacting with Van Allen radiation belt particles along the way
# VLF remote sensing of the heated ionosphere

Research at the HAARP has included:
# Plasma line observations
# Stimulated electron emission observations. That is, HAARP stimulates plasma waves, which creates radio waves that are received on the ground. The spectrum depends on charge density, ion mass, magnetic field strength, etc.
# Gyro frequency heating research
# Spread F observations (blurring of ionospheric echoes of radio waves due to irregularities in electron density in the F layer)
# High-velocity trace runs
# Airglow observations
# Heating induced scintillation observations
# VLF and ELF generation observations
# Radio observations of meteors
# Polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) have been studied, probing the mesosphere using the IRI as a powerful radar, and with a 28 MHz radar and two VHF radars at 49 MHz and 139 MHz. The presence of multiple radars spanning both HF and VHF bands allows scientists to make comparative measurements that may someday lead to an understanding of the processes that form these elusive phenomena.
# Research into extraterrestrial HF radar echos: the Lunar Echo experiment (2008).
# Testing of spread spectrum Transmitters (2009)
# Meteor shower impacts on the ionosphere
# Response and recovery of the ionosphere from solar flares and geomagnetic storms
# The effect of ionospheric disturbances on GPS satellite signal quality
# Producing high density plasma clouds in Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere
# The magnetic zenith effect, that airglow excited by heated electrons becomes much stronger when at the magnetic zenith (the direction of magnetic field). ~100 Rayleighs in O(1 S) 557.7 nm and O(1 D) 630 nm, the main spectral lines in aurora airglows.

Research conducted at the HAARP facility has allowed the US military to perfect communications with its fleet of submarines by sending radio signals over long distances.

== Instrumentation and operation ==
The main instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI). This is a high-power, high-frequency phased array radio transmitter with a set of 180 antennas, disposed in an array of 12×15 units that occupy a rectangle of about . The IRI is used to temporarily energize a small portion of the ionosphere. The study of these disturbed volumes yields important information for understanding natural ionospheric processes.

During active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmitter system is delivered to the antenna array and transmitted in an upward direction. At an altitude between (depending on operating frequency), the signal is partially absorbed in a small volume several tens of kilometers in diameter and a few meters thick over the IRI. The intensity of the HF signal in the ionosphere is less than 3 μW/cm2, tens of thousands of times less than the Sun&#x27;s natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth and hundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity of the Sun&#x27;s natural ultraviolet (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. The small effects that are produced can be observed with the sensitive scientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility. These observations can provide information about the dynamics of plasmas and insight into the processes of solar-terrestrial interactions.

Each antenna element consists of a crossed dipole that can be polarized for linear, ordinary mode (O-mode), or extraordinary mode (X-mode) transmission and reception.
Each part of the two section crossed dipoles is individually fed from a specially designed, custom-built transmitter that operates at very low distortion levels. The effective radiated power (ERP) of the IRI is limited by more than a factor of 10 at its lower operating frequencies. Much of this is due to higher antenna losses and a less efficient antenna pattern.

The IRI can transmit between 2.7 and 10 MHz, a frequency range that lies above the AM radio broadcast band and well below Citizens&#x27; Band frequency allocations. HAARP is licensed to transmit only in certain segments of this frequency range. When the IRI is transmitting, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is 100 kHz or less. The IRI can transmit in continuous waves (CW) or in pulses as short as 10 microseconds (μs). CW transmission is generally used for ionospheric modification, while transmission in short pulses frequently repeated is used as a radar system. Researchers can run experiments that use both modes of transmission, first modifying the ionosphere for a predetermined amount of time, then measuring the decay of modification effects with pulsed transmissions.

There are other geophysical instruments for research located at the HAARP facility. Some of them are:
* A fluxgate magnetometer built by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, available to chart variations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Rapid and sharp changes of the magnetic field may indicate a geomagnetic storm.
* A digisonde that can provide ionospheric profiles, allowing scientists to choose appropriate frequencies for IRI operation. The HAARP makes current and historic digisonde information available online.
* An induction magnetometer, provided by the University of Tokyo, that measures the changing geomagnetic field in the Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) range of 0–5 Hz.
The facility is powered by a set of five 2500 kilowatt generators being driven by EMD 20-645-E4 diesel locomotive engines.

== Site ==
The project site () is north of Gakona, Alaska just west of Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park. An environmental impact statement led to permission for an array of up to 180 antennas to be erected. HAARP was constructed at the previous site of an over-the-horizon radar (OTH) installation. A large structure, built to house the OTH now houses the HAARP control room, kitchen and offices. Several other small structures house various instruments.

The HAARP site was constructed in three distinct phases:
# The Developmental Prototype (DP) had 18 antenna elements, organized in three columns by six rows. It was fed with a total of 360 kilowatts (kW) combined transmitter output power. The DP transmitted just enough power for the most basic of ionospheric testing.
# The Filled Developmental Prototype (FDP) had 48 antenna units arrayed in six columns by eight rows, with 960 kW of transmitter power. It was fairly comparable to other ionospheric heating facilities. This was used for a number of successful scientific experiments and ionospheric exploration campaigns over the years.
# The Final IRI (FIRI) is the final build of the IRI. It has 180 antenna units, organized in 15 columns by 12 rows, yielding a theoretical maximum gain of 31 dB. A total of 3.6 MW of transmitter power will feed it, but the power is focused in the upward direction by the geometry of the large phased array of antennas which allow the antennas to work together in controlling the direction. , all the antennas were in place, the final phase was completed and the antenna array was undergoing testing aimed at fine-tuning its performance to comply with safety requirements required by regulatory agencies. The facility officially began full operations in its final status of 3.6MW transmitter power in the summer of 2007, yielding a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of 5.1gigawatts or 97.1dBW. However, the site typically operates at a fraction of that power due to the lower antenna gain exhibited at frequencies used in standard operation.

== Related facilities ==
In the United States, there have been two related ionospheric heating facilities: the HIPAS, near Fairbanks, Alaska, which was dismantled in 2009, and one at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which collapsed in 2020. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) operates an ionospheric heating facility capable of transmitting over 1 GW effective radiated power (ERP), near Tromsø, Norway. The Sura Ionospheric Heating Facility, in Vasilsursk, Russia, near Nizhniy Novgorod, is capable of transmitting 190 MW ERP.

==Conspiracy theories==
HAARP is the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. Various individuals have speculated about hidden motivations and capabilities of the project. For example, Rosalie Bertell warned in 1996 about the deployment of HAARP as a military weapon. Michel Chossudovsky stated in a book published by the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform that &quot;recent scientific evidence suggests that HAARP is fully operational and has the capability of triggering floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes.&quot; Over time, HAARP has been blamed for generating such catastrophes, as well as thunderstorms, in Iran, Pakistan, Haiti, Turkey, Greece and the Philippines, and even major power outages, the downing of TWA Flight 800, Gulf War syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Allegations include the following:
* Nick Begich Jr., the son of the late U.S. Representative Nick Begich Sr., brother of former U.S. Senator Mark Begich and retired Alaska state senator Tom Begich, and father of current U.S. Representative Nick Begich III is the co-author of &quot;Angels Don&#x27;t Play This HAARP.&quot; He has claimed that the HAARP facility could trigger earthquakes and turn the upper atmosphere into a giant lens so that &quot;the sky would literally appear to burn.&quot; He maintains a website that claims HAARP is a mind control device.
* A Russian military journal wrote that ionospheric testing would &quot;trigger a cascade of electrons that could flip Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles&quot;.
* The Alaska state legislature and the European Parliament held hearings about HAARP, the latter citing environmental concerns.
* Former Governor of Minnesota, ex-professional wrestler, and documentary maker Jesse Ventura questioned whether the government is using the site to manipulate the weather or to bombard people with mind-controlling radio waves. An Air Force spokeswoman said Ventura made an official request to visit the research station but was rejected. &quot;He and his crew showed up at HAARP anyway and were denied access.&quot;
* Physicist Bernard Eastlund claimed that HAARP includes technology based on his own patents that has the capability to modify weather and neutralize satellites.
* It has been proposed as a cause of low frequency background hums said to be heard in various locales.

In 1995, Elisabeth Rehn, Finnish Member of the European Parliament, tabled a motion for a resolution on the potential use of military-related resources for environmental strategies. The proposal is referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defense Policy for substantive consideration. Magda Aelvoet, Belgian MEP and President of the Green Group, becomes convinced that HAARP is a secret weapon system. In 1998, the two MEPs, convinced by Begich&#x27;s theory that HAARP poses a threat to the environment, decided to write a report in which they interviewed only two people — Begich and Rosalie Bertell, head of a Canadian association which also supports the conspiracy theory of chemtrails — the invited representatives of the United States and NATO did not respond. It is on the basis of these two testimonies alone, in which Begich is described as a doctor without having any qualification, that a report by the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defense Policy relating to the environment, security and foreign policy takes up these assertions and adopts a resolution indicating that &quot;HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project) by virtue of its far-reaching impact on the environment to be a global concern and (the European Parliament) calls for its legal, ecological and ethical implications to be examined by an international independent body before any further research and testing.&quot;

Two Georgia men arrested on drug charges in November 2016 were reportedly plotting domestic terrorism based on conspiracy theories about HAARP. The Coffee County Sheriff&#x27;s Office said the men possessed a &quot;massive arsenal&quot; that included AR-15 rifles, Glock handguns, a Remington rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition. According to police, the men wanted to destroy HAARP because they believed the facility manipulates the weather, controls minds and even traps the souls of people. Police say the men confessed that &quot;God told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released.&quot;

Stanford University professor Umran Inan told &quot;Popular Science&quot; that weather-control conspiracy theories were &quot;completely uninformed,&quot; explaining that &quot;there&#x27;s absolutely nothing we can do to disturb the Earth&#x27;s [weather] systems. Even though the power HAARP radiates is very large, it&#x27;s minuscule compared with the power of a lightning flash—and there are 50 to 100 lightning flashes every second. HAARP&#x27;s intensity is very small.&quot; Computer scientist David Naiditch characterizes HAARP as &quot;a magnet for conspiracy theorists,&quot; saying that HAARP attracts their attention because, &quot;its purpose seems deeply mysterious to the scientifically uninformed.&quot; Journalist Sharon Weinberger called HAARP &quot;the Moby Dick of conspiracy theories,&quot; and said the popularity of conspiracy theories often overshadows the benefits HAARP may provide to the scientific community. Austin Baird writing in the &quot;Alaska Dispatch&quot; said, &quot;What makes HAARP susceptible to conspiracy criticism is simple. The facility doesn&#x27;t open its doors in the same way as other federally funded research facilities around the country, and it doesn&#x27;t go to great efforts to explain the importance of its research to the public.&quot; In 2016, in response to these claims, the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, which manages the facility, announced that HAARP will host an annual open house in August, allowing visitors to tour the complex.

This project resurfaced again during the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as &quot;COP 27&quot;, sparking conspiracies as well as many fantasies, and speaking also about geo-engineering.

Following the recent 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, this project, including that of &quot;Blue Beam&quot;, has also been accused of having caused earthquakes, giving rise to numerous conspiracy theories.

On January 11, 2024, far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, in a Twitter post, suggested that presidential candidate Nikki Haley was using HAARP to conjure up a mid-January blizzard in Iowa in order to hurt fellow candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s chances in the Iowa caucuses.

Following the widespread visibility of the aurora borealis over much of the Northern Hemisphere in May and again in October 2024, conspiracy theorists promoted HAARP as the true cause of the event.

== In popular culture ==
HAARP gave rise to a live album by the rock band Muse and became the theme of novels like &quot;La Route de Gakona&quot; by .

HAARP is the key plot point in &quot;Breaking Point&quot; of Tom Clancy&#x27;s Net Force (2000), where it is used to induce group madness.

The HAARP facility appears in the 2004 video game &quot;X-Men Legends&quot;. In the game, the X-Men track the Brotherhood of Mutants to HAARP. The facility is significantly different from its real life counterpart, with snowy valleys around it and vast icy tunnels below. It is guarded by an extensive security force, including armed guards and tanks. The X-Men eventually locate the Brotherhood and learn that sensitive information, including the location of Magneto&#x27;s imprisonment, is kept in the HAARP computers.

Season 1, episode 11, of the UPN TV series &quot;Seven Days&quot; was titled &quot;HAARP Attack&quot;. It was broadcast on January 27, 1999.

The HAARP facility is briefly mentioned in the lore of the game &quot;Project Zomboid&quot;, a zombie survival game set in a fictionalised Knox County, Kentucky in 1993. HAARP is mentioned in the collectable home VHS tape &quot;conspiracy crap???&quot;, equating it to other &quot;lies&quot; the US Military has made regarding UFOs and the Philadelphia Experiment.

In December 2023, an in-game map inspired and named after HAARP was added to &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;.

The Missing in Alaska series, Zombies of HAARP episode, attempts to claim The top secret government facility known as HAARP, an electromagnetic generator, could be turning people into zombies and causing them to disappear in the Alaska Triangle.

<text>Levy County ( ) is a county located on the Gulf coast in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 42,915. Its county seat is Bronson. It has been included in the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area since 2018.

==History==
Levy County was created in 1845, after the Seminole Wars, and became Florida&#x27;s 27th county. It was named for David Levy Yulee, a slave owner elected in 1841 as the state&#x27;s territorial delegate to the US House of Representatives, where he served two terms.

Levy provided for long-term development in the state by constructing the first railroad across Florida, the Florida Railroad, linking the deep-water ports of Fernandina (Port of Fernandina) on the Atlantic Ocean and Cedar Key on the Gulf of Mexico.

The original county seat of Levy County was located in a neighborhood locally known as Sodom. This concerned the county commission so much that in April 1854 they changed the name to “Mount Pleasant”. The name was changed again in January 1856 to &quot;Levyville&quot;. An act of the State of Florida legislature ordered the county commissioners to let the county residents vote on the location of the county seat. In 1869, a vote was held to decide the location for the county seat. Bronson was selected by popular vote. County officials sited illegal votes cast in every precinct, so a new election was set to take place in 30 days. The Board of County Commissioners would later reverse their previous decision and let the vote stand. The process to build a new courthouse at Bronson began along with the removal of the courthouse at Levyville. 

In 1874, the county seat was moved to Bronson, originally known as “Chunky Pond”, and was named after an early settler, Isaac Bronson.

The Rosewood Massacre occurred in Levy County in the first week of January 1923. White citizens from the nearby town of Sumner, reacting to a what turned out to be a false accusation that a black man raped a white woman, burned the predominantly black town of Rosewood to the ground and brutally murdered several of Rosewood&#x27;s black citizens. A film based on the incident was made in 1997, but was not filmed in Levy County.

==Proposed nuclear power plant==

On April 7, 2008, Progress Energy Florida of St. Petersburg announced it had authorized Shaw and Westinghouse to purchase long-lead-time materials for up to two AP1000 nuclear reactors for its Levy County plant, a greenfield plant in Levy County, producing about 1,100 MW each.

Progress expects to apply for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) in the summer of 2008, according to a spokeswoman. Southern Company and SCANA, of whom each own an interest in the plant, would not reveal cost estimates, but Progress has said its plant will cost $14 billion, with an additional $3 billion required for transmission infrastructure.

Applying for a COL does not commit the utilities to construct the plant, but it is part of the licensing process, say officials of all the utilities. The application starts a 40-month review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, meaning that approval could come in August 2011.

In late July 2013 the company said it had scrapped its plan to build the plant.

Levy County has only one railroad line running throughout the county, and only within eastern Levy along US 41. The line is a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad line that is now used by the Florida Northern Railroad for freight to the Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Red Level, Citrus County. Notable abandoned lines include a Seaboard Air Line Railroad line that is in proximity to the existing former ACL line, a Florida Railway and Navigation Company line running parallel to State Road 24, and a third in western and southern Levy County that spans from Fanning Springs towards the Dunnellon area running along US 19-98 until it reaches Lebanon Junction, where it runs along CR 336. The segment of that line between Fanning Springs and Chiefland is part of the Nature Coast State Trail.

===Major roads===

* is the main local road through western Levy County, running south to north.
* runs northwest to southeast from Marion County and joins US 41 in Williston on its way to High Springs.
* is a bannered alternate of US 27 that runs northwest and southeast from US 27/US 41/SR 121 in Williston to US 19/US 98 in Chiefland, which it joins on its way to Perry.
* is the main local road through eastern Levy County, running south to north. Until the north end of the concurrency with SR 121 in Williston, the road is also shared by the DeSoto Trail.
* is an auxiliary route of US 29 that runs northeast from Chiefland, and then turns north in Trenton on its way through Jasper before heading north into Georgia.
* is an east to west highway through the central part of the county from Cedar Key into Alachua County. A county-suffixed alternate route can be found in Bronson.
* is a south to north road that runs southwest to northeast from Lebanon Junction through Williston, and then into Alachua County and beyond, as it takes a long journey through Georgia and South Carolina as a tri-state de facto auxiliary route from U.S. Route 21 in Rock Hill, South Carolina.
* is an east–west route connecting Manatee Springs State Park with US 19/98/Alternate US 27 in Chiefland. A county extension of the road exists north of the eastern terminus with US 19/98/ALT 27 leading to CR 339 in Newton.
* is a combined county and state road spanning from Rosewood to Chiefland.
* runs mostly east and west through southern Levy County. It spans from the Gulf of Mexico in Yankeetown winding along the Withlacoochee River, on the way to Dunnellon and Rainbow Lakes Estates in Marion County, where it eventually becomes State Road 40. The segment between the Gulf of Mexico and US 19-98 is officially named Follow That Dream Boulevard, after the 1962 Elvis Presley movie.
* runs mostly east and west through southeastern Levy County as a bi-county extension of State Road 326. It spans from a dead end at the Waccasassa River in Gulf Hammock winding northeast through US 19-98 until it reaches CR 343 where it turns east. After running through Goethe State Forest it intersects CR 337 in Morris Junction, and then SR 121. By the time it reaches eastern Levy County it has a brief multiplex with southbound US 41 where both serve as the southern terminus of CR 323, only for CR 326 to turn east again as it eventually crosses the Levy-Marion County line, on the way to Ocala and Silver Springs. The segment between I-75 (Exit 358) and SR 40 becomes a state road.
* is a bi-county road that runs mostly southeast and northwest through southwestern Levy County in two segments. It spans from CR 347 southwest of Chiefland, along various local streets, and even overlaps CR 345, then runs southeast toward SR 24 at Otter Creek. From there it is hidden along local streets that merge with US 19–98, which completely overshadows it until the at-grade interchange with SR 121 in Lebanon Junction, where it is exposed again running through the southern segment of Goethe State Forest, and later crosses the Levy-Marion County line, where it overlaps CR 40 all the way to Dunnellon.
* is a tri-county road that runs south and north through central Levy County, as well as southwestern Alachua and eastern Gilchrist counties. It spans from CR 336 in Goethe State Forest and runs primarily along the eastern outskirts of the forest occasionally entering some forest land. North of the forest area, it enters the city of Bronson, where it intersects US Alternate 27, SR 24 and CR 32. Further north of the city limits it crosses the Levy-Alachua County line.

<text>Madison County is a county located in the north central portion of the state of Florida, and borders the state of Georgia to the north. As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,968. Its county seat is also called Madison.

==History==
Located in what is known as the Florida Panhandle, Madison County was created in 1827. It was named for James Madison, fourth President of the United States of America, who served from 1809 to 1817. It was developed as part of the plantation belt, with cotton cultivated and processed by enslaved African Americans.
The county&#x27;s economic and population growth was stagnant from the 1880s and for several decades into the early 20th century.

In the period after Reconstruction, racial violence rose in the state, reaching a peak at the end of the 19th century and extending into the difficult economic years of the 1920s and 1930s. According to the Equal Justice Institute&#x27;s 2015 report, &quot;Lynching in America: Confronting Racial Terror&quot;, from 1877 to 1950, Madison County had 16 lynchings in this period, the 6th highest of any county in the state. 

In 1945, the county&#x27;s population of 15,537 was divided evenly between black and white. 

The last known lynching in the county was that in October 1945 of Jesse James Payne, a young married sharecropper with a child. After an economic dispute with the white landowner where he was sharecropping, where Payne escaped murder following &quot;a demand for an unjust debt repayment&quot;, he was charged with sexually assaulting the landowner&#x27;s daughter, but was innocent. The sheriff and other law enforcement officials appeared implicated in Payne&#x27;s murder, as he was left in the county jail unguarded after mob action had been threatened. Payne&#x27;s was the only recorded lynching nationwide that year, when World War II ended. The case received national attention and the governor was strongly criticized for failure to mount a true investigation or to take action against the sheriff.

In 1949, Ernest Thomas, a WWII veteran, was tracked to a swamp in Madison County after he had fled from a wrongful accusation of rape in Groveland, Florida. He was found sleeping under a tree and was shot an estimated 400 times by a lynch mob led by Lake County Sheriff Willis V. McCall.

As of August 2012, Madison became a wet county, meaning that voters had approved the legal sale, possession, or distribution of alcoholic beverages.

<text>Manatee County is a county in the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the population was 399,710. Manatee County is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its county seat and largest city is Bradenton. The county was created in 1855 and named for the Florida manatee, Florida&#x27;s official marine mammal. Features of Manatee County include access to the southern part of the Tampa Bay estuary, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, and the Manatee River.

==History==

=== Prehistoric history ===
The area now known as Manatee County had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. Shell middens and other archaeological digs have been conducted throughout the county including at Terra Ceia and at Perico Island. These digs revealed materials belonging to peoples from the Woodland period.

=== European exploration and early settlement ===
Some historians have suggested that the southern mouth of the Manatee River was the landing site of the De Soto Expedition.

Due to conflict during the Patriot War and First Seminole War, many Native American and African American refugees fled to the Tampa Bay region of Florida and some settled in modern-day Manatee County. The settlement they founded on the Manatee River was called Angola. By 1819, the population of Angola may have reached as high as 600-700 people.

The Manatee area was opened to settlement in 1842 with the passing of the federal Armed Occupation Act. Early settlements included the Manatee Colony led by Colonel Samuel Reid that numbered thirty-one individuals both black and white. Other prominent early settlers were Joseph and Hector Braden who moved into an area near the Manatee River in 1842. The two had lost their land for their plantations in Northern Florida during the Panic of 1837. They were said to have heard that there was abundant land in the area. The brothers moved into a log cabin five miles north of the mouth of the Manatee River. Four years later Hector drowned while trying to cross the Manatee River on his horse during a hurricane. Despite this tragic event, Joseph decided he would still build the Braden sugar mill at the mouth of the Manatee River and the Braden River. He later built a dock where Main Street was and fortified the area near his house by building a stockade. A few years later in 1851, he built the Braden Castle, which was made out of tabby and served as his residence. In spring of 1856, the fortified home was attacked by Seminole Indians during the Third Seminole War. It later became a popular tourist attraction in the early 1900s with Tin Can Tourists. He would only stay there for the next six years before moving to Tallahassee.

=== County formation and development === 
Manatee County was carved out from a vast Hillsborough County in January 1855 and led by Florida Senate President Hamlin V. Snell. The new county covered 5,000 square miles and included all of what are now Charlotte County, DeSoto County, Glades County, Hardee County, Highlands County, Sarasota County, and part of Lee County. The original county seat was Manatee, a village on the southern shore of the Manatee River in what now is eastern Bradenton. In 1866, the county seat was moved from the village of Manatee to Pine Level, as a result of a referendum mandated by the Florida Legislature. In 1887, the county seat was moved again due to the creation of DeSoto County within the existing boundaries. Braiden Town (Bradenton) was selected as the new county seat by referendum of the county residents who mostly resided near the Manatee River. In 1921, Sarasota County was created by the Florida Legislature and further reducing Manatee County to its current boundaries.

=== American Civil War === 
Following the Seminole Wars, Manatee County continued to grow both in population and in economic output. Cattle, hogs, and some sheep were raised. Processed sugar and molasses was produced and exported. This agricultural economy, like much of the south, was increasingly becoming reliant on slave labor. A federal census in 1860 showed that the county had a population of 601 white people and 214 enslaved black people. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Manatee County provided supplies to the Confederate army. Aside from the Union blockade, the Federal army dispatched raiding parties throughout Florida to further limit the Confederate supply chain. For example, in August 1864, the Union schooner USS Stonewall came up the Manatee river on a raid. According to the Florida State Archives, Dr. Braden&#x27;s sugar works was destroyed during the raid. However, another source states that Braden&#x27;s property was left untouched.

According to a partial list of soldiers of the Confederate States of America, the county also sent at least 100 of its citizens to fight. Some of the men from Manatee would be recruited to the 7th Florida Infantry Regiment, which fought as part of the Army of Tennessee.

Within Manatee County is the Gamble Plantation, a sugar plantation and home of Major Robert Gamble. According to some, following the Civil War, the Confederate Secretary of State, Judah P. Benjamin, took refuge at the mansion before escaping to England.

=== History of libraries ===

Manatee County&#x27;s first public library was a privately owned rental library created by Julia Fuller at the Mrs. Bass Dry Goods store in 1898. The county&#x27;s first independent library opened in Bradenton in 1907, followed a Carnegie Library in Palmetto in 1914 and another in Bradenton in 1918. For much of the twentieth century, both cities&#x27; libraries were free to city residents while county residents had to pay a non-resident fee. In 1964, the Bradenton and Palmetto library associations merged with the Manatee County government to create the Manatee County Public Library System. This was followed by the establishment of a bookmobile for rural areas in 1964 and a Talking Books program for the blind in 1966.

As demands on the bookmobile grew and the library collection outstripped the existing buildings in Bradenton and Palmetto, the first branch of the Manatee County Public Library system was built in Bayshore in 1967, followed by a new branch on East Ninth Street in 1969 and an Island branch in 1971, the last of which was moved into a new building in 1983. A new building for the Palmetto Library was built in 1969, followed by the modern Central Public Library in downtown Bradenton in 1978.

The 1990s saw a period of rapid growth in Manatee County and the library system grew accordingly, with the Braden River, Rocky Bluff, and South Manatee branches opening in 1991, 1994, and 1998, respectively. The Braden River branch moved to a new building in 1997. The Rocky Bluff location would be moved to a larger location, featuring a built in café, in 2011. The new location is still physically within Ellenton. The additions as well as investment into various technologies such as modern computers, a 3-D Printing Lab, as well as new loanable items, brings Manatee County Libraries to its modern services.

Reciprocal borrowing began in 2000 between Manatee and Sarasota County Libraries, which would be followed by statewide reciprocal borrowing programs. Starting in 2017, the Manatee County library system began offering items including musical instruments, tools, telescopes, binoculars, cake pans, hotspots, and museum passes. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the library system began offering WiFi hotspots to patrons in order to provide internet service remotely to work safely and at home. This began in Spring of 2020.

On December 15, 2021, the county broke ground for a new East County library, which was to serve the community of Lakewood Ranch. The new library was scheduled to open mid-2023. The new library, dubbed the Lakewood Ranch Library, had its grand opening on January 12, 2024.

=== Political history ===
Manatee County is part of the strongly Republican Sun Belt. The area became a Republican stronghold following World War II and has remained so since: the last Democrat to win Manatee County was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944.

During the peak of the Socialist Party&#x27;s prominence in the early 20th century, Manatee County would elect the only socialist to the state legislature, Andrew Jackson Pettigrew to the Florida House of Representatives in 1906 for one term defeating John A. Graham (who was a Democrat) in the general election. As a state legislator he would make several proposals that were inline with what the Party reflected at the national level such as making US Senators popularly elected and creating a national income tax. Overall as a state legislator he would make little progress in getting legislation proposed by him passed. Prior to the 1906 race he would run in 1904 for the same position unsuccessfully losing to A.T. Cornwell (also a Democrat) who had served as Bradenton&#x27;s first mayor and in a variety of positions at the county level. Pettigrew would later go on to run for governor in 1908 and Secretary of Agriculture in 1912 being unsuccessful in both races.

In 1970, Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. fired Manatee County&#x27;s superintendent along with the entire school board and appointed himself in their place in an attempt to end desegregation busing. This situation would last from April 6 to 13 before Kirk left his position as the superintendent.

<text>Dryas octopetala, the mountain avens, eightpetal mountain-avens, white dryas or white dryad, is an Arctic–alpine flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a small prostrate evergreen subshrub forming large colonies. The specific epithet &quot;octopetala&quot; derives from Greek &quot;octo&quot; &#x27;eight&#x27; and &quot;petalon&quot; &#x27;petal&#x27;, referring to the eight petals of the flower, an unusual number in the Rosaceae, where five is the normal number. However, flowers with up to 16 petals also occur naturally.

As a floral emblem, it is the official territorial flower of the Northwest Territories and the national flower of Iceland.

==Description==
The stems are woody, tortuous, with short, horizontal rooting branches. The leaves are glabrous above, densely white-tomentose beneath. The flowers are produced on stalks long, and have eight creamy white petals – hence the specific epithet &quot;octopetala&quot;. The style is persistent on the fruit with white feathery hairs, functioning as a wind-dispersal agent. The feathery hairs of the seed head first appear twisted together and glossy before spreading out to an expanded ball which the wind quickly disperses.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Dryas octopetala&quot; has a widespread occurrence throughout mountainous areas where it is generally restricted to limestone outcrops. These include the entire Arctic, as well as the mountains of Scandinavia, Iceland, the Alps, the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and in isolated locations elsewhere. In Great Britain, it occurs in the Pennines of Northern England, at two locations in the Snowdonia region of North Wales, and more widely in the Scottish Highlands. In Ireland, it occurs on The Burren and a few other sites. In North America, it is found in Alaska, most frequently on previously glaciated terrain, and through the Canadian Rockies reaching as far south as Colorado in the Rocky Mountains.
It grows in dry localities where snow melts early, on gravel and rocky barrens, forming a distinct heath community on calcareous soils.

==Climatology==
The Younger Dryas, Older Dryas and Oldest Dryas stadials are named after &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;, because of the great quantities of its pollen found in cores dating from those times. During these cold spells, &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot; was much more widely distributed than it is today, as large parts of the Northern Hemisphere that are now covered by forests were replaced in the cold periods by tundra.

==Cultivation==
&quot;D. octopetala&quot; is cultivated in temperate regions as groundcover, or as an alpine or rock garden plant. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. The leaves are occasionally used as an herbal tea.

<text>Nassau County is a county located in the U.S. state of Florida. It is the northeasternmost county in the state. The county seat is Fernandina Beach. The population was 90,352 at the 2020 census.

Nassau County is a constituent of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which accommodates around 1.68 million inhabitants as of 2022. The county is situated in Northeast Florida with a land area of . The county&#x27;s population has surged by more than 40,000 residents since the year 2000, driven by factors such as Nassau&#x27;s nearness to downtown Jacksonville, the emergence of fresh residential projects, agricultural output, prominent tourist destinations, and a broadening tax foundation through the influx of novel industrial and business enterprises to the county. Nassau County is also a favored residential destination for military personnel stationed at bases in the adjacent Duval County, Florida (Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Naval Station Mayport) and Camden County, Georgia (Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay). Nassau County celebrated 200 years with its bicentennial celebration in 2024.

==History==

Nassau County was created in 1824 from Duval County. It was named for the Duchy of Nassau in Germany.
The Battle of Alligator Bridge took place in Nassau County around Callahan on June 30, 1778, and was the only major engagement in an unsuccessful campaign to conquer British East Florida during the American Revolutionary War.

In 1817, the short-lived Republic of the Floridas was established on Amelia Island. It was one of several attempts to wrest Florida from Spanish control into the growing United States.

Some of the men from the county had formed a militia unit called the Davis Guards leading up to the Civil War. This unit would be organized as Company K of the 2nd Florida Infantry Regiment in the Confederate army.

Similar to a significant portion of the southern Atlantic region in the United States, Nassau County experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). This entails moderate conditions in the winter months and warm, humid conditions throughout the summer. Precipitation patterns show a concentration of rainfall during the warmer months spanning from May to September, whereas the drier period falls between November and April.

===Topography===
There are 12 distinct topographical zones in Nassau County. Most of these zones run in narrow bands stretching from north to south, although this is less true as one approaches the Atlantic coast.
# Directly against the western border with Baker County, the topography ranges from fairly flat to slightly elevated. Drainage is poor and the soil is sandy.
# Moving east, there are some areas (mostly in the northern and central county) of higher ground with much better drainage.
# East of these areas are some lower places, especially in the south, that are level and have extremely poor drainage.
# Eastward again, there is a stretch that ranges from a few miles in the extreme northern areas to about 6- wide in the southern area, including Hilliard and much of County Road 108 and State Road 301. This area again has very poor drainage, low-lying land, and fairly sandy soil.
# East of this are scattered areas of high, sandy land with spotty or poor drainage.
# East of this, there is an area including Callahan with very sandy soil on top, and clay underneath. This section of the county is heavily permeated by small creeks and rivers, which bring with them low, poorly drained soils. This zone extends across the entire county from north to south at a fairly consistent width of about 3-, except in the north, where it widens to nearly across.
# East of this area is a large band of land with a consistent width of about . The land is low and level with extremely poor drainage, and it is permeated by small creeks and rivers. In the northern section, this is where some tributaries join the St. Marys River, while in the south a number of tributaries drain into the Nassau River, which flows into the Nassau Sound and the Atlantic Ocean.
# East of this area is a section of land about in width that has extremely sandy soils with bad drainage all around.
# Further eastward is a large area, including Yulee and O&#x27;Neil, about in width, with poor drainage and sandy soil at higher elevations, pockmarked by large areas of low lands with even worse drainage.
# To the south is an area of low-lying, organic soils which are essentially marshes and wetlands along the northern bank of the Nassau River, continuing into the Nassau Sound.
# Still eastward and somewhat to the north is a large area of marshes and organic soils which characterize area wetlands. There are many small islands in this area, and it is permeated by the Bells River and Jolly River, which empty into the Cumberland Sound to the north, just below Cumberland Island.
# Amelia Island, the easternmost section of the county, is characterized by poor drainage in the west and better drained, higher, sandier land as one travels eastward towards the beach. The northern area of the island features salty marshlands surrounding Egan&#x27;s Creek, which runs directly beneath Atlantic Boulevard in Fernandina Beach.

<text>Christopher D&#x27;Olier Reeve (September 25, 1952 – October 10, 2004) was an American actor, activist, director, and author. He amassed several stage and screen credits in his 34-year career, including playing the title character in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series (1978–1987). He won a British Academy Film Award, an Emmy Award, a Grammy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. He was also known for his activism.

Born in New York City and raised in Princeton, New Jersey, Reeve discovered a passion for acting and theater at the age of nine. He studied at Cornell University and the Juilliard School, making his Broadway debut in 1976. His breakthrough came with playing the title character in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and its three sequels (1980–1987). Afterwards, Reeve turned down multiple roles in big-budget movies, focusing instead on independent films and plays with complex characters. He appeared in critically successful films such as &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980), &quot;Deathtrap&quot; (1982), &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984), &quot;Street Smart&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), and in the plays &quot;Fifth of July&quot; on Broadway and &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; in London&#x27;s West End.

Beginning in the 1980s, Reeve was an activist for environmental and human-rights causes and for artistic freedom of expression. In 1995, Reeve was paralyzed from the neck down after being thrown from a horse during an equestrian competition in Culpeper, Virginia. He used a wheelchair and ventilator for the rest of his life. After his accident, he lobbied for spinal injury research, including human embryonic stem cell research, and for better insurance coverage for people with disabilities. His advocacy work included leading the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and co-founding the Reeve-Irvine Research Center.

Reeve later directed &quot;In the Gloaming&quot; (1997), acted in the television remake of &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1998), and made two appearances in the Superman-themed television series &quot;Smallville&quot; (2003). He also wrote two autobiographical books: &quot;Still Me&quot; (1998) and &quot;Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life&quot; (2002). He died in 2004 from heart failure at a hospital near his home in Westchester County, New York.

==Early life and education==
Reeve was born on September 25, 1952, in New York City, the son of Barbara Pitney Lamb, an associate editor of &quot;Town Topics&quot;, and Franklin D&#x27;Olier Reeve, a teacher, novelist, poet, and scholar. Many of his ancestors had been in America since the early 17th century, some having been aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Through his mother, he was a 12th generation descendant of William Bradford, a pilgrim and five-time Governor of Plymouth Colony. Other ancestors of Reeve came from the French aristocracy. For over 25 years his great-grandfather, Franklin D&#x27;Olier, was CEO of the Prudential Insurance Company. His grand-uncle, Franklin D&#x27;Olier Jr., was married to Margaret Winifred Lee, the maternal aunt of First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

Franklin and Barbara divorced in 1956, and she moved with Christopher and his younger brother Benjamin to Princeton, New Jersey, where they attended Nassau Street School and then Princeton Day School (PDS). Reeve&#x27;s parents both remarried; he had five half-siblings and several step-siblings. Reeve excelled academically, athletically, and onstage; he was on the honor roll and played soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey. He also played the piano and sang in the choir as a soprano.

Reeve had a difficult relationship with his father, Franklin. He wrote in 1998 that his father&#x27;s &quot;love for his children always seemed tied to performance&quot; and he put pressure on himself to act older than he actually was in order to gain his father&#x27;s approval. Between 1988 and 1995 the two barely spoke to each other, but they reconciled after Reeve&#x27;s paralyzing accident.

Reeve found his passion for acting in 1962 at age nine when he was cast in an amateur version of the operetta &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;; it was the first of many student plays. His interest was solidified when at age 15, he spent a summer as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

After graduating from PDS in June 1970, Reeve acted in plays in Boothbay, Maine. He planned to go to New York City to find a career in theater. Ultimately, however, at the advice of his mother, he applied for college. He was accepted into Princeton University, Columbia University, Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern University, and Carnegie Mellon University. Reeve said he chose Cornell primarily because it was distant from New York City and this would help him avoid the temptation of working as an actor immediately versus finishing college, as he had promised his mother and stepfather. Reeve joined the theater department in Cornell and played Pozzo in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Segismundo in &quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;, Hamlet in &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, and Polixenes in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Late in his freshman year, Reeve received a letter from Stark Hesseltine, a high-powered New York City agent who had discovered Robert Redford and who represented actors such as Richard Chamberlain, Michael Douglas, and Susan Sarandon. Hesseltine had seen Reeve in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; and wanted to represent him. Reeve was excited and kept re-reading the letter to make sure of what it said. Reeve was impatient with school and eager to get on with his career. The two met, but Reeve was surprised to find Hesseltine strongly supported his promise to his mother and stepfather to complete college. They decided instead of dropping out of school, Reeve would come to New York once a month to meet casting agents and producers to find work for the summer vacation.

Reeve received favorable responses to his introductions and auditions arranged by Hesseltine but had to forgo several desirable opportunities because they began before school ended. In the summer, he toured in a production of &quot;Forty Carats&quot; with Eleanor Parker. The next year, Reeve received a full summer contract with the San Diego Shakespeare Festival, with roles as Edward IV in &quot;Richard III&quot;, Fenton in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, and Dumaine in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; at the Old Globe Theatre.

Before his third year of college, Reeve took a three-month leave of absence. He traveled to Glasgow, Scotland, and saw theatrical productions throughout the United Kingdom. He was inspired by the actors there, and often had conversations with them in bars after their performances. He helped actors at The Old Vic with their American accents by reading the newspaper aloud for them. He then flew to Paris to study the French theater. Reeve spoke fluent French, having studied it from the third grade through his first year in Cornell. While there he spoke only French to immerse himself in French culture, and watched many performances.

After returning to the US from Europe, Reeve chose to focus solely on acting, although Cornell had several general education requirements for graduation he had yet to complete. He managed to convince theater director John Clancy and the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, as a theater major, he would achieve more at Juilliard (Group 4, 1973–1975) in New York City than at Cornell. They agreed his first year at Juilliard would be counted as his senior year at Cornell.

In 1973, approximately 2,000 students auditioned for 20 places in the freshman class at Juilliard. Reeve&#x27;s audition was in front of 10 faculty members, including John Houseman, who had just won an Academy Award for &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;. Reeve and Robin Williams were the only students selected for Juilliard&#x27;s Advanced Program. They had several classes together in which they were the only students. In their dialects class with Edith Skinner, Williams had no trouble mastering all dialects naturally, whereas Reeve was more meticulous about it. Williams and Reeve developed a close friendship. Reeve was a godfather to Williams&#x27; eldest son Zachary.

In a meeting with Houseman, Reeve was told, &quot;Mr. Reeve. It is terribly important that you become a serious classical actor. Unless, of course, they offer you a shitload of money to do something else.&quot; Houseman then offered him the chance to leave school and join the Acting Company, among performers such as Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, and David Ogden Stiers. Reeve declined, as he had not yet received his bachelor&#x27;s degree.

In early 1974, Reeve and other Juilliard students toured the New York City junior high school system and performed &quot;The Love Cure&quot;. In one performance, Reeve, who played the hero, drew his sword out too high and accidentally destroyed a row of lights above him. The students applauded and cheered. Reeve later said this was the greatest ovation of his career. After completing his first year at Juilliard, Reeve graduated from Cornell in the Class of 1974 as a double major in English and music theory.

==Career==

===Early work===
In 1974, Reeve auditioned for the soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot; to pay tuition fees at Juilliard. Initially, he was promised a schedule that would not interfere with his studies. However, his character quickly gained popularity, leading to increased screen time. When Reeve reminded the producers of their agreement, they responded that it wasn&#x27;t set in writing. The following year, Reeve had to leave Juilliard to fulfill his contract with CBS. He received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Juilliard in 1997.

In between filming for the soap opera, Reeve took acting classes at the HB Studio and appeared in an Off-off-Broadway production of &quot;Berchtesgaden&quot; at the Theater for the New City. The play was directed by Barbara Loden, who became Reeve&#x27;s mentor. She coached him not to play &quot;on the nose&quot;, and he often followed that advice over the years. After that, he starred in a limited run of &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club.

In late 1975, Reeve auditioned for the Broadway play &quot;A Matter of Gravity&quot;. Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her character&#x27;s grandson. With Hepburn&#x27;s influence over CBS, Reeve worked out the schedules of the soap opera and the play so he would be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals and experienced exhaustion and malnutrition. At one of the performances, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, &quot;This boy&#x27;s a goddamn fool. He doesn&#x27;t eat enough red meat.&quot; The understudy finished the play for Reeve, and a doctor treated him. The doctor advised Reeve to eat a healthier diet. He stayed with the play for nine months and was given favorable reviews.

Reeve and Hepburn became very close. Some gossip columns rumored a romance between the two. Reeve said, &quot;She was 67 and I was 22, but I thought that was quite an honor. ... I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her.&quot; She told him, &quot;You&#x27;re going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age.&quot; He replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait long.&quot; Reeve said his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in June 1976, Reeve—to Hepburn&#x27;s disappointment—dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play&#x27;s run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer and just sending messages back and forth.

Reeve&#x27;s first role in a Hollywood film was a small part as a junior officer in the 1978 naval submarine disaster movie &quot;Gray Lady Down&quot;, starring Charlton Heston. He then acted in the play &quot;My Life&quot; at the Circle Repertory Company with friend William Hurt.

===&quot;Superman&quot; films===

During the Off-Broadway production of &quot;My Life&quot;, Stark Hesseltine told Reeve he had been asked to audition for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big-budget film &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve&#x27;s picture and résumé on the top of the pile three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmaster&#x27;s persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was arranged. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Donner&#x27;s motto was &quot;verisimilitude&quot;. Hesseltine also told him that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve flew to London for a screen test, but he still did not believe he had much of a chance. On the plane ride, he imagined his approach to the role. He later said, &quot;By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed. ... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability. ... I felt that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image.&quot; He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant in his role in &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. After the screen test, his driver said, &quot;I&#x27;m not supposed to tell you this, but you&#x27;ve got the part.&quot;

Portraying Superman would be a stretch for the 24-year-old actor. He was tall, but his physique was slim. Reeve went through an intense two-month training regimen with former British weightlifting champion David Prowse supervising. The training regimen consisted of running in the morning, followed by two hours of weightlifting and 90 minutes on the trampoline. He added of muscle to his &quot;thin&quot; frame. He later made even higher gains for &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), though for &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), he decided it would be healthier to focus more on cardiovascular workouts. One of the reasons Reeve could not work out as much for &quot;Superman IV&quot; was an emergency appendectomy that he had in June 1986.

Reeve was never a Superman or comic book fan, though he had watched &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; starring George Reeves. Reeve found the role offered a suitable challenge because it was a dual role. He said, &quot;there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character.&quot; Remembering Loden&#x27;s earlier advice, Reeve also decided to &quot;underplay&quot; Superman: &quot;I was six feet four, strong, and physically imposing; so I played against that, making him as casual as possible, letting the audience sense an implied power.&quot;

On the commentary track for the director&#x27;s edition of &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz spoke of how Reeve had talked to him about playing Superman and then playing Clark Kent. Mankiewicz then corrected Reeve, telling him he was &quot;always, &quot;always&quot; playing Superman&quot; and when he was Clark Kent, he was &quot;playing Superman who was playing Clark Kent.&quot; Mankiewicz described it to Reeve as a role within a role.

The film, made without the use of computers for special effects, was the first attempt to realistically show a person flying. Roy Field, the film&#x27;s optical supervisor, said, &quot;There were many techniques used to make Superman fly, but the best special effect of all was Christopher Reeve himself. We discovered very early on he, being a glider pilot, could hold his body aerodynamically. So when he got into the harness, the whole shot began to come alive.&quot;

The film grossed $300.2 million worldwide (unadjusted for inflation). Reeve received positive reviews for his performance:
* &quot;Christopher Reeve&#x27;s entire performance is a delight. Ridiculously good-looking, with a face as sharp and strong as an ax blade, his bumbling, fumbling Clark Kent and omnipotent Superman are simply two styles of gallantry and innocence.&quot; – &quot;Newsweek&quot;
* &quot;Christopher Reeve has become an instant international star on the basis of his first major movie role, of Clark Kent/Superman. Film reviewers—regardless of their opinion of the film—have been almost unanimous in their praise of Reeve&#x27;s dual portrayal. He is utterly convincing as he switches back and forth between personae.&quot; – &quot;Starlog&quot;

For his performance, Reeve won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles. Reeve described Superman as &quot;the closest opportunity I&#x27;ve had to playing a classical role on film, the closest expression to something of mythical dimension.&quot; His co-star Margot Kidder said after his death that, with the &quot;Superman&quot; films, Reeve &quot;knew he&#x27;d done something meaningful. He was very aware of that and very happy with that role.&quot;

Much of &quot;Superman II&quot; was filmed at the same time as the first film. In fact, the original plan had been for the film to be a single three-hour epic comprising both parts. After most of the footage had been shot, the producers had a disagreement with Donner over various matters, including money and special effects, and Donner was fired. Director Richard Lester, who had worked with the producers previously on the two-parter &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974), replaced Donner. Lester had the script changed and re-shot some footage. The cast was unhappy, but Reeve later said he liked Lester and considered &quot;Superman II&quot; to be his favorite of the series. Donner&#x27;s version of &quot;Superman II&quot;, titled &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, was released on DVD in November 2006 and was dedicated in memory of Reeve.

Lester directed &quot;Superman III&quot;, released in 1983, solo. Reeve believed the producers Alexander Salkind, his son Ilya Salkind, and Pierre Spengler had decreased the credibility of &quot;Superman III&quot; by turning it into a Richard Pryor comedy rather than a proper Superman film. He missed Donner and believed &quot;Superman III&quot; only really good element was the automobile junkyard scene in which Evil Superman fights Good Clark Kent in an internal battle. Reeve&#x27;s portrayal of the Evil Superman was highly praised, though the film was critically panned. Any negative review for &quot;Superman III&quot;, however, was nothing compared to the totally negative reception its successor would receive.

&quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; was released in 1987. After &quot;Superman III&quot;, Reeve vowed he was done with Superman. However, he agreed to continue the role in a fourth film on the condition he would have partial creative control over the script. The nuclear disarmament plot was his idea. Cannon Films purchased the production rights to the character of Superman from the Salkinds in the mid-1980s. Cannon Films were known for low-budget, poorly acted, poorly scripted action films. They cut the budget of &quot;Superman IV&quot; in half to $17 million. The film was both a critical failure and a box-office disappointment, becoming the lowest-grossing &quot;Superman&quot; film to date. Reeve later said, &quot;the less said about &quot;Superman IV&quot; the better.&quot; Both of Reeve&#x27;s children from his relationship with Gae Exton had uncredited appearances in a deleted scene in which Superman rescues a girl, played by his daughter Alexandra, and reunites her with her brother, played by his son Matthew, after Nuclear Man creates a tornado in Smallville.

Reeve would have made a fifth &quot;Superman&quot; film after the rights to the character reverted to the Salkinds and Spengler if the film had a budget of the same size as &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;. Although there was potential for such a film in the late 1980s after Cannon Films went bankrupt, Reeve never received a script.

In 1993, two years before Reeve&#x27;s accident, the Salkinds sold the rights to the character of Superman again, this time to Warner Bros. &quot;There was supposed to be a fifth &quot;Superman&quot; movie titled &quot;Superman Reborn&quot;, but because of studio shifts, the terrible box office [&quot;Superman IV&quot;] got, and ... Reeves&#x27;s accident, it never saw the light of day.&quot;

===1980s===
Reeve&#x27;s first role after 1978&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; was in the 1980 time-travel mystery/romantic fantasy &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. Reeve as playwright Richard Collier romanced Elise McKenna, a popular stage actress from the early 20th century, played by Jane Seymour. The film was shot on Mackinac Island using the Grand Hotel in mid-1979, and was Reeve&#x27;s favorite film to shoot.

The original plan was for a limited release and to build word of mouth, but early test screenings were favorable and the studio decided on a wide release, which proved to be the wrong strategy. Early reviews savaged the film as unduly sentimental and melodramatic, and an actors&#x27; strike prevented Reeve and Seymour from doing publicity. The film quickly closed, although Jean-Pierre Dorléac was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design in 1980. However, thanks to screenings on cable networks and video rentals, the film became a cult classic. INSITE (International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts) did fundraising to sponsor a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Reeve in 1997, and raised over $20,000 for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. Seymour became a friend of Reeve and in 1995 named one of her twin sons Kristopher in his honor (Reeve also became his godfather). The Grand Hotel and Mackinac Island has become a popular tourist site for film fans.

In that same year, Reeve made a guest appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, where he performed &quot;East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)&quot; on a piano for Miss Piggy, who had a crush on him. Reeve denied being Superman but displayed the character&#x27;s superpowers throughout the episode. He then returned to continue filming on the not yet finished production of &quot;Superman II&quot;.

After finishing &quot;Superman II&quot;, Reeve called Nikos Psacharopoulos, the artistic director of the Williamstown Theatre Festival, whom he knew since his apprentice days, and asked if he could join the company. Reeve did two plays that season: &quot;The Front Page&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. The former, directed by Robert Allan Ackerman, became one of the biggest successes of the summer. From then on, he was a regular at the festival. Later in the year, Reeve played a disabled Vietnam veteran in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Fifth of July&quot; on Broadway to excellent reviews. To prepare for the role, he was coached by an amputee on how to walk on artificial legs. The production was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Play. In 1981, Reeve returned to Williamstown to play Achilles in the two-part, six-hour production of &quot;The Greeks&quot;.

In 1982, Reeve stretched his acting range further and played a devious novice playwright with questionable motives regarding his idol and mentor Michael Caine, in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s suspenseful dark comedy &quot;Deathtrap&quot;, based on the play by Ira Levin. The film was well received, but a major plot twist was spoiled by the press, affecting its box office performance. The same year, Reeve portrayed corrupt Catholic priest John Flaherty making challenging decisions during World War II in Frank Perry&#x27;s &quot;Monsignor&quot;. Reeve felt this gave him the opportunity to play &quot;a morally ambiguous character who was neither clearly good nor clearly bad, someone to whom life is much more complex than the characters I&#x27;ve played previously.&quot; Reeve blamed the failure of the film on poor editing. He said, &quot;the movie is sort of a series of outrageous incidents that you find hard to believe. Since they don&#x27;t have a focus, and since they aren&#x27;t justified and explained, they become laughable.&quot;
In 1983, Reeve appeared in &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, playing the dual roles of Prince Charming and the cowardly prince in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. In Williamstown, he acted in the play &quot;Holiday&quot;. Later that year, Reeve went to Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, to work on the film &quot;The Aviator&quot;. The producers approached him without knowing he could fly a Stearman, the vintage biplane used in the film. He readily accepted the role and volunteered to do his own piloting to achieve a more realistic look. The film was released in March 1985.

Reeve was then offered the role of Basil Ransom in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Bostonians&quot; alongside Vanessa Redgrave. Though Reeve ordinarily commanded over one million dollars per film, Ismail Merchant could only afford to pay him one-tenth of that. Reeve had no complaints, as this was exactly the kind of film he wanted to do. In a 2005 interview, James Ivory said that Merchant Ivory Productions didn&#x27;t have good representatives at the time, so Reeve &quot;brokered&quot; the arrangements with the CAA to get them into the agency. The film exceeded expectations and performed well at the box office for what was considered to be an art house film. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked it &quot;among the finest film adaptations of a classic novel that anyone has yet made.&quot;

Ivory thought that Reeve was &quot;wonderful&quot; in &quot;The Bostonians&quot;, but that he was &quot;really undervalued by the critics and even the awards&quot; because &quot;they were so used to thinking of him as Superman.&quot; Hepburn called Reeve to tell him he was &quot;absolutely marvelous&quot; and &quot;captivating&quot; in the film. When he told her he was currently shooting the 1985 version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, she said, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s a terrible mistake.&quot; Reeve reunited with Redgrave in the play &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; during its 1984 run in London&#x27;s West End. In Williamstown, he played the title role in &quot;Richard Cory&quot;.

In March 1985, Reeve starred as Count Vronsky in the television film &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, opposite Jacqueline Bisset. Reeve&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra, also appeared in the film as his character&#x27;s 10-month-old daughter, taking her first steps. It was for this film that Reeve learned to ride horses and decided to take up the sport seriously upon returning home. In April, Reeve hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He then returned to the stage, playing Tony in &quot;The Royal Family&quot; in Williamstown and the Count in a modern adaptation of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; on Broadway. Reeve also hosted the television documentary &quot;Dinosaur!&quot;, which was filmed at the American Museum of Natural History. It was one of the earliest prime-time specials on prehistoric life and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. Also in 1985, DC Comics named Reeve as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th-anniversary publication, &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;, for his work on the &quot;Superman&quot; film series.

In 1986, he was still struggling to find scripts he liked. A script named &quot;Street Smart&quot; had been lying in his house for years, and after re-reading it, he took it to Cannon Films. They agreed to produce it on the condition that he play Superman in at least one more sequel for them. Reeve starred opposite Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for his first Academy Award for the film. It received excellent reviews but performed poorly at the box office, possibly because Cannon Films had failed to properly advertise it. Back in Williamstown, he began building a house and starred in &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; alongside Laila Robins.

After the filming of &quot;Superman IV&quot; in February 1987, Reeve and Exton separated and Reeve returned to New York. In a depression over his personal life, he thought doing a comedy might be good for him and agreed to appear in &quot;Switching Channels&quot;. However, Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. He later stated that he made a fool of himself in the film and most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. In her 2008 memoir, Turner wrote, &quot;Burt and I were sworn enemies. ... It was not happy shooting at all. I was absolutely miserable. If the crew hadn&#x27;t been so kind, and Chris Reeve, who was so very nice, hadn&#x27;t been there in the cast, it might have been impossible.&quot; The film did poorly, and Reeve believed it marked the end of his movie star career. In June, he appeared in the British television special charity event &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; and then went to Williamstown to rehearse for the play &quot;The Rover&quot;. On June 30, Reeve met his future wife Dana Morosini.

In 1988, Reeve played Major Johnnie Dodge in the two-part television film &quot;The Great Escape II: The Untold Story&quot;. Like the 1963 film, the first part tells the story of the mass escape of Allied POWs from a German camp in 1944. The second part depicts the search and prosecution of those responsible for the murder of 50 escapees, which was not covered in the 1963 film. But for most of 1988 and 1989, Reeve worked onstage. He starred in another production of &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, this time with Christine Lahti, at the Ahmanson Theatre. In Williamstown, he reunited with Madeleine Potter in Joel Gross&#x27; new play, &quot;Mesmer&quot;, and performed in a stage reading of the same play on Broadway.

In 1989, Reeve played Polixenes in an Off-Broadway production of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. In Williamstown, he played the lead in &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, in which Dana also had a small role. Reeve was part of a rotating cast in John Tillinger&#x27;s production of &quot;Love Letters&quot; at the Promenade Theatre; with Julie Hagerty, he also performed in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston in 1989 and 1990. He auditioned for the Richard Gere role in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.

===1990s===
In 1990, Reeve starred in the American Civil War film &quot;The Rose and the Jackal&quot;, in which he played Allan Pinkerton, the head of President Lincoln&#x27;s new Secret Service. In Williamstown, he played Death/Prince Nikolai Sirki in the play &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Reeve was cast as a villain in three television films almost in a row: &quot;Bump in the Night&quot; (1991), &quot;Death Dreams&quot; (1991), and &quot;Nightmare in the Daylight&quot; (1992). The most notable of these was &quot;Bump in the Night&quot;, in which Reeve played a child molester who abducts a young boy. The movie received fair to positive reviews. Reeve felt it was important for parents of young children to see the film.

In 1992, Reeve played one of the leads in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s comedy &quot;Noises Off&quot;. In a 2020 book &quot;Picturing Peter Bogdanovich: My Conversations with the New Hollywood Director&quot;, Bogdanovich said, &quot;[Reeve] was very good in that. He was good at comedy. I could tell that from the first &quot;Superman&quot;. He was my only choice for that part.&quot; In another television film, &quot;Mortal Sins&quot;, Reeve for the second time played a Catholic priest, this time hearing the confessions of a serial murderer in a role reminiscent of Montgomery Clift in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;I Confess&quot;. He also acted in the short film &quot;Last Ferry Home&quot;. His last performance in a proper stage production was &quot;The Guardsman&quot; in Williamstown that year.

In the spring of 1992, Reeve attended the US premiere of &quot;Howards End&quot; where he met Ivory again. The next day Ivory called him and offered him a role in his new film, &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993). The script was one of the best he had read, and he unhesitatingly took the part. The film was deemed an instant classic and was nominated for eight Academy Awards. At the 2024 screening of the film, Ivory praised Reeve&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;He was a great guy... a very, very good actor who got trapped in Superman.&quot; According to Reeve&#x27;s son Will, &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; is the film that his father was most proud of.

In 1993, Reeve starred opposite Charles Bronson in the television film &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot;, based on Jack London&#x27;s novel of the same name. After that, he traveled to Canada to shoot a miniseries, &quot;Black Fox&quot;, co-starring Tony Todd. CBS released it as three films two months after Reeve&#x27;s accident in 1995. Scenes of Reeve riding are featured heavily in the story. Reeve&#x27;s children, Matthew and Alexandra, appear briefly in the background in the first film.

During this period, Superman&#x27;s grip on Reeve&#x27;s career gradually began to loosen. In a review for &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (1993), one critic wrote: &quot;Those who can&#x27;t take Reeve seriously unless he&#x27;s wearing a blue suit and a red cape will find themselves pleasantly surprised by the heft and subtlety he brings to his [role]. ... This movie isn&#x27;t big enough to make Reeve a star again. But the impression he makes here is good enough to suggest that a reversal of perception—and fortune—won&#x27;t be long in coming.&quot; Another critic said in a review for &quot;Speechless&quot; (1994): &quot;Mr. Reeve has quietly evolved into a versatile character actor... It&#x27;s only a matter of time before he is &#x27;officially&#x27; rediscovered and celebrated, like John Travolta in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.&quot; Reeve considered &quot;The Rose and the Jackal&quot;, &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, and &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; some of his best work.

In 1994, Reeve did a reading of &quot;Love Letters&quot; in Williamstown, and also appeared as a narrator in a concert version of the musical &quot;Allegro&quot; at the New York City Center. These became his last performances onstage.

In 1995, Reeve starred in John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;, a remake of the 1960 British movie of the same name. Both films were based on the 1957 novel &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; by John Wyndham. For Carpenter, the film was a contractual obligation, but &quot;it has a very good performance from Christopher Reeve, so there&#x27;s some value in it.&quot; &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; was Reeve&#x27;s final feature film to be released in theaters. Shortly before his accident, Reeve played a paralyzed police officer in the HBO movie &quot;Above Suspicion&quot;. He did research at a rehabilitation hospital in Van Nuys &quot;on what it would be like to be a paraplegic.&quot; His injury occurred less than a week after the premiere of the film.

Reeve also made several guest appearances in television shows: &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; in 1991, &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; in 1992. He accepted an offer to appear in &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; without reading the script because Colleen Dewhurst, with whom he was close, spoke highly of the show. His episode in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Cookin&#x27;&quot;, is considered one of the best in the series. He was also one of the celebrity guest callers on &quot;Frasier&quot; in 1993.

Before his injury, Reeve was offered the lead in the 1995 film &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. He also planned to direct his first film for the big screen, a romantic comedy entitled &quot;Tell Me True&quot;. Both plans were cancelled as a result of a horse riding accident that left him paralyzed.

In 1996, Reeve narrated the HBO documentary &quot;Without Pity: A Film About Abilities&quot;. The film won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Special. He then acted in a small role in the film &quot;A Step Toward Tomorrow&quot;.

In 1997, Reeve made his directorial debut with the HBO film &quot;In the Gloaming&quot; with Robert Sean Leonard, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg, Bridget Fonda, and David Strathairn. The film was nominated for five Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries or Special, and won four awards out of the six it was nominated for at the CableACE Awards. Dana said, &quot;There&#x27;s such a difference in his outlook, his health, his overall sense of well-being when he&#x27;s working at what he loves, which is creative work.&quot;

In 1998, Reeve starred and served as executive producer in &quot;Rear Window&quot;, a remake of Hitchcock&#x27;s 1954 film. He was nominated for a Golden Globe and won a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance. On April 25, 1998, Random House published Reeve&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Still Me&quot;. The book spent 11 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Reeve narrated the abridged audiobook, which won him the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, the Audie Award for Solo Narration by the Author, and the Earphones Award from AudioFile. The paperback edition with a new afterword was released the following year and spent an additional two weeks on the Best Seller list.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Reeve made guest appearances on the PBS series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In September 2002, Random House published Reeve&#x27;s second book, &quot;Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life&quot;. This book is shorter than &quot;Still Me&quot; and focuses on Reeve&#x27;s world views and the life experiences which helped shape them. The book spent three weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Reeve narrated an unabridged audiobook for which he received his second Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.

In 2001, Reeve&#x27;s son Matthew began filming a three-part series detailing Reeve&#x27;s recovery process and advocacy for spinal cord injury research. The first film, &quot;Hope in Motion&quot;, aired on ABC in September 2002 under the title &quot;Courageous Steps&quot;. It received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Nonfiction Special. In February 2003, it was broadcast on BBC One under its original title. Following Reeve&#x27;s death in 2004, a third film was never made, while &quot;Hope in Motion&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Choosing Hope&quot;, were released on DVD in 2007.

In 2003, Reeve guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Practice&quot;. He submitted a story treatment to the show&#x27;s creator, David E. Kelley, that addresses the issues of health insurance policy and caregiver burnout. Kelley liked the idea and wrote an episode based on it.

Reeve&#x27;s final acting role was in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot; portraying Dr. Virgil Swann. On February 25, 2003, he made an appearance in the episode &quot;Rosetta&quot;, in which Dr. Swann informs Clark Kent (Tom Welling) about his origins. The scenes of Reeve and Welling feature music cues from 1978&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot;, composed by John Williams and arranged by Mark Snow. At the end of the episode, Reeve and Welling appeared in a short spot inviting people to support the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. &quot;Rosetta&quot; set ratings history for The WB. The fan community met the episode with rave reviews and praised it as being among the series&#x27; best to this day. Reeve also appeared in the episode &quot;Legacy&quot;, in which he reunited with fellow stage actor John Glover, who played Lionel Luthor in the show.

In 2004, Reeve directed the A&amp;E film &quot;The Brooke Ellison Story&quot;. The film is based on the true story of Brooke Ellison, the first quadriplegic to graduate from Harvard University. Reeve during this time was directing the animated film &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Hero&quot;. It was one of his dream projects and he died during the middle of production for the film. His wife Dana helped out, and his son Will was a cast member in the film. Dana and Will also had small roles in &quot;The Brooke Ellison Story&quot;.

===Roles turned down by Reeve===
Following the first &quot;Superman&quot; movie, Reeve realized Hollywood producers wanted him to be an action star. He later said, &quot;I found most of the scripts of the genre poorly constructed, and I felt the starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique.&quot; In addition, he did not feel he was right for the other films he was offered and turned down the lead roles in &quot;American Gigolo&quot;, &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, &quot;Splash&quot;, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, and &quot;Body Heat&quot;. Hepburn recommended Reeve to David Lean for the role of Fletcher Christian in &quot;The Bounty&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins. After considering it, Reeve decided he would be miscast, and the film was eventually made with Mel Gibson. In the 1990s, Reeve received scripts for &quot;Picket Fences&quot; and &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; and was asked by CBS if he wanted to start his own television series. This would have meant moving to Los Angeles, which he did not want to do. He declined the offers. After his accident, Reeve was offered the role of Mason Verger in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Hannibal&quot;. He turned it down upon learning that the character was a paralyzed and facially disfigured child molester. The role went to Gary Oldman.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
Reeve&#x27;s first romantic relationship was at the age of 16, with a theater actress who was seven years his senior. Eventually, he began to feel that &quot;something about it didn&#x27;t feel right&quot;, and they split up.

While filming the first two &quot;Superman&quot; movies in England, Reeve began a 10-year relationship with modeling executive Gae Exton. In 2018, Jane Seymour revealed that Reeve and Exton had broken up prior to filming &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, and during production, Reeve and Seymour fell in love. However, Reeve returned to Exton upon learning that she was pregnant with their son Matthew Exton Reeve, who was born on December 20, 1979. Their second child, daughter Alexandra, was born on November 25, 1983. Both were born in London. In February 1987, Reeve and Exton separated amicably with joint custody of their children, and Reeve returned to New York. Matthew and Alexandra remained in London with their mother and spent their holidays with Reeve. Matthew, who graduated from Brown University in 2002, is a writer, director, and producer. Alexandra graduated from Yale University in 2005 and received a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School in 2008. She is a lawyer and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Alexandra&#x27;s son is named Christopher after her father.

In June 1987, Reeve met his future wife Dana Morosini, a singer and actress. By 1990, they were living together but Reeve, remembering his parents&#x27; painful divorce and other failed marriages in his family, could not bring himself to commit. After they almost broke up, Reeve began about a year of therapy, primarily to talk through his fears about marriage. Then one night during dinner, he said, &quot;I just put down my fork and asked her to marry me.&quot; They were married in April 1992, and their son was born on June 7, 1992. Will graduated from Middlebury College in 2014 and, , he reports for ABC News. Christopher and Dana Reeve remained married until Christopher&#x27;s death.

===Aviation and sailing===
Reeve was a licensed pilot and began reaching major milestones in his early 20s: private, instrument, multi-engine, commercial, instructor, and glider. In 1976, Reeve purchased his first aircraft, a second-hand Cherokee 140. After his paralyzing accident, he fondly recalled sleeping under its wings during a solo trip across Canada. Over the years, he owned an A36 Bonanza, a Beechcraft Baron, a Cheyenne II, and a sailplane. He flew solo across the Atlantic twice and was a pilot for the Environmental Air Force.

When Robin Williams was filming &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, Glenn Close recalled that Reeve would &quot;literally swoop in, piloting his own plane, scoop Robin up, and away they would fly for the weekend.&quot; During the shooting of &quot;Superman III&quot;, Reeve joined The Tiger Club, a group of aviators who pilot vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes. Reeve knew how to fly a Stearman and did his own piloting in the film &quot;The Aviator&quot;. He also enjoyed gliding; his personal record was 32,000 ft.

Reeve was an avid sailor. While filming &quot;The Bostonians&quot;, he lived aboard his Swan 40, &quot;Chandelle&quot;, and would take the cast and crew sailing on the weekends. In 1989, he sold &quot;Chandelle&quot; and bought a sloop sailboat, Cambria 46, which he named the &quot;Sea Angel&quot;. According to David Walters Yachts, &quot;when Chris Reeve came to build a Cambria, he did not want a double entry 44. A new deck mold with a single entry was built, and was designated the new 46 model.&quot;

He sailed in the Caribbean and to Bermuda a few times. The coast of New England is what he knew best, sailing &quot;all over the East, Nova Scotia, and Maine.&quot; His favorite ports were Nantucket, Yarmouth, and Christmas Cove in Maine.

===Equestrianism and injury===
Reeve began his involvement in horse riding in 1985 after learning to ride for the film &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. He was initially allergic to horses, so he took antihistamines. He trained on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and by 1989, he began eventing. His allergies soon disappeared.

Reeve purchased a 12-year-old American thoroughbred horse named Eastern Express, nicknamed &quot;Buck&quot;, while filming &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;. He trained with Buck in 1994 and planned to do Training Level events in 1995 and move up to Preliminary in 1996. Though Reeve had originally signed up to compete at an event in Vermont, his coach invited him to go to the Commonwealth Dressage and Combined Training Association finals at the Commonwealth Park equestrian center in Culpeper, Virginia. Reeve finished in fourth place out of 27 in the dressage, before walking his cross-country course. He was concerned about jumps 16 and 17 but paid little attention to the third jump, which was a routine fence shaped like the letter &quot;W&quot;.

On May 27, 1995, Reeve&#x27;s horse made a refusal. Witnesses said the horse began the third fence jump and suddenly stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, holding on to the reins. His hands became tangled in them, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first on the far side of the fence, shattering his first and second vertebrae. The resulting cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from the neck down and halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. He had no recollection of the accident.

===Hospitalization===
After five days in which Reeve was heavily medicated and delirious, he regained full consciousness. His doctor explained to him his first and second cervical vertebrae had been destroyed and his spinal cord damaged. He was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe without a ventilator.

Reeve&#x27;s first thoughts when informed about the seriousness of his injury was he had ruined his life, would be a burden on his family, and it might be best to &quot;slip away&quot;. He mouthed to his wife Dana, &quot;Maybe we should let me go.&quot; She tearfully replied, &quot;I will support whatever you want to do, because this is your life and your decision. But I want you to know that I&#x27;ll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You&#x27;re still you. And I love you.&quot; In what she would later describe as a &quot;sales ploy&quot;, she also told him that if he still wanted to die in two years they could reconsider the question.

After this conversation, and visits from his children in which he saw how much they needed him, Reeve consented to lifesaving surgery and treatment for pneumonia. He never considered euthanasia as an option again.

Reeve went through inner anguish in the ICU, particularly when he was alone during the night. His upcoming operation to stabilize his spine in June 1995 &quot;was frightening to contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent. He announced that he was my proctologist, and that he had to examine me immediately.&quot; It was Williams, reprising his character from the film &quot;Nine Months&quot;. &quot;For the first time since the accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay.&quot; In addition to visits from friends and family, Reeve received over 400,000 letters from all over the world, which gave him great comfort during his recovery.

John A. Jane performed surgery to repair Reeve&#x27;s neck vertebrae. He put wires underneath both laminae and used bone from Reeve&#x27;s hip to fit between the C1 and C2 vertebrae. He inserted a titanium pin and fused the wires with the vertebrae, then drilled holes in Reeve&#x27;s skull and fitted the wires through to secure the skull to the spinal column. To access the cord, the surgeon had to cut a tendon on the right side of Reeve&#x27;s neck, which became shorter and less flexible as a result, causing his head to tilt slightly to the right.

===Rehabilitation===
After a month in the hospital, Reeve spent six months at the Kessler Rehabilitation Center in West Orange, New Jersey, to continue with his recovery and learn skills such as operating his sip-and-puff electric wheelchair by blowing air through a straw. In his autobiography &quot;Still Me&quot;, he described initially not wanting to face the reality of his disability. Getting used to sitting strapped into a wheelchair or taking a shower was initially terrifying. Reeve developed a deep fondness for many of the staff at Kessler, and through conversations with the other patients gradually started to see himself as being part of the disabled community.

For the first few months after the accident, Reeve relied on a ventilator, which was connected to his neck through a tracheostomy tube, for every breath. With therapy and practice, he developed the ability to breathe on his own for up to 90 minutes at a time.

At home, Reeve exercised for up to four or five hours a day, using specialized exercise machines to stimulate his muscles and prevent muscle atrophy and osteoporosis. He believed that intense physical therapy could regenerate the nervous system, and also wanted his body to be strong enough to support itself if a cure for paralysis were found.

Beginning in 2000, he started to regain the ability to make small movements with his fingers and other parts of his body. By 2002, he could feel the prick of a needle and sense hot and cold temperatures on 65% of his body. He regularly exercised in a swimming pool and could push off with his legs from the side of a pool and make a snow angel movement with his arms. He also had a sense of proprioception, which is critical for movement control. Initially, Reeve was given an A grade on the ASIA Impairment Scale, indicating no motor or sensory function. In 2002, his grade was changed to C, indicating some degree of muscle movement and sensation. Reeve&#x27;s doctors were surprised by his improvements, which they attributed to his intensive exercise regimen. The degree of his recovery was reported in scientific journals.

In February 2003, Reeve became the third patient in the United States to undergo an experimental procedure in which electrodes were implanted in his diaphragm to help him breathe without a ventilator. Previously, he could force air into his lungs using his neck muscles, which required a lot of effort. With a diaphragm pacing device, he was able to breathe normally through his nose, regaining his sense of smell and normal speech. At first, the device allowed him to breathe for 15 minutes an hour, but over time this increased up to 18 hours a day. In November 2003, Reeve appeared in public without a ventilator for the first time since his accident. In 2008, the device was approved by the FDA under a Humanitarian Device Exemption, and received premarket approval in 2023.

===Life with paralysis===
In December 1995, Reeve moved back to his home in Bedford, New York. By two years after the accident, Reeve said he was &quot;glad to be alive, not out of obligation to others, but because life was worth living.&quot; He continued to require round-the-clock care for the rest of his life, with a rotating team of 10 nurses and five aides working in his home.

In the aftermath of the accident, Reeve went through intense grief. He gradually resolved to make the best of his new life, with a busy schedule of activism, film work, writing and promoting his books, public speaking, and parenting. In 1998, he said in an interview:Who knows why an accident happens? The key is what do you do afterwards. There is a period of shock, and then grieving, with confusion and loss. After that, you have two choices. One is to stare out the window and gradually disintegrate. And the other is to mobilize and use all your resources, whatever they may be, to do something positive. That is the road I have taken. It comes naturally to me. I am a competitive person and right now I am competing against decay. I don&#x27;t want osteoporosis or muscle atrophy or depression to beat me.In another interview, Reeve said he drew on the self-discipline he had gained in his early years in the theater:Nobody wants another actor. There&#x27;s too many of them now already. ... To keep believing in yourself in spite of those kinds of obstacles is certainly good preparation for what I&#x27;m going through now.

===Religious views===
For most of his life, Reeve did not identify with any religion. He attended his stepfather&#x27;s Presbyterian church as a young teenager. In 1975, he briefly explored Scientology but chose not to become a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.

Reeve described his wedding in 1992 as his &quot;first act of faith&quot;. After his accident, many well-wishers suggested that prayer would make him feel better, but he did not find it helpful. &quot;I wondered what was wrong with me&quot;, he later wrote. &quot;I had broken my neck and become paralyzed, possibly forever, but still hadn&#x27;t found God.&quot;

In his 2002 book &quot;Nothing is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life&quot;, Reeve said that he and his wife had regularly attended Unitarian services, starting in his late 40s. In the years following the accident, he had gradually come to believe that:Spirituality is found in the way we live our daily lives. It means spending time thinking about others. It&#x27;s not so hard to imagine that there is some kind of higher power. We don&#x27;t have to know what form it takes or exactly where it exists; just to honor it and try to live by it is enough. ... As these thoughts unfolded in the process of learning to live my new life, I had no idea that I was becoming a Unitarian.

==Activism==
At the age of 15, Reeve developed a passionate interest in political and social causes. He conducted a door-to-door campaign on behalf of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and participated in protests against the invasion of Cambodia in 1970.

After the release of &quot;Superman&quot;, Reeve used his celebrity status to enable him to support several philanthropic causes. Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he visited terminally ill children. He joined the board of directors for the worldwide charity Save the Children. In 1979, he served as a track and field coach at the Special Olympics.

In the 1980s, Reeve campaigned for Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy and made speeches throughout the state. He served as a board member for the Charles Lindbergh Fund, which promotes environmentally safe technologies. He lent support to causes such as Amnesty International, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and People for the American Way. As a pilot with the Environmental Air Force he gave government officials and journalists aerial tours over areas of environmental damage. In 1983, he was elected to Actors&#x27; Equity Association Council.
In late 1987, in Santiago, Chile, the country&#x27;s dictator, Augusto Pinochet, threatened to execute 77 actors. Ariel Dorfman asked Reeve to help save their lives. Reeve flew to Chile and helped lead a protest march. A cartoon then ran in a newspaper showing him carrying Pinochet by the collar with the caption, &quot;Where will you take him, Superman?&quot; For his contribution to the protest, Reeve was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, the highest Chilean distinction for foreigners. He also received an Obie Award and the Annual Walter Briehl Human Rights Foundation award. The following year, Reeve was among the international stars for the No campaign in the Chilean presidential referendum that marked the end of Pinochet&#x27;s rule.

Reeve spoke out against Donald Trump&#x27;s developing projects on West End Avenue in the late 1980s. The 1991 documentary &quot;&quot;, which was suppressed for years, showed Reeve deliver a critical speech on the topic at a public event. The documentary also featured an interview in which Reeve called Trump&#x27;s ambitions &quot;the American dream gone berserk&quot;, adding, &quot;You&#x27;re allowed to dream as big as you want, but if your dreams step on the lives of ordinary people and ruin the quality of their life and their neighborhood, you have to be stopped.&quot;

In 1989, Reeve&#x27;s friend Ron Silver started the Creative Coalition (TCC), a liberal organization aiming to teach celebrities how to speak knowledgeably about political issues. Reeve was an early member of the group, along with Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, and Blythe Danner. The group&#x27;s initiatives included environmental issues and defending the National Endowment of the Arts, which was under attack from conservative Republicans who objected to taxpayer funding of art they considered offensive. Reeve was elected as a co-president of TCC in 1994. They were instrumental in starting residential recycling in New York, convincing the state legislature to allocate $1 billion to protect the city&#x27;s watershed area, and stopping the building of a coal-fired power station near Albany. The organization&#x27;s work was noticed nationwide, and the Democratic Party asked Reeve to run for the United States Congress. He replied, &quot;Run for Congress? And lose my influence in Washington?&quot; In 1997, TCC established the Christopher Reeve First Amendment Award.

In 1996, 10 months after his injury, Reeve appeared at the 68th Academy Awards to a long standing ovation. He used the occasion to encourage Hollywood to make more films on social issues, saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s continue to take risks. Let&#x27;s tackle the issues. In many ways our film community can do it better than anyone else.&quot;

===Disability activism===

Reeve left the Kessler Rehabilitation Center feeling inspiration from the other patients he had met. Because the media was constantly covering him, he decided to use his name to put focus on spinal cord injuries. He traveled across the country to make speeches and also hosted the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games in Atlanta and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. For these efforts, he was placed on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on August 26, 1996.

Reeve was elected chairman of the American Paralysis Association and vice chairman of the National Organization on Disability. With Joan Irvine Smith, he co-founded the Reeve-Irvine Research Center, which is now one of the leading spinal cord research centers in the world. In 1999, the American Paralysis Association and Reeve&#x27;s own foundation, established in 1996, were merged into the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which aims to speed up research through funding and to use grants to improve the quality of lives of people with disabilities. The Foundation to date has given more than $140 million to research and more than $46 million in quality-of-life grants. Reeve served as a board member for several organizations&#x27; aim to improve quality of life for people with disabilities.

In the mid-1990s, Reeve established the Christopher Reeve Acting Scholarship, which is given to a young disabled actor at the Media Access Awards, sponsored by the Reeve Foundation. The scholarship changed its name to the Christopher Reeve Acting Award in 2023.

Reeve&#x27;s first effort to change disability legislation was in supporting a 1997 bill to raise the lifetime &quot;cap&quot; on insurance payments from $1 million to $10 million per person. For catastrophically injured people with one insurance policy, the $1 million limit often lasts just a few years. He said, &quot;There are certain CEOs of insurance companies taking home $300 million a year in personal income. That is outrageous. We need to make insurance companies provide the benefits they are supposed to, and we shouldn&#x27;t have to fight for necessities.&quot; The bill was narrowly defeated. In 1999, he supported the Work Incentives Improvement Act, which allows people to continue to receive disability benefits after they return to work. This bill passed.
Reeve lobbied for expanded federal funding on embryonic stem cell research to include all embryonic stem cell lines in existence and for self-governance to make open-ended scientific inquiry of the research. President George W. Bush limited federal funding to research only on human embryonic stem cell lines created on or before August 9, 2001, the day he announced his policy, and allotted approximately $100 million for it. Reeve initially called this &quot;a step in the right direction&quot;, admitting he did not know about the existing lines and would look into them further. He fought against the limit when scientists revealed an early research technique involved mixing the human stem cells with mouse cells contaminated most of the old lines.

In 2001, Reeve received Public Service Award from the American Society for Cell Biology for &quot;outstanding public service in support of biomedical research.&quot; 

In 2002, Reeve lobbied for the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001, which would allow somatic cell nuclear transfer research, but would ban reproductive cloning. He argued stem cell implantation is unsafe unless the stem cells contain the patient&#x27;s own DNA and because somatic cell nuclear transfer is done without fertilizing an egg, it can be fully regulated. In June 2004, Reeve provided a videotaped message on behalf of the Genetics Policy Institute to the delegates of the United Nations in defense of somatic cell nuclear transfer, which a world treaty was considering banning. In the final days of his life, Reeve urged California voters to vote yes on Proposition 71, which would establish the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and would allot $3 billion of state funds to stem cell research. Proposition 71 was approved less than one month after Reeve&#x27;s death.

In July 2003, Reeve&#x27;s continuing frustration with the pace of stem cell research in the US led him to Israel, a country that was then, according to him, at the center of research in spinal cord injury. Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited him to seek out the best treatment for his condition. During his visit, Reeve called the experience &quot;a privilege&quot; and said, &quot;Israel has very proactive rehab facilities, excellent medical schools and teaching hospitals, and an absolutely first-rate research infrastructure.&quot; Israelis were very receptive to Reeve&#x27;s visit, calling him an inspiration to all and urging him never to give up hope.

In September 2003, Reeve was awarded the Lasker Public Service Award &quot;for his perceptive, sustained and heroic advocacy for medical research in general and victims of disability in particular.&quot;

Commenting on Reeve&#x27;s impact, Jerome Groopman said in 2003, &quot;I think that people of prominence or great resources are the ones who act as catalysts in our society. ... There was essentially no substantial funding of spinal-cord research before Reeve&#x27;s injury, and now it is one of the hottest areas in neurobiology. Scientists are flocking to work in it, because science follows the money.&quot; Of Reeve, UC Irvine said, &quot;in the years following his injury, Christopher did more to promote research on spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders than any other person before or since.&quot;

==Health problems and death==
During his teenage years, Reeve suffered from occasional bouts of asthma and allergies. He sustained injuries in various sports activities, such as a broken ankle while skiing and a fractured rib from a riding mishap while training for &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. At Kessler Rehabilitation Center, he discovered that he hadn&#x27;t fully recovered from malaria, which he contracted while scouting filming locations in Kenya in 1993.

He had a rare condition called mastocytosis, which made him vulnerable to anaphylaxis, and more than once he had a severe reaction to a drug. While at Kessler, he tried a drug which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I have to go now&quot;, during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, &quot;and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling. ... I looked down and saw my body stretched out on the bed, not moving, while everybody—there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses—was working on me. The noise and commotion grew quieter as though someone were gradually turning down the volume.&quot; After receiving a large dose of epinephrine, he woke up and stabilized later that night. Two days later, he gave it another try, but experienced the same anaphylactic reaction and was immediately given epinephrine.

At age 16, he developed alopecia areata. Generally, he was able to comb over the bald spots and often the problem disappeared for long periods. The condition became more noticeable after he became paralyzed. He was given a medication for it, but an adverse reaction caused all the hair on his body to fall out, including his eyebrows and eyelashes.

During 1996 and 1997, Reeve was frequently hospitalized for dysreflexia, pneumonia, a collapsed lung, and two blood clots. On one occasion, he was put incorrectly in a wheelchair, which caused him to fall and break his left arm. A titanium rod was inserted inside his humerus bone to stabilize his arm. In 1997, a small ulcer on his left ankle became infected, eventually spreading to the bone. He was warned that his leg might have to be amputated to prevent further spread of infection. Reeve sought help from specialists at Albany Medical Center, who examined his leg, removing the dead tissue and putting him on powerful antibiotics, although he developed an allergy after eight days. His leg fully healed a few months later.

In early October 2004, he was being treated for an infected pressure ulcer that was causing sepsis, a complication he had experienced many times before. On October 4, 2004, he spoke at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago on behalf of the institute&#x27;s work; it was his last reported public appearance. On October 9, 2004, Reeve attended his son Will&#x27;s hockey game. That night, he went into cardiac arrest after receiving an antibiotic for the infection. He fell into a coma, and was taken to Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York. Eighteen hours later, on October 10, Reeve died at the age of 52. No autopsy was performed. However, both Reeve&#x27;s wife, Dana, and his doctor, John McDonald, believed that an adverse reaction to a drug caused his death.

His remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery, where his ashes were sprinkled in the wind by his family. A memorial service for Reeve was held at the Unitarian Church in Westport, Connecticut, which was officiated by Frank Hall. Another private memorial service held at the Juilliard School three weeks later was attended by more than 900 people, with speakers.

==Legacy==

Reeve&#x27;s widow, Dana, headed the Christopher Reeve Foundation after his death. Although a non-smoker, she was diagnosed with lung cancer on August 9, 2005. She died at age 44 on March 6, 2006, and the foundation was subsequently renamed the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. All of Reeve&#x27;s children serve on the board of directors of the foundation.

Following Reeve&#x27;s death, the Society for Neuroscience added his name to their satellite symposium dedicated to stem cell research. The Annual Christopher Reeve &quot;Hot Topics&quot; in Stem Cell Biology is held almost annually, except for the years 2020, 2021, and 2024.

In 2005, Princeton Day School established the Christopher Reeve &#x27;70 Sportsmanship Award that is awarded during the Invitational Ice Hockey Tournament. In 2006, Cornell University dedicated a plaque to Reeve at the Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts and established the Christopher Reeve &#x27;74 Scholarship that provides support to students majoring in theater, film, music, and English.

In 2005, the Williamstown Theatre Festival, where Reeve often performed during his career, announced that it would begin a tradition of dedicating the final performance of every season to his memory and would establish a fund to support artists with disabilities. In 2015, Princeton Public Library created the Christopher Reeve Theater and Dramatic Arts Collection that consists of books on acting, screenwriting, theater, filmmaking, cinema studies, music and Broadway. Reeve&#x27;s books are also part of the collection. 

From 2004 to 2016, Heart of America Foundation awarded the Christopher Reeve Award, an annual scholarship funded by Merriam-Webster, Inc., to &quot;a student who has demonstrated outstanding compassion and caring by serving their community.&quot; In 2018, Drexel University College of Medicine established the Christopher Reeve Endowment Award &quot;as a scholarship fund for support of research and training of scientists and clinicians working in the area of spinal cord and brain injury research.&quot;

In March 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act that aims &quot;to enhance and further research into paralysis and to improve rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with paralysis and other physical disabilities.&quot;

The portrait of Reeve by Alexander Newley is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.

On September 25, 2021, Google celebrated Reeve&#x27;s 69th birthday with a Google Doodle.

A documentary about Reeve&#x27;s life and the aftermath of his accident titled &quot;Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024. On the 20th anniversary of Reeve&#x27;s death, the Empire State Building was lit in blue, yellow, red, and orange colors in honor of the foundation&#x27;s work and the wide release of the documentary. On October 25, 2024, a French documentary about Reeve titled &quot;Christopher Reeve: The Eternal Superman&quot; was released on TCM Cinéma.

<text>Martin County is a county located in the southeastern part of the state of Florida, in the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 158,431. Its county seat is Stuart. Martin County is in the Port St. Lucie, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Martin County was created in 1925 with the northern portion coming from St. Lucie County and southern portion coming from Palm Beach County. It was named for John W. Martin, Governor of Florida from 1925 to 1929.

When the county was created, the western contour followed the shore of Lake Okeechobee, as did the borders of Glades, Okeechobee, and Hendry counties. Palm Beach County had historically claimed all of the surface of the lake as part of its area, to its benefit for the distribution of state and federal highway funds. The state representative of Martin County, William Ralph Scott of Stuart, initiated a bill to divide the lake among its adjacent counties, creating a more equitable distribution of state funds for road creation and maintenance. All bordering counties confirmed the justice of this change and supported its ratification, with the exception of Palm Beach County. Representatives from Palm Beach County later presented Representative Scott with a jug of water, signifying &quot;all the water Bill Scott left Palm Beach County.&quot; The jug is in the possession of Stuart Heritage.

<doc id="73630" wikidata="Q263742" url="?curid=73630" title="Monroe County, Florida">
<text>Monroe County is the southernmost county of the state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 82,874. Its county seat is Key West. Monroe County includes the islands of the Florida Keys and comprises the Key West-Key Largo Micropolitan Statistical Area. Over 99.9% of the county&#x27;s population lives on the Florida Keys. The mainland, which is part of the Everglades, comprises 87% of the county&#x27;s land area and is virtually uninhabited with only 17 people recorded in the 2020 census.

==History==
Monroe County was created in 1823. It was named for James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States from 1817 to 1825.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (26.3%) is land and (73.7%) is water. It is the largest county in Florida by total area.

More than 99.9 percent of the Monroe County population lives in the island chain known as the Florida Keys.

Two thirds of the large area in what local residents call &quot;mainland Monroe&quot; is uninhabited by virtue of being part of the Everglades National Park, and the remainder by the Big Cypress National Preserve in the northeastern interior. The area, officially named Cape Sable Census County Division, is virtually uninhabited. This area has 87.4 percent of the county&#x27;s land area (859.6 out of ), but it had only 0.022 percent of the county&#x27;s population (18 out of 82,170) as of the 2021 American Community Survey. The Census Bureau defines this area as Census Tract 9800 of Monroe County, Florida.

In mainland Monroe, the only three populated places appearing on detailed maps and in the USGS geographic name database are Flamingo, Pinecrest, (not to be confused with much larger Pinecrest of neighboring Miami-Dade County), and Trail City. Flamingo, on the south coast and at the end of State Road 9336 (Flamingo Lodge Highway), is the location of the Flamingo Lodge and the Flamingo Ranger Station (with Visitor Center &amp; Marina). northeast on the highway is the West Lake Trail (station). Pinecrest, located in the northern interior of the county (in the Big Cypress National Preserve) on Loop Road (given that name since it forms a loop with U.S. Highway 41 further north), hosts the Loop Road Education Center. Trail City is west of Pinecrest on Loop Road. Loop Road can be found on most maps as CR 94, although the roadway no longer has a numbered designation and is now managed by the National Park Service.

Between the south coast of Florida&#x27;s mainland and the Florida Keys is Florida Bay, which is encompassed by the Everglades National Park and contains numerous islets or keys.

The county is coterminous with the Key West-Key Largo, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA), with Key Largo and Key West designated as principal cities. The μSA was first defined in 2003 as the Key West-Marathon, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area. The name was changed to Key West, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area in 2006, and to Key West-Key Largo, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area in 2023. The μSA is part of the Miami-Port Saint Lucie-Fort Lauderdale Combined Statistical Area.

In 1998, the Florida Keys Council of the Arts was designated by the Board of Monroe County Commissioners as the area&#x27;s Local Arts Agency as provided by Florida Statute 286.011.

===Politics===

Like much of the Solid South, in the first two-thirds of the 20th century, Monroe was a solidly Democratic county, supporting landslide losers like James M. Cox and John W. Davis. However, unlike most Southern Democrats, Monroe County voters tended to be far more liberal on social issues such as civil rights and later gay rights, voting decisively for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and even supporting Hubert Humphrey in 1968, one of only three Florida counties to do so. Four years later, however, Richard Nixon easily carried the county in his 1972 landslide re-election, becoming the first Republican winner since 1888 by receiving over 70% of the vote. 

Since the 1970s, Monroe County has been a competitive swing county in presidential elections. Although Monroe voted for the Democratic candidate from 1992 to 2012, it was won by consistently narrow margins, such as 0.5% in 2004 and 2012. Barack Obama in 2008 was the first candidate for president to win a majority, 51.7%, of the vote since George H. W. Bush&#x27;s national landslide victory in 1988. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to carry the county in almost three decades, winning a majority and winning it by an even larger margin than Obama had won it by in 2008. In 2020, he won it by a still wider margin, and in 2024 he won by double digits.

Monroe County is home to a large LGBT community, particularly in Key West. Due to the influence of this community, Monroe County was the only county in Florida to reject 2008 Florida Amendment 2, which banned same-sex marriage and civil unions in the state. The amendment passed in the state with 60% of the vote.













Monroe County is politically divided by geography, with Key West voting reliably Democratic, Stock Island a swing area, and the rest of the archipelago voting reliably Republican. The western part of Key West is more strongly Democratic than the eastern part of the island.

On July 17, 2014, a county court judge ruled the state&#x27;s ban on same sex marriage unconstitutional, ordering the county clerk of court to issue marriage licenses on July 22, 2014.

===Libraries===
The Monroe County Public Library system serves residents of the Florida Keys in five locations: Key West, Big Pine, Marathon, Key Largo, and Islamorada.

The Monroe County Public Library provides various programs and services to the Monroe County community, including job finding tools. There is a program that preserves the history of the Keys for use by customers. In 2010 the library worked to digitize historical photographs of the Keys.

Annual visitors cards can be purchased for $30. The library provides access to PCs with internet and word processing capabilities. The library also provides free Wi-Fi for all.

The Monroe County Public Library is served by the Miami-Dade County subregional library of Florida Bureau of Braille and Talking Books Library.

<text>Manoj Nelliyattu M. Night Shyamalan ( ; born August 6, 1970) is an American filmmaker. His films often employ supernatural plots and twist endings. The cumulative gross of his films exceeds $3.3 billion globally. Shyamalan has received various accolades, including nominations for two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards and a Golden Globe.

Shyamalan was born in Mahé, India, and raised in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania. His early films include &quot;Praying with Anger&quot; (1992) and &quot;Wide Awake&quot; (1998) before his breakthrough film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. He then released &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (2000), &quot;Signs&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Village&quot; (2004). After a string of poorly received films—&quot;Lady in the Water&quot; (2006), &quot;The Happening&quot; (2008), &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; (2010), and &quot;After Earth&quot; (2013)—he experienced a career resurgence with &quot;The Visit&quot; (2015) and &quot;Split&quot; (2016). These were followed by the more critically mixed receptions of &quot;Glass&quot; (2019), &quot;Old&quot; (2021), &quot;Knock at the Cabin&quot; (2023), and &quot;Trap&quot; (2024).

Shyamalan was also one of the executive producers and occasional director of the 20th Television science fiction series &quot;Wayward Pines&quot; (2015–2016) and the Apple TV+ psychological horror series &quot;Servant&quot; (2019–2023), for which he also served as showrunner.

==Early life==
Shyamalan was born in Mahé, India, a town in the Union Territory of Puducherry. His father, Dr. Nelliyattu C. Shyamalan, is a Malayali neurologist from Mahé and a JIPMER graduate; his mother, Dr. Jayalakshmi Shyamalan, a Tamil from Chennai, is an OB-GYN. 

Shyamalan&#x27;s parents immigrated to the United States when he was six weeks old. Shyamalan was raised Hindu in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania. He attended the private Roman Catholic grammar school Waldron Mercy Academy. He felt like an outsider and remembers that teachers would say that whoever was not baptized would go to hell. When he was a student there, a teacher once became upset because he &quot;got the best grade in religion class and [he] wasn&#x27;t Catholic&quot;. He later attended the Episcopal Academy, a private Episcopal high school located at the time in Merion Station, Pennsylvania.

Shyamalan earned the New York University Merit Scholarship in 1988, and was also a National Merit Scholar. Shyamalan is an alumnus of New York University Tisch School of the Arts in Manhattan, graduating in 1992. It was while studying there that he adopted &quot;Night&quot; as his second name.

Shyamalan had an early desire to be a filmmaker when he was given a Super 8 camera at a young age. Though his father wanted him to follow in the family practice of medicine, his mother encouraged him to follow his passion. By the time he was seventeen, he had made forty-five home movies. On each DVD release of his films, beginning with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and with the exception of &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, he has included a scene from one of these childhood movies, which, he feels, represents his first attempt at the same kind of film.

==Career==
===Film===

Shyamalan made his first film, the semi-autobiographical drama &quot;Praying with Anger&quot;, while still a student at NYU, using money borrowed from family and friends. He wrote and directed his second movie, &quot;Wide Awake&quot;. His parents were the film&#x27;s associate producers. The drama dealt with a ten-year-old Catholic schoolboy (Joseph Cross) who, after the death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia), searches for God. The film&#x27;s supporting cast included Dana Delany and Denis Leary as the boy&#x27;s parents, as well as Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Julia Stiles, and Camryn Manheim. &quot;Wide Awake&quot; was filmed in a school Shyamalan attended as a child and earned 1999 Young Artist Award nominations for Best Drama, and, for Cross, Best Performance. Only in limited release, the film grossed $305,704 in theaters, against a $6 million budget.

That same year Shyamalan co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Stuart Little&quot; with Greg Brooker. In 2013, he revealed he was the ghostwriter for the 1999 film &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;, a teen comedy starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook. On June 17, 2013, Jack Lechner (who served as Miramax&#x27;s head of development in the late 1990s) confirmed that both Shyamalan and R. Lee Fleming, Jr. contributed to the script: Fleming wrote the initial script that Miramax bought while Shyamalan did an uncredited rewrite (doing more than &quot;a polish&quot;) that got the film green-lit. Lechner reiterated that content from both writers was included in the final cut of the film.

Shyamalan gained international recognition when he wrote and directed 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, starring Bruce Willis, and which became the second-highest grossing horror movie of all time. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

In July 2000, on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Shyamalan said he had met with Spielberg and was in early talks to write the script for the fourth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film. This would have given Shyamalan a chance to work with his longtime idol. After the film fell through, Shyamalan later said it was too &quot;tricky&quot; to arrange and &quot;not the right thing&quot; for him to do.

Shyamalan followed &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; by writing and directing &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (2000), again starring Willis, a stealth superhero film within a thriller, which was both critically and financially successful.

Shyamalan&#x27;s name was linked with the 2001 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, but it conflicted with the production of &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. In July 2006, while doing press tours for &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, Shyamalan expressed he remained interested in directing one of the last two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films: &quot;The themes that run through it ... the empowering of children, a positive outlook ... you name it, it falls in line with my beliefs&quot;, Shyamalan said. &quot;I enjoy the humor in it. When I read the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and was thinking about making it, I had a whole different vibe in my head of it&quot;.

His next film, &quot;Signs&quot;, was released in 2002. The film stars Mel Gibson as a former Episcopalian priest who regains his faith in God during an alien invasion. It was both critically and financially successful and grossed $408 million from a budget of $72 million.

Shyamalan next directed &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), about an isolated community living in the woods. Although it received mixed reviews, it was financially successful as it grossed $257 million from a budget of $60 million.

After the release of &quot;The Village&quot; in 2004, Shyamalan had been planning a film adaptation of Yann Martel&#x27;s novel &quot;Life of Pi&quot; with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out so that he could make &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;. In an interview he said about his reasons for dropping out of that project:
Released in 2006, &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, a bedtime story about a water nymph and an apartment superintendent, was both critically and financially unsuccessful, only grossing $72 million worldwide from a budget of $70 million.

Next was the film &quot;The Happening&quot;, a science fiction thriller about an inexplicable natural disaster causing mass suicides, featuring a teacher and his wife fleeing from contaminated cities into the countryside. It was critically unsuccessful but financially successful as it grossed $163 million from a budget of $48 million.

In July 2008, it was announced that Shyamalan had partnered with Media Rights Capital to form a production company called Night Chronicles. Shyamalan would produce, but not direct, one film a year for three years. The first of the three films was &quot;Devil&quot;, a supernatural thriller directed by siblings John and Drew Dowdle. The script was written by Brian Nelson, based on an original idea from Shyamalan. The movie was about a group of people stuck in an elevator with the devil, and starred Chris Messina. The film was not previewed by critics before its release.

In 2010, he directed &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;, based on of the Nickelodeon TV series &quot;&quot;. It was critically unsuccessful—with significant criticism aimed at its casting of white actors in Asian and Native American-inspired roles, yet was a financial success, grossing $319 million from a budget of $150 million.

In 2013, Shyamalan directed the film &quot;After Earth&quot;, based on a script by Gary Whitta and starring Will Smith and his son, Jaden. It was received poorly by critics, but was financially successful, making nearly $244 million against a budget of $130 million. Shyamalan later described his thinking in 2013 as full of doubts, introspection and questioning.

Shyamalan announced in January 2014 that he would be working again with Bruce Willis on a film titled &quot;Labor of Love&quot;. As of March 2022, and the retirement of Willis, this film had yet to be produced.

Shyamalan&#x27;s reputation was poor and most Hollywood studios passed on his self-funded, low-budget horror-comedy &quot;The Visit&quot;, featuring a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents’ remote Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong visit. After revising the film, which Shyamalan had shot in secret, Universal picked up rights to &quot;The Visit&quot;. The movie went on to gross $98 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million – the fifth-highest grossing thriller film of the year. Universal released the movie on September 11, 2015.

In 2017, Shyamalan released the movie &quot;Split&quot;. It was both critically and financially successful and grossed $279 million from a budget of $9 million.

In 2019, he released &quot;Glass&quot; as the final installment in his 19-year trilogy inclusive of previous films &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and &quot;Split&quot;. The movie grossed over $247 million worldwide.

His next film, &quot;Old&quot;, a thriller about tourists who begin aging rapidly on a mysterious beach, was shot in the Dominican Republic and released on July 23, 2021. The film stars Gael Garcia Bernal, Eliza Scanlen, Thomasin McKenzie, Aaron Pierre, Alex Wolff, Abbey Lee, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Ken Leung, Vicky Krieps, Rufus Sewell, Embeth Davidtz, Alexa Swinton, Nolan River, and Emun Elliott. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

In October 2021, Shyamalan announced that his next film &quot;Knock at the Cabin&quot; would be released in cinemas on February 3, 2023. &quot;Knock at the Cabin&quot; premiered in New York City at the Rose Hall on January 30, 2023. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed over $54 million worldwide.

In February 2023, it was revealed Shyamalan&#x27;s next film, titled &quot;Trap&quot;, would be released in theatres on August 2, 2024 distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $82 million worldwide.

===Television===

Shyamalan is the executive producer on the Apple TV series &quot;Servant&quot;. He directed several episodes, including the pilot. &quot;Servant&quot; was renewed for a second series in advance of the season one premiere. The second season of &quot;Servant&quot; completed filming in fall 2020 under COVID protocols.

Shyamalan was also instrumental in the creation of the Fox science fiction series &quot;Wayward Pines&quot; (2015–2016), for which he executive produced and directed the pilot episode. The series became the most-watched show of that summer.

In 2016, TNT first announced that Shyamalan would be responsible for a reboot series for &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. the series had been cancelled due to a number of legal reasons.

He also appeared in an episode of the series &quot;Entourage&quot;.

===Production company===
Shyamalan&#x27;s production company, Blinding Edge Pictures, is located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Blinding Edge has produced &quot;Servant&quot;, &quot;Wayward Pines&quot;, &quot;Devil&quot;, &quot;The Happening&quot;, &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, &quot;The Village&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;, &quot;After Earth&quot;, &quot;The Visit&quot;, &quot;Split&quot;, &quot;Glass&quot; and &quot;Old&quot;. It is run by Shyamalan and Ashwin Rajan. In February 2023, the company signed a multi-year first-look deal with Warner Bros., among them the Shyamalan-directed &quot;Trap&quot;, which released theatrically on August 2, 2024.

==Books==
While working on his film &quot;The Happening&quot;, Shyamalan developed an interest in improving the delivery of education in American schools. He hired doctoral student James Richardson to do most of the background research and as a result published &quot;I Got Schooled: The Unlikely Story of How a Moonlighting Movie Maker Learned the Five Keys to Closing America&#x27;s Education Gap&quot; through Simon and Schuster in 2013. John Willol of NPR reviewed the book by stating &quot;&quot;I Got Schooled&quot; is a breezily written, research driven call to change America&#x27;s approach to education. Shyamalan is smart and sincere, and his innovative ideas are unbound by the educational establishment.&quot;

==Personal life==
Shyamalan married Bhavna Vaswani, a fellow student whom he met at New York University. The couple has three daughters, including director Ishana and musician Saleka. 

Shyamalan and his family live near Philadelphia at Ravenwood, a estate, built around a 1937 Georgian Revival house.

Shyamalan is a season ticket holder of the Philadelphia 76ers.

In 2023, Shyamalan bought a estate from the Rockefeller family in Willistown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, which has five historic houses and two barns for $24 million.

==Critical analysis and box-office performance==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; gave Shyamalan the reputation of &quot;the guy who makes the scary movies with a twist&quot;. In 2008, Shyamalan said it was a common misperception that &quot;all my movies have twist endings, or that they&#x27;re all scary. All my movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective&quot;. He nonetheless avoided plot twists for years, until again using them starting with &quot;The Visit&quot; in 2015. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in 2018,

After the release of &quot;The Village&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;″s Michael Agger noted that Shyamalan was following &quot;an uncomfortable pattern&quot; of &quot;making fragile, sealed-off movies that fell apart when exposed to outside logic&quot;.

Shyamalan has also been nominated for, and in some cases won, numerous Golden Raspberry Awards for &quot;Lady in the Water&quot; in 2006, &quot;The Happening&quot; in 2008, &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; in 2010, and &quot;After Earth&quot; in 2013. In 2016 he was also nominated for the Razzie Redeemer Award.

&quot;The Village&quot;, &quot;Lady in the Water,&quot; &quot;Split&quot; and &quot;Trap&quot; have been included in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; annual top ten lists.

Shyamalan is also known for setting and shooting his films in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, along with nearby Reading, Pennsylvania. Most of his early commercially successful films were co-produced and released by Walt Disney Studios&#x27; Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures imprints. Films of his resurgence, however, were usually released by Universal Pictures.

==Awards and nominations==

In 2008, Shyamalan was honored with the Padma Shri award by the Government of India. Shyamalan was the Jury President of the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival competition section.

==Controversies==
===SyFy Channel hoax===
In 2004, Shyamalan was involved in a media hoax with SyFy Channel, which was eventually uncovered by the press. SyFy claimed in its &quot;documentary&quot; special &quot;The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan&quot;, shot on the set of &quot;The Village&quot;, that as a child, Shyamalan had been dead for nearly half an hour while drowned in a frozen pond in an accident, and that upon being rescued he had experiences of communicating with spirits, fueling an obsession with the supernatural.

In truth, Shyamalan developed the hoax with SyFy, going so far as having SyFy staffers sign non-disclosure agreements with a $5 million fine attached and requiring Shyamalan&#x27;s office to formally approve each step. Neither the childhood accident nor a supposed rift with the filmmakers ever occurred. The hoax included a nonexistent SyFy publicist, &quot;David Westover&quot;, whose name appeared on press releases regarding the special. SyFy also fed false news stories to the Associated Press, Zap2It, and the &quot;New York Post&quot;, among others.

After an AP reporter confronted SyFy Channel president Bonnie Hammer at a press conference, Hammer admitted the hoax, saying it was part of a guerrilla marketing campaign to generate pre-release publicity for &quot;The Village&quot;. This prompted SyFy&#x27;s parent company, NBC Universal, to state that the undertaking was &quot;not consistent with our policy at NBC. We would never intend to offend the public or the press and we value our relationship with both.&quot;

===Plagiarism accusations===
Robert McIlhinney, a Pennsylvanian screenwriter, sued Shyamalan in 2003, alleging similarities between &quot;Signs&quot; and his unpublished script &quot;Lord of the Barrens: The Jersey Devil&quot;.

In 2004, Margaret Peterson Haddix claimed that &quot;The Village&quot; has numerous similarities to her young adult novel &quot;Running Out of Time&quot;, prompting discussions with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster about filing a lawsuit.

In response to both allegations, Disney and Shyamalan&#x27;s production company Blinding Edge issued statements calling the claims &quot;meritless&quot;.

Orson Scott Card has claimed that many elements of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; were plagiarized from his novel &quot;Lost Boys&quot;, although he has said that enough had been changed that there was no point in suing.

==Pop culture and racism==
After the release of &quot;The Happening&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Kim Newman questioned, &quot;Can it be a kind of racism that the Indian-born, Philadelphia-raised auteur is hammered for his apparent character (or funny name) rather more than, say, Quentin Tarantino or Spike Lee?&quot; The British Film Institute (BFI) also discussed the impact of racism on Shyamalan&#x27;s career, pointing to frequent mispronunciations of his last name. By 2017, &quot;Vice&quot; said that &quot;Shamalamadingdong&quot; had become the &quot;agreed-upon mockery of his name&quot;.

BFI asked if critical attacks are the result of egotistical statements on Shyamalan&#x27;s part. They question whether his strong statements of self-assurance coupled with the remarkable success of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; set up a fall from grace which was soon realized when a run of very successful films (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot; and &quot;The Village&quot;) seemingly collapsed with a string of critical failures (&quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, &quot;The Happening&quot;, &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;, and &quot;After Earth&quot;). In 2019, Tim Greiving of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that &quot;his confidence was interpreted as arrogance by some, especially after he cast himself in &quot;Lady in the Water&quot; as a brilliant writer whose book is prophesied as a world-saver.&quot; Greiving continued, &quot;Howard, who expressed pride in him for forging ahead despite his turn among critics, noted how rare it was for such a young filmmaker to write, direct and produce original material. He wondered whether that placed a bigger target on his back, as his reputation for doggedness was perpetuated within the industry and reinforced by critics.&quot;

==Law enforcement==

In November 2023 in Fort Walton Beach, Okaloosa County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy Jesse Hernandez and sergeant Beth Roberts shot multiple times at Hernandez&#x27;s police car, where a handcuffed and unarmed black suspect had been placed there by police, according to investigators. The suspect was not injured by the shootings. Hernandez in December 2023 resigned from the department. In February 2024, it was announced that an internal investigation by the Okaloosa County Sheriff&#x27;s office concluded that Hernandez began shooting after hearing the sound of an acorn bouncing off his police car, then Roberts began shooting after hearing Hernandez shooting and screaming, with Hernandez at one point shouting: &quot;I&#x27;m hit! I&#x27;m hit!&quot;. Hernandez had told investigators that he thought he heard a gunshot from a &quot;suppressed weapon&quot; and believed that he had been shot: &quot;I felt an impact on my right side, like upper torso area … I feel the impact. My legs just give out.&quot; The Sheriff&#x27;s Office&#x27;s stated that while Roberts&#x27; shooting was reasonable, Hernandez&#x27;s shooting was &quot;not objectively reasonable&quot;, but &quot;we do believe [Hernandez] felt his life was in immediate peril&quot;.

In May 2024, an Okaloosa County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy fatally shot Roger Fortson, a United States Air Force member, in Fortson&#x27;s home in Fort Walton Beach. According to body camera footage, when the deputy visited an apartment, Fortson opened the apartment door holding a gun in his right hand, with the gun held by his side and pointed downwards. As the door opened, the deputy told Fortson to &quot;step back&quot; and immediately shot Fortson. Fortson falls to the floor, and it is only then that the deputy tells Fortson: &quot;Drop the gun!&quot;

Later in May 2024, a Florida woman sued the Okaloosa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, claiming that on two occasions, once in August 2019 and once in May 2020, they forced her to leave her home while she remained naked during the execution of search warrants, exposing her to law enforcement officers and the public.

<doc id="73633" wikidata="Q648949" url="?curid=73633" title="Overkill (band)">
<text>Overkill is an American thrash metal band, formed in 1980 in New Jersey. They have gone through many lineup changes, leaving bassist D.D. Verni and lead vocalist Bobby &quot;Blitz&quot; Ellsworth as the only remaining original members. The band&#x27;s current lineup includes Verni, Ellsworth, Dave Linsk on lead guitar, Derek &quot;The Skull&quot; Tailer on rhythm guitar, and Jeramie Kling as a touring drummer. Along with Nuclear Assault and Anthrax, the latter of whom would feature one-time Overkill lead guitarist Dan Spitz, the band is one of the most successful East Coast thrash metal bands, and they are often called &quot;the Motörhead of thrash metal&quot;, based on their unique playing style, which was influenced by punk rock and the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM). The band has a notable mascot named &quot;Chaly&quot; (a skeletal bat with a skull-like face, horns, bony wings and green eyes) who has appeared on many of their album covers.

Overkill has released twenty studio albums, an album of cover songs, two extended plays, one demo tape and three live albums. They were one of the first thrash metal bands to be signed to a major label (having signed to Atlantic Records in 1986), and rose to popularity as part of the genre&#x27;s movement of the mid-to-late 1980s, along with the &quot;Big Four&quot; (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax) as well as Exodus and Testament. Overkill achieved its first mainstream success with their second studio album and Atlantic debut, &quot;Taking Over&quot; (1987), which peaked at number 191 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band&#x27;s next five studio albums—&quot;Under the Influence&quot; (1988), &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; (1989), &quot;Horrorscope&quot; (1991), &quot;I Hear Black&quot; (1993) and &quot;W.F.O.&quot; (1994)—were also successful on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, with the latter two entering the top 10 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Following their split from Atlantic in 1995, Overkill went through some label changes, but continued to enjoy moderate underground success, particularly in Europe and Japan. The band experienced a resurgence of popularity in the U.S. during the 2010s, with three of their studio albums released that decade—&quot;The Electric Age&quot; (2012), &quot;White Devil Armory&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Grinding Wheel&quot; (2017)—all reaching the top 100 on the charts. Overkill has sold over 16 million records worldwide; they are also estimated to have sold more than 625,000 records in the U.S. since the beginning of the SoundScan era.

==History==
===Early years and &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; (1980–1986)===

Overkill was formed in 1980 by members of the punk band the Lubricunts, which featured bassist D.D. Verni and drummer Rat Skates. Verni and Skates placed an ad looking for a guitarist and lead singer, which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek and singer Bobby Ellsworth, and the first incarnation of Overkill was formed. After rejecting several band names, including Virgin Killer, the band finally settled on Overkill, named after Motörhead&#x27;s second album.

Early covers, especially those done under the Virgin Killer name, were punk songs by the Ramones, the Dead Boys and others. By late 1980, the band&#x27;s setlist was made up of songs by bands such as Motörhead (including songs from &quot;Overkill&quot; and half of the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; album), Judas Priest (&quot;Tyrant&quot; was their closer), and Riot. Along with the new influx of heavy metal covers, the band still played a smattering of punk covers, with extra distortion, intensity, and speed. In 1981, the band went through a succession of guitarists after Robert Pisarek left, first being replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony , then Rich Conte and Mike Sherry, before settling with Bobby Gustafson in late 1982. It was around this time that the band started writing original songs, including &quot;Grave Robbers&quot; (later renamed &quot;Raise the Dead&quot;), &quot;Overkill&quot;, and &quot;Unleash the Beast (Within)&quot;. More songs would follow, such as &quot;Death Rider&quot; (1981) and &quot;Rotten to the Core&quot; (1982). As the band continued to write songs, they became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs, such as L&#x27;Amour.

In 1983, the lineup of Verni, Skates, Ellsworth, and Gustafson released the &quot;Power in Black&quot; demo, a recording that made as much impact in the underground tape trading circuit as demos by then-up-and-coming Bay Area thrash metal bands, such as Exodus and Testament (then-called Legacy). &quot;Power in Black&quot; gained the band two compilation appearances: &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; was included on &quot;New York Metal &#x27;84&quot; while &quot;Death Rider&quot; appeared on the fifth volume of Metal Blade Records&#x27; &quot;Metal Massacre&quot; series. The success of &quot;Power in Black&quot; also enabled the band to secure a small recording deal with Azra/Metal Storm Records that resulted in the 1985 four-track extended play (EP) &quot;Overkill&quot;, which quickly sold out, instantly pushing the band to the forefront of the fledgling thrash metal movement. Long out of print, the vinyl-only EP is now considered a rare collector&#x27;s item and all the songs appeared eleven years later on the compilation album &quot;!!!Fuck You!!! and Then Some&quot;.

Though it is said that the band never saw any money from its release, the &quot;Overkill&quot; EP garnered the band massive underground interest, and the attention of Jon Zazula, owner of Megaforce Records, one of the most prominent independent heavy metal record labels at the time. Megaforce signed Overkill to a multi-album record contract and released their full-length debut album &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; in October 1985. Hailed by many critics and fans as a thrash metal masterpiece, the album cemented the band&#x27;s position as one of the driving forces of the East Coast thrash metal movement. The band spent the better part of 1985 and 1986 touring in support of &quot;Feel the Fire&quot;, touring Europe with Anthrax and Agent Steel, and supporting Slayer on their &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; tour in North America. Overkill&#x27;s grueling tour schedule and the growing buzz for &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; resulted in the band being courted by several major labels; they were eventually signed to Atlantic Records, making Overkill one of the early thrash metal bands to sign to a major label.

===Rise to success (1987–1990)===
Overkill&#x27;s second album, &quot;Taking Over&quot;, was released in March 1987; it was the first to be released by Megaforce with distribution from Atlantic Records. The album featured longer songs and improved production. &quot;Taking Over&quot; also brought the band public recognition, becoming their first album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while Overkill&#x27;s first-ever music video &quot;In Union We Stand&quot; received significant airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. Another European tour followed, this time opening for Helloween. Overkill also opened for Megadeth on their &quot;Peace Sells&quot; tour in North America, and then headlined their own U.S. tour, with support from Nuclear Assault and then-Megaforce/Atlantic labelmates Testament.
In late 1987, the &quot;!!!Fuck You!!!&quot; EP was released, consisting of a studio cover version of the Subhumans&#x27; &quot;Fuck You&quot;, as well as a handful of live tracks recorded earlier that year in Cleveland. 1987 also saw the departure of founding drummer Rat Skates. He was replaced temporarily by Mark Archibole, and then permanently by Danish drummer Bob &quot;Sid&quot; Falck, formerly of Paul Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s Battlezone. Overkill closed out the year with a one-off show at the Christmas on Earth festival in Leeds, England, together with Megadeth, Kreator, Nuclear Assault, Voivod, the Cro-Mags, Lȧȧz Rockit and Virus.

Overkill released their third album, &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, in July 1988. Once again produced by Alex Perialas, who had worked on the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Under the Influence&quot; was much more raw and thrashy, lacking most of the epic atmosphere heard on &quot;Taking Over&quot;. &quot;Hello from the Gutter&quot; was released as a single, and its music video gained regular airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. Overkill kept up constant touring all over the world, furthering their reputation as one of the most active live metal bands; this included opening for Slayer on their &quot;South of Heaven&quot; tour in the United States and Europe, and performing with other bands such as Anthrax, Motörhead, Anvil, Nuclear Assault, M.O.D., Testament, Vio-lence, King&#x27;s X, Prong, Murphy&#x27;s Law, Ludichrist and Znowhite.

Overkill released their fourth album, &quot;The Years of Decay&quot;, in October 1989. Produced by Terry Date (who would later work with the likes of Pantera, White Zombie and Soundgarden), the album featured the band&#x27;s best production value to date, as well as Overkill&#x27;s most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous albums. It combined the raw approach of &quot;Under the Influence&quot; with more complex song structures and epic elements of &quot;Taking Over&quot;, resulting in a more serious atmosphere and longer songs, including the eight-minute title track and the ten-minute &quot;Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher&quot;, the latter is the longest track Overkill has recorded to date. Although the album charted lower than &quot;Under the Influence&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 155, &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; was a breakthrough album for Overkill, selling over 67,000 copies within the next decade-and-a-half, and includes one of the band&#x27;s best-known songs &quot;Elimination&quot;, for which a music video received regular airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. That song became a fan favorite and remains a staple in the band&#x27;s live repertoire. Overkill toured relentlessly in support of &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; between November 1989 and June 1990, with bands such as Testament, Wolfsbane, Dark Angel, Vio-lence, Mordred, Powermad, Whiplash and Excel.

===&quot;Horrorscope&quot;, &quot;I Hear Black&quot; and &quot;W.F.O.&quot; (1990–1995)===
Not long after &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; tour ended in the summer of 1990, Gustafson parted ways with Overkill. Accounts vary as to exactly how and why he had split with the band: he had been either fired by Verni and Ellsworth, or had left Overkill following an argument over the band&#x27;s musical direction. Gustafson has stated that one of the reasons for his split with Overkill was due to disagreements over royalties, during which he became embroiled in a bitter feud with Verni and Ellsworth. The remaining members added two new guitarists to the band: Rob Cannavino, who had been Gustafson&#x27;s guitar technician, and Merritt Gant, formerly of Faith or Fear. Ellsworth stated in an interview with &quot;Invisible Oranges&quot; years later that the reason Overkill hired two guitarists was mainly because they wanted to do something different: &quot;We knew if we replaced Bobby with one guitarist, we&#x27;d get compared to what we were. So, it seemed like to logical thing to bring in two players. We didn&#x27;t want anyone to say, &#x27;Bobby was better than this new guy.&#x27; And we wanted to perform old stuff with two guitars to keep in fresh. We realized that change isn&#x27;t a bad thing.&quot;

The &quot;new&quot; Overkill recorded their fifth album &quot;Horrorscope&quot;, once again produced by Terry Date, in 1991. Featuring the furious riffs and trade-off solos of new guitarists Cannavino and Gant, and the refined songwriting of Verni and Ellsworth, &quot;Horrorscope&quot; quickly silenced worries from fans that the band would not recover from their split with Gustafson. The album is widely regarded as one of Overkill&#x27;s defining moments and is arguably their heaviest release. Focusing on a darker, heavier style, the album spawned the doomy single &quot;Horrorscope&quot;, a departure from the band&#x27;s earlier singles, which had traditionally been uptempo songs. &quot;Horrorscope&quot; was also Overkill&#x27;s first album to be accompanied by more than one music video or single; there were music videos for the title track and &quot;Thanx for Nothin&#x27;&quot; (both of which received some good airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;), while other songs like &quot;Coma&quot;, &quot;Infectious&quot; and the cover version of Edgar Winter&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; received particular attention (through radio or otherwise), therefore expanding the band&#x27;s popularity in the heavy metal community, and helping the album enter the Top 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart. Overkill supported &quot;Horrorscope&quot; by touring North America with Anacrusis and Galactic Cowboys in 1991 and Armored Saint in 1992, after which drummer Sid Falck left the band. Admittedly never a big fan of thrash metal music, Falck said that he had initially wanted to push his drumming to the limit by playing the most complex type of music (of the era), and in time he decided to pursue other musical interests.

Falck was replaced by former M.O.D. drummer Tim Mallare, with whom the next Overkill album &quot;I Hear Black&quot; was recorded. Released in March 1993, &quot;I Hear Black&quot; saw the band reunite with Alex Perialas as a producer, and was the first Overkill album released directly through Atlantic Records. The album once again presented a change in style, from the heavy thrash of &quot;Horrorscope&quot; to a more stoner/blues rock-oriented style influenced by Black Sabbath. The eclectic nature of the album is often attributed to the fact that many different songwriters were involved. Verni and Ellsworth would handle most of the song writing themselves on subsequent albums, with only minor contributions from the other members. A music video was shot for &quot;Spiritual Void&quot; and it had received minor airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. The European leg of the 1993 &quot;World of Hurt Tour&quot; featured Savatage and Non-Fiction as support acts.

Overkill&#x27;s self-produced seventh album &quot;W.F.O.&quot; (which stands for &quot;Wide Fuckin&#x27; Open&quot;, a common biker term) was released on July 15, 1994, in response to the criticism that &quot;I Hear Black&quot; had received. The album presented a fast, heads-down, old school thrash metal style without any of the experimental elements present on &quot;I Hear Black&quot; in favor of a groove-oriented sound. The music video for &quot;Fast Junkie&quot; received little or no airplay from MTV, due to changing mainstream tastes and limited airplay availability for metal bands. Overkill continued to have bigger success overseas, mounting an extensive European tour in the fall, supported by Jag Panzer and Massacra.

With grunge dominating the airwaves in the United States, many heavy metal radio stations changing formats and &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; going off the air, &quot;W.F.O.&quot; failed to find an audience, and in 1995 Overkill split with Atlantic Records. The band was happy to leave the major label, where they felt they received little or no attention and signed to different record companies around the world (CMC International in the US).

A March 1995 show, once again in Cleveland, Ohio, was recorded for Overkill&#x27;s first full-length live album, a 100-minute double CD entitled &quot;Wrecking Your Neck&quot;. The album was released in April 1995, with the first pressing featuring a bonus CD containing the &quot;Overkill&quot; EP that had been out of print for ten years. A music video for the song &quot;Bastard Nation&quot; taken from &quot;Wrecking Your Neck&quot; was also released, but again failed to receive airplay in the US.

===Post-Atlantic years (1995–2002)===
Late in 1995, both Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant decided to leave the band; Cannavino to focus on motorcycle racing, and Gant to spend more time with his family. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, Overkill then hired Joe Comeau, former singer of Liege Lord, on guitar. Comeau brought along former Anvil guitarist Sebastian Marino, with whom he had worked in the past. The new lineup recorded &quot;The Killing Kind&quot; in 1996, again self-produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest). While staying well within the thrash genre, the album was a departure from its predecessor&#x27;s more traditional thrash metal style and featured different elements such as hardcore, while the vocals showed influences from a broad spectrum of music. As Comeau was also a singer, backing vocals on &quot;The Killing Kind&quot; and subsequent albums were more elaborate and frequent than before, adding another element to the band&#x27;s sound. Press response to &quot;The Killing Kind&quot; was very positive, but the album remains a hotly contested topic among the band&#x27;s audience, with some longtime fans resistant to the new modern elements, and others hailing &quot;The Killing Kind&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s finest moments.

Overkill toured Europe twice in support of &quot;The Killing Kind&quot; first in February 1996 with Megora and Accu§er, and then again in November with Anvil and Stahlhammer. In the summer of 1996, Overkill appeared on Volume 2 of Century Media&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Metal – A Tribute to Judas Priest&quot; compilation, to which they contributed &quot;Tyrant&quot;.

In October 1996, the band released &quot;!!!Fuck You!!! and Then Some&quot;. The album included the &quot;!!!Fuck You!!!&quot; EP, which had been out of print for some years, along with the classic &quot;Overkill&quot; EP and two live tracks from a 1990 promo single. October of the same year saw the release of the ninth Overkill studio album, titled &quot;From the Underground and Below&quot;. This record retained some of the modern influences from &quot;The Killing Kind&quot;, while also reincorporating elements from the band&#x27;s earlier efforts. Some songs on &quot;From the Underground and Below&quot;, including &quot;Save Me&quot;, even had a slight industrial metal sound to them. Reportedly a video for the track &quot;Long Time Dyin&#x27;&quot; was shot, but received no television exposure. In 1998, once again the band opted to tour only Europe in support of the album, hitting the road with Nevermore, Angel Dust and Nocturnal Rites.

In 1998, Ellsworth was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of nose cancer and underwent immediate surgery, stopping the cancer before it spread. After his recovery, the band started work on their tenth studio album. The self-produced &quot;Necroshine&quot; was released in February 1999, making Overkill the first thrash metal band ever to release ten full-length studio albums (other first wave thrash bands, such as Sodom or Kreator, would not achieve this milestone until two years later). While once again quite different from the previous records and musically not considered &quot;classic&quot; Overkill, the album was vocally even more experimental than &quot;The Killing Kind&quot;, and was well received by fans and critics alike.

Before the release of &quot;Necroshine&quot;, Sebastian Marino left Overkill to spend more time with his family. He was replaced by Dave Linsk from the New Jersey hardcore/thrash metal band Anger on Anger. A two-week European trip in June was arranged to fill the gap between appearances at the Dynamo and With Full Force festivals.

October 1999 saw the release of &quot;Coverkill&quot;, an album consisting entirely of cover versions from bands that were especially influential to Overkill, such as Black Sabbath (featured three times), Kiss, Motörhead, Manowar, and the Ramones. Some of the tracks had been previously available on compilations or as bonus tracks, but others had been shelved for years (the earliest recording was from the &quot;Under the Influence&quot; sessions) or were recorded immediately prior to the album&#x27;s release. A full European tour in support of both &quot;Necroshine&quot; and &quot;Coverkill&quot; took place in February 2000, as Overkill co-headlined with Canadian thrash metal band Annihilator, with German band Dew-Scented in the opening slot.

During the European tour, Annihilator fired their lead singer Randy Rampage due to his disruptive behavior. A few months later, Joe Comeau was confirmed as his replacement, effectively ending his tenure with Overkill. The band returned to the studio, this time as a four-piece, and in the fall of 2000, released &quot;Bloodletting&quot;. Once again, it was produced by the band and mixed by Colin Richardson.

In November 2000, the band toured Europe as a special guest on Halford&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; world tour. Since Overkill had not found a new rhythm guitarist yet, Comeau joined on a temporary basis for the tour. For the last couple of shows, the band also utilized another session musician. With D.D. Verni&#x27;s wife about to give birth to their second child, Verni was to miss a week or two of shows and needed a fill-in. Derek Tailer of Dee Snider&#x27;s band SMFs was asked to do the job. In 2002, Tailer was announced as a permanent member of Overkill, although not on bass, but filling the vacant rhythm guitarist position.

===Switching labels and drummers (2002–2008)===

After taking a break, Overkill resurfaced in 2002 with &quot;Wrecking Everything&quot;, their second full-length live album, recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The album contained only songs that had not been on &quot;Wrecking Your Neck&quot;, some simply because they were released on later albums, but also a few early songs from albums such as &quot;Taking Over&quot;, &quot;Under the Influence&quot; and &quot;The Years of Decay&quot;. The same show was used for Overkill&#x27;s first ever DVD, &quot;Wrecking Everything – An Evening in Asbury Park&quot;, also released in 2002.

The European tour in June 2002, supporting both &quot;Bloodletting&quot; and &quot;Wrecking Everything&quot;, saw Blaze and Wicked Mystic opening up for Overkill. During the second to last show of the tour in Nuremberg, Germany, Blitz suffered a stroke on stage and collapsed. For nearly three days, rumors ran rampant, reporting everything from Blitz being in a coma, permanently paralyzed, or even that Blitz had died. Finally, three days later, the band announced that the stroke was very minor and had no lasting consequences, as well as no cause that could be determined by the doctors.

Overkill signed to Spitfire Records and entered the studio in late 2002 to record their next studio album, &quot;Killbox 13&quot;. Produced by the band and Colin Richardson, and released in March 2003, the album was actually only their twelfth regular studio album, but the &quot;Overkill&quot; EP was also counted to achieve the number 13. The album received critical acclaim, combining the &quot;new&quot; Overkill with their raw early style as presented on the debut album &quot;Feel the Fire&quot;. Touring for the album included a number of European festivals during the summer, and a full European tour followed in November with Seven Witches and After All. The band played without Derek Tailer, who was absent for undisclosed reasons. Nobody was hired to fill in for him, so Overkill toured as a four-piece for the first time since 1990. Tailer was still considered a full member of the band.

In late 2004, after a Japanese tour with Death Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam, the band started work on another record in D.D. Verni&#x27;s own recording studio. The album, &quot;ReliXIV&quot;, was produced and mixed by the band themselves and released in March 2005.

Overkill toured the eastern US in April 2005, and just before they went on a European tour in May, it was announced that Tim Mallare would not take part in this tour. Replacing him for the tour was former Hades drummer Ron Lipnicki. A few weeks later, the band announced that Mallare had left permanently and Lipnicki was his replacement. In the summer of 2005, Overkill organized their first US West Coast tour in more than ten years, playing Western Canada to Southern California. The tour was such a success that the band was added to the 2006 Gigantour bill, as second stage headliners, marking Overkill&#x27;s first nationwide US tour since 1994.

Now with the Bodog Music label, the band rejoined forces with Jonny and Marsha Zazula, previous owners of Megaforce Records, who were part of the Bodog Team in the United States. Overkill released its 14th studio album, &quot;Immortalis&quot;, on October 9, 2007. The album featured the lineup of founders Bobby &quot;Blitz&quot; Ellsworth and D.D. Verni, guitarists Dave Linsk and Derek Tailer, and new drummer Ron Lipnicki. Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe contributed vocals on the song &quot;Skull and Bones&quot;.

===Return to popularity (2009–2017)===
On October 30, 2009, it was reported that Overkill had inked a multi-album deal with Nuclear Blast Records. The band&#x27;s 15th album, &quot;Ironbound&quot;—which is described as a true &quot;thrashter-piece&quot;—was released on February 9, 2010. The album marked something of a &quot;comeback&quot; for Overkill after years of lackluster record sales and a decline in popularity in the U.S. since the mid-1990s; it was also the band&#x27;s first album to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart since 1993&#x27;s &quot;I Hear Black&quot;, peaking at number 192. The band happened to be playing at Times Square in New York City on May 1, 2010, as part of their &quot;Ironbound&quot; tour when someone nearby attempted unsuccessfully to blow a car up using fireworks. The show proceeded without interruption, but some ticket holders arriving late were prevented from entering the theater by police responding to the incident. Overkill had toured for almost two years by promoting &quot;Ironbound&quot;; it started with a European trek in February 2010 (supported by Suicidal Angels, Savage Messiah and Cripper), followed two months later by a U.S. tour with Vader, God Dethroned, Warbringer, Evile and Woe of Tyrants. The band toured the U.S. again in the fall (this time with Forbidden, Evile, Gama Bomb and Bonded by Blood), and then did a European run in March 2011 with Destruction, Heathen, After All and Bonded by Blood. The tour cycle for &quot;Ironbound&quot; ended in South America in the fall of 2011.

In July 2011, Overkill began demoing six songs and were planning to begin recording their 16th album in October for an early 2012 release. The resulting album, &quot;The Electric Age&quot;, was released on March 27, 2012, and it was the band&#x27;s first album to enter the top 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 77; this was also Overkill&#x27;s highest-chart position at the time. In 2013, the band embarked on &quot;The Dark Roots of Thrash&quot; tour of North America, headlined by labelmates Testament, and supported by Flotsam and Jetsam and 4Arm. However, they canceled their February 15 show in Huntington at The Paramount Theatre due to singer Bobby &quot;Blitz&quot; being diagnosed with &quot;walking pneumonia&quot;. On February 18, it was announced that Overkill was officially dropped out of the &quot;Dark Roots of Thrash&quot; tour as Blitz&#x27;s condition had gotten slightly worse after the show in Worcester, Massachusetts.

On August 31, 2013, Overkill entered Gear Recording on to begin recording their seventeenth studio album. The album was going to be released on March 7, 2014. On January 14, however, it was announced that the album was postponed to July. On March 15, it was revealed that the new album was going to be titled &quot;White Devil Armory&quot;. After some delays, &quot;White Devil Armory&quot; was finally released on July 22, 2014. The album was their most successful; it peaked at #31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Overkill&#x27;s highest chart position yet.

On November 5, 2015, it was announced that Overkill would play a special show on April 16, 2016 in Oberhausen where they played the &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; and &quot;Horrorscope&quot; albums in their entirety. The show was professionally filmed and recorded for the DVD &quot;Live in Overhausen&quot;, which was released on May 18, 2018.

Overkill released a box set, titled &quot;&quot;, on October 16, 2015. To support the box set, Overkill embarked on a North American tour with Symphony X in September–October 2015, and a UK tour in April 2016. In a September 2015 interview, Bobby &quot;Blitz&quot; Ellsworth revealed that Overkill had begun writing their eighteenth studio album, and by March 2016, they had &quot;fully demoed&quot; eleven songs for it. Ellsworth said in a March 2016 interview that Overkill would begin recording the album in early May for an October release. On April 16, 2017, the band announced that their drummer Ron Lipnicki would miss the European tour due to a family emergency, and that he would be replaced by Eddy Garcia, which was later confirmed to be a &quot;personal issue&quot; from Lipnicki. On August 13, 2016, &quot;The Grinding Wheel&quot; was announced as the name of the album, and Ellsworth said that the band was &quot;looking for a first-week-of-November release&quot;; however, the album&#x27;s release date was pushed back to February 10, 2017. &quot;The Grinding Wheel&quot; was another successful album for Overkill; it reached at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the band&#x27;s second-highest chart position behind &quot;White Devil Armory&quot;. To support the album, Overkill toured North America with Nile, and supported former Sepultura members Max and Igor Cavalera in Europe on their Return to Roots tour. They also headlined the 2017 edition of the Metal Alliance Tour, supported by Crowbar, Havok, Black Fast and Invidia.

===Jason Bittner-era (2017–2024)===

On May 4, 2017, Overkill announced that Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall and formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam) had replaced Lipnicki as the drummer of the band. Lipnicki later went on to join Whiplash.

On February 9, 2018, Overkill announced that they were in the studio working on demos for their nineteenth studio album. Pre-production of the album began that April, and Ellsworth announced that it would be released in February 2019. On June 1, 2018, the band announced that they had begun recording the album. During an interview with Eddie Trunk on &quot;Trunk Nation&quot; on October 10, 2018, bassist D.D. Verni announced that the album was finished; he was quoted as saying, &quot;I just got the final sequencing and all that, so that&#x27;s all buttoned up. We&#x27;re working on the cover now. We still don&#x27;t have a title — we&#x27;re gonna have to come up with that soon — but we have a lot of things floating around. And the new release will probably be in February.&quot; On November 28, 2018, Overkill announced that the album was titled &quot;The Wings of War&quot; and would be released on February 22, 2019. The band promoted the album by headlining the 2019 edition of the Killfest Tour, supported by Destruction, Flotsam and Jetsam and Meshiaak, touring North America in the spring with Death Angel and Mothership, and performing at Megadeth&#x27;s first-ever MegaCruise in the Pacific Ocean that October. They continued to tour in support of &quot;The Wings of War&quot; in 2020, including touring the U.S. with Exhorder and Hydraform, and appearing at a handful of metal-related festivals in Europe.

In June 2019, it was reported that Overkill was expected to start writing new material for their 20th studio album by the beginning of 2020. In an interview with Metal Exhumator in October 2019, Ellsworth said, &quot;We just sat down and talked about starting to write in the spring. Maybe late spring, early summer, just say maybe we should just schedule some time to do it. But there&#x27;s been no ideas with regard to where it&#x27;s going to go.&quot; Bittner revealed in an April 2020 interview with Metal Pilgrim that Verni had written nine songs for the album, but added that plans to enter the studio were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic: &quot;So our plan was to start working on new material, but considering the fact that we have to stay in our spaces right now, we&#x27;re just kind of doing things electronically and it&#x27;s just given D.D. some more time to write. Because we were kind of on a little bit of a timeline, &#x27;cause we — well, all right, I&#x27;ll say we &quot;had&quot; a plan, but everybody had a plan before last month.&quot; He also mentioned that a European tour in March 2021 to support the album was in the works: &quot;We have no idea if that&#x27;s gonna even be a possibility right now, because timelines that we had for the record label and whatnot are no longer those anymore, because the record label is shut down and &quot;nobody&quot; is doing any business right this very second.&quot; Ellsworth stated in an interview with A&amp;P Reacts in June 2020 that a new Overkill album was expected to be released in April 2021, with a tour supporting it to follow; Bittner later revealed that the band had recorded 11 demos for the album, and added, &quot;I think right now, the last time I talked to D.D., our idea is to try to start getting drums done, like, September-ish, depending on what happens. The problem is that we really can&#x27;t do our regular pre-production right now, because we all don&#x27;t live in the same state.&quot; On September 5, 2020, Bittner announced on his Facebook profile that Overkill would enter the studio on September 14 to begin recording their new album. Drum tracks had been finished by October, and mixing was handled by Colin Richardson, who had previously worked with Overkill in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In an interview on That Metal Interview in October 2020, Bittner said its release could be pushed back to the fall of 2021 due to the COVID pandemic, explaining, &quot;Lord knows what&#x27;s gonna happen. God forbid it gets worse. It might even be pushed back even longer. But the point is at least we&#x27;re gonna get it done.&quot; Verni reiterated Bittner&#x27;s comments about a possible release date, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;re trying to coordinate it maybe with some touring. We don&#x27;t really have any touring till next July, I think, our first shows. We have shows [booked] in July, August, September, October. Whether any of them are gonna happen, I don&#x27;t know, but probably something like that for the new Overkill release. So I&#x27;ll be working on that between now and then.&quot; Bittner later stated that the release of the album was pushed back to February 2022. In an August 2021 interview on Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk, Verni revealed that Overkill was still recording their 20th studio album and planning to mix it in the fall for a March 2022 release coincided with a tour. However, Ellsworth stated in a March 2022 interview that it was not expected to be released before April 2023.

On November 13, 2021, Overkill performed their first show in &quot;609 f!!kin&#x27; days&quot; at the Wellmont Theater in New Jersey; supported by Demolition Hammer and Sworn Enemy, it was a make-up date for a show that was initially scheduled to take place on March 14, 2020, but was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this show, Phil Demmel (formerly of Machine Head and Vio-lence) filled in for guitarist Dave Linsk, who was unable to perform. Demmel once again filled in for him during the band&#x27;s spring 2022 tour with Prong.

On December 9, 2022, the band debuted a new song titled &quot;Wicked Place&quot; during their performance at the Ruhrpott Metal Meeting festival in Oberhausen from their then-upcoming 20th studio album. The resulting album, &quot;Scorched&quot;, was released on April 14, 2023. In support of the album, Overkill embarked on a headlining European and U.S. tour with Exhorder and Heathen. The band performed at the parking lot of the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on August 6, 2023, the same day Metallica played at the venue as part of the latter&#x27;s M72 World Tour. Overkill continued to tour in support of &quot;Scorched&quot; with a tour over Latin America in April 2024, where former Megadeth bassist David Ellefson filled in for Verni, who was unable to perform due to recovery from shoulder surgery. Verni played his first show back with Overkill at the Milwaukee Metal Fest on May 17, 2024.

Several months after the release of &quot;Scorched&quot;, guitarist Derek Tailer said that Overkill would begin work on their 21st studio album after the conclusion of the &quot;Scorched&quot; tour in 2024 for a tentative 2025 release.

===Jeramie Kling-era and upcoming 21st studio album (2024–present)===
On August 5, 2024, Bittner announced that he was leaving Overkill to focus on both Shadows Fall and Category 7. Later that month, it was revealed that Jeramie Kling was the band&#x27;s new drummer, and he played his first show with Overkill on August 30, at the Posada Rock festival in Câmpulung Muscel, Romania. During the band&#x27;s summer and fall 2024 European tour, former Kreator bassist Christian &quot;Speesy&quot; Giesler filled in for Verni, who was unable to perform due to an ongoing &quot;shoulder issue&quot;. Overkill (along with Night Demon) supported King Diamond on their Saint Lucifer&#x27;s Hospital 1920 tour in North America from October to December 2024, which saw former Fear Factory and Vio-lence bassist Christian Olde Wolbers fill in for Verni. Also on this tour, the band performed as a four-piece for the first time in years, with guitarist Derek Tailer sitting out for one show, due to an illness.

When asked in September 2024 when Overkill was going to begin work on their 21st studio album, Ellsworth said, &quot;We&#x27;re looking at, I suppose, the majority of the first half of 2025 as being that timeframe for the writing. And probably recording by the end of 2025 and then releasing in 2026.&quot;

==Legacy and style==
Overkill&#x27;s beginnings predate the formation of all of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal bands (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer) by at least one year. Though Overkill was known for its fast and heavy style, their music lacked enough variety to rival the &quot;Big Four&quot;, Regardless, Overkill maintained its unique sound throughout its career instead of trying to gain popularity with a more commercial style. Overkill has been viewed as one of the most important thrash bands from the East Coast, and they are considered to be one of the most active bands of the genre, having never disbanded or gone on hiatus, nor taken more than four years to release a new album.

Along with Exodus and Testament, Overkill has been the subject of which thrash metal band should be included in an expanded &quot;Big Four&quot;. Asked in September 2014 about the idea of either Overkill, Exodus or Testament being included in the &quot;Big Five&quot; of thrash metal, frontman Bobby Ellsworth replied, &quot;Aw man, that&#x27;s gonna put me in a corner! We measure our success in days, not dollars! But maybe you can find the answer in what I&#x27;m going to say. When [playing thrash metal] became harder in the &#x27;90s with grunge music, we never had a question about if we would stop doing it and go work for our moms and dads or something. We just needed to make it happen. We weren&#x27;t going to let grunge stop us. And if it did, we&#x27;d just go back to the underground. I liked it there anyway!&quot; Commenting on the fact that Overkill did not become part of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, Ellsworth stated, &quot;When it comes to being selected and not selected, that&#x27;s a simple accounting issue. When you talk numbers, numbers make the world go around, numbers put food on your table, and numbers put the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; in arenas. And they sell enough records to do that. For me, it&#x27;s not a concern. To even be asked the question from you is quite a compliment with regard to, let&#x27;s say, our longevity or tenacity doing what we like doing. But this is quite simply an accounting issue. He who sells the most gets the pole positions.&quot;

Overkill&#x27;s sound has influenced the genre of thrash metal. Their technique draws on bits and pieces of punk and hard rock as well as the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM). These elements blend to create a fast, aggressive style unique to the band and make Overkill&#x27;s sound easily recognizable to metal fans; as a result, they have been referred to as &quot;the Motörhead of thrash metal.&quot; The band has been influenced by a variety of music, including heavy metal, hard rock, progressive rock and classic rock acts such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Accept, Judas Priest, the Who, Aerosmith, Rush, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Queen, UFO, Jethro Tull, Motörhead, Saxon, Venom, Ted Nugent, Humble Pie, Rainbow, Manowar, Wishbone Ash and Starz, as well as punk rock and glam rock acts such as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Damned, the New York Dolls, Lou Reed, the Vibrators, Generation X and the Dead Boys.

Overkill has been cited as an influence by Pantera, Sepultura and Slipknot, as well as bands from the so-called &quot;thrash metal revival&quot; scene of the 2000s, including Evile, Havok and Mantic Ritual, the latter of whom incorporates a variety of stylistic traits reminiscent of Overkill and other thrash bands that had found success in the past. The band has also been cited as an influence on the groove metal genre; Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell had cited Bobby Gustafson&#x27;s performance on the albums &quot;Under the Influence&quot; and &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; as the source of inspiration for the band&#x27;s transition from glam metal to thrash/groove metal, as well as &quot;The Years of Decay&quot; producer Terry Date&#x27;s production for Pantera&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;.

<doc id="73634" wikidata="Q180159" url="?curid=73634" title="Glossary of mathematical symbols">
<text>A mathematical symbol is a figure or a combination of figures that is used to represent a mathematical object, an action on mathematical objects, a relation between mathematical objects, or for structuring the other symbols that occur in a formula. As formulas are entirely constituted with symbols of various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all mathematics.

The most basic symbols are the decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the letters of the Latin alphabet. The decimal digits are used for representing numbers through the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. Historically, upper-case letters were used for representing points in geometry, and lower-case letters were used for variables and constants. Letters are used for representing many other types of mathematical object. As the number of these types has increased, the Greek alphabet and some Hebrew letters have also come to be used. For more symbols, other typefaces are also used, mainly boldface , script typeface formula_1 (the lower-case script face is rarely used because of the possible confusion with the standard face), German fraktur , and blackboard bold (the other letters are rarely used in this face, or their use is unconventional). It is commonplace to use alphabets, fonts and typefaces to group symbols by type. 

The use of specific Latin and Greek letters as symbols for denoting mathematical objects is not described in this article. For such uses, see &quot;Variable § Conventional variable names&quot; and &quot;List of mathematical constants&quot;. However, some symbols that are described here have the same shape as the letter from which they are derived, such as formula_2 and formula_3.

These letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography; others by deforming letter forms, as in the cases of formula_4 and formula_5. Others, such as and , were specially designed for mathematics.

== Layout of this article ==

* Normally, entries of a glossary are structured by topics and sorted alphabetically. This is not possible here, as there is no natural order on symbols, and many symbols are used in different parts of mathematics with different meanings, often completely unrelated. Therefore, some arbitrary choices had to be made, which are summarized below.
* The article is split into sections that are sorted by an increasing level of technicality. That is, the first sections contain the symbols that are encountered in most mathematical texts, and that are supposed to be known even by beginners. On the other hand, the last sections contain symbols that are specific to some area of mathematics and are ignored outside these areas. However, the long section on brackets has been placed near to the end, although most of its entries are elementary: this makes it easier to search for a symbol entry by scrolling.
* Most symbols have multiple meanings that are generally distinguished either by the area of mathematics where they are used or by their &quot;syntax&quot;, that is, by their position inside a formula and the nature of the other parts of the formula that are close to them.
* As readers may not be aware of the area of mathematics to which the symbol that they are looking for is related, the different meanings of a symbol are grouped in the section corresponding to their most common meaning.
* When the meaning depends on the syntax, a symbol may have different entries depending on the syntax. For summarizing the syntax in the entry name, the symbol formula_6 is used for representing the neighboring parts of a formula that contains the symbol. See for examples of use.
* Most symbols have two printed versions. They can be displayed as Unicode characters, or in LaTeX format. With the Unicode version, using search engines and copy-pasting are easier. On the other hand, the LaTeX rendering is often much better (more aesthetic), and is generally considered a standard in mathematics. Therefore, in this article, the Unicode version of the symbols is used (when possible) for labelling their entry, and the LaTeX version is used in their description. So, for finding how to type a symbol in LaTeX, it suffices to look at the source of the article.
* For most symbols, the entry name is the corresponding Unicode symbol. So, for searching the entry of a symbol, it suffices to type or copy the Unicode symbol into the search textbox. Similarly, when possible, the entry name of a symbol is also an , which allows linking easily from another Wikipedia article. When an entry name contains special characters such as [,], and |, there is also an anchor, but one has to look at the article source to know it.
* Finally, when there is an article on the symbol itself (not its mathematical meaning), it is linked to in the entry name.

{=}}E,&lt;/math&gt; formula_7 and formula_8 are each an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;let formula_9&quot;, where is an expression and is a variable.
This is similar to the concept of assignment in computer science, which is variously denoted (depending on the programming language used) formula_10}}









== Comparison ==








 


== Set theory ==




















== Basic logic ==
Several logical symbols are widely used in all mathematics, and are listed here. For symbols that are used only in mathematical logic, or are rarely used, see &quot;List of logic symbols&quot;.


















== Blackboard bold ==

The blackboard bold typeface is widely used for denoting the basic number systems. These systems are often also denoted by the corresponding uppercase bold letter. A clear advantage of blackboard bold is that these symbols cannot be confused with anything else. This allows using them in any area of mathematics, without having to recall their definition. For example, if one encounters formula_11 in combinatorics, one should immediately know that this denotes the real numbers, although combinatorics does not study the real numbers (but it uses them for many proofs).












== Calculus ==

 or the covariant derivative.

(Capital Greek letter delta—not to be confused with formula_12, which may denote a geometric triangle or, alternatively, the symmetric difference of two sets.)


(Note: the notation formula_6 is not recommended for the four-gradient since both formula_6 and formula_15 are used to denote the d&#x27;Alembertian; see below.)

== Linear and multilinear algebra ==

 

&lt;/math&gt;.}}







== Advanced group theory ==
 



== Infinite numbers ==








== Brackets ==
Many types of bracket are used in mathematics. Their meanings depend not only on their shapes, but also on the nature and the arrangement of what is delimited by them, and sometimes what appears between or before them. For this reason, in the entry titles, the symbol is used as a placeholder for schematizing the syntax that underlies the meaning.

=== Parentheses ===










=== Square brackets ===









=== Braces ===







=== Other brackets ===
















== Symbols that do not belong to formulas ==
In this section, the symbols that are listed are used as some sorts of punctuation marks in mathematical reasoning, or as abbreviations of natural language phrases. They are generally not used inside a formula. Some were used in classical logic for indicating the logical dependence between sentences written in plain language. Except for the first two, they are normally not used in printed mathematical texts since, for readability, it is generally recommended to have at least one word between two formulas. However, they are still used on a black board for indicating relationships between formulas.







== Miscellaneous ==








(P\parallel Q)}&lt;/math&gt;, denotes a statistical distance or measure of how one probability distribution P is different from a second, reference probability distribution Q.}}

==Politics==
Prior to the Civil Rights Act, Okeechobee County followed the Solid South pattern of voting Democratic, making an exception in 1928 amidst Southern skepticism to Democrat Al Smith&#x27;s Northern Catholicism. The only non-Republicans to carry Okeechobee County at the presidential level after John F. Kennedy in 1960 were Independent segregationist George Wallace of Alabama (which borders Florida) in 1968 as well as Southern Democrats Jimmy Carter of Georgia (another neighboring state of Florida; 1976 and 1980) and Bill Clinton of Arkansas (1992 and 1996).

Today, Okeechobee County — in line with other Florida Heartland counties — is a rock-ribbed Republican stronghold, with the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the county being Clinton in 1996, the last to be competitive in the county being Al Gore in 2000 (who lost the county by less than 5%), the last to win at least 40% of the county vote being John Kerry in 2004, and the last to win so much as 30% of the vote being Barack Obama in 2012.

<doc id="73637" wikidata="Q51800" url="?curid=73637" title="Grand Moff Tarkin">
<text>Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He was introduced in the original 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film as one of the two main antagonists, alongside Darth Vader, and the commander of the Death Star, a gigantic spherical space station built by the Galactic Empire, equipped with an immensely powerful superlaser capable of obliterating entire planets. Tarkin is portrayed by Peter Cushing in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Tarkin also appears in the films &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;Rogue One&quot;, and in the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;Rebels&quot;, and &quot;The Bad Batch&quot;. He is featured in the 2014 novel &quot;Tarkin&quot;, which details his backstory and his rise to power within the Empire. In 2006, the entertainment website &quot;IGN&quot; called Tarkin &quot;one of the most formidable villains&quot; in &quot;Star Wars&quot; history.

==Creation and portrayal==
Tarkin&#x27;s character was originally conceived as a holy man from the planet Aquila, but was changed to an antagonist. As the Emperor would not appear until later in the original trilogy, Lucas used Tarkin&#x27;s final version as the &quot;main villain&quot; of the first film, a personification of the Empire. According to a book created to help promote the original film to prospective theaters, he aspires to become the Emperor.

Cushing admitted many years later to not knowing what a &quot;Grand Moff&quot; actually was, joking that it sounded like &quot;something which infests a clothes closet&quot; and characterizing Tarkin as a &quot;deeply cross and unpleasant gentleman&quot;.

In the 2005 prequel film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Wayne Pygram was able to achieve the likeness of a young version of Tarkin through the use of prosthetic makeup. For his performance as Tarkin in the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, the voice actor Stephen Stanton researched Cushing&#x27;s performances and then tried to imitate what Cushing might have sounded like in his mid-thirties and soften his voice to portray a level of humanity.

In the 2016 film &quot;Rogue One&quot;, archival footage and a digital scan of Peter Cushing&#x27;s life mask made for the 1984 film &quot;Top Secret!&quot; were used to create a 3D CGI mask which was augmented and mapped to actor Guy Henry&#x27;s face. Henry had studied Cushing&#x27;s mannerisms many years previously for the lead role in British TV show &quot;Young Sherlock&quot;, but insisted on a screen test as he was not comfortable that his vocal imitation was accurate, stating he sounded more &quot;Peter O&#x27;Toole than Peter Cushing&quot;. The ILM team searched through hours of footage to find suitable material of Cushing to build from. The footage from &quot;A New Hope&quot; was lit very differently to the lighting used in &quot;Rogue One&quot; and had to be digitally changed. The more they manipulated the lighting to match the other actors in the scenes the less like Cushing the character model looked, which meant creating a balancing act between &quot;a digital figure&quot; and &quot;one who looked precisely like Cushing&quot;. The owners of Cushing&#x27;s estate were heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to small and subtle adjustments. The result, which has been called &quot;one of the most complex and costly CGI re-creations ever&quot;, received a mixed response, with questions being raised about the morality of using a dead actor&#x27;s likeness.

==Appearances==

===Film===

====&quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977)====
Introduced in the first film in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, Governor Tarkin is the Grand Moff of the Galactic Empire and commander of the Death Star. After Emperor Palpatine dissolves the Imperial Senate, Tarkin and Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) are charged with pursuing and destroying the Rebel Alliance. He threatens Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) with the destruction of her home planet, Alderaan, if Leia does not reveal the location of the Rebel main base of operations. When Leia names the planet Dantooine as the base&#x27;s location, he destroys Alderaan regardless, hoping to make an example out of the planet&#x27;s support of the Rebellion. Upon learning that Leia&#x27;s coerced information was false, Tarkin orders Leia&#x27;s execution.

He allows the Rebels to escape the Death Star with Leia after placing a tracking beacon on the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; in order to find the Rebel base. He orders the Death Star to destroy the Rebel base on Yavin 4. In the film&#x27;s climax, Tarkin refuses to believe that the Death Star is in danger from the Rebel starfighter attack; as a result, he refuses to evacuate. He is subsequently killed by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who succeeds in destroying the Death Star by firing torpedoes into the exhaust port. Tarkin is last seen deep in thought seconds before the Death Star explodes.

====&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005)====
At the end of &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the final film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy, a younger version of Tarkin, played by Wayne Pygram, makes a cameo appearance overseeing the original Death Star&#x27;s construction, standing beside Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) and Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).

====&quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016)====
In the film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (which takes place just a week before the events in &quot;A New Hope&quot;), Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn), Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military, meets with Tarkin, who expresses his skepticism about Krennic&#x27;s management of the Death Star project. Tarkin oversees the Death Star&#x27;s first attack on the Rebellion when it is used to destroy the Holy City of the planet Jedha. Impressed, he congratulates Krennic before announcing that he is going to take command of the Death Star from that point on, pointing out security breaches that had occurred under Krennic&#x27;s command (much to Krennic&#x27;s chagrin). Later in the film, Tarkin is informed of a Rebel attack on Scarif, the planet where the plans to the Death Star are kept. He orders the jump to hyperspace to the planet, where an ongoing battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance rages. Tarkin has the Death Star target and destroy the Scarif base, killing Krennic, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), and any other survivor of the ground battle.

===Television series===

====&quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2010–2013)====
In the animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, set during the events of the prequel trilogy, a younger Tarkin (voiced by Stephen Stanton) is depicted as a Captain and later an Admiral in the Galactic Republic Navy.

In the third season, Captain Tarkin and Jedi Master Even Piell (Blair Bess) are ambushed and attacked by Separatist forces. Prisoners to the Citadel, Tarkin and Piell are freed from captivity by a rescue team. Initially pessimistic about being in enemy territory, Tarkin puts himself at odds with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter), but their respective opinions of each other improve when each realizes that both know Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian Abercrombie). During a skirmish, Tarkin fights and attempts to execute Citadel Warden Osi Sobeck (James Arnold Taylor), but fails when Sobeck swiftly retaliates and nearly kills him. However, Tarkin is rescued just in time by Anakin&#x27;s Padawan Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein).

In the fifth season, Tarkin, now an admiral, suspects Ahsoka of masterminding a terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple, and attempts to have the Padawan arrested. After Ahsoka is recaptured, Tarkin requests that the Jedi Order expel her and turn her over to the Republic so she can receive more &quot;impartial&quot; judgement. The Jedi concede and Ahsoka is tried before a jury of senators, with Tarkin heading the prosecution while Padmé Amidala (Catherine Taber) heads the defense. Despite Padmé&#x27;s impressive defense, Tarkin casts doubt by mentioning that Ahsoka had been seen with Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress (Nika Futterman). After Tarkin and Padmé&#x27;s arguments conclude and the jury reaches a verdict that Palpatine is about to read, Anakin arrives with Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger), the real mastermind of the attack.

====&quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2014–2018)====
In the television series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Tarkin (voiced once again by Stanton) starts off as Governor of the Outer Rim territories, including Lothal, but eventually receives his Grand Moff title. He visits the planet Lothal to deal with its growing Rebel activity, and reprimands Minister Maketh Tua (Kath Soucie), Agent Kallus (David Oyelowo), and the Inquisitor for their repeated failures to stop the planet&#x27;s Rebel cell. Tarkin has the Inquisitor execute Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint (both David Shaughnessy) for their inability to deal with the cell&#x27;s leader, Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Later, Tarkin sets a trap for the Rebels and manages to capture Kanan during their mission to send a message through one of the planet&#x27;s communication towers. The Rebels&#x27; message gets sent out, but Tarkin then orders the tower to be destroyed. Kanan is tortured by the Inquisitor and transported to the Mustafar system aboard Tarkin&#x27;s Star Destroyer. During Kanan&#x27;s rescue by Rebel forces, Tarkin&#x27;s Star Destroyer is destroyed, and the Inquisitor is killed. On Lothal, Tarkin introduces Agent Kallus to Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).

Taking the loss of his Star Destroyer personally, Tarkin orders that Maketh Tua be brought before him for her failure to find the Lothal rebels. Knowing the true meaning behind the summoning after the deaths of Aresko and Grint, Tua attempts to defect to the rebellion, but she is killed by Vader and Kallus before she can leave Lothal. Tarkin later appears in the season three premiere where he meets with Governor Pryce (Mary Elizabeth Glynn) regarding the Lothal Rebels. He subsequently grants her request for use of the Seventh Fleet, commanded by Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen). Tarkin appears via hologram in the season three finale, being briefed on Thrawn&#x27;s imminent attack on Atollon to stymie a coordinated Rebel attack on Lothal. Towards the end of season four, he warns Thrawn that he must prove the worth of his TIE Defender program, Thrawn&#x27;s prototype design of a new Imperial Star Fighter, or it will be shut down in favor of diverting resources to Krennic&#x27;s &quot;Stardust project&quot; - which would eventually become the Death Star.

====&quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot; (2021–2024)====
Tarkin (voiced again by Stanton) appears in the Disney+ series &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot;, set between the events of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; and &quot;Rebels&quot;. In the premiere episode, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, Admiral Tarkin arrives on Kamino to discuss with Prime Minister Lama Su if the Empire should continue to produce clone troopers, noting that conscripted soldiers would be less expensive. He later evaluates Clone Force 99, a group of genetically enhanced clone troopers also known as the Bad Batch, through a battle simulation. While impressed by their extraordinary skills, he also notices disobedience in them. He then dispatches them to the planet of Onderon to eliminate a group of refugees led by Saw Gerrera, as a test of their loyalty. When the Bad Batch disobeys orders, Tarkin has them arrested, but separates Bad Batch member Crosshair from the others after noticing that he is more loyal to the Empire. Tarkin has Kaminoan scientist Nala Se intensify the programming of Crosshair&#x27;s inhibitor chip, turning him against his teammates, who escape Kamino.

Tarkin is later promoted to Governor, and in the episode &quot;Replacements&quot;, he puts Crosshair in charge of an &quot;elite squad&quot; of recruited soldiers, who are then sent to finish the mission the Bad Batch had abandoned. After the mission is successful, Tarkin sees potential for conscripts. In the episode &quot;Return to Kamino&quot;, after most Imperial personnel are evacuated from Kamino, Tarkin orders Vice Admiral Rampart to destroy all settlements on the planet, wiping out most of the Kaminoan race.

In the series finale episode &quot;The Cavalry Has Arrived&quot;, he went with Captain Bragg and the stormtroopers to find Dr. Royce Hemlock&#x27;s base destroyed.

===Novels===
Tarkin appears in &quot;&quot;, the prequel novel to &quot;Rogue One&quot;, where Tarkin forms a rivalry with Advanced Weapons Director Orson Krennic.

====&quot;Tarkin&quot; (2014)====
&quot;Star Wars: Tarkin&quot; explores the title character&#x27;s origins, and chronicles how he meets and aligns himself with Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader prior to the events of &quot;A New Hope&quot;. The novel was one of the first four canon novels to be released in 2014 and 2015. Tarkin&#x27;s Star Destroyer, the &quot;Executrix&quot;, is introduced; it later appears in &quot;Rogue One&quot;. In the novel, he advocates for the Tarkin Doctrine, a military system based on &quot;the threat of force, rather than force itself&quot;. His philosophy becomes central to Imperial policy and earns him the position as the first Grand Moff in the Empire. (In the Galactic Empire, a &quot;Moff&quot; is the governor of a Sector, or subdivision of the Empire; a &quot;Grand Moff&quot; is the governor of an Oversector, a grouping of several Sectors.)

====&quot;From a Certain Point of View&quot; (2017)====
In Glen Weldon&#x27;s short story &quot;Of MSE-6 and Men&quot;, featured in the anthology &quot;From a Certain Point of View&quot;, Tarkin is revealed to have been sleeping with the stormtrooper TK-421 during the events of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, after capturing Leia Organa, but before his armour was stolen by Luke Skywalker in order to rescue Organa.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===
With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe material produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

In &quot;Legends&quot;, Tarkin appears in several novels, including &quot;Death Star, Cloak of Deception, Rogue Planet&quot; and &quot;Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader&quot;. The original Marvel &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic series features a powerful superweapon called &quot;The Tarkin&quot; after the late Grand Moff. His protegee and lover, Natasi Daala, is later featured as a frequent antagonist in novels set after his death.

West End Games&#x27; roleplaying material describes the &quot;Tarkin Doctrine&quot;, which emphasizes ruling &quot;through the fear of force, rather than force itself&quot;, and has been mentioned various other times in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon. He is also mentioned during the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; novel series as having been present on Zonama Sekot with Anakin Skywalker. In the comics series &quot;Darth Vader and the Lost Command&quot;, Tarkin is seen telling Vader of a missing convoy of Imperial craft and adds that his own son was in command of the convoy and is also missing.

<doc id="73638" wikidata="Q469555" url="?curid=73638" title="Quercus alba">
<text>Quercus alba, the white oak, is one of the preeminent hardwoods of eastern and central North America. It is a long-lived oak, native to eastern and central North America and found from Minnesota, Ontario, Quebec, and southern Maine south as far as northern Florida and eastern Texas. Specimens have been documented to be over 450 years old.

Although called a white oak, it is very unusual to find an individual specimen with white bark; the usual colour is a light gray. The name comes from the colour of the finished wood. In the forest it can reach a magnificent height and in the open it develops into a massive broad-topped tree with large branches striking out at wide angles.

== Description ==
&quot;Quercus alba&quot; typically reaches heights of at maturity, and its canopy can become quite massive as its lower branches are apt to extend far out laterally, parallel to the ground. Trees growing in a forest will become much taller than ones in an open area which develop to be short and massive. The Mingo Oak was the tallest known white oak at over two hundred feet with a trunk height of before it was felled in 1938. It is not unusual for the crown spread of a white oak tree to be as wide as it is tall, but specimens growing at high altitudes may only become small shrubs. 
The bark is a light ash-gray and peels somewhat from the top, bottom and/or sides. According to Chris Bolgiano in &quot;The Appalachian Forest: A Search for Roots and Renewal&quot;, the largest tree ever cut in West Virginia was a white oak that measured thirteen feet thick at its base.
White oak may live 200 to 300 years, with some even older specimens known. The Wye Oak in Wye Mills, Maryland was estimated to be over 450 years old when it finally fell in a thunderstorm in 2002.

Another noted white oak was the Basking Ridge white oak in New Jersey, estimated to have been over 600 years old when it died in 2016. The tree measured in circumference at the base and in circumference above the ground. The tree was tall, and its branches spread over from tip to tip. The oak, claimed to be the oldest in the United States, began showing signs of poor health in the mid-2010s. The tree was taken down in 2017.

Sexual maturity begins at around 20 years, but the tree does not produce large crops of acorns until its 50th year and the amount varies from year to year. Acorns deteriorate quickly after ripening, the germination rate being only 10% for six-month-old seeds. As the acorns are prime food for insects and other animals, all may be consumed in years of small crops, leaving none that would become new trees. The acorns are usually sessile, and grow to in length, falling in early October.

In spring, the young leaves are delicate, silvery pink, and covered with a soft blanket-like down. The petioles are short, and the clustered leaves close to the ends of the shoots are pale green and downy, resulting in the entire tree having a misty, frosty look. This condition continues for several days, passing through the opalescent changes of soft pink, silvery white, and finally, yellow green.
The leaves grow to be long and wide and have a deep glossy green upper surface. They usually turn red or brown in autumn, but depending on climate, site, and individual tree genetics, some trees are nearly always red, or even purple in autumn. Some dead leaves may remain on the tree throughout winter until very early spring. The lobes can be shallow, extending less than halfway to the midrib, or deep and somewhat branching.

&quot;Quercus alba&quot; is sometimes confused with the swamp white oak, a closely related species, and the bur oak. The white oak hybridizes freely with the bur oak, the post oak, and the chestnut oak.

;Detailed description
* Bark: Light gray, varying to dark gray and to white; shallow, fissured and scaly. Branchlets start out as bright green, later turn reddish-green, and finally, light gray. A distinguishing feature of this tree is that a little over halfway up the trunk, the bark tends to form overlapping scales that are easily noticed and aid in identification.
* Wood: Light brown with paler sapwood; strong, tough, heavy, fine-grained and durable. Specific gravity, 0.7470; weight of one cubic foot, 46.35 lbs; weight of one cubic meter 770 kg.
* Winter buds: Reddish brown, obtuse, long.
* Leaves: Alternate, long, wide. Obovate or oblong, seven to nine-lobed, usually seven-lobed with rounded lobes and rounded sinuses; lobes destitute of bristles; sinuses sometimes deep, sometimes shallow. On young trees the leaves are often repand. They come out of the bud conduplicate, are bright red above, pale below, and covered with white tomentum. The reddish hue fades in a week or less, and they become silvery greenish, white, and shiny; when mature, they are thin, bright yellow-green, shiny or dull above, pale, glaucous or smooth below; the midrib is stout and yellow, primary veins are conspicuous. In late autumn the leaves turn a deep red and drop, or on young trees, remain on the branches throughout winter. Petioles are short, stout, grooved, and flattened. Stipules are linear and caducous.
* Flowers: Appear in May when leaves are one-third grown. Staminate flowers are borne in hairy aments long; the calyx is bright yellow, hairy, and six to eight-lobed with lobes shorter than the stamens; anthers are yellow. Pistillate flowers are borne on short peduncles; involucral scales are hairy and reddish; calyx lobes are acute; stigmas are bright red.
* Acorns: Annual, sessile or stalked; nut ovoid or oblong, round at apex, light brown, shiny, long; cap is cup-shaped, encloses about one-fourth of the nut, tomentose on the outside, tuberculate at base, scales with short obtuse tips becoming smaller and thinner toward the rim. White Oak acorns (referring to &quot;Q. alba&quot; and all its close relatives) have no epigeal dormancy and germination begins readily without any treatment. In most cases, the oak root sprouts in the fall, with the leaves and stem appearing the next spring. The acorns take only one growing season to develop unlike the red oak group, which require two years for maturation.

=== Chemistry ===
Grandinin/roburin E, castalagin/vescalagin, gallic acid, monogalloyl glucose (glucogallin) and valoneic acid dilactone, monogalloyl glucose, digalloyl glucose, trigalloyl glucose, ellagic acid rhamnose, quercitrin and ellagic acid are phenolic compounds found in &quot;Q. alba&quot;.

The haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale genome of Q. alba was published in 2025.

== Distribution ==

&quot;Quercus alba&quot; is fairly tolerant of a variety of habitats, and may be found on ridges, in valleys, and in between, in dry and moist habitats, and in moderately acid and alkaline soils. It is mainly a lowland tree, but reaches altitudes of 1,600 m (5,249 ft) in the Appalachian Mountains. It is often a component of the forest canopy in an oak-heath forest.

Frequent fires in the Central Plains region of the United States prevented oak forests, including &quot;Q. alba&quot;, from expanding into the Midwest. However, a decrease in the frequency of these natural fires after European settlement caused rapid expansion of oak forests into the Great Plains, negatively affecting the natural prairie vegetation.

== Uses ==
=== Cultivation ===
&quot;Quercus alba&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree somewhat infrequently due to its slow growth and ultimately huge size. It is not tolerant of urban pollution and road salt and due to its large taproot, is unsuited for a street tree or parking strips/islands.

=== Food ===
The acorns are much less bitter than the acorns of red oaks. They can be eaten by humans but, if bitter, may need to have the tannins leached. They are also a valuable wildlife food, notably for turkeys, wood ducks, pheasants, grackles, jays, nuthatches, thrushes, woodpeckers, rabbits, squirrels, and deer. The white oak is the only known food plant of the &quot;Bucculatrix luteella&quot; and &quot;Bucculatrix ochrisuffusa&quot; caterpillars.

The young shoots of many eastern oak species are readily eaten by deer. Dried oak leaves are also occasionally eaten by white-tailed deer in the fall or winter. Rabbits often browse twigs and can girdle stems.

=== Woodcraft ===
White oak has tyloses that give the wood a closed cellular structure, making it water- and rot-resistant. Because of this characteristic, white oak is used by coopers to make wine and whiskey barrels as the wood resists leaking. It has also been used in construction, shipbuilding, agricultural implements and in the interior finishing of houses. White oak splints have been used historically by Native Americans for basketry.

White oak logs feature prominent medullary rays which produce a distinctive, decorative ray and fleck pattern when the wood is quarter sawn. Quarter sawn white oak was a signature wood used in mission style oak furniture by Gustav Stickley in the Craftsman style of the Arts and Crafts movement.

White oak is used extensively in Japanese martial arts for some weapons, such as the bokken and jo. It is valued for its density, strength, resiliency and relatively low chance of splintering if broken by impact, relative to the substantially cheaper red oak.

 is made of white oak and southern live oak, conferring additional resistance to cannon fire. Reconstructive wood replacement of white oak parts comes from a special grove of &quot;Quercus alba&quot; known as the &quot;&quot;Constitution&quot; Grove&quot; at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division.

=== Musical instruments ===
Deering Banjo Company have made several 5-string banjos using white oak - including members of the Vega series, the White Lotus, and the limited edition 40th anniversary model. White Oak has a mellower timbre than more traditionally used maple, and yet still has enough power and projection to not require a metal tone ring.

=== Oak barrels ===
Barrels made of American white oak are commonly used for oak aging of wine, in which the wood is noted for imparting strong flavors. Also, by federal regulation, bourbon whiskey must be aged in charred new oak (generally understood to mean specifically American white oak) barrels.

==Culture==
White oak has served as the official state tree of Illinois after selection by a vote of school children. There are two &quot;official&quot; white oaks serving as state trees, one located on the grounds of the governor&#x27;s mansion, and the other in a schoolyard in the town of Rochelle. The white oak is also the state tree of Connecticut and Maryland. The Wye Oak, probably the oldest living white oak until it fell because of a thunderstorm on June 6, 2002, was the honorary state tree of Maryland.

Being the subject of a legend as old as the colony itself, the Charter Oak of Hartford, Connecticut is one of the most famous white oaks in America. An image of the tree now adorns the reverse side of the Connecticut state quarter.

The white oak from the movie &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, known as the &quot;Shawshank tree&quot; and the &quot;Tree of Hope&quot;, was estimated to be more than 200 years old when it fell. The tree is seen during the last ten minutes of the movie. As the movie gained fame, the tree became popular as well, and used to attract tens of thousands of movie fans and tourists every year. A portion of the tree came down on July 29, 2011, when the tree was split by lightning during a storm. The remaining half of the tree fell during heavy winds just short of five years later, on July 22, 2016.

The Bedford Oak is a 500-year-old white oak tree that sits in the town of Bedford in New York. It is the mascot of the town. It sits at the corner of the Hook Road and the old Bedford Road (now Cantitoe Street). The ground the tree stands on was deeded to the Town of Bedford in 1942 by Harold Whitman in memory of his wife, Georgia Squires Whitman. It has seen Westchester history from Native American settlements to the Revolutionary War to modern times.

The video game &quot;Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth&quot; features a character named Quercus Alba who bears some resemblance to the white oak and plants in general.

== Threats to Oaks ==
Insects and the damage from insects account for the greatest amount of threat to acorn production from white oaks, particularly nut weevils, moth larvae, and gall forming cynipids.

<text>Orange County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the county had a population of 1,429,908, making it the fifth-most populous county in Florida and the 28th-most populous county in the United States. Its county seat is Orlando, which, along with it being the county&#x27;s largest city, is the core of the Orlando metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.67 million in 2020.

As of 2022, Orange County has a gross domestic product of $115 billion, the third-largest GDP of Florida&#x27;s 67 counties and the 27th-largest for the nation&#x27;s 3,033 counties. The county is a tourist, economic, and cultural hub for the Central Florida region. Popular destinations within the county include Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando, Icon Park, Kia Center, Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Orlando Museum of Art, and many other attractions. It is the home to the University of Central Florida (UCF), which as of Fall 2023 had a student population of 69,320, making it the fourth-largest on-campus student body of any public university in the United States. The county is home to other notable colleges, including Rollins College and Valencia College. Despite rapid development countywide, swaths of nature still do exist. There are many lakes within the county, most notable of such being Lake Apopka. Wekiwa Springs is a state park, that features natural springs, trails, and campsites.

==History==
The land that is Orange County was part of the first land to come up from below the Early Oligocene sea 33.9–28.4 million years ago and is known as Orange Island. Orange County&#x27;s Rock Spring location is a Pleistocene fossil-bearing area and has yielded a vast variety of birds and mammals including giant sloth, mammoth, camel, and the dire wolf dating around 1.1 million years ago.

===19th century to mid-20th century===

Immediately following the transfer of Florida from the Spanish to the United States in 1821, Governor Andrew Jackson created two counties: Escambia to the west of the Suwannee River and St. Johns to the east. In 1824, the area to the south of St. Johns County was organized as Mosquito County, and Enterprise was named its county seat. This large county took up much of central Florida. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized relocation of the Seminole people from Florida to Oklahoma. This resulted in pushback from the Seminole community, leading to the Second Seminole War. In 1845 when Florida finally became a state, the county was renamed Orange County. After the population increased in the region, the legislature organized several counties, such as Osceola (1887), Seminole (1913), Lake (1887), and Volusia (1854), from its territory.


Early on, the county greatly suffered, due to the Union blockade, but things greatly improved during Reconstruction. A boom in population, resulting from the incorporation of the Town of Orlando in 1875, greatly changed the demographics of the county. Orlando, establishing itself as a city in 1885, experienced rapid growth from 1875 to 1895, due to it becoming the hub of Florida&#x27;s citrus industry. The fruit that constituted the county&#x27;s main commodity crop, was the impetus to the aforementioned county&#x27;s renaming. The dark-green foliage of orange trees filled the county, as did the scent of the orange blossoms when in bloom. Fewer commercial orange groves remained by the end of the twentieth century. The majority of groves were destroyed by the freezing temperatures that occurred in December 1983, January 1985, and December 1989, the worst since 1899.

During the post-Reconstruction period, white people committed a high rate of racial violence against black people in Orange County; racial terrorism was used to re-establish and maintain white supremacy. Whites lynched 33 African Americans here from 1877 to 1950; most were killed in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. This was the highest total of any county in the state, and sixth highest of any county in the country. Florida had the highest per-capita rate of lynchings of any state in the South, where the great majority of these extrajudicial murders took place.

Among the terrorist lynchings was the death of Julius &quot;July&quot; Perry of Ocoee, whose body was found November 3, 1920, hanged from a lightpole in Orlando, near the house of a judge known to be sympathetic to black voting. But this was part of a much larger story of KKK and other white attempts to suppress black voting in Ocoee and the state. African Americans had organized for a year to increase voter turnout for the 1920 presidential election, with organizations helping prepare residents for voter registration, paying for poll taxes, and similar actions. On Election Day in Ocoee, blacks were turned away from the polls. Perry, a prosperous farmer, was suspected of sheltering Mose Norman, an African-American man who had tried to vote. After Norman was twice turned away, white violence broke out, resulting in a riot through the black community, leaving an estimated 50 to 60 African-Americans dead and all the properties destroyed. Many blacks fled from Ocoee to save their lives, and the town became all-white. Voting efforts were suppressed for decades.

===Later 20th century to present===

Economically destroyed at the turn of the century from the decimation of the citrus industry, many farmers walked away from the region. The freeze caused many farmers in central Florida to move to other warm climates, such as to the Caribbean or to California (such as the similarly named Orange County, California). Others awaited other opportunities. One of the region&#x27;s major land owners and growers was the Tropicana company. They withdrew rather than try to come back from these seemingly endless generational decimation. With no realistic avenues for agricultural use of this rural land, and Florida&#x27;s continuing strong population growth and its attendant needs (aided and supported by the success of nearby Walt Disney World and Universal Studios Florida), these areas began to be developed for housing and other industries, especially after World War II.

In 1962 Orlando Jetport was built. The predecessor of modern-day Orlando International Airport, it was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines (Delta Air Lines, National Airlines, Eastern Airlines, and Southern Airways) had begun providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, in which the airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO).

In 1965, Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World. The renowned resort opened in October 1971. This had a seismic impact to the region, resulting in an explosive growth in the county&#x27;s population and in its economy. The success of Disney World, allowed for other theme parks and entertainment attractions to open and thrive in the county, such as Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. The county now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.

In the 21st century, the county&#x27;s economy has since diversified. Despite the rapid development in the county, thanks to gentrification relics of the historic core of &quot;Old Orlando&quot; still reside in downtown Orlando (along Church Street, between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue), as well as within Orange County communities outside city limits, such as in Eatonville, Windermere, and Winter Park.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (10.0%) is water. Orange County is about above sea level. The county is bordered by Osceola County by the south, on the southwest by Polk County, on the west by Lake County, on the north by Seminole County, on the northeast by Volusia County, and on the east by Brevard County.

Most of the county lies in the Florida coastal lowlands, while the northwestern areas rise into the Florida Central Highlands. The population center of the county is in the central and western sections in the transition zone from coastal plain to highlands, whereas eastern sections in the coastal plain are more remote in population. Orange County was part of the first land to rise up below from below the Early Oligocene sea about 33.9–28.4 million years ago, also known as Orange Island.

The headwaters for the Kissimmee River, which forms the northern part of the Everglades, are located in the county. Boggy Creek rises from the Orlando International Airport at above sea level, which is the primary inflow for East Lake Tohopekaliga in nearby Osceola County. Other watersheds within the county include the Ocklawaha and Wekiva rivers, along with the Upper and Middle basins, which are all sub-watersheds within the extensive St. Johns watershed. Lake Apopka is located in the county, on the course of the Ocklawaha River, and is the fourth largest lake in the state of Florida. Wekiwa Springs State Park is a Florida State Park along the course of the Wekiva River.

Despite Orange County being landlocked in the center of the state, it is still relatively close to many beaches to the east on the Atlantic Ocean, with Cocoa Beach being the closest and a popular destination. The Gulf of Mexico is also relatively close, although a bit farther away, to the west, with many beaches like Clearwater Beach and St. Pete Beach also being popular destinations.

===Regions of Orange County===

Orange County is divided into six regions; the (central) Downtown area (with urban characteristics); the (southwestern) tourist strip (with a mixture of permanent dwellings, resorts, and hotels); a mixture of working-class, middle-class, and wealthier suburbs in the west (with some exurban characteristics); more historically established suburbs to the north (with inner-ring characteristics, attributed to the SunRail); a mixture of suburbs with more accessibly priced homes in the east (within the influence of University of Central Florida); and working-class neighborhoods and additional tourist attractions to the south (within the influence of nearby Kissimmee in neighboring Osceola County). Florida&#x27;s Turnpike is popularly regarded as a dividing line between northern areas catering more to permanent residents and southern areas catering more to tourists.

There are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits of Orlando, along with many municipalities and unincorporated areas throughout the county. Orlando&#x27;s city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits. Such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando. This also explains Orlando&#x27;s relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population. The city and county are working together in an effort to &quot;round-out&quot; the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits.

The center of government, commerce and culture in the county, is in Downtown Orlando, bordered by Marks Street in the north, Mills Avenue (SR 15) in the east, Orange Blossom Trail in the west, and Kaley Avenue in the south. Mostly composed of high-rise residential towers and office towers, 46 of the 79 high-rises in the Greater Orlando region are located in downtown. Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Kia Center, Lake Eola, Orlando Museum of Art, and other attractions are located in downtown, along with corporate offices for banks such as Wells Fargo, Seacoast, and Suntrust banks, and government building such as Orange County Courthouse and Orlando City Hall.

In the southern region of the county is the rapidly growing community of Lake Nona. Along with being home to Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club, it is also the health district for the city of Orlando, with Lake Nona Medical City. Featuring Nemours Children&#x27;s Hospital, University of Central Florida&#x27;s Health Sciences Campus, which includes the university&#x27;s College of Medicine, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Nursing, College of Dental Medicine, a teaching hospital, and other healthcare amenities.

The main tourist strip for the city is in the southwestern section of the county. International Drive, commonly known as I-Drive, is a major thoroughfare that traverses central and southern portions of unincorporated Orange County. An additional extension is known as International Drive South, partly located in the northern portion of Osceola County. Other major roads in this region include, Sand Lake Road, Kirkman Road, SR 536, and Universal Boulevard, which runs parallel to the midsection of International Drive. At its northern end, International Drive is home to Orlando International Premium Outlets and Universal Orlando resort, along with being in close proximity to the upcoming Epic Universe theme park (set to open in 2025). Further south on International Drive, it features the Orange County Convention Center, Dezerland Park mall, SeaWorld Orlando (along with Aquatica, SeaWorld&#x27;s water park), ICON Park (featuring its famous ferris wheel, Orlando Eye), the World&#x27;s Largest Entertainment McDonald&#x27;s, and other tourist ventures. This region is most known for being the location of Walt Disney World Resort, which covers nearly (of which half has been developed). The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (formerly the Reedy Creek Improvement District) is the governing jurisdiction and special taxing district for the land of Disney World, encompassing a large swath of in southern Orange county and northern Osceola County. It acts with most of the same authority and responsibility as a county government. It includes the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, as well as unincorporated land, within Orange County. Other communities in southwestern Orange County, which have primarily suburban and exurban characteristics, include Bay Hill, Dr. Phillips, Four Corners, Horizon West, MetroWest, Williamsburg, and Windermere.

Orange County communities due west of Downtown Orlando, which primarily have exurban characteristics, include Apoka, Gotha, Oakland, Ocoee, Pine Hills, Tildenville, and Winter Garden. Orange County communities due north of Downtown Orlando, which are primarily more well-established and that have suburban and urban characteristics, include Baldwin Park, Eatonville, Fairview Shores, Goldenrod, Lockhart, Maitland, and Winter Park. Orange County communities due east of Downtown Orlando, which primarily have suburban and rural characteristics, include Alafaya, Avalon Park, Azalea Park, Bithlo, Christmas, Union Park, and Wedgefield. The east side of the county is also the home of the University of Central Florida (UCF). Orange County communities due south of Downtown Orlando, which primarily have suburban characteristics, include Conway, Hunter&#x27;s Creek, Lake Nona, Meadow Woods, Oak Ridge, Southchase, and Taft.

The Florida Mall is located in unincorporated Orange County, and with a gross leasable area of it is one of the largest single-story malls in the United States and the largest mall in Central Florida. With over 250 stores and various dining options (including 25 quick-service restaurants and 8 sit-down restaurants), The Florida Mall attracts over 20 million visitors annually, including domestic and international tourists.

Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) is an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista. The complex includes four distinct areas: Marketplace, The Landing, Town Center, and West Side. Walt Disney Imagineers took inspiration from real coastal towns in Florida, such as St. Augustine and Coral Gables. Universal CityWalk in Orlando is the entertainment and retail district located adjacent to the theme parks of Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure at Universal Orlando.

Other regional shopping destinations in the county include Dezerland Park Orlando, Disney&#x27;s Flamingo Crossings, The Mall at Millenia, Orlando Fashion Square, Orlando International Premium Outlets, Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets, Waterford Lakes Town Center, West Oaks Mall, Winter Garden Village, and Winter Park Village.

===Sports===

Orange County hosts two major league professional sports teams: the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer (MLS). There are also minor league professional teams, such as the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL, the Orlando Predators of the National Arena League (NAL), and the Orlando Anarchy of the Women&#x27;s Football Alliance. The UCF Knights, the athletics teams of the University of Central Florida, compete in NCAA Division I.

The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a multi-purpose sports complex located at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake. The complex includes nine venues, hosting professional and amateur sporting events throughout the year.

The Atlanta Braves utilized the facilities for spring training from 1997 to 2019, along with the Tampa Bay Rays utilizing the complex in 2023 spring training, due to Charlotte Sports Park being heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian in the previous year.

The Arnold Palmer Invitational on the PGA Tour is played each March at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge, a private golf resort owned since 1974 by Arnold Palmer in the community of Bay Hill. Other notable golf clubs in the county are the Eagle Creek Golf Club, the Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club, and the Rio Pinar Country Club.

===Tourism and hospitality===

Tourism remains at the core of Orange County&#x27;s economy. Nicknamed the &#x27;Theme Park Capital of the World&#x27;, the county is home to Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld Orlando, among many other theme parks. As of 2022, with over 2.9 million visitors, Orlando was the third-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City and Miami. Orlando International Airport is the 7th-busiest airport in the United States and the 18th-busiest in the world. The county features 7 of the 10 most visited theme parks in North America (5 of the top 10 in the world), as well as the 4 most visited water parks in the U.S. The Walt Disney World resort is the area&#x27;s largest attraction. The resort is home to, the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon, Disney&#x27;s Blizzard Beach and Disney Springs. Universal Orlando encompasses Universal Studios Florida, Universal Islands of Adventure, Universal Volcano Bay and Universal CityWalk. SeaWorld Orlando is an animal theme park, featuring numerous marine wildlife displays, alongside an amusement park, Aquatica water park, and Discovery Cove. Other theme parks include Fun Spot Orlando, Icon Park, Madame Tussauds, and Sealife Aquarium.

Along with these tourist offerings, the county is also home to the corporate headquarters for these theme parks&#x27; operations. One of the two corporate headquarters for Disney Experiences is located in Lake Buena Vista (the other headquarters is located in Glendale, California). There were reportedly plans from Disney, that they were to expand more of their corporate presence in Orange County, with the transferring of DPEP positions over the next couple of years to a new 60-acre corporate campus in the Lake Nona area of the county, with as many as 90% of the transferred positions being Imagineering positions. However, the planned relocation was cancelled in May 2023 amidst the feud between Disney and Florida&#x27;s governor Ron DeSantis. United Parks &amp; Resorts (formerly SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. or SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment) is an American theme park and entertainment company, with corporate headquarters located in Orange County. Along with SeaWorld, United Parks &amp; Resorts is the parent company for the theme parks Adventure Island, Aquatica, Busch Gardens, Discovery Cove, Sesame Place, Water Country USA, and Worlds of Discovery.

As of July 2021, Westgate Resorts has 22 locations across the United States. Other major hospitality companies with a significant economic presence (both corporate and in its resort properties) within the county include:

*Hilton Grand Vacations Club
*Marriott Vacation Club International
*Ryman Hospitality Properties
*Travel + Leisure Co. (formerly part of Wyndham Worldwide)

The county functions under a charter form of government. The charter serves as a constitution, detailing the structure and operation of the local government. A Charter Review Commission has the power to consider and place amendments on the ballot. Voters then decide whether to accept or reject all amendments put forth. If voters approve an amendment, it is then inserted into the charter.

===County representation===

Orange County is served by a board of commissioners. The board consists of an elected mayor and six commissioners. The mayor is elected At-large, while commissioners are elected from single-member districts. The mayor and commissioners each serve staggered four-year terms. Commissioners from Districts 1, 3, and 5 are elected in presidential election years, while the mayor and commissioners from Districts 2, 4, and 6 are elected in alternate years. The county is also served by a clerk of courts, sheriff, property appraiser, tax collector, supervisor of elections, state attorney, and public defender. All positions are four-year terms, requiring direct election by voters in presidential election years.

==Politics==
Orange County is located along the pivotal Interstate 4 corridor, which until recently was a powerful swing region in what was one of the country&#x27;s most critical swing states. Many close elections were won or lost depending on the voting outcome along the corridor. Voters were considered independent, traditionally splitting their votes, electing Democrats and Republicans on the same ballot. As a result of such independence, voters were inundated with non-stop television and radio ads months preceding a general election.

Orange County was one of the first areas of Florida to turn Republican. It swung from a 15-point victory for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 to a seven-point victory for Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. It eventually became one of the stronger Republican bastions in Florida, as evidenced when it gave Barry Goldwater 56 percent of its vote in 1964. For most of the second half of the 20th century, it was one of the more conservative urban counties in Florida and the nation. From 1948 to 1988, Democrats only cracked the 40 percent barrier twice, in 1964 and 1976. However, the Republican edge narrowed considerably in the 1990s. George H. W. Bush fell from 67 percent of the vote in 1988 to only 45.9 percent in 1992. In 1996, Bob Dole only won the county by 520 votes.

In September 2000, Democrats overtook Republicans in voter registration. This was a factor in Al Gore becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county since 1944. John Kerry narrowly carried the county in 2004. In 2008, however, Orange County swung hard to Barack Obama, who won it by the largest margin for a Democrat since Roosevelt. In the years since, it has become one of the strongest Democratic bastions in Florida.

Since 2000, Republicans have yet to retake the advantage they once enjoyed. In the twelve years that followed, Democrats experienced a modest increase in their voter registration percentage from 41.40% to 42.73% of the electorate. Minor party voters also had modest growth, increasing from 2.17% to 2.37%. In contrast, Republicans experienced a sharp decrease in registered voters, sliding from 40.95% in 2000 down to 29.85% in 2012. The beneficiary of the Republican losses have been unaffiliated voters. The percentage of the electorate identifying as an unaffiliated voter increased from 15.47% to 25.06% during this same period. Orange County is one of two different counties in the entire nation to have voted for Al Gore in 2000 after voting for Dole in 1996, a distinction it shares with Charles County, Maryland.

However, Orange County went to Kamala Harris by just 13 points in 2024, the closest margin in Orange County since 2004. This made Orange County one of just six Florida counties to go for Harris as Donald Trump won the former swing state of Florida by 13 points. Florida is now considered a red state and presidential campaigns are unlikely to focus on the state in the future.

==Education==
===Public education===
The Orange County Public Schools deliver public education to students countywide. Its functions and expenditures are overseen by an elected school board composed of a chairman, elected at-large; and seven members, elected from single-member districts. Each member is elected to a four-year term: the chairman and three other members are elected in gubernatorial election years, while the other four are elected in presidential election years. As of the 2021–2022 school year, the school system operated 205 schools (127 elementary, 9 K-8, 39 middle, 22 high, and 8 exceptional learning), with 206,246 students. As of 2023, it is the 4th largest district statewide and eighth largest in the nation.

==Libraries==
Orange County is served by the Orange County Library System, which was established in 1923. Before the opening of the Albertson Public Library in 1923, a circulating library maintained by the Sorosis Club of Orlando offered book lending services to patrons on a subscription basis. The Albertson Public Library was established with the collection of Captain Charles L. Albertson and the library was named in his honor. In 1924, the Booker T. Washington Branch of the Albertson Library was established to service the African American community of Orlando. In 1966, the current Orlando Public Library building was completed on the grounds of the Albertson Public Library. Currently there are 16 libraries within the Orange County Library system. The library systems offers a diverse selection of materials, free programs and free access to various databases. In addition, the library offers free delivery of most items through its MAYL service.

One exception exists in the cities of Maitland and Winter Park which are each part of a separate library taxing districts and as a result residents of these cities are not entitled to receive resident borrowing privileges at OCLS branches even though they are technically and legally residents of Orange County, instead an agreement was reached between Maitland, Winter Park and the OCLS whereas a resident of those cities can go to any OCLS branch and request a &quot;Reciprocal borrower card&quot; which is provided free of charge. The Reciprocal borrower cards is valid for one year and can be used at any OCLS branch with the exception of the Melrose Center at the Orlando Public Library which requires a separate Melrose Center specific card which is issued after the user applies for the card and goes through a mandatory orientation class. Access to the OCLS Internet on library owned PCs requires a Reciprocal borrower to pay small session access fee. The OCLS Wi-Fi network which is available at all branches remains free of charge to all users including Reciprocal borrowers and visitors who use their own iPad, Mac, PC, Smartphone or tablet devices. Maitland and Winter Park Library do not provide reciprocal privileges to OCLS patrons and charge non-residents a yearly user fee.

<doc id="73641" wikidata="Q501067" url="?curid=73641" title="Osceola County, Florida">
<text>Osceola County ( ) is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 388,656. Its county seat is Kissimmee. Osceola County is included in the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Fla. Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Being 54.3% Hispanic, Osceola is one of three Hispanic-majority counties in Florida, owing to its large Puerto Rican American population. It also is the 12th-largest majority-Hispanic county in the nation.

==Etymology==
Osceola County is named for the Native American leader Osceola, whose name means &quot;Black Drink Cry [Asi Yaholo]&quot;.

==History==
Osceola County was created in 1887. On July 21, 1821, Florida was divided into two counties, named Escambia County to the west and St. John&#x27;s County to the east. In 1824, the southern part of St. John&#x27;s County became Mosquito County, with Enterprise as the county seat. In 1844, Brevard County was carved out from Mosquito County. When Florida became a state in 1845, Mosquito County was renamed Orange County. On May 12, 1887, Osceola was named a county, having been created from both Orange and Brevard Counties. Osceola County reached all the way down to Lake Okeechobee until 1917 when Okeechobee County was formed.

Since the late 20th century, Osceola County has experienced a significant influx of migrants from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the unincorporated territory of the United States, and in the 2000 U.S. Census Puerto Rican was the largest self-reported ancestry group.

==Government==
Osceola County is a charter county, and a subdivision within the State of Florida. Voters approved the County Charter in March 1992, and it took effect on October 1, 1992. The structure of County government under the charter does not depart dramatically from the structure of a County government outlined in the Florida Statutes.

Osceola County Government is governed by three sets of elected officials, each of which independently directs separate branches of County Government. These include: the five-member County Commission, five separate Constitutional Officers, and a number of Judicial Officers. Under State law, the County Commission is responsible for funding the budgets of all Osceola County Government, including the independently elected Constitutional Officers and Judicial Officers, as well as the Commission&#x27;s own departments. Each independent officer has discretion to administer his or her own programs. The County Commission exercises oversight only over its own departments.

Osceola County has five electoral districts each represented by a commissioner. All the commissioners compose the Board of Commissioners that appoint a County Manager. There also is a Commission Auditor and County Attorney.

==== History ====
Until 1989, there was no independent Osceola Library System. Instead, Osceola patrons were taken care of by Orange County Library System. Before that, there were two libraries, which are still named after the original independent libraries, run by women&#x27;s organizations: Veteran&#x27;s Memorial in Saint Cloud and Hart Memorial Library in Kissimmee.

In 1910, land for the Hart Memorial Library was donated by a widow of a former Florida Governor, Carrie S. Hart. It was located on North Stewart Avenue in Kissimmee . In 1914, women pooled money together from themselves and other community members to build the actual building and Annie Palmer Fell, another widow of a prominent Florida man, donated furnishings and books from her personal collection to begin building inventory in the new library. In 1968, the location moved to a 4,000 square foot building on Broadway and Dakin. Hart Memorial Library is the Osceola headquarters and is now located in a 43,000 square building .

Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Library was at first a reading room until enough funds were raised to build the first official location on Massachusetts Avenue in Saint Cloud. In the early 70&#x27;s the location moved to a former SunBank location on 10th Street and New York Avenue. In 1995, this branch moved for its final time to a larger building on Indiana Avenue and 13th street where it is still located today.

The first Poinciana Branch was opened in 1988. It was a modular building and consisted of a 14,000 book collection. This branch was eventually moved into a larger location with a collection of 40,000 books and computer access for patrons.

Osceola Library Systems began as an independent organization on April 1, 1989.

In 1990, the Buenaventura Library opened.

In 1991, volunteers helped open the Kenansville Branch Library in a shared space with the old Kenansville school. During the 2004 hurricanes, the collection was a total loss. It was rebuilt in 2007 with a larger collection, including books, DVDs, and computer/wifi access.

<doc id="73643" wikidata="Q483352" url="?curid=73643" title="Thrash metal">
<text>Thrash metal (or simply thrash) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall aggression and fast tempo. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead guitar work. 

The genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk and the technicality of progressive music. Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan era and the much more moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also developed concurrently in the 1980s. Derived genres include crossover thrash, a fusion of thrash metal and hardcore punk.

The early thrash metal movement revolved around independent record labels, including Megaforce, Metal Blade, Combat, Roadrunner, and Noise, and the underground tape trading industry in both Europe and North America. The genre was commercially successful from approximately 1985 through 1991, bringing prominence to Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, all grouped together as the &quot;Big Four&quot; of U.S. thrash metal. Other bands, such as Overkill, Metal Church, Nuclear Assault, Flotsam and Jetsam, and Bay Area acts Exodus, Testament and Death Angel, never achieved the same level of success as the &quot;Big Four&quot; but had also developed a strong following in the metal community, through MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; or otherwise. Some of the most popular international thrash metal bands from this era were Brazil&#x27;s Sepultura, Canada&#x27;s Voivod and Annihilator, Switzerland&#x27;s Coroner, England&#x27;s Onslaught, and the genre&#x27;s German &quot;Big Four&quot;: Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard.

The thrash metal genre had declined in popularity by the mid-1990s, due to the commercial success of numerous genres such as alternative rock, grunge, and later pop-punk and nu metal. In response, some bands either disbanded or moved away from their thrash metal roots and more towards groove metal or alternative metal. The genre has seen a resurgence in popularity since the 2000s, with the arrival of various bands such as Bonded by Blood, Evile, Hatchet, Havok, Lamb of God, Municipal Waste, and Warbringer, who have all been credited for leading the so-called &quot;thrash metal revival&quot; scene.

== Characteristics ==
Thrash metal generally features fast tempos, low-register, complex guitar riffs, high-register guitar solos, and double bass drumming. The rhythm guitar parts are played with heavy distortion and often palm muted to create a tighter and more precise sound. Vocally, thrash metal can employ anything from melodic singing to shouted or screamed vocals. Most guitar solos are played at high speed and technically demanding, as they are usually characterized by shredding, and use advanced techniques such as sweep picking, legato phrasing, alternate picking, tremolo picking, string skipping, and two-hand tapping. 

David Ellefson, the original bassist of Megadeth, described thrash metal as &quot;a combination of the attitude from punk rock but the riffs and complexities of traditional metal.&quot; On the origins of thrash metal, original Anthrax bassist Dan Lilker recalls: &quot;Thrash was just what they called &#x27;faster hardcore,&#x27; because you literally thrashed around when you were either playing it or reacting to it. And thrash metal was born because it was influenced by thrash hardcore, and they just thought it was more metal, so they said, &#x27;Okay, this is thrash metal.&#x27;&quot;

The guitar riffs often use chromatic scales and emphasize the tritone and diminished intervals, instead of using conventional single-scale-based riffing. For example, the intro riff of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; (the title track of the namesake album) is a chromatic descent, followed by a chromatic ascent based on the tritone.

Speed, pacing, and time changes also define thrash metal. Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel which may be due in large part to its aggressive drumming style. For example, drummers often use two bass drums, or a double-bass pedal to create a relentless, driving beat. Cymbal stops/chokes are often used to transition from one riff to another or to precede an acceleration in tempo. Some common characteristics of the genre are fast guitar riffs with aggressive picking styles and fast guitar solos, and extensive use of two bass drums as opposed to the conventional use of only one, typical of most rock music.

To keep up with the other instruments, many bassists use a plectrum (pick). However, some prominent thrash metal bassists have used their fingers, such as Frank Bello, Greg Christian, Steve Di Giorgio, Robert Trujillo, and Cliff Burton. Several bassists use a distorted bass tone, an approach popularized by Burton and Motörhead&#x27;s Lemmy. Lyrical themes in thrash metal include warfare, corruption, injustice, murder, suicide, isolation, alienation, addiction, and other maladies that afflict the individual and society. In addition, politics, particularly pessimism and dissatisfaction towards politics, are common themes among thrash metal bands. Humor and irony can occasionally be found (Anthrax for example), but they are limited, and are an exception rather than a rule.

== History ==
=== Roots (1970s–early 1980s) ===

The term proto-thrash has been used to describe bands as having elements of speed metal or thrash metal before those genres came to prominence in the early-to-mid-1980s. Deep Purple&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot; is perhaps the earliest proto-thrash/speed metal album, as music journalist Martin Popoff noted, &quot;It&#x27;s really about the discipline and classical haughtiness of this record, as well as &#x27;Hard Lovin&#x27; Man&#x27; which is a great contender for first proto-thrash song ever.&quot; Queen&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; and Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;, released the following year, have also been cited as examples of proto-thrash/speed metal; the latter of which was a direct inspiration for Diamond Head&#x27;s pioneering song &quot;Am I Evil?&quot;. The new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands emerging from Britain in the late 1970s further influenced the development of early thrash. The early work of artists such as Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motörhead, Tygers of Pan Tang, Raven, Saxon and Angel Witch, among others, introduced the fast-paced and intricate musicianship that became core aspects of thrash. Phil Taylor&#x27;s double-bass drumming featured in Motörhead&#x27;s 1979 song &quot;Overkill&quot; has been acknowledged by many thrash drummers, most notably Lars Ulrich, as a primary influence on their playing. Thrash metal bands have also taken inspiration from Judas Priest, with Slayer guitarist Kerry King saying that, &quot;There would be no Slayer without Priest.&quot; Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel played a key role in bringing the NWOBHM to a larger audience, as he was responsible for discovering both Metallica and Slayer and producing their earliest studio recordings.

Greg Prato of Ultimate Guitar notes, &quot;Although the thrash movement seemed to have much more in common with punk than prog fashion-wise (leather jackets vs. capes), musically, there were certainly moments when thrash leaned more towards the prog side of things.&quot; Canadian progressive rock band Rush has been cited a formative influence on the thrash metal movement and the birth of its subgenre technical thrash metal (or &quot;progressive thrash metal&quot;), which is known for combining traditional thrash metal with elements of progressive, jazz or classical music. In a 2013 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante said: &quot;When I was first learning to play drums, I would strap on my headphones, play along with [Rush&#x27;s live album &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;] and be transformed. I remember talking with Cliff and Kirk back when we first met, and we all agreed how much of an influence Rush was on all of us.&quot;

The thrash metal genre is also strongly influenced by punk rock, drawing inspiration from sources ranging from traditional punk bands from the 1970s, including the New York Dolls, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Dead Boys, to late 1970s/early 1980s hardcore punk bands Discharge, GBH, Black Flag, the Misfits, the Dead Kennedys, and Bad Brains. The Ramones&#x27; 1976 self-titled debut album in particular has been noted as a key influence on the genre, due to its sound, which introduced the three-chord thrash style of guitar. Void has been credited as one of the earliest examples of hardcore/heavy metal crossover, whose chaotic musical approach is often cited as particularly influential. Their 1982 split LP with fellow Washington band The Faith showed both bands exhibiting quick, fiery, high-speed punk rock. It has been argued that those recordings laid the foundation for early thrash metal, at least in terms of selected tempos, and that thrash is essentially hardcore punk with the technical proficiency missing from that genre. The crossover with hardcore punk has also been cited as important influence on thrash, especially the English hardcore punk band Discharge, whose &quot;influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as Metallica, Anthrax, Machine Head, Sepultura, Soulfly, Prong and Arch Enemy have covered Discharge&#x27;s songs in tribute.&quot; The eponymous debut albums by D.R.I. and Suicidal Tendencies, both released in 1983, have been credited for paving the way for thrashcore.

In Latin America, this genre also gained a lot of strength, and its creation is also attributed to it, since it began to gain popularity due to the dictatorships that many countries faced at that time, with bands like V8 (1979) with their debut albums &quot;Demo 1982&quot; or &quot;Luchando por el metal&quot;, from Argentina, Transmetal (1987) from Mexico, also the band Massakre (1985) in Chile.

In Europe, the earliest band of the emerging thrash movement was Venom from Newcastle upon Tyne, formed in 1979. Their 1982 album &quot;Black Metal&quot; has been cited as a major influence on many subsequent genres and bands in the extreme metal world, such as Bathory, Hellhammer, Slayer, and Mayhem. The European scene was almost exclusively influenced by the most aggressive music Germany and England were producing at the time. British bands such as Tank and Raven, along with German bands Accept (whose 1982 song &quot;Fast as a Shark&quot; is often credited as one of the first-ever thrash/speed metal songs) and Living Death, motivated musicians from central Europe to start bands of their own, eventually producing groups such as Sodom, Kreator, and Destruction from Germany, as well as Switzerland&#x27;s Celtic Frost (formed by two-thirds of Hellhammer), Coroner and Carrion (who later became Poltergeist) and Denmark&#x27;s Artillery.

===Thrash metal in the 1980s===
====Birth and underground expansion (1981–1983)====
In 1981, Los Angeles band Leather Charm wrote a song entitled &quot;Hit the Lights&quot;. Leather Charm soon disbanded and the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, met drummer Lars Ulrich through a classified advertisement. Together, Hetfield and Ulrich formed Metallica, one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash bands, with lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who would later form Megadeth, another of the &quot;Big Four&quot; originators of thrash, and bassist Ron McGovney. McGovney would be replaced by Cliff Burton (formerly of Trauma), and Mustaine was later replaced by Kirk Hammett of the then-unsigned Bay Area thrash metal act Exodus, and at Burton&#x27;s insistence, the band relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area. Before Metallica had even settled on a definitive lineup, Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel asked Hetfield and Ulrich (credited as &quot;Mettallica&quot;) to record &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; for the first edition of his &quot;Metal Massacre&quot; compilation in 1982. A re-recorded version of &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; would later open their first studio album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, released in July 1983. &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; is widely regarded as the first thrash metal album, and one of the album&#x27;s tracks &quot;Whiplash&quot; has been referred to as one of the first songs of the genre.

The term &quot;thrash metal&quot; was first used in the music press by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s journalist Malcolm Dome while referring to another of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, Anthrax (who, like Metallica, formed in 1981), and their song &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;. Before this, Metallica frontman James Hetfield referred to his band&#x27;s sound as speed metal or power metal.

Another &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash band formed in Los Angeles in 1981, when guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King met while auditioning for the same band and subsequently decided to form a band of their own. Hanneman and King recruited vocalist/bassist Tom Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo, and Slayer was formed. Slayer was discovered by Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel; the band&#x27;s live performance of Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; so impressed him that he promptly signed them to his label. In December 1983, five months after the release of Metallica&#x27;s debut &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, Slayer released their debut album, &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;.

To the north, Canada produced influential thrash and speed metal bands such as Annihilator, Anvil, Exciter, Razor, Sacrifice, and Voivod.

====Mainstream popularity (1984–1989)====
=====First wave (1984–1986)=====
The popularity of thrash metal increased in 1984 with the release of Metallica&#x27;s sophomore record &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, as well as Anthrax&#x27;s debut &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; and Metal Church&#x27;s eponymous debut album. Slayer and Overkill released extended plays on independent labels during this era, &quot;Haunting the Chapel&quot; and &quot;Overkill&quot; respectively. This led to a heavier-sounding form of thrash, which was reflected in Exodus&#x27; debut album &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot;, Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; and Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, all three released in 1985. Several other debut albums were released that same year, including Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot;, Overkill&#x27;s &quot;Feel the Fire&quot;, Kreator&#x27;s &quot;Endless Pain&quot;, Destruction&#x27;s &quot;Infernal Overkill&quot;, Possessed&#x27;s &quot;Seven Churches&quot;, Celtic Frost&#x27;s &quot;To Mega Therion&quot;, Watchtower&#x27;s &quot;Energetic Disassembly&quot; and the Sepultura EP &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot;. &quot;Seven Churches&quot; and &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; are often credited for pioneering and popularizing the mid-1980s extreme metal scene (as well as the then-developing genres of death metal and black metal, respectively), while &quot;Energetic Disassembly&quot; has been cited as the first progressive/technical thrash metal album.

From a creative standpoint, the year 1986 was perhaps the pinnacle of thrash metal, as a number of critically acclaimed and genre-defining albums were released. Metallica&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was released in March, becoming the first thrash album to be certified platinum, being certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it would be the band&#x27;s last album to feature bassist Cliff Burton, who was killed in a bus accident six months after its release. Kreator released &quot;Pleasure to Kill&quot; in April 1986, which would later be a major influence on the death metal scene. Megadeth released &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; in September, an album which proved to be the band&#x27;s commercial and critical breakthrough and which AllMusic later cited as &quot;a classic of early thrash&quot;. Slayer, regarded as one of the most sinister thrash metal bands of the early 1980s, released &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; in October, an album considered by some to have single-handedly inspired the death metal genre. Also in October, Nuclear Assault released their debut album &quot;Game Over&quot;, followed a month later by Dark Angel&#x27;s &quot;Darkness Descends&quot;, which marked the debut of drummer Gene Hoglan. Flotsam and Jetsam&#x27;s debut album &quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot; (released on the Fourth of July in 1986) received some attention as well, due to the album being &quot;the first of only a handful&quot; to ever receive a 6K rating from &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, and it is also notable for featuring a then-unknown Jason Newsted, who, not long after the album&#x27;s release, joined Metallica as Burton&#x27;s replacement.

Also during the mid-to-late 1980s, bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, D.R.I., S.O.D. (who featured three-fifths of Anthrax), and Corrosion of Conformity paved the way to what became known as crossover thrash, a fusion genre that lies on a continuum between heavy metal and hardcore punk, and is arguably faster and more aggressive than thrash metal.

=====Second wave (1987–1989)=====

By the mid-to-late 1980s, thrash metal began to achieve major mainstream success worldwide, with many bands of the genre receiving heavy rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, and radio stations such as KNAC in Long Beach and Z Rock in Dallas, as well as coverage on numerous publications, including &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;RIP Magazine&quot;. These outlets not only played a major role in the crossover success of thrash metal during this time, but helped push album sales of the genre&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot; and similar bands or moved them from playing clubs to arenas and stadiums.

Anthrax made its mainstream breakthrough in 1987 with the release of their gold-certified album &quot;Among the Living&quot;, which borrowed elements from their two previous releases, with fast guitar riffs and pounding drums. Shortly after the release of &quot;Among the Living&quot;, three Bay Area bands, Testament, Death Angel and Heathen, respectively released their debut albums &quot;The Legacy&quot;, &quot;The Ultra-Violence&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot;. All of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Teutonic thrash metal also released albums in 1987: Kreator&#x27;s &quot;Terrible Certainty&quot;, Destruction&#x27;s &quot;Release from Agony&quot;, Sodom&#x27;s &quot;Persecution Mania&quot; and Tankard&#x27;s &quot;Chemical Invasion&quot;; those albums cemented their reputations as top-tier German thrash metal bands.

In response to thrash metal&#x27;s growing popularity during this period, several hardcore punk bands began changing their style to a more heavier direction, including Suicidal Tendencies, who are often considered to be one of the &quot;fathers of crossover thrash&quot;, and became more recognized as a thrash metal band in the late 1980s (thanks in large part to the presence of guitarists Rocky George and Mike Clark); the band would reach new heights of success with their first two major-label albums, &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#x27;t Even Smile Today&quot; (1988) and &quot;Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit... Déjà Vu&quot; (1989). D.R.I.&#x27;s music took a similar direction with their last three albums of the 1980s, &quot;Crossover&quot; (1987), &quot;4 of a Kind&quot; (1988), and &quot;Thrash Zone&quot; (1989), and other bands would follow suit, including The Exploited, Excel (from Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; hometown of Venice) and New York hardcore acts M.O.D. (fronted by former S.O.D. singer Billy Milano), the Cro-Mags and the Crumbsuckers.

From 1987 to 1989, Overkill released &quot;Taking Over&quot;, &quot;Under the Influence,&quot; and &quot;The Years of Decay&quot;, three albums considered their best. Each of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal bands released albums in 1988: Slayer released &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, Megadeth released &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;, Anthrax released &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; while Metallica&#x27;s &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; spawned the band&#x27;s first video and Top 40 hit, the World War I-themed song &quot;One&quot;. That same year, Metallica joined Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come on the two-month-long arena and stadium tour Monsters of Rock in North America. In the spring of 1989, Anthrax teamed up with Exodus and Helloween on a US arena tour sponsored by &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

Sepultura&#x27;s third album, &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; (1989), earned them some mainstream appeal as it was released by Roadrunner Records. Testament&#x27;s second and third albums, &quot;The New Order&quot; (1988) and &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; (1989), nearly gained them the same level of popularity as the &quot;Big Four&quot;, while Exodus&#x27; third album &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot; (1989) garnered the band their first music video and one of their most recognized songs, the mosh-pit anthem &quot;The Toxic Waltz&quot;. Vio-lence, Forbidden, and Sadus, three relative latecomers to the Bay Area thrash metal scene, released their debut albums &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Evil,&quot; and &quot;Illusions&quot;, respectively, in 1988; the latter album demonstrated a sound that was primarily driven by the fretless bass of Steve Di Giorgio. Also in 1988, Blind Illusion released its only studio album for more than two decades, &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot;, which received some particular attention as it was produced by Kirk Hammett, and is also notable for featuring bassist Les Claypool and former Possessed guitarist Larry LaLonde; after its release, the two would later team up together in Claypool&#x27;s then-upcoming band Primus.

Canadian thrashers Annihilator released their highly technical debut &quot;Alice in Hell&quot; in 1989, which was praised for its fast riffs and extended guitar solos. In Germany, Sodom released &quot;Agent Orange&quot;, and Kreator would release &quot;Extreme Aggression&quot;. Several highly acclaimed albums associated with the sub-genre of technical thrash metal were also released in 1989, including Coroner&#x27;s &quot;No More Color&quot;, Dark Angel&#x27;s &quot;Leave Scars&quot;, Toxik&#x27;s &quot;Think This,&quot; and Watchtower&#x27;s &quot;Control and Resistance&quot;, which has been recognized and acknowledged as one of the cornerstones of jazz-metal fusion and a major influence on the technical death metal genre, while Forced Entry&#x27;s debut album &quot;Uncertain Future&quot; helped pioneer the late 1980s Seattle music scene.

===Thrash metal in the 1990s===
====Continued popularity (1990–1991)====
A number of more typical but technically sophisticated albums were released in 1990, including Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;Persistence of Time&quot;, Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot;, Testament&#x27;s &quot;Souls of Black&quot;, Kreator&#x27;s &quot;Coma of Souls&quot;, Destruction&#x27;s &quot;Cracked Brain&quot;, Forbidden&#x27;s &quot;Twisted into Form&quot;, Exodus&#x27; &quot;Impact Is Imminent&quot;, Sacred Reich&#x27;s &quot;The American Way&quot;, Prong&#x27;s &quot;Beg to Differ&quot;, Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; and Exhorder&#x27;s &quot;Slaughter in the Vatican&quot;; the latter three are often credited for being an integral part of the then-developing groove metal genre. All of those albums were commercial high points for the aforementioned artists. During this period, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined one of the most successful tours in thrash metal history called the Clash of the Titans; the first leg in Europe included support from Testament and Suicidal Tendencies, while the second leg in North America had Anthrax and then-emerging Seattle band Alice in Chains, who were the supporting act.

Several albums, some of which had come to be known as technical thrash metal, were released in 1991, including Overkill&#x27;s &quot;Horrorscope&quot;, Heathen&#x27;s &quot;Victims of Deception&quot;, Dark Angel&#x27;s &quot;Time Does Not Heal&quot;, Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Arise&quot;, Coroner&#x27;s &quot;Mental Vortex&quot;, Prong&#x27;s &quot;Prove You Wrong&quot; and Forced Entry&#x27;s &quot;As Above, So Below&quot;.

In 1991, Metallica released their eponymous fifth studio album, known as &quot;The Black Album&quot;. The album marked a stylistic change in the band, eliminating much of the speed and longer song structures of the band&#x27;s previous work, and instead focusing on more concise and heavier songs. The album was a change in Metallica&#x27;s direction from the thrash metal style of the band&#x27;s previous four studio albums towards a more contemporary heavy metal sound with original hard rock elements, but still had remnant characteristics of thrash metal. It would go on to become the band&#x27;s best-selling album and began a wave of thrash metal bands releasing more garage-oriented albums, or else more experimental ones.

====Decline (1991–1999)====
The era of 1991–1992 marked the beginning of the end of thrash metal&#x27;s commercial peak, due to the rising popularity of the alternative metal and grunge movements (the latter spearheaded by Washington-based bands Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam). In response to this climate change, many thrash metal bands that had emerged from the previous decade had called it quits or went on hiatus during the 1990s, while half of the &quot;Big Four&quot; and other veteran bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles. Metallica was a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid-to-late 1990s albums &quot;Load&quot;, and &quot;ReLoad&quot;, which displayed minor blues and southern rock influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band&#x27;s earlier sound. Megadeth took a more accessible heavy metal route starting with their 1992 album &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. Testament, Exodus and Flotsam and Jetsam all took a melodic/progressive approach with the albums &quot;The Ritual&quot;, &quot;Force of Habit&quot;, and &quot;Cuatro&quot;, respectively. One of the pioneers of crossover thrash, Corrosion of Conformity, began changing their sound into a slower and Black Sabbath-influenced heavy metal direction with their post-1980s output, adapting influences and textures of sludge, doom metal, blues, and southern rock on several of their albums, including &quot;Blind&quot; (1991), &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1994) and &quot;Wiseblood&quot; (1996).

In the wake of the success of groove metal, instigated by Pantera (who went on to become one of the most successful heavy metal bands of the 1990s), several thrash metal established bands started to expand their sound by adding elements and influences from the groove metal genre. Anthrax, who had recently replaced Joey Belladonna with John Bush as their singer, began stepping away from their previously established thrash metal formula to a more accessible alternative/groove metal approach for the remainder of their 1990s output, starting with and including &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; (1993). Sacred Reich, Overkill, Coroner, Prong, Testament, and Forbidden followed this trend with their respective albums &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;I Hear Black&quot;, &quot;Grin&quot;, &quot;Cleansing&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Distortion&quot;. Sepultura&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; also marked the beginning of their transition away from death/thrash metal to groove metal which had influenced then-up-and-coming bands like Korn, who reciprocally became the inspiration behind the nu metal style of the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Roots&quot; (1996). &quot;Roots&quot; would influence a generation of bands from Linkin Park to Slipknot, which during the 1990s meant the replacement of death, thrash, and speed, by nu metal and metalcore as popular epicenters of the hardest metal scene.

Staying away from this new commercial mainstream of groove metal, metalcore, and especially nu metal, the second wave of black metal emerged as an opposed underground music scene, initially in Norway. This crop of new bands differenced themselves from the &quot;first wave&quot; by totally distilling black metal from the combined origins with thrash metal, but they preserved from all these sub-genres the emphasis on atmosphere over rhythm.

As further extreme metal genres came to prominence in the 1990s (industrial metal, death metal, and black metal each finding their own fanbase), the heavy metal &quot;family tree&quot; soon found itself blending aesthetics and styles. For example, bands with all the musical traits of thrash metal began using death growls, a vocal style borrowed from death metal, while black metal bands often utilized the airy feel of synthesizers, popularized in industrial metal. Today the placing of bands within distinct sub-genres remains a source of contention for heavy metal fans, however, little debate resides over the fact that thrash metal is the sole proprietor of its respective spin-offs.

===Revivals (2000–present)===
A few thrash metal bands from the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the genre&#x27;s U.S. &quot;Big Four&quot;, continued recording and touring with success in the 2000s. In 2003, Anthrax released their first studio album in five years &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot;, followed a month later by Metallica&#x27;s double platinum-certified album &quot;St. Anger&quot;. After experimenting further with a commercialized sound on their previous few albums, Megadeth returned to its heavier sound with their ninth album &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; (2001). It would be the band&#x27;s final album before disbanding in the following year, due to an arm injury that had left Dave Mustaine unable to play guitar; he would eventually reform Megadeth for a handful albums, including &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; (2004) which was originally going to be released as a solo album by him, before reuniting with co-founding member and bassist David Ellefson in 2010. Slayer released three albums in the 2000s: &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; (2001), which saw a return to their signature thrash metal sound, followed by &quot;Christ Illusion&quot; (2006) and &quot;World Painted Blood&quot; (2009), both of which marked their first studio albums with drummer Dave Lombardo in nearly two decades. Although their career had declined from its peak in the 1990s, Overkill was perhaps one of the most-active thrash metal groups outside of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, having never disbanded or taken longer breaks in-between records, and by 2000&#x27;s &quot;Bloodletting&quot;, they were the first band in the genre to release more than ten studio albums. Overkill&#x27;s popularity was reignited in the 2010s, with three of their albums, &quot;The Electric Age&quot; (2012), &quot;White Devil Armory&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Grinding Wheel&quot; (2017), all entering the Top 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

The resurgence of interest in the thrash metal genre during the early 2000s was widely attributed to the Thrash of the Titans festival, which was held in August 2001 as a co-benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy and Death&#x27;s Chuck Schuldiner, who were both battling cancer. The show is also notable for seeing several of Testament&#x27;s Bay Area thrash metal contemporaries, including Exodus, Death Angel, Vio-lence, Forbidden Evil, Sadus and Legacy (a precursor to Testament), reunited. Many thrash metal bands from outside of the Bay Area would subsequently reunite, including Anthrax (twice with Joey Belladonna and briefly with John Bush), Dark Angel, Nuclear Assault, Sacred Reich, UK bands Onslaught, Sabbat, and Xentrix, and Canada&#x27;s Sacrifice, renewing interest in previous decades.

The term &quot;thrash-revivalists&quot; has been applied to such bands as Lamb of God, Municipal Waste, Evile, Havok, Warbringer, Vektor, Bonded by Blood, Hatchet, and Power Trip. Evile&#x27;s 2007 debut album &quot;Enter the Grave&quot;, produced by former Metallica producer and engineer Flemming Rasmussen, received considerable praise for its sound, which combined elements of the sounds of Slayer and the Bay Area scene (particularly Exodus and Testament). Los Angeles-based bands Warbringer and Bonded by Blood took a similar approach on their respective debut albums, &quot;War Without End&quot; and &quot;Feed the Beast&quot;, both released in 2008. Perhaps the most commercially successful band from the 2000s and 2010s thrash metal revival movement is Lamb of God, who are also considered a key part of the new wave of American heavy metal movement, have received two gold-certified albums in the U.S., and have gone from playing small clubs to arenas and stadiums.

Notable bands returned to their roots with releases such as Kreator&#x27;s &quot;Violent Revolution&quot; (2001), Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Death Magnetic&quot; (2008), Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot; (2009), Slayer&#x27;s &quot;World Painted Blood&quot; (2009), Exodus&#x27; &quot;Exhibit B: The Human Condition&quot; (2010), Overkill&#x27;s &quot;Ironbound&quot; (2010), Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;Worship Music&quot; (2011), Testament&#x27;s &quot;Dark Roots of Earth&quot; (2012), and Flotsam and Jetsam&#x27;s &quot;Ugly Noise&quot; (2012). More recent bands of the genre, such as Havok and Legion of the Damned have turned their focus towards a more aggressive rendition of thrash metal, incorporating elements of melodic death metal.

==Spin-off genres==
Thrash metal is directly responsible for the development of underground metal genres, such as death metal, black metal, and groove metal. In addition to this, metalcore, grindcore, and deathcore employ similar riffs in their composition, the former with more focus on melody rather than chromaticism. The blending of punk ethos and metal&#x27;s brutal nature led to even more extreme, underground styles after thrash metal began gaining mild commercial success in the late 1980s. 

With gorier subject matter, heavier down tuning of guitars, more consistent use of blast beat drumming, and darker, atonal death growls, death metal was established in the mid-1980s. Black metal, also related to thrash metal, emerged at the same time, with many black metal bands taking influence from thrash metal bands such as Venom. Black metal continued deviating from thrash metal, often providing more orchestral overtones, open tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, shrieked or raspy vocals and pagan or occult-based aesthetics to distinguish itself from thrash metal. Thrash metal would later combine with its spinoffs, thus giving rise to genres like blackened thrash metal and deathrash. 

Groove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo, but since the early 1990s, it started to favor a more death metal-derived sound. Thrash metal with stronger punk elements is called crossover thrash. Its overall sound is more punk-influenced than traditional thrash metal but has more heavy metal elements than hardcore punk and thrashcore.

==Regional scenes==
Thrash metal emerged predominantly from a handful of regional scenes, each of which was generally distinguished by the unique characteristics of its bands.

* Bay Area thrash metal, also known as West Coast thrash metal: In addition to being the most commercially successful, the West Coast&#x27;s thrash metal (mostly centered in California) is the most progressive and technical of the major regional thrash scenes, being strongly NWOBHM-influenced. Metallica (originally from Los Angeles), Exodus, Testament, Metal Church, Possessed, Death Angel, Attitude Adjustment, Lȧȧz Rockit, Vio-lence, Forbidden, Defiance, Sadus, Mordred and Blind Illusion are prominent examples of bands to emerge from the Bay Area. Although Megadeth, Slayer, Dark Angel and Suicidal Tendencies were technically from Los Angeles, those bands are often credited for popularizing and contributing to the thrash metal scene in Northern California during the 1980s by frequently playing shows there, especially early in their careers and/or before they received their first record deal.
* East Coast thrash metal: Centered in New York and New Jersey, the East Coast&#x27;s thrash metal tended to display a sound that incorporated a strong hardcore punk influence. An emphasis was placed on aggression and speed rather than technicality. Anthrax, Overkill, Carnivore, Nuclear Assault, Meanstreak, Warzone, Prong, Toxik, Whiplash, Wrathchild America and Demolition Hammer exemplified the style to emerge from this regional scene.
*Gulf Coast thrash metal: While not as popular as the West Coast and East Coast regions, the Gulf Coast spawned at least three thrash metal scenes (including Texas, Louisiana and Florida) during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which saw a number of bands develop a style that was influenced by punk rock and/or the early-to-mid 1980s heavy metal scene. The most notable bands from the Gulf Coast are Atheist, Solstice, Juggernaut, Opprobrium (formerly named Incubus), Watchtower, Rigor Mortis, D.R.I., Absu, Nasty Savage, Verbal Abuse, Angkor Wat, Dead Horse, Pantera and Exhorder, the latter of the two (along with New York&#x27;s Prong) are often credited for developing and popularizing the groove metal genre in the early 1990s.
* British thrash metal: The British thrash scene originated from NWOBHM bands like Raven, Jaguar, Warfare and Dragonslayer (originally called Slayer) beginning to play accelerated heavy metal. This led to British thrash metal bands leaning towards a more traditional heavy metal approach, often heavier though less aggressive than their American counterparts. Additionally, crust punk is an integral part of the British thrash metal scene. The most notable bands from this scene are Onslaught, Cancer, Amebix, Sabbat, Detritus, Xentrix, Sacrilege, Nightlord, Atomkraft, Hellbastard, Cerebral Fix, Seventh Angel, Acid Reign and Lawnmower Deth. 
* Brazilian thrash metal: The Brazilian thrash scene is notable for producing a handful of bands that would become principal parts of thrash metal&#x27;s prevalence in the early 1990s. There were three scenes where Brazilian thrash metal originated: Belo Horizonte (the most prominent), São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. The most notable bands from this scene are Sepultura, Dorsal Atlântica, Executer, Mutilator, Chakal, Korzus, Holocausto, Claustrofobia, Torture Squad, Ratos de Porão, Sagrado Inferno, Vulcano and Sarcófago.
* Teutonic thrash metal: The German and Swiss regions have spawned dozens of bands since the mid-1980s that developed their own style. Their style was more aggressive than American and Canadian thrash. The most prominent bands from this scene are Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, Tankard, Celtic Frost, Holy Moses, Desaster, Coroner, Exumer, Despair, Paradox, Messiah, Assassin, Poltergeist, Living Death and Sieges Even (who were originally called Sodom).
* Canadian thrash metal: The Canadian region has seen numerous thrash metal bands create a unique blend of speed metal, progressive and hardcore punk into their music, influenced by a variety of acts such as Rush, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motörhead and D.R.I., as well as fellow American thrash metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. Anvil and Exciter are considered to be the pioneers of this scene, while Voivod, Sacrifice, Razor, and Annihilator are often referred to as the country&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot;. Notable crossover bands from the Hardcore Punk scene include West Coast bands Death Sentence and Beyond Possession. Other notable Canadian thrash metal bands include Infernäl Mäjesty, Anonymus, Eudoxis, Piledriver, Slaughter, DBC and Obliveon.
* Australian thrash metal: While not considered a &quot;major&quot; part of the worldwide thrash metal scene due to distance from the major Bay Area and Teutonic scenes, Australian thrash metal has had a fairly substantial following in overseas markets, while local audiences have always been difficult to gather. The most notable Australian thrash metal bands from the 1980s are Mortal Sin, Nothing Sacred and Hobbs&#x27; Angel of Death.

<text>The Fagaceae (; ) are a family of flowering plants that includes beeches, chestnuts and oaks, and comprises eight genera with around 1,000 or more species. Fagaceae in temperate regions are mostly deciduous, whereas in the tropics, many species occur as evergreen trees and shrubs. They are characterized by alternate simple leaves with pinnate venation, unisexual flowers in the form of catkins, and fruit in the form of cup-like (cupule) nuts. Their leaves are often lobed, and both petioles and stipules are generally present. Their fruits lack endosperm and lie in a scaly or spiny husk that may or may not enclose the entire nut, which may consist of one to seven seeds. In the oaks, genus &quot;Quercus&quot;, the fruit is a non-valved nut (usually containing one seed) called an acorn. The husk of the acorn in most oaks only forms a cup in which the nut sits. Other members of the family have fully enclosed nuts. Fagaceae is one of the most ecologically important woody plant families in the Northern Hemisphere, as oaks form the backbone of temperate forest in North America, Europe, and Asia, and are one of the most significant sources of wildlife food.

Several members of the Fagaceae have important economic uses. Many species of oak, chestnut, and beech (genera &quot;Quercus&quot;, &quot;Castanea&quot;, and &quot;Fagus&quot;, respectively) are commonly used as timber for floors, furniture, cabinets, and wine barrels. Cork for stopping wine bottles and a myriad other uses is made from the bark of cork oak, &quot;Quercus suber.&quot; Chestnuts are the fruits from species of the genus &quot;Castanea.&quot; Numerous species from several genera are prominent ornamentals. Wood chips from the genus &quot;Fagus&quot; are often used in flavoring beers. Nuts of some species in the Asian tropical genera &quot;Castanopsis&quot; and &quot;Lithocarpus&quot; are edible and often used as ornamentals.

==Classification==
The Fagaceae are often divided into five or six subfamilies and are generally accepted to include 8 (to 10) genera (listed below). Monophyly of the Fagaceae is strongly supported by both morphological (especially fruit morphology) and molecular data.

The Southern Hemisphere genus &quot;Nothofagus,&quot; commonly the southern beeches, was historically placed in the Fagaceae sister to the genus &quot;Fagus&quot;, but recent molecular evidence suggests otherwise. While &quot;Nothofagus&quot; shares a number of common characteristics with the Fagaceae, such as cupule fruit structure, it differs significantly in a number of ways, including distinct stipule and pollen morphology, as well as having a different number of chromosomes. The currently accepted view by systematic botanists is to place &quot;Nothofagus&quot; in its own family, Nothofagaceae.

== Subfamilies and genera ==

There are two subfamilies:

=== Fagoideae ===

Auth. K. Koch. Monotypic

* &quot;Fagus&quot; —beeches; about 10 to 13 species, north temperate east Asia, southwest Asia, Europe, eastern North America
The genus &quot;Nothofagus&quot; (southern beeches: from the Southern Hemisphere), formerly included in the Fagaceae, is now treated in the separate monotypic family Nothofagaceae.

=== Quercoideae ===

Auth. Õrsted

# &quot;Castanea&quot; —chestnuts; eight species, north temperate east Asia, southwest Asia, southeast Europe, eastern North America
# &quot;Castanopsis&quot; —chinquapins or chinkapins; about 125–130 species, southeast Asia
# &quot;Chrysolepis&quot; —golden chinkapins; two species, western United States
# &quot;Lithocarpus&quot; —stone oaks; about 330-340 species, warm temperate to tropical Asia
# &quot;Notholithocarpus&quot; —Tanoaks; 1 species (formerly &quot;Lithocarpus densiflorus&quot;), endemic to California and southwest Oregon
# &quot;Quercus&quot; —oaks; about 600 species, widespread Northern Hemisphere, crossing the equator in Indonesia
# &quot;Trigonobalanus&quot; —three species, tropical southeast Asia, Northern South America (Colombia) (three species of &quot;Colombobalanus&quot; and &quot;Formanodendron&quot; are included)

The &quot;Quercus&quot; subgenus &quot;Cyclobalanopsis&quot; is treated as a distinct genus by the &quot;Flora of China&quot;, but as a section or subgenus by most taxonomists.

==Distribution==
The Fagaceae are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Genus-level diversity is concentrated in Southeast Asia, where most of the extant genera are thought to have evolved before migrating to Europe and North America (via the Bering Land Bridge). Members of the Fagaceae (such as &quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;, &quot;Castanea dentata&quot; and &quot;Quercus alba&quot; in the Northeastern United States, or &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;, &quot;Quercus robur&quot; and &quot;Q. petraea&quot; in Europe) are often ecologically dominant in northern temperate forests. More than 400 species of Fagaceae, mostly &quot;Castanopsis&quot; and &quot;Lithocarpus&quot;, grow in tropical Southeast Asia, with some species in similar dominant roles over large areas.

== Phylogeny ==

Modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:

<text>Kreator is a German thrash metal band from Essen, formed in 1982. Their current line-up consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Miland &quot;Mille&quot; Petrozza, drummer Jürgen &quot;Ventor&quot; Reil, lead guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö, and bassist Frédéric Leclercq. The band&#x27;s line-up has changed multiple times throughout its -year career, most noticeably with their bassists and lead guitarists. Petrozza and Reil are the only two original members left in Kreator, although the latter took a break from the band from 1994 to 1996. Yli-Sirniö has been the lead guitarist of Kreator since 2001, while Leclercq joined in 2019 as the replacement of Christian &quot;Speesy&quot; Giesler, who had been in the band since 1994.

Kreator has released fifteen studio albums, two EPs, two live albums and three compilation albums. They gained a large underground fanbase within the international thrash metal community, with their second studio album &quot;Pleasure to Kill&quot; (1986) regarded as an influential album of the genre. Many of their subsequent albums — including &quot;Terrible Certainty&quot; (1987), &quot;Extreme Aggression&quot; (1989) and &quot;Coma of Souls&quot; (1990) — were also highly acclaimed. Despite being an influential band, as well as one of the first European thrash metal acts to sign to a major label (signing to Epic Records in 1988), Kreator would not achieve mainstream popularity until later albums, including their thirteenth studio album &quot;Phantom Antichrist&quot; (2012) and its follow-up &quot;Gods of Violence&quot; (2017), both of which charted highly in many countries, with the latter reaching number one on the German charts. Their latest studio album, &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot;, was released on 10 June 2022, and the band is currently working on new material for their next album.

Kreator has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time. Along with Destruction, Sodom and Tankard, they are credited as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Teutonic thrash metal, responsible for developing and popularizing the German thrash metal scene as well as pioneering the then-emerging death metal and black metal genres during the mid-1980s.

==History==
===Formation and early releases (1982–1987)===
The band was originally formed as Metal Militia in 1982 in Essen, Germany and then became Tyrant. Later they used the name Tormentor until 1984, when they changed to its current name Kreator. The original line-up featured lead vocalist and guitarist Mille Petrozza, drummer Jürgen &quot;Ventor&quot; Reil, and bassist Rob Fioretti. Kreator recorded their debut album, &quot;Endless Pain&quot; (1985), in just ten days. The band hired then-future Sodom guitarist Michael Wulf for the album&#x27;s tour to play lead, while Petrozza switched to rhythm guitar.

Wulf was in the band for a few days but, contrary to the liner notes, he never played on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pleasure to Kill&quot; (1986), which is widely considered a thrash classic and a big influence on the death metal genre. It would not be until 31 years after its release that &quot;Pleasure to Kill&quot; entered the German album charts. Produced by Harris Johns (who had also worked with Sodom, Helloween and Voivod), the album showed the band growing in talent and technical ability. The song &quot;Flag of Hate&quot; became a concert standard, and the band became one of the most promising up-and-coming European metal acts. The band started their first tour ever (before the release of &quot;Pleasure to Kill&quot;, they had only played five gigs total); they played their first shows outside of Germany during the fall of 1986, touring Europe with Destruction and Celtic Frost, and during the spring of 1987, they toured North America for the first time, opening for Voivod on their &quot;Killing Technology&quot; tour. Kreator&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Flag of Hate&quot;, was also released in 1986, and around this time, Jörg &quot;Tritze&quot; Trzebiatowski had joined the band.

===Rising popularity (1987–1991)===
In 1987, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Terrible Certainty&quot;, which is often considered a high-quality Kreator album as the arrangements on the album were more complex and the tempos more varied. The album featured another hit &quot;Behind the Mirror&quot;, and the band&#x27;s popularity continued to grow and a video for &quot;Toxic Trace&quot; received airplay on MTV. They managed to find enough time and money (coming from their concerts) to finance another EP, &quot;Out of the Dark... Into the Light&quot; (1988). By this point, Kreator had graduated to headlining their own tours, as well as playing at theaters and arenas with bands such as Megadeth, Voivod, Overkill, D.R.I. and Holy Terror.

Berlin-based independent record label Noise Records licensed Kreator for the territories outside of Europe and Japan to the major-label Epic Records in 1988. Their fourth studio album and debut with Epic (for limited territories) &quot;Extreme Aggression&quot;, recorded in Los Angeles, became a metal hit in Europe upon its release in 1989; however, the album would not enter the German album charts until 28 years after its release. Continuing the &quot;Terrible Certainty&quot; formula while showing the band still progressing musically, and with better production by the well-regarded Randy Burns (who had also worked with Megadeth, Possessed, Nuclear Assault, Death, Dark Angel, among others), the album featured the band&#x27;s first major singles, the title track, &quot;Betrayer&quot; and the radio-only &quot;Love Us or Hate Us&quot;, gaining support from the Southern California radio station KNAC, and the video for &quot;Betrayer&quot; receiving airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. This – as well as playing with bands like King Diamond, Raven, Coroner, Suicidal Tendencies, Death and Sadus – greatly expanded their popularity outside of Germany.

Also in 1989, German director Thomas Schadt made a documentary about Kreator (focusing on the social aspect of heavy metal in the Ruhr Area) titled &quot;Thrash Altenessen&quot; (named after the band&#x27;s hometown, a suburb of Essen). Tritze left Kreator after the release of&quot;Extreme Aggression&quot;. In 1990, with new guitarist Frank &quot;Blackfire&quot; Gosdzik (then-formerly of Sodom), the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Coma of Souls&quot;, again produced by Burns. The album was not quite as praised as the band&#x27;s previous few albums (many felt it was &quot;rushed&quot; and repetitive), but it still managed sell and maintain popularity quite well, with the singles &quot;When the Sun Burns Red&quot; and &quot;People of the Lie&quot; becoming hits.

===Experimentation (1992–2000)===
The early 1990s brought a decline in the popularity of traditional thrash metal, which was replaced by grunge. By 1992, Kreator had been released from their American contract with CBS/Sony Music, then-home of the likes of Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam. Their sixth studio album &quot;Renewal&quot; was released in the fall of that year, and featured heavy death metal and industrial influences. While reaching a newer audience, the band upset many longtime fans, accusing them of &quot;selling out&quot;. Kreator experienced a decline in popularity as the result of the backlash against the album.

The line-up of the band had also underwent significant changes. Founding member Roberto Fioretti left the band after the recording of the album and was replaced by Andreas Herz. In 1994, Reil left as well, leaving Petrozza the sole original band member. Reil was replaced by Joe Cangelosi while Herz left the same year and was replaced by Christian &quot;Speesy&quot; Giesler. During this time, Kreator ended their tenure with Noise Records and signed with GUN Records. The new line-up released the album &quot;Cause for Conflict&quot; in 1995. The songs bore a heavy influence of such bands as Pantera and Machine Head as well as the partial resemblance of &quot;Renewal&quot;.

Gosdzik and Cangelosi both left in 1996 and were replaced by Tommy Vetterli (then-formerly of Coroner) and a returning Reil, respectively. Kreator continued to experiment producing &quot;Outcast&quot; (1997) and &quot;Endorama&quot; (1999), with ambient and gothic influences, incorporated samples and loops. However, the record sales went down, and by the end of the 1990s, the band had reached commercial and critical nadir. Despite that, Petrozza was quoted as stating: &quot;For us, success doesn&#x27;t define in record sales. So all our albums have been successful for us, because we&#x27;ve achieved what we were aiming for...&quot;.

===Return in style (2001–2009)===

In 2001, with new lead guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö, Kreator released their tenth studio album &quot;Violent Revolution&quot;, which saw the band returning to their classic thrash metal style. Despite containing a lot of melodic and so-called &quot;Gothenburg metal&quot; riffs, &quot;Violent Revolution&quot; was praised by fans and critics alike and benefited from the 2000s thrash metal revival movement, led by the likes of Overkill, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus and Testament. The tour was extremely successful and introduced Kreator to a younger generation of metal fans. Yli-Sirniö, who lived in Germany, was known to be a good guitar player, so the band recruited him. A live album &quot;Live Kreation&quot; and live DVD &quot;Live Kreation: Revisioned Glory&quot; were both released in 2003, and their eleventh studio album – emphasizing more on the Gothenburg influences – &quot;Enemy of God&quot; was released in 2005. This album also saw a special edition re-release in 2006 called &quot;Enemy of God: Revisited&quot;. In early 2006, Kreator toured North America with Napalm Death, A Perfect Murder, and The Undying. There was a joint headline European tour with Celtic Frost in 2007 with support from Watain, and Kreator were to tour in 2008 with King Diamond, Leaves&#x27; Eyes, and Cellador; however, this tour was canceled due to back issues with King Diamond.

In March 2008, the &quot;At the Pulse of Kapitulation&quot; DVD was released, featuring &quot;Live in East Berlin&quot; and &quot;Hallucinative Comas&quot; on one disc. Both had previously been available on VHS only and were long out of print. The band had also begun working on their twelfth full-length album in late 2007/early 2008 and began recording in July 2008. Recording for the album, titled &quot;Hordes of Chaos&quot;, was wrapped up in late August, with the album being released in January 2009. On 23 January 2009, the band began their &quot;Chaos Over Europe&quot; tour in Tilburg (the Netherlands) with Caliban, Eluveitie and Emergency Gate as other acts. In April 2009, the band embarked on a North American headlining tour, co-headlined by Exodus, and supported by Belphegor, Warbringer, and Epicurean. In late 2009, Reil was forced to sit out some tour dates due to personal issues, with Marco Minnemann temporarily taking his place.

===&quot;Phantom Antichrist&quot; and &quot;Gods of Violence&quot; (2010–2017)===
Kreator signed with Nuclear Blast in early 2010, before embarking on a North American tour in March to celebrate their 25th anniversary. A European tour with Exodus, Death Angel and Suicidal Angels, entitled Thrashfest, took place in late 2010. On 1 June 2012, they released their thirteenth studio album &quot;Phantom Antichrist&quot;. Kreator co-headlined a 23-date North American tour that fall with Nuclear Blast labelmates Accept. Entitled the Teutonic Terror Attack 2012 tour, they were supported by Finland&#x27;s Swallow the Sun. Kreator performed alongside Suidakra in Bangalore on 16 June 2012.

Kreator released a music video for &quot;Civilization Collapse&quot; on 28 November 2012.

In a November 2013 interview, Mille Petrozza stated that Kreator would begin work on their fourteenth studio album after the &quot;Phantom Antichrist&quot; tour for a 2016 release. However, Petrozza said that the album would not be released until 2017. On 30 August that year, they released a two-disc live album called &quot;Dying Alive&quot;. It contained 24 tracks recorded at Turbinehalle in Oberhausen, Germany. On 14 October 2016, it was announced that Kreator&#x27;s fourteenth studio album would be called &quot;Gods of Violence&quot;, and it was released on 27 January 2017. A music video for the album&#x27;s title track was released on 18 November 2016. &quot;Gods of Violence&quot; received generally positive reviews, and was their first album to reach number one on the German charts. To promote the album, Kreator embarked on a headlining European tour in February and March 2017, with support from Sepultura, Soilwork and Aborted, and co-headlined the Decibel Magazine tour with Obituary in March and April. In late April, the band announced an Australian tour with Vader, which took place in September. They embarked on two tours in 2018: one in Europe with Decapitated and Dagoba in January, followed by a co-headlining North American tour with Sabaton in February and March.

===Split with Christian Giesler, &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot; and upcoming sixteenth studio album (2018–present)===

About three months after the release of &quot;Gods of Violence&quot;, Petrozza mentioned a follow-up album, saying, &quot;Maybe we should work with a different producer. Maybe we should go to a different country to record the album. Maybe we should write a more metal or more full-on thrash metal. Whatever we feel, first and foremost, that is the most important thing. Time will tell.&quot; In a September 2017 interview with Australia&#x27;s Silver Tiger Media, Petrozza stated that Kreator could do another album after &quot;Gods of Violence&quot; but &quot;not yet.&quot; When asked in February 2018 about the band&#x27;s future, Petrozza said, &quot;I think we&#x27;re gonna take next year off and write a new record. That&#x27;s the plan at least. We&#x27;ll see what happens. I don&#x27;t put myself under pressure. Let&#x27;s see how I feel after this tour, and if I have ideas for new music, I will book a studio and start working on demos as soon as I have the time. And then I&#x27;ll come up with some new stuff.&quot; He told &quot;Guitar Interactive&quot; magazine in July 2018 that Kreator would take 2019 off to focus on writing the new album, which was planned for release in the summer of 2020. Petrozza later stated their new album was not expected to be released until the summer of 2021.

In the beginning of December, Kreator embarked on a tour of Europe, entitled the European Apocalypse, with Dimmu Borgir, Hatebreed and Bloodbath. It was also announced that the final concert of the European Apocalypse in London would be filmed and produced as a live DVD in 2019; titled &quot;London Apocalypticon - Live at the Roundhouse&quot;, this DVD was released on 14 February 2020. Kreator supported Slayer on their final world tour, appearing at the Santiago Gets Louder festival in Chile on 6 October 2019, along with Anthrax and Pentagram Chile.

On 16 September 2019, it was announced that Christian &quot;Speesy&quot; Giesler had left Kreator after 25 years as their bassist, and was replaced by Frédéric Leclercq, who had recently left DragonForce.

On 26 March 2020, Kreator released a music video for &quot;666 - World Divided&quot;, which marked their first song in three years and their first one since Leclercq joined the band.

On 20 July 2020, Petrozza posted a picture of himself in the studio on his Instagram page, which indicated that Kreator was working on their next album. Petrozza confirmed two months later that Kreator had been writing new material &quot;in the last couple of months&quot;, and that he was recording vocals for the album. In a March 2021 interview, Petrozza revealed that Kreator was supposed to start recording their new album in February, but added that this plan was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. He also went on to say that he wants &quot;the album to come out and go on a world tour right afterwards&quot; and revealed that Arthur Rizk would produce it. The band announced in September 2021 that they had begun recording the album at Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin, Germany with Rizk. In December 2021, Petrozza announced on his Instagram page that their new album would be released in the summer of 2022, preceded by a &quot;new single SOON!&quot;. On 4 February 2022, the band released the title track from &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single, and announced on the same day that the album would be released on 3 June; its release date was later pushed back to 10 June. A video for the second single from &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot;, &quot;Strongest of the Strong&quot;, was released on 8 April 2022, followed less than a month later by its third single &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;. A fourth music video was released for &quot;Conquer and Destroy&quot; on 22 May 2023, though unlike the previous three music videos, this song was not released as a single.

Kreator promoted &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot; with a world tour, including supporting Mercyful Fate on their first North American tour in over 20 years, and touring Europe with Lamb of God and Municipal Waste, during the winter of 2023. They also co-headlined the Klash of the Titans tour throughout the spring of 2023, first in Latin America with Testament, and then in North America with Sepultura, the latter supported by Death Angel and Spiritworld. The band continued to tour in support of &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot; throughout 2024, including touring Japan in January–February with In Flames, co-headlining a North American tour with Testament in September–October (with Possessed as the opening act), and co-headlining a European trek in November–December with Anthrax and support from Testament. They also headlined the Klash of the Ruhrpott festival at Amphitheater Gelsenkirchen in Gelsenkirchen, Germany on 20 July 2024, which saw all of the &quot;Big Teutonic Four&quot; bands (Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and Tankard) on stage together for the first time. Touring for &quot;Hate Über Alles&quot; continued into 2025, with the band headlining the upcoming Demonic Summer tour with Rotting Christ and Warbringer.

By October 2023, Kreator had begun working on new material for their sixteenth studio album, which the band had planned to start recording in early 2025; however, Petrozza has stated that it will not be released until 2026. A documentary about the band is tentatively due in 2025.

Former Kreator bassist Andreas Herz died in December 2023; the news of his death was confirmed by Petrozza.

==Musical style and influences==
Kreator&#x27;s musical style is similar to that of their compatriots Destruction, Sodom and Tankard, which is usually more complex and, since &quot;Violent Revolution&quot; (2001), has been more melodic. Along with those three bands, Kreator has been referred to as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Teutonic thrash metal, and they are often credited with helping pioneer death metal and black metal by containing several elements of what was to become those genres. The band&#x27;s style has changed several times over the years, from a Venom-inspired speed metal sound, later moving into thrash metal, and including a period of transitioning from thrash to industrial and gothic metal throughout the 1990s. In the early 2000s, Kreator returned to their traditional thrash metal sound, which has continued to the present.

Kreator has been influenced by a variety of music, including post-punk bands Siouxsie and the Banshees, hardcore punk bands Bad Religion, D.R.I., the Exploited, GBH and Raw Power, and 1970s and 1980s hard rock and heavy metal bands, including Accept, Bathory, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Kiss, Mercyful Fate, Metallica, Motörhead, Possessed, Raven, Rush, Slayer and Venom.
