<text>CBC Television has aired National Hockey League (NHL) broadcasts under the Hockey Night in Canada (often abbreviated Hockey Night or HNiC) brand that is primarily associated with its Saturday night NHL broadcasts throughout its history in various platforms. The brand is owned by the CBC and was exclusively used by CBC Sports through the end of the 2013–14 NHL season.

Saturday NHL broadcasts began in 1931 on the CNR Radio network, and debuted on television in 1952. Initially games were aired once a week, but doubleheader games had debuted in 1995 at 7:30 pm and 10:30 pm (ET) start times. Since 1998, the games begin at 7:00 pm and 10:00 pm (ET). The broadcast features various segments during the intermissions and between games, as well as pre- and post-game coverage of the night&#x27;s games, and player interviews. It also shows the hosts&#x27; opinions on news and issues occurring in the league.

Ahead of the 2014–15 season, Rogers Media had secured exclusive national multimedia rights to NHL games and would sub-license Saturday night and playoff games to the CBC. In addition, the &quot;HNiC&quot; brand would be licensed to Rogers for Sportsnet-produced Saturday NHL broadcasts airing on CBC Television, as well as the Rogers-owned Citytv and Sportsnet outlets. This sub-license agreement runs through the end of the Rogers deal with the NHL.

== History ==

=== Radio ===
Hockey broadcasting originated with play-by-play radio broadcasts from Toronto&#x27;s Arena Gardens, which began on February 8, 1923, on Toronto station CFCA when Norman Albert announced the third period of play of an intermediate men&#x27;s Ontario Hockey Association game. Foster Hewitt took over announcing duties within a month, and after several years of sporadic coverage that began to include National Hockey League games, the broadcasts went national in 1931 as the &quot;General Motors Hockey Broadcast&quot;. The program began broadcasting Saturday-night Toronto Maple Leafs games on November 12, 1931, over the Canadian National Railway radio network, of which CFCA was an affiliate. The more-powerful CFRB replaced CFCA as the program&#x27;s Toronto flagship station in 1932. The show was sponsored by General Motors Products of Canada and produced by MacLaren Advertising, which had acquired exclusive radio-broadcasting rights for Maple Leaf Gardens from Conn Smythe in 1931 and produced the TV broadcast that became &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; from 1952 until 1988.

The Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) broadcast Montreal Canadiens and Maroons games on its Quebec stations in 1933. Imperial Oil took over sponsorship from General Motors the following year, and the broadcast became known as the &quot;Imperial Esso Hockey Broadcast&quot;. The broadcasts began at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, around the start of the second period of play. The games began to be broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the CRBC&#x27;s successor, in 1936. The program acquired what would become its permanent title—&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;—around that time, which was coined by Foster Hewitt. It featured the Maple Leafs and was hosted by Gordon Calder, with play-by-play announcer Hewitt and colour commentary by Percy Lesueur, in much of Ontario and points west. Montreal Maroons broadcasts were hosted by Doug Smith and Elmer Ferguson in English, and René Lecavalier called Montreal Canadiens games in French. After the Maroons folded in 1938, Smith and Ferguson hosted Canadiens games in English. The popularity of the radio show (and Hewitt) across Canada made it an obvious choice for early Canadian network-television programming.

Although it was never carried on a U.S. radio station, &quot;HNIC&quot; became popular with listeners in the northern United States; if a U.S.-based team (in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, or New York City) was playing in Toronto on a Saturday night, thousands of fans in the American city whose team faced the Leafs would listen to the CBC broadcast via skywave (usually via 50,000-watt flagships CBL or CBM); a game often attracted more listeners to &quot;HNIC&quot; than local stations did.

CBC Radio aired Saturday-night &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcasts through 1965, followed by &quot;Sunday Night NHL Hockey&quot; through 1976 (when the program moved to national television). Toronto&#x27;s CFRB (originally a CNR Radio affiliate) took over the broadcast from CFCA in 1932, and continued to broadcast Maple Leaf games for many years with CBC Radio&#x27;s Toronto station CBL.

=== Television ===

&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; began airing on Saturday nights on CBC Television in 1952. According to the CBC, instant replay made its world debut on a 1955 &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcast; CBC director George Retzlaff made a kinescope of a goal, and replayed it for the television audience seconds later.

Regular-season games were not broadcast in their entirety until 1968, and only one game was televised each Saturday night until the 1990s. From 1952 to 1964, the &quot;HNIC&quot; telecast followed the lead of the radio broadcast by beginning at 9 p.m. ET; games were typically joined in progress shortly before (or during) the second period. Its start time was moved up to 8:30 p.m. ET at the beginning of the 1963–64 season, allowing games to be joined in progress late in the first period. In the fall of 1968, regular-season games were shown in their entirety and the program began at 8 p.m. Although a handful of games were broadcast in colour during the 1966–67 regular season, all &quot;HNIC&quot; games began colour broadcasting during the 1967 Stanley Cup playoffs. From 1965 through 1975, &quot;HNIC&quot; also produced and broadcast a Wednesday-night game on CTV (the CBC&#x27;s privately owned competitor); the midweek games began to be broadcast by local stations during the 1975–76 NHL season.

The Vancouver Canucks joined the NHL in 1970–71, increasing the number of &quot;HNIC&quot; venues from two to three. During the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, four more Canadian teams (the Edmonton Oilers, Quebec Nordiques, Winnipeg Jets, and Calgary Flames) joined the NHL. The Oilers and Flames were featured frequently, since the teams were playoff contenders during the 1980s. The Nordiques, owned by Carling O&#x27;Keefe (a rival of &quot;HNIC&quot; sponsor Molson) with a small Anglophone fan base, were never broadcast from Quebec City during the regular season.

The CBC announced before the preliminary round of the 1976 playoffs that they would not televise any preliminary-round games, and the rights were sold back to the individual Canadian teams. Since Montreal earned a bye into the quarterfinals, this impacted Toronto and Vancouver&#x27;s television coverage. While CHCH and CITY televised all three games of the Toronto-Pittsburgh series (with Bill Hewitt and Brian McFarlane), CHAN picked up the Vancouver-New York Islanders series. Game 1 of the Philadelphia-Toronto playoff series was televised locally to Southern Ontario by CHCH. Game 1 of the 1977 Pittsburgh-Toronto playoff series was seen regionally in southern Ontario on Hamilton&#x27;s CHCH.

During the 1978 playoffs, the NHL Network began simulcasting many games with &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. Dan Kelly, the NHL Network&#x27;s lead play-by-play announcer, covered play-by-play with &quot;HNIC&quot; colour commentators; in Game 7 of the quarterfinal series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Islanders on April 29, 1978, Kelly teamed up with Brian McFarlane. The 1978 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins and the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers were also simulcast.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
On April 9, 1980, the CBC carried the ACTRA Awards ceremony. Game 2 of the Hartford–Montreal playoff series was televised in French and the Edmonton-Philadelphia and Toronto-Minnesota games were shown only on local stations CITV in Edmonton and CHCH in Hamilton, respectively. The Vancouver-Buffalo game was televised by the CBC regionally in British Columbia, since the ACTRA Awards show was tape-delayed into prime time on the west coast.

Except for the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals, the CBC&#x27;s only other nationally televised postseason games that year were the April 23 Boston-Quebec game (Game 6), the April 25 Quebec-Boston game (Game 7), and the May 6 Vancouver-Chicago game (Game 5). All the other games were seen regionally.

CTV had the national rights for the 1986 Calgary-St. Louis playoff series, except in the Calgary market (in which the CBC and Molson retained exclusive rights). CTV was unable to televise Games 2 and 3 of this series due to prior commitments. The CBC was allowed to televise Games 2 and 3 to Alberta and British Columbia, but not nationally.

On April 18, 1988 (during Game 1 of the Montreal–Boston playoff series) at 8:08 p.m. local time, Quebec experienced a power outage. Darkness enveloped Montreal and the Forum; the Forum&#x27;s reserve generators could only illuminate the rink enough to keep the game moving, and the CBC abandoned its coverage after the first period. Chris Cuthbert was assigned by the CBC to report and provide updates on Game 1 of the Washington-New Jersey playoff series. When Quebec blacked out, the CBC tasked Cuthbert with working the rest of the game. In Boston, WSBK-TV lost the picture but continued audio of the game with Fred Cusick and Derek Sanderson by telephone. Canwest/Global aired the 1988 Calgary-Edmonton playoff series nationally, except for the Edmonton and Calgary markets (where the CBC retained exclusive rights).

After Wayne Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, the network began showing occasional double-headers when Canadian teams visited Los Angeles to showcase the sport&#x27;s most popular player. The games were often joined in progress, since the start time for &quot;HNIC&quot; was still 8 p.m. ET, while Gretzky&#x27;s Kings home games began at 7:30 p.m. Pacific (10:30 p.m. ET). Weekly double-headers became permanent during the 1994–95 season, with games starting at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7:30 p.m. PT, respectively. The start times were moved up to 7 p.m. ET and PT in 1998, with a 30-minute pre-game show airing at 6:30 p.m. ET.

==== 2000–2014 ====
Olympic women&#x27;s ice hockey champion Cassie Campbell joined &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; in 2006 as a rink-side reporter, becoming (on October 14, 2006) the first female colour commentator on an &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcast. Campbell substituted when Harry Neale was snowed in at his home in Buffalo. (Helen Hutchinson was the first woman to appear on &quot;HNIC&quot; telecasts in 1974, when she conducted between-period interviews on the Wednesday night CTV telecasts.)

Trevor Pilling became &quot;HNIC&quot; executive producer on July 23, 2010, replacing Sherali Najak. In September 2012, Steve Sloan and Joel Darling became the show&#x27;s executive producers when Pilling became the head of CBC Sports programming.

The CBC&#x27;s deal with the NHL ran through the 2013–14 season, and was replaced in 2014–15 by a sublicensing deal with Rogers Communications. The deal included over-the-air broadcasts of games on the CBC Television network and digital broadcasts on CBCSports.ca. It was reached after controversy during the 2006–07 NHL season, when private broadcaster CTVglobemedia tried to acquire exclusive Canadian distribution rights to the NHL for its own networks (including broadcast network CTV and cable channels TSN and RDS).

The CBC also produced &quot;Hockey Night in Canada Radio&quot;, a daily radio program which premiered on October 1, 2007, on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 122 (also known as Sports Play-by-Play 1). Although the broadcaster called &quot;HNIC Radio&quot; a return &quot;back to the radio airwaves&quot; for &quot;HNIC&quot;, &quot;HNIC Radio&quot; was an NHL-oriented talk show with appearances by &quot;HNIC&quot; hosts and commentators; it did not cover games. After the merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, the show moved to NHL Network Radio (Sirius channel 207 and XM channel 211). Rogers did not take over national radio rights to the NHL until the 2015–16 season, but the CBC ended production of &quot;HNIC Radio&quot; for the 2014–15 season due to high production costs and conflicts with Rogers.

=== 2014: Rogers takeover ===

Negotiating a new contract with the CBC, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman reportedly recognized the broadcaster&#x27;s financial difficulties and offered a smaller package which would have consisted of a national doubleheader on Saturday nights (as opposed to regional coverage of multiple games), reduced playoff coverage, and the loss of digital rights and the All-Star Game. Rights to the remaining properties not covered under the CBC contract would have been offered to other broadcasters. However, CBC Sports&#x27; staff (including executive director Jeffrey Orridge) continued to insist on exclusivity for every Saturday-night game involving Canadian teams. The CBC was unable to reach a deal; the league reportedly aimed for its next round of Canadian television contracts to have a total value of at least $3.2 billion. BCE (owners of Bell Media and previous cable rights-holder TSN) bid for sole national rights to the NHL, and attempted to contact the CBC about a partnership; the CBC Sports staff did not respond. Rogers Communications also made a bid of its own.

On November 26, 2013, the NHL announced a 12-year deal with Rogers for exclusive Canadian television and digital media rights to all NHL broadcasts beginning with the 2014–15 season; the deal was valued at $5.2 billion, twice as much as what NBC paid for its 2011 long-term contract with the league. The CBC sub-licensed a package of games from Rogers, allowing the network to continue airing &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; for at least the first four seasons of the agreement (2014–15 through 2017–18). The last CBC-produced &quot;Hockey Night&quot; broadcast aired on June 13, 2014, when the Los Angeles Kings clinched the Stanley Cup in a four-games-to-one final series over the New York Rangers, ending with a montage set to Queen&#x27;s &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; which included season and playoff highlights interspersed with images and sounds from the CBC&#x27;s six decades of NHL coverage.

The new season had a significant change in format for &quot;Hockey Night&quot;, with games no longer split by region. The CBC was joined by Rogers&#x27; over-the-air Citytv network, the Sportsnet family of specialty channels and (initially) FX Canada, who aired other games nationally with the CBC and shared the &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; brand. Decisions on network assignments for the games were made on a week-by-week basis, ensuring that viewers have live on-air access to every &quot;Hockey Night&quot; game. The CBC continued to cover the NHL All-Star Game, Stanley Cup playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals, with the latter simulcast on a Rogers network if needed. The NHL Winter Classic aired in 2015 on the CBC, moving to Sportsnet the following year.

The CBC did not pay any rights fees to Rogers or the NHL, but Rogers assumed responsibility for production and advertising sales. Promotions for CBC programs are included on CBC simulcasts; Rogers paid the corporation for CBC production staff and rent for offices and Studio 41 of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre for &quot;Hockey Night&quot; and Sportsnet coverage. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; was a financial boon for CBC Television, which received half of its total estimated advertising revenue from the broadcasts. To assign responsibility for televised content, compliance with regulatory guidelines and advertising to Rogers, the &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcasts are broadcast on a part-time television network owned by Rogers&#x27; Sportsnet subsidiary and affiliated with the CBC&#x27;s English-language television stations (although CBC Television branding and continuity is still used on air). A licence for the arrangement was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in April 2015.

The loss of NHL rights accompanied other reductions in CBC funding and revenue, leading the corporation to cut its budget, staff, and programming. In April 2014, the CBC decided not to compete for NHL or other professional-sports broadcast rights. Among staff members laid off were the advertising sales staff who handled &quot;Hockey Night&quot;. In an internal staff notification of the Rogers deal, CBC president Hubert T. Lacroix wrote that the arrangement with Rogers &quot;may not be the ideal scenario&quot; for the CBC but the network would have suffered a major blow to its prestige if it was excluded from NHL broadcasts. Lacroix said that the deal &quot;is the right outcome for Canadian hockey fans&quot;, allowing &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; to remain on the CBC for a wider audience at a low cost before the 2015 Pan-American Games and 2016 Summer Olympics (whose broadcast rights were owned by the broadcaster). CBC staff called the agreement as a &quot;structured exit&quot; from NHL coverage if Rogers did not extend it.

Rogers&#x27; &quot;Hockey Night&quot; was initially guided by Scott Moore, appointed Rogers Media president of Sportsnet and NHL properties in January 2014; Moore, with Rogers Media since 2010, was a former CBC Sports president. Rogers reviewed on-air content and production of games and ancillary content, including announcers and other personnel. &quot;Hockey Night&quot;″s new look was revealed on March 10, 2014, when CBC personality George Stroumboulopoulos became studio host of &quot;Hockey Night&quot; and Citytv&#x27;s Sunday night &quot;Hometown Hockey&quot; package with Sportsnet&#x27;s Daren Millard and Jeff Marek. Stroumboulopoulos, an alumnus of Toronto sports radio station CJCL and host of a CBC talk show, was seen as an effort by Rogers to expand &quot;Hockey Night&quot; appeal to a younger demographic.

Although Ron MacLean ceded hosting &quot;Hockey Night&quot; to Stroumboulopoulos, he remained with Don Cherry on the &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; segment and was the on-location host of Sportsnet&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Hockey&quot; games. Cherry, called &quot;iconic&quot; by Rogers president Keith Pelley, remained under contract to the CBC until he was released on November 11, 2019. Several other CBC &quot;Hockey Night&quot; veterans continued in roles with &quot;HNIC&quot; and Rogers&#x27; NHL coverage, including game announcers Jim Hughson (who retired in 2021) and Bob Cole (who retired in 2019); reporters Elliotte Friedman, Scott Oake, and Cassie Campbell-Pascall; and analysts Glenn Healy, Kelly Hrudey, Craig Simpson, Garry Galley, and P. J. Stock. New hires included game announcers Dave Randorf and Paul Romanuk.

The CBC-Rogers agreement reduced the CBC&#x27;s advertising revenue, which fell by 37 percent in the last quarter of 2014 from the previous year. Industry analysts reported that, despite the agreement&#x27;s increased promotion of other CBC programming, the corporation might lose more advertising revenue during the Stanley Cup playoffs.

==== 2016–present ====
In June 2016, Rogers announced that George Stroumboulopoulos was leaving Sportsnet. Ron MacLean was reinstated as the studio host of &quot;Hockey Night&quot; early game, in addition to his on-location role on &quot;Hometown Hockey&quot;. David Amber was the late-game studio host.

Bob Cole retired in April 2019, and Don Cherry was fired after a November 9 incident during his &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; for comments that suggested Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans but do not wear Remembrance poppies.

On June 5, 2020, Sportsnet announced that it had hired TSN commentator and former &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcaster Chris Cuthbert. Jim Hughson retired before the 2021–22 season. &quot;Hockey Night&quot; features, until 2019, included the &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; segment during the first intermission of the first game.

== Coverage overview ==

=== Regular season ===

==== Pre-game show ====
&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; typically begins at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time (a little more than 30 minutes before the first game&#x27;s opening faceoff) with &quot;Hockey Central Saturday&quot;, a pre-game show. Ron MacLean hosts &quot;Hockey Central Saturday&quot; with analysts Kelly Hrudey, Elliotte Friedman, Kevin Bieksa, and Jennifer Botterill.

==== Game 1 ====

The first game of the Saturday night doubleheader typically originates in Eastern Canada, beginning at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT). Since 2021–22, Chris Cuthbert, Craig Simpson, and Kyle Bukauskas serve as the lead broadcast team, primarily calling the CBC Toronto Maple Leafs broadcast. Other Eastern Canada games aired on Citytv are called by the secondary team of John Bartlett, Garry Galley, and Shawn Mackenzie. When three or more early games involve Canadian teams, Sportsnet uses its regional announcers for those broadcasts. From 2008 to 2020, Jim Hughson was the lead play-by-play voice of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; until his retirement on September 21, 2021; Hughson only called national Vancouver Canucks home games during the previous season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the 2014–15 season, additional games involving Canadian teams were split to air regionally on CBC stations; Winnipeg Jets games were often seen in Central Canada, and Ottawa Senators games were seen in the Ottawa area and Eastern Canada.

During the 2015–16 season, the second-most-important game (typically featuring either the Jets, the Senators or the Montreal Canadiens) was allocated to Citytv. Sportsnet also sometimes simulcast the CBC&#x27;s or Citytv&#x27;s featured games, and broadcasters (of teams) regionally contracted to Sportsnet as needed. Although second-tier games were shown on Citytv during the inaugural season, these games were later moved to Sportsnet (with Citytv sometimes airing all-U.S. games or simulcasting the CBC game) to encourage pay-television subscriptions.

Until the end of the first period on November 9, 2019, MacLean hosted &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;; the segment featured former NHL Coach of the Year Don Cherry. Cherry analyzed the first period(s) of the game(s) in progress, expressed his opinions about issues affecting the sport (or the league), and gave tips on various points of hockey; MacLean was Cherry&#x27;s foil. &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; was followed by highlights of other evening games. MacLean also hosts &quot;Saturday Headlines&quot;, the second-intermission segment, with Hrudey, Friedman, Bieska, and Botterill. The segment usually focuses on the previous week&#x27;s NHL news, along with highlights and analysis of the games in progress.

Until November 9, 2019, after the &quot;three stars&quot; selection of the first game(s), and before the face-off of Game 2, MacLean and Cherry return to give updates on scores and highlights from around the league. The commentators for Game 2 preview the upcoming contest. Since then, the second-intermission crew return to give updates on scores and highlights from around the league.

==== Cherry&#x27;s removal from &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and end of &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; ====
On the November 9, 2019 &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;, Cherry suggested that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans without wearing remembrance poppies: &quot;You people that come here ... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that! These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada! These guys paid the biggest price.&quot; The Royal Canadian Legion, Canada&#x27;s poppy distributor, denounced Cherry&#x27;s statement: &quot;Mr. Cherry&#x27;s personal opinion was hurtful, divisive and in no way condoned by the Legion.&quot; Sportsnet apologized for his remarks, stating that they were discriminatory and offensive and &quot;do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.&quot; His co-host, Ron MacLean, tweeted regret for giving a thumbs-up and for allowing Cherry to make the comments. The NHL released a statement on Cherry&#x27;s comments: &quot;The comments made last night were offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.&quot; Cherry later told the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; that he would not apologize: &quot;I have had my say.&quot;

The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) said that its internal systems was overloaded by a high number of complaints. Two days later, on November 11, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that Cherry had been fired: &quot;Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night&#x27;s broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down.&quot; Cherry said to a &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; reporter, &quot;I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers ... I would have liked to continue doing &#x27;Coach&#x27;s Corner&#x27;. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn&#x27;t &#x27;Coach&#x27;s Corner. He later said that if he had to do it again, he would have said &quot;everybody&quot;. The following Saturday, MacLean reflected on the incident during &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; (his first without Cherry) and announced the end of &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;.

==== Game 2 ====
The second game airs at 10 p.m. ET (7 p.m. PT, 8 p.m. MT) on the CBC and Sportsnet, originating from a Mountain or Pacific Time Zone city and usually featuring at least one of Western Canada&#x27;s three teams: the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers or Vancouver Canucks. Regular-season games rarely last longer than three hours since the introduction of quicker faceoffs, and every double-header game is seen in its entirety.

Since 2021–22, for Western Canada games, Harnarayan Singh, Louie DeBrusk, and Scott Oake are the lead broadcast team, while from 2016-2022, David Amber took over MacLean as host. Like the early games, when at least two Western Canadian teams played, Sportsnet assigned regional announcers to call the games. From 2012–13 until early in the 2019–20 season, the first intermission of Game 2 contained a short analysis segment with Ron MacLean and Don Cherry followed by &quot;Inside the Game&quot; and &quot;Scoreboard Saturday&quot; with highlights of earlier games.

Game 2 was followed on the CBC from 2000–01 to 2014–15 by &quot;After Hours&quot;, a post-game show hosted by Oake and DeBrusk from the game&#x27;s arena. The program featured a wrap-up of the night&#x27;s games and a lengthy interview with (and viewer questions to) a player or coach, usually from one of the game&#x27;s teams. &quot;After Hours&quot; was revived for 2016–17, and is shown on Sportsnet and the CBC.

Only on rare occasions has &quot;HNIC&quot; broadcast regular-season games involving two U.S.-based teams, and this has usually been due to exceptional circumstances. Special occasions have included Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s final game in 1999 (which actually took place on a Sunday afternoon), the retirement of Steve Yzerman&#x27;s jersey in 2007, Sidney Crosby&#x27;s comeback game in Pittsburgh against the New York Islanders in 2011, and early editions of the league&#x27;s major outdoor games (such as the Winter Classic). However, due to their decline in popularity, outdoor games are no longer shown on the CBC or branded &quot;HNIC&quot; unless a Canadian team is involved.

=== Playoffs ===

The CBC provides extensive Stanley Cup playoff coverage every spring (focusing on Canadian teams), and has exclusive English-language rights to the Stanley Cup Finals. Its playoff coverage and rights to the Finals continue under the Rogers sublicensing agreement, with coverage shared with Sportsnet and all Canadian-based teams&#x27; series being shown on CBC. Due to rights agreements with Rogers, playoff games are not available to livestream on the CBC Gem or CBC Sports online platforms, even if the broadcast airs on CBC Television.

==== Stanley Cup Finals ====

In 1972, &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; moved playoff coverage from the CBC to CTV to avoid a lengthy NABET strike against the CBC. Bob Cole, Dan Kelly and Jim Robson shared the play-by-play for the CBC&#x27;s 1980 coverage.

In 1986, the CBC televised games one and two of the Stanley Cup Finals in Montreal and Calgary; it televised games three, four and five nationally. When CTV televised games one and two, both games were blacked out in Montreal and Calgary.

The first game four (May 24) of the 1988 Stanley Cup Finals was hampered by fog before a power outage caused its cancellation with the Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins tied, 3–3. The CBC televised that game and the &quot;official&quot; fourth game (on May 26), which the Oilers won 6–3.

=== &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot; ===

Since 2000, the CBC has aired an annual &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot; to celebrate the game. The afternoon broadcast of hockey-related features leads up to a triple-header of NHL games with the seven Canadian teams: the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and Winnipeg Jets. The 2008 edition featured four games which included two American teams (Detroit and Colorado) with the six Canadian teams, due to the NHL&#x27;s schedule format. COVID-19 travel restrictions in 2021 led to the Edmonton Oilers missing out; seven teams (an odd number) were in the temporary North Division.

The broadcast includes live segments from smaller communities across the country, and features panel discussions on issues facing &quot;Canada&#x27;s game&quot; at the amateur and professional levels. Usually telecast on a Saturday in mid-February, it was shown in early January due to the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics; the 2007 event was also held in January (January 13). The 2010 broadcast was on January 30 because of the February 2010 Winter Olympics, and the 2014 event was on January 18 due to the February 2014 Winter Olympics.

&quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot; has included world-record all-night pick-up games from Red Deer, Alberta (in 2001) and Windsor, Nova Scotia (2002). Viewers saw the games, without commentary, after the CBC ended regular programming for the night.

&quot;HDIC&quot; continued under the Rogers agreement, with Scotiabank the sponsor. Since Sportsnet also holds national broadcast rights to the Canadian Hockey League, the 2015 edition included a prime-time Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) game between the hosting Halifax Mooseheads and the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles.

When the 2005 edition was cancelled, TSN aired &quot;Hockey Lives Here: Canada&#x27;s Game&quot;. The telecast, based at the World Pond Hockey Championships in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick, featured NHL players playing an exhibition game to raise money for charities in Hamilton, Ontario.

=== Lockout programming ===
The CBC replaced &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; with &quot;Movie Night in Canada&quot;, a block of Saturday-night movies hosted by Ron MacLean from junior-hockey venues, during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. A labour agreement was reached for the 2005–06 NHL season. &quot;Movie Night in Canada&quot; was revived in 2020, when league play was suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 1994–95 and 2012–13 lockouts, the CBC aired classic &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; games.

=== Other languages ===
&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; has produced special telecasts of games in other languages to accommodate the country&#x27;s multiculturalism, primarily as part of &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot;. &quot;HDIC&quot; simulcast a 2007 game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks on the TLN cable channel in Italian, with features and commentary by soccer host Alf De Blasis. It televised a 2010 game in the Inuit language Inuktitut, with commentary by CBC North&#x27;s Charlie Panigoniak and Annie Ford, and matches have been presented in Cree, Hindi, Punjabi, Tagalog, Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.

The CBC broadcast one series per round during the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs in Mandarin, and added a regular-season schedule of games in Punjabi (Canada&#x27;s third- and fifth-most-spoken languages, after English and French) on the network&#x27;s website and some cable and satellite providers. It suspended the Punjabi broadcasts just before the 2010–11 season, but coverage was restored for the 2013 season with a new sponsorship deal. With the transition to the Rogers contract, the Punjabi broadcasts moved to Rogers&#x27; multicultural Omni Television stations as &quot;Hockey Night in Canada: Punjabi Edition&quot;.

Harnarayan Singh&#x27;s Punjabi call of the game-winning Pittsburgh Penguins goal by Nick Bonino during the first game of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals went viral. Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan, who showed footage of the call to the team as part of a video recap before game two, called it &quot;entertaining&quot;. Singh was invited to Pittsburgh to join the Penguins&#x27; Stanley Cup celebrations. On November 30, 2016, Singh began to also participate in English-language broadcasts for Sportsnet.

In 2020, Clarence Iron, Earl Wood, and John Chabot called a Montreal Canadiens-Carolina Hurricanes game in Cree. Building on its 2019 coverage of &quot;Rogers Hometown Hockey&quot; in Cree, APTN hosts &quot;HNIC in Cree&quot; every Saturday night; Clarence Iron calls the game with host Earl Wood and analysts John Chabot and Jason Chamakese. Although Cree broadcasts were suspended during the pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season, a push ensured the return of consistent, weekly Plains Cree hockey coverage. The Cree broadcast team is working to translate hockey terms such as &quot;slapshot&quot; ( ), &quot;faceoff&quot; ( ), and &quot;rink&quot; ( ) into the language. In January 2025, it was announced that APTN would also carry three games in Inuktitut through the remainder of the season,

==== French ====

The CBC&#x27;s French sister network, Ici Radio-Canada Télé (then known as Télévision de Radio-Canada), aired with Montreal Canadiens games on Saturday evenings. The network had also aired Quebec Nordiques and Ottawa Senators games occasionally during the regular season (if the Canadiens were not playing that night) and the Stanley Cup Finals.

During the 2002–03 season, RDS secured exclusive French-language rights to the NHL. The deal, negotiated with the Canadiens rather than the NHL, was meant to ensure a consistent home for all Canadiens games. Radio-Canada did not bid for the rights, saying that it could not devote so much airtime to hockey. The announcement angered Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who suggested that the network was violating its licence conditions by not airing . When Radio-Canada carried , play-by-play announcers included René Lecavalier, Richard Garneau, and Claude Quenneville.

Radio-Canada reached an agreement to produce the Saturday-night games as , simulcast on Radio-Canada and RDS. The agreement was terminated after the 2004 playoffs, but the RDS-produced replacement () continued to be simulcast on Radio-Canada outside Quebecwhere RDS has limited distributionthrough the 2005–2006 season. Radio-Canada stopped simulcasting RDS broadcasts in 2006–2007, and Rogers sold the French-language rights to TVA Sports.

== Availability outside Canada ==
When &quot;HNIC&quot; was on radio, it was broadcast over several powerful CBC clear-channel stations whose nighttime signals reached much of the northern United States; the games had a following in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and New York, which also had NHL teams at the time. Foster Hewitt acknowledged the listeners in his opening greeting, &quot;Hello Canada, and hockey fans in the United States and Newfoundland&quot; (before Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949; the line is immortalized in the opening montage of today&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night&quot; telecasts). This continued into the television era, waning in recent years with the expansion of local-team TV coverage on regional sports networks; some C-band satellite dishes, however, can still receive CBC over-the-air feeds. U.S. cable television outlets near the international border (including Metro Detroit, Seattle, Buffalo, Burlington, Vermont and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan) typically carry a nearby CBC affiliate on their systems, although some systems carry a non-regional station). CBC stations are generally carried within about 150 miles of the border, and are not blacked out.

During the 2008–09 season, &quot;Hockey Night&quot; main games were simulcast weekly in the United States on NHL Network with pre- and post-game shows. If U.S.-based teams appear in these games, the telecast is blacked out in the markets of the participating teams or is televised by the U.S. team&#x27;s local broadcaster. During the 2009–10 season, only the first game of the &quot;HNIC&quot; doubleheader was simulcast live on NHL Network; the second game and the post-game &quot;After Hours&quot; program was shown Sunday on tape delay; the only exception was &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot;. Since the Rogers takeover, &quot;HNIC&quot; on NHL Network carries games regardless of broadcaster (the CBC or a Rogers network).

&quot;NHL Center Ice&quot; offers some &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; games at the same time as the CBC broadcast, usually regional &quot;Hockey Night&quot; games from Ottawa or Montreal. &quot;Center Ice&quot; generally shows the 7 p.m. ET games, because the late games are usually national.

From 2006 to 2021, the NBC networks (originally OLN and Versus) simulcast CBC coverage of some games (generally first- and second-round matchups from Western Canada) instead of using their own crews and announcers. During the early 1990s, SportsChannel America similarly covered the Stanley Cup playoffs. Versus and NBCSN, its later incarnation, continued to use CBC and Sportsnet feeds to augment its own playoff coverage. All games broadcast under the HNIC brand are now available on ESPN+, as part of parent company ESPN’s 7-year agreement with the NHL. Blackout restrictions will apply for all games.

&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; is also broadcast live (and occasionally as-live) in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Viaplay. Although the pre- and post-game segments are not included, both games and the segments between periods are shown. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; was also seen in other European markets on ESPN America, distributed on cable and satellite platforms until 2013 (when ESPN America closed) Hockey Night in Canada is now broadcast in the UK and Ireland on Premier Sports now (Viaplay Sports in the UK). Until its closure in 2014, Canadian Forces Radio and Television rebroadcast &quot;HNIC&quot; games to Canadian Forces members overseas.

== Announcers ==
Foster Hewitt, who welcomed Canadians to the radio broadcast each week, demonstrated that his style could also work on television in 1952. Hewitt continued to work in television for many years (including the 1972 Summit Series between an NHL all-star team and the Soviet national team), and his style of play-by-play announcing remained the same on television as it was on radio. Hewitt was followed by Danny Gallivan, Hewitt&#x27;s son, Bill Hewitt, Dan Kelly, Bob Cole, Dick Irvin Jr., Jim Robson, and Jim Hughson. Previous show hosts included Wes McKnight, Ward Cornell, Frank Selke Jr., Jack Dennett, Dan Kelly, Ted Darling, Dave Hodge, Brian McFarlane, Don Cherry, Dick Irvin Jr., and George Stroumboulopoulos.

Ron MacLean is the host during the 2024–25 season. Chris Cuthbert, Harnarayan Singh and John Bartlett are the play-by-play announcers, and Craig Simpson, Louie DeBrusk, Garry Galley and Greg Millen are the color commentators.

On June 5, 2020, Sportsnet announced that it had hired TSN commentator and former &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcaster Chris Cuthbert. Cuthbert joined &quot;HNIC&quot; in time for the NHL post-COVID return, calling games from Edmonton. Dave Randorf&#x27;s contract was not renewed, and he joined the Tampa Bay Lightning as their play-by-play announcer. Hughson announced his retirement after the 2020–21 season, and Cuthbert assumed the lead play-by-play role.

== Theme music ==

=== 1952–1968 ===
The television show&#x27;s original theme song was &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Game&quot;, a march composed by Howard Cable. The CBC and MacLaren Advertising, the advertising agency responsible for the broadcasts at the time, later replaced it with the &quot;Esso Happy Motoring Song&quot;.

=== 1968–2008: &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; ===
The companies commissioned &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot;, composed in 1968 by Dolores Claman and orchestrated by Jerry Toth. The CBC&#x27;s most recent licence to use &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; expired at the conclusion of the 2007–08 NHL season. Claman&#x27;s publisher issued a statement on June 4, 2008, that the CBC would not be renewing its rights to the composition. CBC Sports head Scott Moore denied the reports, saying that the CBC wanted to keep the song and that negotiations on a new licence agreement for the song were ongoing.

==== 2008: The CBC loses rights to &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; ====
On June 6, 2008, the CBC announced that it could not reach an acceptable agreement to renew its licence. Rights to &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; were picked up by CTV, which began using it for hockey broadcasts on its TSN and RDS sports channels during the 2008–09 season. (The theme was also featured during the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, aired on CTV.) The CBC said that it had offered nearly $1 million for perpetual rights to Claman&#x27;s theme, but Copyright Music was asking for $2.5 to $3 million. Copyright Music turned it down because it was &quot; ... a settlement that barely covered our legal bills, let alone losses.&quot; One proposed payment method would have allowed the CBC to continue using the theme at a cost of $500 per play ($65,000 annually) while not giving the corporation ownership of the music. Despite being contacted by five parties interested in buying Claman&#x27;s theme, &quot;[Copyright Music] had no desire to start a bidding war.&quot;

Moore said, &quot;We have no real idea why the deal fell apart. We&#x27;re not sure why because the other side hasn&#x27;t communicated with us.&quot; According to Copyright Music, Moore gave them an unrealistic deadline of 24 hours to meet him when his client was five time zones away.

Moore also said that he did not think &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; would lose viewers if he lost the theme song: &quot;Hockey&#x27;s a game, not a song&quot;. Mike Myers disagreed with Moore&#x27;s ambivalence towards the song, calling it &quot; ... the second anthem [of Canada]&quot; Canadian jazz-fusion band the Shuffle Demons jokingly introduced it as &quot; ... [Canada&#x27;s] national anthem&quot; during performances. In a CBC-website poll asking, &quot;Can Canada go on as we know it without the &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; theme?&quot;, 84 percent said no.

=== Finding a new theme: Canada&#x27;s Hockey Anthem Challenge ===
After the loss of &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot; to CTV, the CBC sponsored a nationwide search (powered by the Filemobile media platform) for a new theme in collaboration with the Nettwerk label. The contest began on June 10, 2008; by August 31, the end of the submissions period, the network received over 14,000 entries. They were reduced to five semi-finalists, whose themes were re-arranged by producer Bob Rock and presented for public voting:

# &quot;Ice Warriors&quot;Gerry Mosby
# &quot;Sticks to the Ice&quot;Robert Fraser Burke
# &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;Graham McRae
# &quot;Let the Game Begin&quot;Christian St-Roch and Jimmy Tanaka
# &quot;Canadian Gold&quot;Colin Oberst

&quot;Hockey Scores&quot;, one of the highest-rated submissions, was not chosen as a semi-finalist. Written by Logan Aubé of Aurora, Ontario, the song is described by the &quot;National Post&quot; as &quot;an endearingly insane cacophony of screaming babies, screeching animals and gunshot blasts&quot;, and by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as sounding &quot;a lot like a baby riding an unco-operative sheep through an industrial grinder&quot;. Aubé originally posted the song on Something Awful, asking participants to vote for it on the CBC&#x27;s contest website. &quot;Hockey Scores&quot; quickly became the most viewed and among the highest rated of the contest&#x27;s
submissions, though the CBC would not make the decision based on popularity alone.

Voting began on October 4, 2008, with two finalists picked for a final one-day vote.

==== October 11, 2008–2014: &quot;Canadian Gold&quot; arr. Oberst ====
The two finalists—Burke&#x27;s &quot;Sticks to the Ice&quot; and Oberst&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Gold&quot;—were announced on October 9, 2008. On October 11, after a final round of voting, &quot;Canadian Gold&quot; was announced by Don Cherry on &quot;Scotiabank Hockey Tonight&quot; as the new &quot;HNIC&quot; theme. Oberst received $100,000 plus 50 percent of the song&#x27;s royalties, the other half of which would be donated to minor hockey. The CBC received exclusive rights to the song for three years, and renewed its rights for the 2011–2012 season.

==== 2014–present: &quot;Canadian Gold&quot; arr. Herberman ====

A re-orchestrated version of the theme was introduced for the 2014–15 season, arranged and orchestrated by John Herberman and recorded in Toronto by a 50-piece orchestra. Herberman also created an extensive library of new stings and bumpers derived from the main theme.

== Awards ==
&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; has received four Gemini Awards from six nominations, mostly for Ron MacLean:
*1992: Best Sports Broadcaster: Ron MacLean
*1994: Best Sports Broadcaster: Ron MacLean
*2004: Best Host or Interviewer in a Sports Program or Sportscast: Ron MacLean
** Best Sports Program or Series: Joel Darling, Chris Irwin, Sherali Najak
*2006: Best Host or Interviewer in a Sports Program or Sportscast: Ron MacLean

== Criticism ==

=== Programming ===
Critics of &quot;HNIC&quot; programming allege that the program favours the Toronto Maple Leafs. The CBC did not air the March 11, 2006 pregame sweater-retirement ceremony for Canadiens legend (and slapshot inventor Bernard &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Geoffrion), continuing its planned broadcast of a Toronto Maple Leafs-Tampa Bay Lightning game; Geoffrion had died earlier in the day. The CBC devoted portions of its coverage to Geoffrion (including a pregame tribute and acknowledgements during the first intermission and on &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;), and the ceremony was broadcast in full by French-language outlets. A CBC spokesperson said that the network received a &quot;handful&quot; of complaints about the lack of coverage; if the broadcaster aired the ceremony in full, it would have preempted the Leafs game for 40 minutes. An &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; article considered the decision an example of perceived bias towards the Maple Leafs by the CBC, which did not want to &quot;offend&quot; their fans by not showing the full game.

=== Content ===

Criticism of &quot;HNIC&quot; content often focused on Don Cherry, who made controversial statements during his live on-air segments. Cherry was criticized for insulting Québécois and European players, some of whom he called &quot;soft&quot;. According to Cherry, Americans were ruining the NHL. Despite these controversies, Cherry&#x27;s popularity among Canadians endured.

The Rogers-produced &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; was shortened from 10 minutes to five, which was criticized by Cherry and MacLean during the first segment of the new season. The following Monday, Scott Moore had a brief discussion with Cherry; he laughingly said, &quot;If you have more to talk about, all you need to do is make sure you tell the executive producer what you want to talk about and we&#x27;ll make sure you have lots of time.&quot;

<text>Lycopodiopsida is a class of vascular plants also known as lycopsids, lycopods, or lycophytes. Members of the class are also called clubmosses, firmosses, spikemosses and quillworts. They have dichotomously branching stems bearing simple leaves called microphylls and reproduce by means of spores borne in sporangia on the sides of the stems at the bases of the leaves. Although living species are small, during the Carboniferous, extinct tree-like forms (Lepidodendrales) formed huge forests that dominated the landscape and contributed to coal deposits.

The nomenclature and classification of plants with microphylls varies substantially among authors. A consensus classification for extant (living) species was produced in 2016 by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG I), which places them all in the class Lycopodiopsida, which includes the classes Isoetopsida and Selaginellopsida used in other systems. (See Table 2.) Alternative classification systems have used ranks from division (phylum) to subclass. In the PPG I system, the class is divided into three orders, Lycopodiales, Isoetales and Selaginellales.

==Characteristics==
Club-mosses (Lycopodiales) are homosporous, but the genera &quot;Selaginella&quot; (spikemosses) and &quot;Isoetes&quot; (quillworts) are heterosporous, with female spores larger than the male. As a result of fertilisation, the female gametophyte produces sporophytes. A few species of &quot;Selaginella&quot; such as &quot;S. apoda&quot; and &quot;S. rupestris&quot; are also viviparous; the gametophyte develops on the mother plant, and only when the sporophyte&#x27;s primary shoot and root is developed enough for independence is the new plant dropped to the ground. Many club-moss gametophytes are mycoheterotrophic and long-lived, residing underground for several years before emerging from the ground and progressing to the sporophyte stage.

Lycopodiaceae and spikemosses (&quot;Selaginella&quot;) are the only vascular plants with biflagellate sperm, an ancestral trait in land plants otherwise only seen in bryophytes. The only exceptions are &quot;Isoetes&quot; and &quot;Phylloglossum&quot;, which independently has evolved multiflagellated sperm cells with approximately 20 flagella (sperm flagella in other vascular plants can count at least thousand at most, but the number is generally much lower, and flagella are completely absent in seed plants except for Ginkgo and cycads). Because only two flagella puts a size limit on the genome, we find the largest known genomes in the clade in &quot;Isoetes&quot;, as multiflagellated sperm is not exposed for the same selection pressure as biflagellate sperm in regard of size.

==Taxonomy==
===Phylogeny===
The extant lycophytes are vascular plants (tracheophytes) with microphyllous leaves, distinguishing them from the euphyllophytes (plants with megaphyllous leaves). The sister group of the extant lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives are generally believed to be the zosterophylls, a paraphyletic or plesion group. Ignoring some smaller extinct taxa, the evolutionary relationships are as shown below.

, there was broad agreement, supported by both molecular and morphological evidence, that the extant lycophytes fell into three groups, treated as orders in PPG I, and that these, both together and individually, are monophyletic, being related as shown in the cladogram below:
===Classification===
The rank and name used for the taxon holding the extant lycophytes (and their closest extinct relatives) varies widely. Table 1 below shows some of the highest ranks that have been used. Systems may use taxa at a rank lower than the highest given in the table with the same circumscription; for example, a system that uses Lycopodiophyta as the highest ranked taxon may place all of its members in a single subclass.

Some systems use a higher rank for a more broadly defined taxon of lycophytes that includes some extinct groups more distantly related to extant lycophytes, such as the zosterophylls. For example, Kenrick &amp; Crane (1997) use the subdivision Lycophytina for this purpose, with all extant lycophytes falling within the class Lycopsida. Other sources exclude the zosterophylls from any &quot;lycophyte&quot; taxon.

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the three orders are placed in a single class, Lycopodiopsida, holding all extant lycophyte species. Older systems have used either three classes, one for each order, or two classes, recognizing the closer relationship between Isoetales and Selaginellales. In these cases, a higher ranked taxon is needed to contain the classes (see Table 1). As Table 2 shows, the names &quot;Lycopodiopsida&quot; and &quot;Isoetopsida&quot; are both ambiguous.

===Subdivisions===
The PPG I system divides up the extant lycophytes as shown below.
*Class Lycopodiopsida (3 orders)
:*Order Lycopodiales (1 extant family)
::*Family Lycopodiaceae (16 extant genera)
:*Order Isoetales (1 extant family)
::*Family Isoetaceae (1 extant genus)
:*Order Selaginellales (1 extant family)
::*Family Selaginellaceae (1 extant genus)

Some extinct groups, such as zosterophylls, fall outside the limits of the taxon as defined by the classifications in Table 1 above. However, other extinct groups fall within some circumscriptions of this taxon. Taylor et al. (2009) and Mauseth (2014) include a number of extinct orders in their division (phylum) Lycophyta, although they differ on the placement of some genera. The orders included by Taylor et al. are:
*Order †Drepanophycales (including &quot;Baragwanathia&quot;, &quot;Drepanophycus&quot; and &quot;Asteroxylon&quot;)
*Order †Protolepidodendrales
*Order †Lepidodendrales
*Order †Pleuromeiales
Mauseth uses the order †Asteroxylales, placing &quot;Baragwanathia&quot; in the Protolepidodendrales.

The relationship between some of these extinct groups and the extant ones was investigated by Kenrick and Crane in 1997. When the genera they used are assigned to orders, their suggested relationship is:
==Evolution==

The Lycopodiopsida are distinguished from other vascular plants by the possession of microphylls and by their sporangia, which are lateral as opposed to terminal and which open (dehisce) transversely rather than longitudinally. In some groups, the sporangia are borne on sporophylls that are clustered into strobili. Phylogenetic analysis shows the group branching off at the base of the evolution of vascular plants and they have a long evolutionary history. Fossils are abundant worldwide, especially in coal deposits. Fossils that can be ascribed to the Lycopodiopsida first appear in the Silurian period, along with a number of other vascular plants. The Silurian &quot;Baragwanathia longifolia&quot; is one of the earliest identifiable species. &quot;Lycopodolica&quot; is another Silurian genus which appears to be an early member of this group. The group evolved roots independently from the rest of the vascular plants.

From the Devonian onwards, some species grew large and tree-like. Devonian fossil lycopsids from Svalbard, growing in equatorial regions, raise the possibility that they drew down enough carbon dioxide to change the Earth&#x27;s climate significantly. During the Carboniferous, tree-like plants (such as &quot;Lepidodendron&quot;, &quot;Sigillaria&quot;, and other extinct genera of the order &quot;Lepidodendrales&quot;) formed huge forests that dominated the landscape. Unlike modern trees, leaves grew out of the entire surface of the trunk and branches, but fell off as the plant grew, leaving only a small cluster of leaves at the top. The lycopsids had distinctive features such as &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycophytes, which were marked with diamond-shaped scars where they once had leaves. Quillworts (order Isoetales) and &quot;Selaginella&quot; are considered their closest extant relatives and share some unusual features with these fossil lycopods, including the development of both bark, cambium and wood, a modified shoot system acting as roots, bipolar and secondary growth, and an upright stance. The remains of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycopods formed many fossil coal deposits. In Fossil Grove, Victoria Park, Glasgow, Scotland, fossilized lycophytes can be found in sandstone.

The Lycopodiopsida had their maximum diversity in the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous), particularly tree-like &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; and &quot;Sigillaria&quot; that dominated tropical wetlands. The complex ecology of these tropical rainforests collapsed during the Middle Pennsylvanian due to a change in climate. In Euramerica, tree-like species apparently became extinct in the Late Pennsylvanian, as a result of a transition to a much drier climate, giving way to conifers, ferns and horsetails. In Cathaysia (now South China), tree-like species survived into the Permian. Nevertheless, lycopodiopsids are rare in the Lopingian (latest Permian), but regained dominance in the Induan (earliest Triassic), particularly &quot;Pleuromeia&quot;. After the worldwide Permian–Triassic extinction event, members of this group pioneered the repopulation of habitats as opportunistic plants. The heterogeneity of the terrestrial plant communities increased markedly during the Middle Triassic when plant groups like horsetails, ferns, pteridosperms, cycads, ginkgos and conifers resurfaced and diversified quickly.

==Microbial associations==
Lycophytes form associations with microbes such as fungi and bacteria, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and endophytic associations.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal associations have been characterized in all stages of the lycophyte lifecycle: mycoheterotrophic gametophyte, photosynthetic surface-dwelling gametophyte, young sporophyte, and mature sporophyte. Arbuscular mycorrhizae have been found in &quot;Selaginella spp.&quot; roots and vesicles.

During the mycoheterotrophic gametophyte lifecycle stage, lycophytes gain all of their carbon from subterranean glomalean fungi. In other plant taxa, glomalean networks transfer carbon from neighboring plants to mycoheterotrophic gametophytes. Something similar could be occurring in &quot;Huperzia hypogeae&quot; gametophytes which associate with the same glomalean phenotypes as nearby &quot;Huperzia hypogeae&quot; sporophytes.

Fungal endophytes have been found in many species of lycophyte, however the function of these endophytes in host plant biology is not known. Endophytes of other plant taxa perform roles such as improving plant competitive fitness, conferring biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, promoting plant growth through phytohormone production or production of limiting nutrients. However, some endophytic fungi in lycophytes do produce medically relevant compounds. &quot;Shiraia&quot; sp Slf14 is an endophytic fungus present in &quot;Huperzia serrata&quot; that produces Huperzine A, a biomedical compound which has been approved as a drug in China and a dietary supplement in the U.S. to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease. This fungal endophyte can be cultivated much more easily and on a much larger scale than &quot;H. serrata&quot; itself which could increase the availability of Huperzine A as a medicine.

==Uses==
The spores of lycopods are highly flammable and so have been used in fireworks. Lycopodium powder, the dried spores of the common clubmoss, was used in Victorian theater to produce flame-effects. A blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly, but with little heat. (It was considered safe by the standards of the time.)

<text>Apophatic theology, also known as negative theology, is a form of theological thinking and religious practice which attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God. It forms a pair together with cataphatic theology, which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God &quot;is&quot;.

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception.

== Etymology and definition ==
&quot;Apophatic&quot;, (noun); from ἀπόφημι &quot;apophēmi&quot;, meaning &#x27;to deny&#x27;. From &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;: 
 or (Latin), &#x27;negative way&#x27; or &#x27;by way of denial&#x27;. The negative way forms a pair together with the &quot;kataphatic&quot; or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, &quot;negative theology is as old as philosophy itself:&quot; elements of it can be found in Plato&#x27;s unwritten doctrines, while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in Philo of Alexandria.

According to Carabine, &quot;apophasis proper&quot; in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus. Carabine writes that there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo, and Meredith even states that Philo &quot;is the real founder of the apophatic tradition.&quot; Yet, it was with Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Maximus the Confessor, whose writings shaped both Hesychasm (the contemplative monastic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches) and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.

Elijah&#x27;s hearing of a &quot;still, small voice&quot; at 1 Kings 19:11-13 has been proposed as a Biblical example of apophatic prayer.

==Greek philosophy==
===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship. Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained. Epiphany played an essential role in attaining this knowledge. Xenophanes () noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.

According to Herodotus (484–425 BC), Homer and Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods. The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his &quot;Theogony&quot; the birth of the gods and creation of the world, which became an &quot;ur-text for programmatic, first-person epiphanic narratives in Greek literature,&quot; but also &quot;explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine.&quot; According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods &quot;actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought.&quot;

Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem &quot;On Nature&quot;, gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. &quot;The way of conviction&quot; explores Being, true reality (&quot;what-is&quot;), which is &quot;What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect.&quot; &quot;The way of opinion&quot; is the world of appearances, in which one&#x27;s sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato&#x27;s allegory of the Cave. Together with the Biblical story of Moses&#x27;s ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God. Cook notes that Parmenides&#x27; poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the mystery cults, giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook. Cook further notes that the philosopher&#x27;s task is to &quot;attempt through &#x27;negative&#x27; thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom.&quot;

===Plato===

Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC), &quot;deciding for Parmenides against Heraclitus&quot; and his theory of eternal change, had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.

Plato further explored Parmenides&#x27;s idea of timeless truth in his dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot;, which is a treatment of the eternal forms, &quot;Truth, Beauty and Goodness&quot;, which are the real aims for knowledge. The Theory of Forms is Plato&#x27;s answer to the problem of how one fundamental reality or unchanging essence can admit of many changing phenomena, other than by dismissing them as being mere illusion.

In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato argues that the &quot;real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,&quot; stating that the &quot;Form of the Good&quot; is the highest object of knowledge. His argument culminates in the Allegory of the Cave, in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the &quot;Form of the Good&quot;. Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the &quot;first principles of all knowledge.&quot;

According to Cook, the &quot;Theory of Forms&quot; has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus. The pursuit of &quot;Truth, Beauty and Goodness&quot; became a central element in the apophatic tradition, but nevertheless, according to Carabine &quot;Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way.&quot; Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with &quot;one transcendent source,&quot; an identification which his later interpreters made.

===Middle Platonism===
Middle Platonism (1st century BC–3rd century AD) further investigated Plato&#x27;s &quot;Unwritten Doctrines,&quot; which drew on Pythagoras&#x27; first principles of the Monad and the Dyad (matter). Middle Platonism proposed a hierarchy of being, with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato&#x27;s &quot;Form of the Good&quot;. An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was Philo (c. 25 BC – c. 50 AD), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity. According to Craig D. Allert, &quot;Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God.&quot; For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God&#x27;s transcendence.

===Neo-Platonism===
Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which &quot;developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism.&quot; It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270 AD), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 AD, when the pagan traditions were ousted. It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to Gnosticism. Proclus of Athens (*412–485 AD) played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages., serving as head or &#x27;successor&#x27; (diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic &#x27;Academy&#x27; for over 50 years. His student Pseudo-Dionysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.

====Plotinus====

Plotinus (204/5–270 AD) was the founder of Neo-Platonism. In the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute. For Plotinus, the &quot;One&quot; is the first principle, from which everything else emanates. He took it from Plato&#x27;s writings, identifying the Good of the &quot;Republic&quot;, as the cause of the other Forms, with the &quot;One&quot; of the first hypothesis of the second part of the &quot;Parmenides&quot;. For Plotinus, the &quot;One&quot; precedes the Forms, and &quot;is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being.&quot; From the &quot;One&quot; comes the Intellect, which contains all the Forms. The &quot;One&quot; is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such. Plotinus&#x27;s third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to itself. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of the &quot;One&quot;, which unites all existents &quot;as a single, all-pervasive reality.&quot;

The &quot;One&quot; is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity. Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the &quot;presence of the intellect in the human soul,&quot; initiating an ascent of the soul by abstraction or &quot;taking away,&quot; culminating in a sudden appearance of the &quot;One&quot;. In the &quot;Enneads&quot; Plotinus writes: 
Carabine notes that Plotinus&#x27; apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of the &quot;One&quot;, but a means to &quot;ecstasis&quot; and an ascent to &quot;the unapproachable light that is God.&quot; Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus&#x27; methods for reaching &quot;henosis&quot;, concludes that &quot;Plotinus&#x27; mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology.&quot; According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the &quot;non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul,&quot; by &quot;calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6).&quot; Pao-Shen Ho further notes that &quot;for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments.&quot; The argumentation about &quot;henosis&quot; is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when &quot;henosis&quot; has been attained. Ho further notes that Plotinus&#x27;s writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to &quot;bring his own soul and &quot;the souls of others&quot; by way of Intellect to union with the One.&quot; As such, the &quot;Enneads&quot; as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot;, demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry. Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.

====Proclus====
Proclus (412–485) introduced the terminology used in apophatic and cataphatic theology. He did this in the second book of his &quot;Platonic Theology&quot;, arguing that Plato states that the &quot;One&quot; can be revealed &quot;through analogy,&quot; and that &quot;through negations [&quot;dia ton apophaseon&quot;] its transcendence over everything can be shown.&quot; For Proclus, apophatic and cataphatic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from the &quot;One&quot;, and cataphatic theology corresponding to the return to the &quot;One&quot;. The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward the &quot;One&quot;, while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to the &quot;One&quot;. According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that &quot;Marinus&#x27; Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single ineffable Name of God () should also have been in many ways compatible with the school&#x27;s ineffable and apophatic divine principle.&quot;

==Christianity==


===Apostolic Age===
The Book of Revelation 8:1 mentions &quot;the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven.&quot; According to Dan Merkur:

===Early Church Fathers===
The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo (), who saw Moses as &quot;the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man&#x27;s ascent into the &#x27;luminous darkness&#x27; of God.&quot; His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.

God&#x27;s appearance to Moses in the burning bush was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers, especially Gregory of Nyssa (), realizing the fundamental unknowability of God; an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition. Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since &quot;following Christ is the human way of seeing God.&quot;

Clement of Alexandria () was an early proponent of apophatic theology. Clement holds that God is unknowable, although God&#x27;s unknowability, concerns only his essence, not his energies, or powers. According to R.A. Baker, in Clement&#x27;s writings the term develops further from a mere intellectual &quot;seeing&quot; toward a spiritual form of contemplation. Clement&#x27;s apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of and the &quot;mystic vision of the soul.&quot; For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent. According to Baker, Clement&#x27;s apophaticism is mainly driven not by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition. His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective. According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach. and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.

According to Tertullian ():

Saint Cyril of Jerusalem (313–386), in his &quot;Catechetical Homilies&quot;, states:


Augustine of Hippo (354–430) defined God , meaning &#x27;other, completely other&#x27;, in &quot;Confessions&quot; 7.10.16, wrote , meaning &#x27;if you understand [something], it is not God&#x27;, in &quot;Sermo 117.3.5&quot; (&quot;PL&quot; 38, 663), and a famous legend tells that, while walking along the Mediterranean shoreline meditating on the mystery of the Trinity, he met a child who with a seashell (or a little pail) was trying to pour the whole sea into a small hole dug in the sand. Augustine told him that it was impossible to enclose the immensity of the sea in such a small opening, and the child replied that it was equally impossible to try to understand the infinity of God within the limited confines of the human mind.

===The Chalcedonian Christological dogma===

The Christological dogma, formulated by the Fourth Ecumenical Council held in Chalcedon in 451, is based on dyophysitism and hypostatic union, concepts used to describe the union of humanity and divinity in a single hypostasis, or individual existence, that of Jesus Christ. This remains transcendent to mankind&#x27;s rational categories, a mystery which has to be guarded by apophatic language, as it is a personal union of a singularly unique kind.

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of Proclus (412–485) who combined a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas. He is a constant factor in the contemplative tradition of the eastern Orthodox Churches, and from the 9th century onwards his writings also had a strong impact on western mysticism.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from Acts of the Apostles chapter 17, in which Paul gives a missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus in Athens. In Acts 17:23 Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the Unknown God, &quot;a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world.&quot; For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul&#x27;s speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity. Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term &quot;unknown God&quot; is a reversal of Paul&#x27;s preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the &quot;unknown God.&quot;

Pseudo-Dionysius further explored apophasis within the context of Christian Philosophy, to him, that which is the transcendent cause in a stricter sense, does not possess all the positive attributes of the universe as it succeeds them all, wherein there ought to be no contradiction between affirmation and denial of such inasmuch as it precedes and surpasses all deprivation, being wholly beyond all positive (kataphic) and negative distinctions. In this sense, the One, that we may arise by unknowing is the realization that none can fully know the Infinite One, and therefore is only to be approached by &quot;agnosia&quot; or by that which is beyond and above all knowledge.

According to Corrigan and Harrington, &quot;Dionysius&#x27; central concern is how a triune God[...] who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source.&quot; Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described human ascent to divinity as a process of purgation, illumination and union. Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.
===Eastern Orthodox Christianity===
In Orthodox Christianity, apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century Cappadocian Fathers stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator transcends this existence, is uncreated. The essence of God is completely unknowable; mankind can acquire an incomplete knowledge of God in his attributes (), positive and negative, by reflecting upon and participating in his self-revelatory operations (). Gregory of Nyssa (), John Chrysostom (–407), and Basil the Great (329–379) emphasized the importance of negative theology to an orthodox understanding of God. John of Damascus (–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal &quot;not the nature, but the things around the nature.&quot;

Maximus the Confessor (580–622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius&#x27; ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Gregory Palamas (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of Hesychasm, the Eastern Orthodox practices of contemplative prayer and theosis, &quot;deification.&quot;

Influential 20th-century Orthodox theologians include the Neo-Palamist writers Vladimir Lossky, John Meyendorff, John S. Romanides, and Georges Florovsky. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology, which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation. This is expressed in the idea that mysticism is the expression of dogmatic theology &quot;&quot;.

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through Scripture and Sacred Tradition, such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in his essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even angels) can understand. He is transcendent in essence (). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or his indestructible energies through (vision of God). According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is immanent in his hypostasis or existences.

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian John Scotus Erigena wrote:

When he says &quot;He is not anything&quot; and &quot;God is not&quot;, Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is &quot;other&quot;.

Theologians like Meister Eckhart and John of the Cross exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; and John of the Cross&#x27; &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the Catholic Church, which, on the basis of Scripture and church tradition, during the Fourth Lateran Council formulated the following dogma:

====The ====
Thomas Aquinas was born ten years later (1225–1274) and, although in his he quotes Pseudo-Dionysius 1,760 times, stating that &quot;Now, because we cannot know what God is, but rather what He is not, we have no means for considering how God is, but rather how He is not&quot; and leaving the work unfinished because it was like &quot;straw&quot; compared to what had been revealed to him, his reading in a neo-Aristotelian key of the conciliar declaration overthrew its meaning inaugurating the &quot;analogical way&quot; as between and : the . In this way, the believers see what attributes are common between them and God, as well as the unique, not human, properly divine and not understandable way in respect of which God possesses that attributes.

According to Adrian Langdon:

According to &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the &quot;Doctor Angelicus&quot; and the scholastici declare that:

Since then Thomism has played a decisive role in resizing the negative or apophatic tradition of the magisterium.

===20th century===

Apophatic statements are still crucial to many modern theologians, restarting in the 1800s by Søren Kierkegaard (see his concept of the infinite qualitative distinction) up to Rudolf Otto, Karl Barth (see their idea of &quot;Wholly Other&quot;, i.e. or ), the Ludwig Wittgenstein of the , and Martin Heidegger after his .

C. S. Lewis, in his book &quot;Miracles&quot; (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse one&#x27;s mind of misconceptions. He goes on to advocate refilling the mind with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad analogies or false mind-pictures.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd, who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding the impossibility of absolutely knowing God, and yet the possibility of truly knowing something of God. Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. He argues that most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, which involves reflection and attempts to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, for Dooyeweerd, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, exhibits a diverse range of aspects, and can grasp at least the law side. According to Dooyeweerd, knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature. The philosopher Leo Strauss considered that the Bible, for example, should be treated as pre-theoretical (everyday) rather than theoretical in what it contains.

Ivan Illich (1926–2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called &quot;Why Philia?&quot;.

===21st century===
Karen Armstrong, in her book &quot;The Case for God&quot; (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in postmodern theology.

Philosopher and literary scholar William Franke, particularly in his 2007 two-volume collection &quot;On What Cannot Be Said&quot; and his 2014 monograph &quot;A Philosophy of the Unsayable&quot;, puts forth that negative theology&#x27;s exploration and performance of language&#x27;s limitations is not simply one current among many in religious thought, but is &quot;a kind of perennial counter-philosophy to the philosophy of Logos&quot; that persistently challenges central tenets of Western thought throughout its history. For Franke, literature demonstrates the &quot;infinitely open&quot; nature of language which negative theology and related forms of philosophical thought seek to draw attention to. Franke therefore argues that literature, philosophy, and theology begin to bleed into one another as they approach what he frames as the &quot;apophatic&quot; side of Western thought.

==Islam==

Various traditions and schools in Islam (see Islamic schools and branches) draw on sundry theologies in approaching God in Islam (Allah, Arabic ) or the ultimate reality. &quot;Negative theology&quot; involves the use of , , defined as &#x27;setting aside&#x27;, &#x27;canceling out&#x27;, &#x27;negation&#x27;, or &#x27;nullification&#x27;. The followers of the Mu&#x27;tazili school of Kalam, the spread of which is often attributed to Wasil ibn Ata, are often called the (&#x27;cancelers&#x27; or &#x27;negators&#x27;), a description, sometimes employed derogatorily, deriving from the school&#x27;s descriptions of the Islamic God.

Rajab ʿAlī Tabrīzī, an Iranian and Shi&#x27;ite philosopher and mystic of the 17th century, is credited with instilling an apophatic theology in a generation of philosophers and theologians whose influence extended into the Qajar period. Mulla Rajab affirmed the completely unknowable, unqualifiable, and attributeless nature of God and upheld a general view concerning God&#x27;s attributes which can only be negatively &#x27;affirmed&#x27; (that is, by affirmingly negating all that is not God about God).

Shia Islam largely adopts &quot;negative theology&quot;. In the words of the Persian Ismaili missionary, Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani: &quot;There does not exist a [&quot;transcendence&quot;] more brilliant and more splendid than that by which we establish the absolute transcendence of our Originator through the use of these phrases in which a negative and a negative of a negative apply to the thing denied.&quot;

Literalists completely reject and condemn any negation that would clash with the wording of the Islamic Scriptures or with the narratives ascribed to the Islamic Prophet. They therefore hold that descriptors and qualifiers that occur in the Qur&#x27;ān and in the canonized religious traditions, even if seeming or sounding humanlike such as &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;finger, or &quot;foot&quot;, are to be wholly affirmed as attributes of God (not limbs).

Many Sunnites, like the Ash&#x27;aris and Maturidis, adhere to some middle path or synthesis between negation and anthropomorphism, though the kind of each combination of negation and affirmation varies greatly.

==Judaism==

Maimonides (1135/1138–1204) was &quot;the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the .&quot; Maimonides – along with Samuel ibn Tibbon – draws on Bahya ibn Paquda, who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of his absolute unity. God, as the entity which is &quot;truly One&quot; (), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and indescribable. In &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, Maimonides states:

According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that &quot;[God] is knowledge,&quot; and saw his essence, being, and knowledge as completely one, &quot;a perfect unity and not a composite at all.&quot; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating:

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought. Yeshayahu Leibowitz (1903–1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology. According to Leibowitz, a person&#x27;s faith is their commitment to obey God, meaning God&#x27;s commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person&#x27;s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God&#x27;s understanding is not man&#x27;s understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.

=== Jacques Derrida ===

The work of Jewish philosopher Jacques Derrida, and in particular his critical method called deconstruction, has frequently been compared to negative theology, and led to renewed interest in apophaticism in the late 20th century, even among continental philosophers and literary scholars who may not have otherwise have been particularly invested in theological issues. Conversely, the perception that deconstruction resembled or essentially was a form of secular negative theology also – according to Derrida himself – took the form of an accusation from his critics, implicitly positing both negative theology and deconstruction as being elaborate ways of saying nothing of any substance or importance. However, Derrida strongly repudiated this comparison for much of his career, arguing that any resemblance between his thought and apophaticism is purely superficial. Derrida argued that the aims of negative theology – to demonstrate the ultimate, incomprehensible, transcendent reality of God – are a form of ontotheology which runs fundamentally counter to deconstruction&#x27;s aim of purging Western thought of its pervasive metaphysics of presence.

Later in his career, such in as his essay , Derrida comes to see apophatic theology as potentially but not necessarily a means through which the intractable inadequacies of language and the ontological difficulties which proceed from them can brought to our attention and explored:

Scholars such as Stephen Shakespeare have noted that – despite Derrida&#x27;s pervasive concern with many aspects of Jewish theology and identity – his writing on negative theology draws almost exclusively on Christian writing and couches the topic in the language of Christianity generally. Derrida&#x27;s thought in general, but in particular his later writing on negative theology, was highly influential in the development of the Weak Theology movement, and of postmodern theology as a whole.

David Wood and Robert Bernasconi have highlighted how Derrida explains what deconstruction is in an overwhelmingly negative, &quot;apophatic&quot; fashion.

==Indian parallels==

Early Indian philosophical works which have apophatic themes include the Principal Upanishads (800 BC to the start of the common era) and the Brahma Sutras (from 450 BC and 200 AD). An expression of negative theology is found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where Brahman is described as &quot;neti neti&quot; or &quot;neither this, nor that&quot;. Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:

Buddhist philosophy has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha&#x27;s own theory of anatta (not-atman, not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. Madhyamaka is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by Nagarjuna (2nd–3rd century AD), which is based on a four-fold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness (shunyata). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the prajñaparamita genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval Hindu philosophy are visible in the works of Shankara (8th century), a philosopher of Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), and Bhartṛhari (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, Brahman, is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being Nirguna or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality. The Taittiriya hymn speaks of Brahman as &quot;one where the mind does not reach&quot;. Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman&#x27;s positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same.

Negative theology also figures in the Buddhist and Hindu polemics. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Bahá&#x27;í Faith==

Bahá&#x27;í&#x27;s believe that God is an ultimately unknowable being (see God in the Baháʼí Faith) and Bahá&#x27;í writings state that &quot;there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true God with His creation, and no resemblance whatever can exist between the transient and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute.&quot;

According to the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, the only way to grow nearer to God is to gain knowledge of the Manifestation of God, who is a reflection of God&#x27;s reality in a similar way to how a mirror reflects an image of the sun. Stephen Lambden has written a paper entitled, &quot;The Background and Centrality of Apophatic Theology in Bábí and Bahá&#x27;í Scripture&quot; and Ian Kluge has also looked into the Apophatic Theology and the Baha&#x27;i faith in the second part of his paper, &quot;Neoplatonism and the Bahá&#x27;í Writings&quot;.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the &quot;via negativa&quot; essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality. Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of atheism or agnosticism, since it cannot say truly that God exists. &quot;The comparison is crude, however, for conventional atheism treats the existence of God as a predicate that can be denied (&quot;God is nonexistent&quot;), whereas negative theology denies that God has predicates&quot;. &quot;God or the Divine is&quot; without being able to attribute qualities about &quot;what He is&quot; would be the prerequisite of positive theology in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism. &quot;Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology&quot;. Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value. In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the &quot;via negativa&quot; also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.

<text>DPZ CoDesign (DPZ) (formerly Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Co. and DPZ Partners) is an architecture and town planning firm based in Miami, Florida, founded in 1980 by the husband-and-wife team of Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. The firm advocates for New Urbanist town planning in the United States and other countries, having completed designs for over 300 new and existing communities. In addition to Duany and Plater-Zyberk, DPZ&#x27;s partners include Galina Tachieva, Marina Khoury, Senen M. A. Antonio and Matthew J. Lambert.

DPZ largely operates using the &quot;charrette&quot; methodology, which involves a week-long intensive workshop with a client team and any relevant shareholders to &#x27;co-design&#x27; plans that factor in real-time proposals, feedback, and revisions.

==Areas of practice==
DPZ&#x27;s area of practice includes: regional and downtown plans; new towns; urban infill; villages and resort villages; transit-oriented development; suburban retrofits; campuses; housing; affordable housing; and civic buildings. The firm is headquartered in Miami, Florida, with offices in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and Portland, Oregon.

==Awards==
DPZ has received numerous awards for its projects, including two National AIA Awards; the Thomas Jefferson Award; the Vincent Scully Prize; and two Governor&#x27;s Urban Design Awards for Excellence. The firm&#x27;s Seaside, Florida project was the first authentic new town to be built successfully in the United States in over fifty years. In 1989, &quot;Time&quot; magazine selected Seaside as one of the 10 &quot;Best of the Decade&quot; achievements in the field of design.

==Representative projects==
Planned communities designed by DPZ include:
*East Beach, Norfolk, Virginia
*Village of Providence, Huntsville, Alabama
*Alys Beach, Florida
*Prospect New Town, Longmont, Colorado

==Disaster recovery planning==
DPZ took a leading role in the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Working with the Mississippi Governor&#x27;s Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal, and the Louisiana Recovery Authority, DPZ&#x27;s designers have generated plans for rebuilding at the regional, local and neighborhood level. They also developed guidelines for individual homeowners looking to rebuild. Notably, DPZ organized and led the Mississippi Renewal Forum, which generated plans for eleven municipalities along the Mississippi Coast; prepared a series of typological plans for recovery and redevelopment of the Southern Louisiana coast under the Louisiana Speaks effort; and participated in the Unified New Orleans Plan as the neighborhood planner for the French Quarter, the Central Business District and Gentilly. Following the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, DPZ, working under the banner of The Prince&#x27;s Foundation for the Built Environment (TPFBE), prepared a recovery plan for Port-au-Prince.

==Publications==
Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk&#x27;s book &quot;Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream&quot;, written with Jeff Speck and published in 2000, was reported in the national media as &quot;an essential text for our time&quot;, and &quot;a major literary event&quot;. Their book &quot;New Civic Art: Elements of Town Planning&quot;, written with Robert Alminana, was published to wide acclaim. More recent publications by or about DPZ include Duany and Speck&#x27;s &quot;The Smart Growth Manual&quot;; Thomas E. Low&#x27;s &quot;Light Imprint Handbook: Integrating Sustainability and Community Design&quot;; Galina Tachieva&#x27;s &quot;Sprawl Repair Manual&quot;; and Duany&#x27;s &quot;Garden Cities: Theory &amp; Practice of Agrarian Urbanism&quot;.

<doc id="66979" wikidata="Q33254" url="?curid=66979" title="Tasman Sea">
<text>The Tasman Sea is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who in 1642 was the first known person to cross it. British explorer Lieutenant James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s during his three voyages of exploration.

The Māori people of New Zealand call this sea &quot;Te Moana-a-Rehua&quot; meaning &#x27;the sea of Rehua&#x27; which clashes with the Pacific waters named &quot;Te Tai-o-Whitirea&quot; (&#x27;the sea of Whitirea&#x27;) –after Whitirea, Rehua&#x27;s lover– at Cape Reinga northernmost tip of North Island. In both Australian and New Zealand English, it is nicknamed the Ditch comparable to the North Atlantic Ocean nicknamed as &quot;the Pond&quot;; for example, &quot;crossing the Ditch&quot; means travelling to Australia from New Zealand or vice versa.

==Climate==
The south of the sea is passed over by depressions going from west to east. The northern limit of these westerly winds is near to 40°S. During the southern winter, from April to October, the northern branch of these winds from the west changes its direction toward the north and goes up against trade winds. Hence, the sea receives frequent winds from the southwest during this period. In the Australian summer (from November to March), the southern branch of the trade winds goes up against west winds and produces further wind activity in the area.

==Geography==
The Tasman Sea is wide and has an area of . The maximum depth of the sea is . 
The base of the sea is made up of globigerina ooze. A small zone of pteropod ooze is found to the south of New Caledonia and to the southern extent of 30°S, siliceous ooze can be found.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tasman Sea as:

===Ridge===

The Tasman Sea&#x27;s midocean ridge developed between 85 and 55 million years ago as Australia and Zealandia broke apart during the breakup of supercontinent Gondwana. It lies roughly midway between the continental margins of Australia and Zealandia. Much of Zealandia is submerged, so the ridge runs much closer to the Australian coast than New Zealand&#x27;s.

===Islands===
The Tasman Sea features a number of midsea island groups, quite apart from coastal islands located near the Australian and New Zealand mainlands:
* Lord Howe Island (part of New South Wales)
* Ball&#x27;s Pyramid (part of New South Wales)

===Adjoining bodies of water===
* North: Coral Sea
* Northeast and East: Pacific Ocean
* East: Cook Strait
* South and southeast: Southern Ocean
* West: Bass Strait

==Currents==
The East Australian Current that commences its flow southwards in the tropics of the Coral Sea, near the eastern coast of Australia is the most energetic circulation feature in the south western Pacific Ocean and is a primary means of heat transport from the tropics to the middle latitudes between Australia and New Zealand. The East Australian Current is a return of the westward-flowing Pacific Equatorial Current (Pacific South Equatorial Current). At the juncture between the Tasman and Coral seas while the East Australian Current continues south in the western Tasman a branch flows east called the Tasman Front towards the north of New Zealand with most continuing eastward above New Zealand into the South Pacific Ocean. It transpires that while predominantly the location of westerly wind stress is a factor in how far north the formation of the Tasman Front occurs, so is the presence of the New Zealand land mass, as the top of New Zealand defines the furtherest south that the Tasman Front can be split off by the westerly winds. A boundary current called the East Auckland Current goes down the west coast of the North Island and further south the East Cape Current, that has been diverted towards the South Island by the shapes of the Lord Howe Rise and southern east coast of the North island continues to the south. The East Australian Current south of Tasmania also is diverted west in the Subtropical Front which collides with the western moving Subantarctic front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The East Australian Current sheds eddies on its way south that move south-westward with some known as the Tasman Leakage making it as far westward as the Indian Ocean.

==Animal and plant life==
A deep-sea research ship, the RV &quot;Tangaroa&quot;, explored the sea and found 500 species of fish and 1300 species of invertebrates. The tooth of a megalodon, an extinct shark, was also found by researchers.

==History==

In 1876, the first telegraph cable connecting Australia and New Zealand was laid in the Tasman Sea. The telegraph cable was made obsolete in 1963 when the Commonwealth Pacific Cable, New Zealand&#x27;s first international telephone cable, was completed. Moncrieff and Hood were the first to attempt a trans-Tasman crossing by plane in January 1928. The aviators were never seen or heard of again. The first successful flight over the sea was accomplished by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm later that year. The first person to row solo across the sea was Colin Quincey in 1977. The next successful solo crossing was completed by his son, Shaun Quincey, in 2010.

<text>An epidemic (from Greek ἐπί &quot;epi&quot; &quot;upon or above&quot; and δῆμος &quot;demos&quot; &quot;people&quot;) is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of hosts in a given population within a short period of time. For example, in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic.

Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g., increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging pathogen to a host population (by movement of pathogen or host). Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to either an established pathogen or newly emerging novel pathogen is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded.

An epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed as a pandemic. The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza, are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold) would not. An epidemic can cause enormous damage through financial and economic losses in addition to impaired health and loss of life.

==Definition==

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines epidemic broadly: &quot;Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.&quot; The term &quot;outbreak&quot; can also apply, but is usually restricted to smaller events.

Any sudden increase in disease prevalence may generally be termed an epidemic. This may include contagious disease (i.e. easily spread between persons) such as influenza; vector-borne diseases such as malaria; water-borne diseases such as cholera; and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. The term can also be used for non-communicable health issues such as obesity.

The term &quot;epidemic&quot; derives from a word form attributed to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which later took its medical meaning from the &quot;Epidemics,&quot; a treatise by Hippocrates. Before Hippocrates, , , , and other variants had meanings similar to the current definitions of &quot;&quot; or &quot;endemic&quot;. Thucydides&#x27; description of the Plague of Athens is considered one of the earliest accounts of a disease epidemic. By the early 17th century, the terms &quot;endemic&quot; and &quot;epidemic&quot; referred to contrasting conditions of population-level disease, with the endemic condition a &quot;&quot;common sicknesse&quot; and the epidemic &quot;hapning in some region, or countrey, at a certaine time, ... producing in all sorts of people, one and the same kind of sicknesse&quot;&quot;.

The term &quot;epidemic&quot; is often applied to diseases in non-human animals, although &quot;epizootic&quot; is technically preferable.

==Causes==
There are several factors that may contribute (individually or in combination) to causing an epidemic. There may be changes in a pathogen, in the population that it can infect, in the environment, or in the interaction between all three. Factors include the following:

=== Antigenic Change ===

An antigen is a protein on the virus&#x27; surface that host antibodies can recognize and attack. Changes in the antigenic characteristics of the agent make it easier for the changed virus to spread throughout a previously immune population. There are two natural mechanisms for change - antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift arises over a period of time as an accumulation of mutations in the virus genes, possibly through a series of hosts, and eventually gives rise to a new strain of virus which can evade existing immunity. Antigenic shift is abrupt - in this, two or more different strains of a virus, coinfecting a single host, combine to form a new subtype having a mixture of characteristics of the original strains. The best known and best documented example of both processes is influenza. SARS-CoV2 has demonstrated antigenic drift and possibly shift as well.

=== Drug resistance ===
Antibiotic resistance applies specifically to bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance in bacteria can arise naturally by genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another through horizontal gene transfer. Extended use of antibiotics appears to encourage selection for mutations which can render antibiotics ineffective. This is especially true of tuberculosis, with increasing occurrence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) worldwide.

=== Changes in transmission ===

Pathogen transmission is a term used to describe the mechanisms by which a disease-causing agent (virus, bacterium, or parasite) spreads from one host to another. Common modes of transmission include: -
* airborne (as with influenza and COVID-19),
* fecal-oral (as with cholera and typhoid),
* vector-borne (malaria, Zika) and
* sexual (syphilis, HIV)

The first three of these require that pathogen must survive away from its host for a period of time; an evolutionary change which increases survival time will result in increased virulence.

Another possibility, although rare, is that a pathogen may adapt to take advantage of a new mode of transmission

=== Seasonality ===
Seasonal diseases arise due to the change in the environmental conditions, especially such as humidity and temperature, during different seasons. Many diseases display seasonality, This may be due to one or more of the following underlying factors: -
* The ability of the pathogen to survive outside the host - e.g. water-borne cholera which becomes prevalent in tropical wet seasons, or influenza which peaks in temperate regions during winter.
* The behaviour of people susceptible to the disease - such as spending more time in close contact indoors.
* Changes in immune function during winter - one possibility is a reduction in vitamin D, and another is the effect of cold on mucous membranes in the nose.
* Abundance of vectors such as mosquitoes.

=== Human behaviour ===

Changes in behaviour can affect the likelihood or severity of epidemics. The classic example is the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, in which a cholera outbreak was mitigated by removing a supply of contaminated water - an event now regarded as the foundation of the science of epidemiology. Urbanisation and overcrowding (e.g. in refugee camps) increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. A factor which contributed to the initial rapid increase in the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic was ritual bathing of (infective) corpses; one of the control measures was an education campaign to change behaviour around funeral rites.

=== Changes in the host population ===
The level of immunity to a disease in a population - herd immunity - is at its peak after a disease outbreak or a vaccination campaign. In the following years, immunity will decline, both within individuals and in the population as a whole as older individuals die and new individuals are born. Eventually, unless there is another vaccination campaign, an outbreak or epidemic will recur.

It&#x27;s also possible for disease which is endemic in one population to become epidemic if it is introduced into a novel setting where the host population is not immune. An example of this was the introduction European diseases such as smallpox into indigenous populations during the 16th century.

=== Zoonosis ===

A zoonosis is an infectious disease of humans caused by a pathogen that can jump from a non-human host to a human. Major diseases such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans in the early part of the 20th century, though it has now evolved into a separate human-only disease. Some strains of bird flu and swine flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu.

==Types==
=== Common source outbreak ===
In a common source outbreak epidemic, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed as a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed as a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.

===Propagated outbreak===
In a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.Many epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks (sometimes referred to as mixed outbreak).

For example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or an environmental vector may spread a zoonotic diseases agent.

==Preparation==

Preparations for an epidemic include having a disease surveillance system; the ability to quickly dispatch emergency workers, especially local-based emergency workers; and a legitimate way to guarantee the safety and health of health workers.

Effective preparations for a response to a pandemic are multi-layered. The first layer is a disease surveillance system. Tanzania, for example, runs a national lab that runs testing for 200 health sites and tracks the spread of infectious diseases. The next layer is the actual response to an emergency. According to U.S.-based columnist Michael Gerson in 2015, only the U.S. military and NATO have the global capability to respond to such an emergency. Still, despite the most extensive preparatory measures, a fast-spreading pandemic may easily exceed and overwhelm existing health-care resources. Consequently, early and aggressive mitigation efforts, aimed at the so-called &quot;epidemic curve flattening&quot; need to be taken. Such measures usually consist on non-pharmacological interventions such as social/physical distancing, aggressive contact tracing, &quot;stay-at-home&quot; orders, as well as appropriate personal protective equipment (i.e., masks, gloves, and other physical barriers to spread).

Moreover, India has taken significant strides in its efforts to prepare for future respiratory pandemics through the development of the National Pandemic Preparedness Plan for Respiratory Viruses using a multisectoral approach.

Preceding this national effort, a regional workshop on the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) initiative was organized by WHO&#x27;s South-East Asia Regional Office on October 12-13, 2023. Recognizing that the same capacities and capabilities can be leveraged and applied for groups of pathogens based on their mode of transmission, the workshop aimed to facilitate pandemic planning efficiency for countries in the region. The participating countries, in the aftermath of the workshop, outlined their immediate next steps and sought support from WHO and its partners to bolster regional preparedness against respiratory pathogen pandemics.

<text>The IJssel (; ) is a Dutch distributary of the river Rhine that flows northward and ultimately discharges into the IJsselmeer (before the 1932 completion of the Afsluitdijk known as the Zuiderzee), a North Sea natural harbour. It more immediately flows into the east-south channel around the Flevopolder, Flevoland which is kept at 3 metres below sea level. This body of water is then pumped up into the IJsselmeer.

It is sometimes called the Gelderse IJssel (; &quot;Gueldern IJssel&quot;) to distinguish it from the Hollandse IJssel. It is in the provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel, the latter of which was named after this river. The Romans knew the river as Isala. It flows from Westervoort, on the east side of the city of Arnhem.

Similar to the Nederrijn which shares its short inflow, the Pannerdens Kanaal, it is a minor discharge of the Rhine. At the fork where the Kanaal is sourced the Rhine takes the name the Waal. This splitting-off is west of the German border. The Waal in turn interweaves with other rivers and the lower course of the Nederrijn, which altogether is known as the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta.

The name contains the digraph &quot;ij&quot;, used throughout modern Dutch orthography, which is why both letters appear capitalized (as in: IJmuiden and IJsselmeer).

== History ==
The name &quot;IJssel&quot; (older &quot;Isla&quot;, &quot;Isala&quot;, from *&quot;Īsalō&quot;), is thought to either have been derived from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*eis-&quot; &quot;to move quickly&quot; (Old Norse &quot;eisa&quot; &quot;to race forward&quot;, Latin &quot;ira&quot; &quot;anger&quot;) or a possible Old European stratum source.

Before the Roman Warm Period, the Zuiderzee in highly glaciated times was a brackish, sometimes tidal, very broad set of mudflats, the &quot;Vlies&quot; (Latin: &quot;Flevo&quot;). The IJssel and Amstel kept a saline-freshwater balance, and northward flow, enabling islands and banks to build up. Among these are rare zones just above sea level: Kampen, Elburg and north-east bank once wooded strip from Nijemirdum to Stavoren.

However, the North Sea, locally to form (or re-form) the Zuiderzee, reasserted itself – the so-called Dunkirk transgressions.

By the time these were tamed (terraformed) the IJssel had formed many of its new short distributaries to dissipate its flow. The submerged old delta is traceable out from its sea level elevation point at Zwolle throughout the broadest parts of the IJsselmeer; the lands of Emmeloord, Lelystad and south of Dronten are relatively recent reclamations. They were continuations of these old, broad troughs, and lie six metres below sea level.

The name Vlie refers to a strait between sea islands, Vlieland and Terschelling. It seems that the firmly below-sea-level excoriations in the far north (the &quot;Groote Vliet&quot;) by Medemblik and the IJ (near Amsterdam) were all deep parts of the same body of water in the height of the Roman Warm Period and Medieval Dark Age sea rises (transgressions). Most of the surrounding basin of the vast harbour-like body of water of the Netherlands is reclaimed from it (nationally called polderisation; in England called the making of a fen).

The river was a natural barrier and in April 1945 was stormed by assault troops of the Allied armies liberating the Netherlands from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany.

=== The IJssel as the lower part of the Oude IJssel ===

Most of the IJssel was the lower part of the small river Oude IJssel (lit. &quot;Old IJssel&quot;, German &quot;Issel&quot;), that rises in Germany and is now a 70 km tributary. The connection between the Rhine and IJssel was probably artificial, allegedly dug by men under the Roman general Nero Claudius Drusus 12 BCE as a defence against Germanic tribes and to let Roman ships carry troops along it.

The Oude IJssel is the second-largest contributor to the flow of the river, after the Rhine.

The source of the Oude IJssel is near Borken in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. First it flows south-west until it nearly reaches the Rhine near Wesel; then it turns west northwest. After skirting Isselburg it crosses the border with the Netherlands. The river then flows through Doetinchem and joins the IJssel at Doesburg.

== Characteristics ==
The average daily discharge can change greatly. It has been, over long periods, averaged as about 300 cubic meters per second. It can be as low as 140 and as high as 1800, depending on the velocity of the water arriving from upstream and the weirs west of Arnhem, which control the water taken in. These control the Pannerdens Kanaal, the sole inflow (shared with the Nederrijn).

As a lowland river in which velocity decreases, the IJssel meanders. Some bends (and spurs of land, &quot;hank&quot;) have been cut off by man such as near Rheden and Doesburg, reducing the length from 146  km to 125 km, but not as radically as the Meuse nor Great Ouse. Deposition of sediment to form islands in the outside of bends has been curtailed since the late nineteenth century.

=== The IJssel as a Rhine distributary ===

Since the connection between the Rhine and IJssel was dug, the Rhine became the main contributor to the flow of the IJssel – a small fraction of the former&#x27;s flow makes up the upper IJssel. Various tributaries add a little or much water to the flow of the IJssel, such as the Berkel and Schipbeek streams from relatively local precipitation. The IJssel, if accepted as a branch of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta, is the only one that takes up tributary rivers rather than giving rise to distributaries. It has no contact with the Meuse, nor Scheldt, nor their resultant watercourses.

In the last few miles of the river&#x27;s run, near the city of Kampen, distributaries form, resulting in a quite small delta. Some of these have been dammed up to lower the risk of flooding. Some have silted up. Others flow without interruption. Most of the damming-up was done before 1932, when the Zuiderzee was turned into the freshwater IJsselmeer lake. The whole delta had been prone to flooding in times of northwestern gales, pushing back the saline Zuiderzee water into the delta.

The modern-day names of the delta branches are, west to east, the:
*Keteldiep
*Kattendiep
*Noorddiep (local drainage ditch only)
*Ganzendiep
*Goot

Of these, the first-stated two are the main navigations. The Noorddiep has been stopped up at both ends. Another branch, De Garste, had already completely silted up by the middle of the nineteenth century. Until about 1900, the Ganzendiep up to the Goot fork was known as IJssel proper as was the historical main channel. The present main channel was named the Regtediep or Rechterdiep until well into the twentieth century.

The IJssel, now mainly a Rhine branch as to its water, has retained most of the character of a distinct river in its own right. It has its own tributaries and, as to the Old IJssel (&quot;Oude IJssel&quot;), a former headstream.

=== Tributaries and connecting canals ===

The following canals, long ditches and tributary streams feed the IJssel, in downstream order:

* Apeldoorns Kanaal (west) near the town of Dieren
* river Oude IJssel (east) at the city of Doesburg
* the Berkel stream (east) at the city of Zutphen
* the Twentekanaal (east) between Zutphen and the village of Eefde (municipality of Gorssel)
* the Schipbeek stream (east) near the city of Deventer
* the Grift stream (west) at the town of Hattem; its lower reaches have been channelised to form the mouth of the Griftkanaal
* the Willemsvaart canal (east) at the city of Zwolle
* the Zwolle-IJsselkanaal (east) near Zwolle

<text>Reforestation is the practice of restoring previously existing forests and woodlands that have been destroyed or damaged. The prior forest destruction might have happened through deforestation, clearcutting or wildfires. Three important purposes of reforestation programs are for harvesting of wood, for climate change mitigation, and for ecosystem and habitat restoration purposes. One method of reforestation is to establish tree plantations, also called plantation forests. They cover about 131 million ha worldwide, which is 3% of the global forest area and 45% of the total area of planted forests.

Globally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and 2015. Plantation forests made up 280 million ha (hectare) in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the previous ten years. Of the planted forests worldwide, 18% of that area consists of exotic or introduced species while the rest consist of species native to the country where they are planted.

There are limitations and challenges with reforestation projects, especially if they are in the form of tree plantations. Firstly, there can be competition with other land uses and displacement risk. Secondly, tree plantations are often monocultures which comes with a set of disadvantages, for example biodiversity loss. Lastly, there is also the problem that stored carbon is released at some point.

The effects of reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation (the conservation of intact forests). Instead of planting entirely new areas, it might be better to reconnect forested areas and restore the edges of forest. This protects their mature core and makes them more resilient and longer-lasting. It takes much longer − several decades − for the carbon sequestration benefits of reforestation to become similar to those from mature trees in tropical forests. Therefore, reducing deforestation is usually more beneficial for climate change mitigation than is reforestation.

Many countries carry out reforestation programs. For example, in China, the &quot;Three Northern Protected Forest Development Program&quot; – informally known as the &quot;Great Green Wall&quot; – was launched in 1978 and scheduled to last until 2050. It aims to eventually plant nearly 90 million acres of new forest in a 2,800-mile stretch of northern China. Such programs often blur the boundaries between &quot;reforestation&quot; and &quot;afforestation&quot; (the latter being the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no forest before).

== Definition ==
Reforestation according to the IPCC means the &quot;conversion to forest of land that has previously contained forests but that has been converted to some other use&quot;.

According to FAO terminology, reforestation is defined as the re-establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land classified as forest. 

&quot;Afforestation&quot; on the other hand means establishing new forest on lands that were not forest before (for example, abandoned agriculture). It is the process of restoring and recreating areas of woodlands or forests that may have existed long ago but were deforested or otherwise removed at some point in the past or lacked it naturally (for example, natural grasslands).

== Purposes ==

=== Harvesting of wood ===

Reforestation is not only used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as Finland, many of the forests are &quot;managed&quot; by the wood products and pulp and paper industry. In such an arrangement, like other crops, trees are planted to replace those that have been cut. The Finnish Forest Act from 1996 obliges the forest to be replanted after felling. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation.

Reforestation, if several indigenous species are used, can provide other benefits in addition to financial returns, including restoration of the soil, rejuvenation of local flora and fauna, and the capturing and sequestering of 38 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year.

=== Climate change mitigation ===

There are four primary ways in which reforestation and reducing deforestation can increase carbon sequestration and thus help with climate change mitigation. First, by increasing the volume of existing forest. Second, by increasing the carbon density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale. Third, by expanding the use of forest products that will sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions. Fourth, by reducing carbon emissions that are caused from deforestation and degradation.
=== Ecosystem restoration ===

Plantation forests are intensively managed, composed of one or two species, even-aged, planted with regular spacing, and established mainly for productive purposes. Other planted forests, which comprise 55 percent of all planted forests, are not intensively managed, and they may resemble natural forests at stand maturity. The purposes of other planted forests may include ecosystem restoration and the protection of soil and water values.

== Methods ==

=== Forest plantations ===
Plantation forests cover about 131 million ha, which is 3 percent of the global forest area and 45 percent of the total area of planted forests.

Over 90% of the world&#x27;s forests regenerate organically, and more than half are covered by forest management plans or equivalents.

Globally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and 2015. Plantation forests made up 280 million ha (hectare) in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the previous ten years. Of the planted forests worldwide, 18% of that planted area consists of exotic or introduced species while the rest consist of species native to the country where they are planted.

==== Using existing trees and roots ====
Planting new trees often leads to up to 90% of seedlings failing. However, even in deforested areas, existing root systems often exist. Growth can be accelerated by pruning and coppicing where a few branches of new shoots are cut and often used for charcoal, itself a major driver of deforestation. Since new seeds are not planted, it is cheaper. Additionally, they are much more likely to survive as their root systems already exist and can tap into groundwater during harsher seasons with no rain. While this method has existed for centuries, it is now sometimes referred to as farmer-managed natural regeneration or assisted natural regeneration.

== Financial incentives ==

Policies that promote reforestation for incentives in return have shown promising results of being an effective and motivative concept to re-plant globally on a mass scale.

Some incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. A compensated reduction of deforestation approach has been proposed which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation: Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided. To raise the payments, the host country would issue government bonds or negotiate some kind of loan with a financial institution that would want to take part in the compensation promised to the other country. The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades.

Another emerging revenue source to fund reforestation projects deals with the sale of carbon sequestration credits, which can be sold to companies and individuals looking to compensate their carbon footprint. This approach allows for private landowners and farmers to gain a revenue from the reforestation of their lands, while simultaneously benefiting from improved soil health and increased productivity.

Alongside past financial incentive strategies, reforestation tax benefits have been another way the government has encouraged companies to promote reforestation tactics through the promises of a tax break.

As many landholders seek to earn carbon credits through sequestration, their participation also encourages biodiversity and provides ecosystem services for crops and livestock.

== Challenges ==

There is often insufficient integration between the different purposes of reforestation, namely economic utilization, enhancement of biodiversity and carbon sequestration. This can lead to a range of different challenges.

=== Competition with other land uses and displacement risk ===
Reforestation can compete with other land uses, such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space, for further economic growth. Reforestation can also divert large amounts of water from other activities. A map created by the World Resources Institute in collaboration with the IUCN identifies 2 billion hectares for potential forest restoration and is criticized for including 900 million hectares of grasslands. An assessment of the pledges of governments for reforestation found that the sum of global pledges translates to a required land area of 1.2bn hectares, until 2060, which is equal to a tenth of the global land area und thus deemed unrealistic without a significant encroachment on non-forest areas. Experts are calling for a better integration of social data, such as the dependence of livelihoods on specific land uses, into restoration efforts. Possible solutions include the integration of other land uses into forests through agroforestry, such as growing coffee plants under trees, reducing the delineation between forests and other land uses.

A study found that almost 300 million people live on tropical forest restoration opportunity land in the Global South, constituting a large share of low-income countries&#x27; populations, and argues for prioritized inclusion of &quot;local communities&quot; in forest restoration projects.

There are calls for a more selective approach to identifying reforestation areas, taking into account the possible displacement of customary land uses.

=== Biodiversity loss ===
Reforesting sometimes results in extensive canopy creation that prevents growth of diverse vegetation in the shadowed areas and generating soil conditions that hamper other types of vegetation. Trees used in some reforesting efforts (for example, &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;) tend to extract large amounts of moisture from the soil, preventing the growth of other plants. The European Commission found that, in terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to allow for deforestation to subsequently reforest, as the former leads to irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

The effects reforestation has on biodiversity is not limited to just other forms of vegetation, it can affect all forms of living organisms all contained in the present ecosystem. Due to the major role trees have on ecosystems it is important to better understand components like the ecosystem, waterways, and species present in areas that are being re-planted. Prior research helps limit the depletion of biodiversity which can hinder medicinal discoveries, and alter gene flow in organisms.

A debated issue in managed reforestation is whether the succeeding forest will have the same biodiversity as the original forest. If the forest is replaced with only one species of tree and all other vegetation is prevented from growing back, a monoculture forest similar to agricultural crops would be the result. However, most reforestation involves the planting of different selections of seedlings taken from the area, often of multiple species.

=== Stored carbon being released ===
There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the probability that legacy carbon will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forests. An example of this can be seen in the peatlands in Central Africa, which house an abundance of carbon in the mud called peat. Much like the forest fire or insect outbreak which can harm tropical rainforests, money can also be seen an incentive to harm forests and be paid off to protect it. The global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests may be underestimated by a factor of six.

Also the possible harvesting and utilization of wood from reforested areas, limits the permanence of carbon sequestered through reforestation. For example, it was found that nearly half of the pledges under the Bonn Challenge were areas earmarked for commercial wood use.

Additionally the effects of afforestation and reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation (the conservation of intact forests). It takes much longer − several decades − for the benefits for global warming to manifest to the same carbon sequestration benefits from mature trees in tropical forests and hence from limiting deforestation.

Some researchers note that instead of planting entirely new areas, reconnecting forested areas and restoring the edges of forest, to protect their mature core and make them more resilient and longer-lasting, should be prioritized.

=== Implementation challenges ===
There are some implementation challenges
* Seed shortage: the Seed to Forest Alliance was founded in 2022 in response to a global seed shortage. It will promote the establishment of national seed banks, while focusing on the tropics and biodiversity hotspots.
* Seedling survival rate: a common challenge for reforestation is the low survival rate of seedlings. Planted trees often do not mature, for example due to difficult climatic conditions or insufficient care after planting.

== By country ==
=== Asia ===

==== China ====
According to China&#x27;s government, the forest coverage of the country grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024.

China has introduced the Green Wall of China project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi desert through the planting of trees. There has been a 47-million-hectare increase in forest area in China since the 1970s. The total number of trees amounted to be about 35 billion and 4.55% of China&#x27;s land mass increased in forest coverage. The forest coverage was 12% in the early 1980s and had reached 16.55% by 2001.

China announced two large reforestation programs, the Natural Forest Protection Program and the Returning Farmland to Forest program, in late 1998. The programs were piloted in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu in 1999. They became widely implemented in 2000. The Natural Forest Protection Program called for major reductions in timber harvest, forest conservation, and instituted logging bans in most of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet. The program provided for alternative employment opportunities for former logging industry workers, including hiring them for reforestation work. The Returning Farmland to Forest program paid farmers to plant trees on less productive farmland and provided them with a yearly subsidy for lost income. In 2015 China announced a plan to plant 26 billion trees by the year 2025; that is, two trees for every Chinese citizen per year.

Between 2013 and 2018, China planted 338,000 square kilometres of forests, at a cost of $82.88 billion. By 2018, 21.7% of China&#x27;s territory was covered by forests, a figure the government wants to increase to 26% by 2035. The total area of China is 9,596,961 square kilometres (see China), so 412,669 square kilometres more needs to be planted. According to the government&#x27;s plan, by 2050, 30% of China&#x27;s territory should be covered by forests.

In 2017, the Saihanba Afforestation Community won the UN Champions of the Earth Award in the Inspiration and Action category for their successful reforestation efforts, which began upon discovering the survival of a single tree.

From 2016 to 2021, 3976 square kilometers of forests were planted in the Tibet Autonomous Region, with plans for 20 million trees to be planted before 2023.

In the years 2012–2022 China restored more than of forests. China committed to plant and conserve 70 billion trees by the year 2030 as part of the Trillion Tree Campaign.

The Jane Goodall Institute launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, Inner Mongolia to plant one million trees. China used 24 million hectares of new forest to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000.

The Chinese government requires mining companies to restore the environment around exhausted mines by refilling excavated pits and planting crops or trees. Many mining companies use these recovered mines for ecotourism business.

Launched in 1978 and scheduled to last until 2050, the Three Northern Protected Forest Development Program – informally known as the &quot;Great Green Wall&quot; – aims to eventually plant nearly 90 million acres of new forest in a 2,800-mile stretch of northern China.

Over 69.3 million hectares of forest were planted across China from 1999 to 2013. This large-scale reforestation contributed to China’s forests sequestering 1.11 ± 0.38 Gt carbon per yr over the period 2010 to 2016. This amounted to about 45 percent of the yearly greenhouse gas emissions during that period in China.

==== India ====
Jadav Payeng had received national awards for reforestation efforts, known as the &quot;Molai forest&quot;. He planted 1400 hectares of forest on the bank of river Brahmaputra alone. There are active reforestation efforts throughout the country. In 2016, India had more than 50 million trees planted in Uttar Pradesh and in 2017, more than 66 million trees planted in Madhya Pradesh. In addition to this and individual efforts, there are startup companies, such as Afforest, that are being created over the country working on reforestation.
Lots of plantation are being carried out in the Indian continent but the survivability is very poor especially for massive plantations, with less than 20% survivability rate. To improve the forest cover and to achieve the national mission of forest cover of 33%, there is a need to improve the methods of plantation. Rather than mass planting, there is a need to work on performance measurement &amp; tracking of trees growth. Taking this into consideration, a non-profit organization Ek Kadam Sansthan in Jaipur is leading the development of a module of mass tracking for plantations. The pilot has been done successfully and the organization is hoping to implement nationwide by the end of 2021.

==== Japan ====
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery explain that about two-thirds of Japanese land is covered with forests, and it was almost unchanged from 1966 to 2012. Japan needs to reduce 26% of green house gas emission from 2013 by 2030 to accomplish Paris Agreement and is trying to reduce 2% of them by forestry.

Mass environmental and human-body pollution along with relating deforestation, water pollution, smoke damage, and loss of soils caused by mining operations in Ashio, Tochigi became the first environmental social issue in Japan, efforts by Shōzō Tanaka had grown to large campaigns against copper operation. This led to the creation of &#x27;Watarase Yusuichi Pond&#x27;, to settle the pollution which is a Ramsar site today. Reforestation was conducted as a part of afforestation due to inabilities of self-recovering by the natural land itself due to serious soil pollution and loss of woods consequence in loss of soils for plants to grow, thus needing artificial efforts involving introducing of healthy soils from outside. Starting from around 1897, about 50% of once bald mountains are now back to green.

==== Pakistan ====
The Billion Tree Tsunami was launched in 2014 by planting 10 billion trees, by the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Imran Khan, as a response to the challenge of global warming. Pakistan&#x27;s Billion Tree Tsunami restored 350,000 hectares of forests and degraded land to surpass its Bonn Challenge commitment.

In 2018, Pakistan&#x27;s prime minister Imran Khan declared that the country will plant 10 billion trees in the next five years.

In 2020, the Pakistani government launched an initiative to hire 63,600 laborers to plant trees in the northern Punjab region, with indigenous species such as acacia, mulberry and moringa. This initiative was meant to alleviate unemployment caused by lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

==== Philippines ====
In 2011, the Philippines established the National Greening Program as a priority program to help reduce poverty, promote food security, environmental stability, and biodiversity conservation, as well as enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation in the country. The program paved the way for the planting of almost 1.4 billion seedlings in about 1.66 million hectares nationwide during the 2011–2016 period. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ranked the Philippines fifth among countries reporting the greatest annual forest area gain, which reached 240,000 hectares during the 2010–2015 period.

==== Thailand ====
Efforts are being made in Thailand to restore the land after 800,000 hectares of forest have been destroyed in exchange for cash crop land to grow maize. Agroforestry has become part of the solution to fix the damage caused by deforestation. Agroforestry would affect the agriculture and atmosphere in Thailand in numerous ways. By planting a combination of different tree species, these trees are able to change the microclimatic conditions. Nutrient cycling also occurs when trees are incorporated in the agricultural system. It is also probable that the soil erosion that occurred as a result of deforestation can be mediated when these trees are planted.

=== Europe ===
==== Armenia ====
The Armenia Tree Project was founded in 1994 to address environmental and economic concerns related to Armenia&#x27;s dwindling forests. Since its founding, the organization has planted more than 6.5 million trees in communities throughout Armenia.

My Forest Armenia was founded in 2019 and has since planted 910,000 trees in Armenia.

==== Iceland ====
Prior to the deforestation of Iceland in the Middle Ages, some 40% of the land was forested. Today, the country is about 2% forested, with the Icelandic Forest Service aiming to increase that share to 10% through reforestation and natural regrowth.

==== Ireland ====
In 2019 the government of Ireland decided to plant 440 million trees by 2040. The decision is part of the government&#x27;s plan to make Ireland carbon neutral by 2050 with renewable energy, land use change and carbon tax.

Ireland is also driven to increase sustainable timber consumption while also adding more eco friendly work positions. They also have taken efforts to limit the use of methane emissions by signing a pledge to draw back methane use by 30%.

==== Germany ====
By the 14th century, forests in heavily populated areas had been devastated by industry, many of which required wood for their activities. Peter Stromer (1310–1388), lord of the Stromer trading and commercial company, was spurred by this shortage to &quot;conduct forest culture experiments&quot;. In 1368 he successfully sowed fir and pine seeds in the Nuremberg Reichswald, which over time ended the wood shortage and established the &quot;triumph of the pine in the Nuremberg Reichswald&quot; (at the expense of other deciduous trees). The &quot;doctrine of coniferous sowing&quot; spread widely through forestry regulations and other writing at the time.

Reforestation is required as part of the federal forest law. 31% of Germany is forested, according to the second forest inventory of 2001–2003. The size of the forest area in Germany increased between the first and the second forest inventory due to forestation of degenerated bogs and agricultural areas.

==== United Kingdom ====

Since the 1980s, 8.5 million trees have been planted in the United Kingdom in an area of the Midlands around the villages of Moira and Donisthorpe, close to Leicester. The area is called The National Forest. An even larger reforestation project, called The Northern Forest, is beginning in South Yorkshire. It aims to plant 50 million trees. Despite this, the UK government has been criticized for not achieving its tree planting goals. There have also been concerns of non-native tree planting disturbing the ecological integrity and processes of what would be a native habitat restoration.

=== Middle East ===

==== Israel ====
Since 1948, large reforestation and afforestation projects were accomplished in Israel. 240 million trees have been planted. The carbon sequestration rate in these forests is similar to the European temperate forests.

Israel and only one other country was documented to have a net increase of forestation in the 2000s. This type of progress could be attributed to the social practices that Israel incorporates into their society.

==== Lebanon ====
For thousands of years Lebanon was covered by forests; one particular species of interest, &quot;Cedrus libani&quot; was exceptionally valuable and was almost eliminated due to lumbering operations. Many ancient cultures along the Mediterranean Sea harvested these trees including the Phoenicians who used cedar, pine and juniper for boat building, the Romans, who cut them down for lime-burning kilns, and the Ottomans, who used much of the remaining cedar forests of Lebanon as fuel in steam trains in the early 20th century. Despite two millennia of deforestation, forests in Lebanon still cover 13.6% of the country, and other wooded lands represent 11%.

Law No. 558, which was ratified by the Lebanese Parliament on April 19, 1996, aims to protect and expand existing forests, classifying all forests of cedar, fir, high juniper, evergreen cypress and other trees, whether diverse or homogeneous, whether state-owned or not as conserved forests.

Since 2011 more than 600,000 trees, including cedars and other native species, have been planted throughout Lebanon as part of the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative, which aims to restore Lebanon&#x27;s native forests. Projects financed locally and by international charity are performing extensive reforestation of cedar being carried out in the Mediterranean region, particularly in Lebanon and Turkey, where over 50 million young cedars are being planted annually.

The Lebanon Reforestation Initiative has been working with tree nurseries throughout Lebanon since 2012 to grow stronger seedlings with higher survival rates.

==== Turkey ====
Of the country&#x27;s 78 million hectares of land in total, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry aims to increase Turkey&#x27;s forest cover to 30% by 2023.

Four thousand years ago, Anatolia was 60% to 70% forested. Although the flora of Turkey remains more biodiverse than many European countries, deforestation occurred during both prehistoric and historic times, including the Roman and Ottoman periods.

Since the first forest code of 1937, the official government definition of &#x27;forest&#x27; has varied. According to the current definition, 21 million hectares are forested, an increase of about 1 million hectares over the past thirty years, but only about half is &#x27;productive&#x27;. However, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization definition of forest, about 12 million hectares was forested in 2015, about 15% of the land surface.

The amount of greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey removed by forests is very uncertain., however, a new assessment is being made with the help of satellites and new soil measurements and better information should be available by 2020. According to the World Resources Institute &quot;Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities&quot;, 50 million hectares are potential forest land, a similar area to the ancient Anatolian forest mentioned above. This could help limit climate change in Turkey. To help preserve the biodiversity of Turkey, more sustainable forestry has been suggested. Improved rangeland management is also needed.

National Forestation Day is on 11 November but, according to the agriculture and forestry trade union, although volunteers planted a record number of trees in 2019, most had died by 2020 in part due to lack of rainfall.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
Natural Resources Canada (The Department of Natural Resources) states that the national forest cover was decreased by 0.34% from 1990 to 2015, and Canada has the lowest deforestation rate in the world. The forest industry is one of the main industries in Canada, which contributes about 7% of Canadian economy, and about 9% of the forests on Earth are in Canada. Therefore, Canada has many policies and laws to commit to sustainable forest management. For example, 94% of Canadian forests are public land, and the government obligates planting trees after harvesting to public forests.

==== United States ====

It is the stated goal of the United States Forest Service (USFS) to manage forest resources sustainably. This includes reforestation after timber harvest, among other programs.

United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data shows that forest occupied about 46% of total U.S. land in 1630 (when European settlers began to arrive in large numbers), but had decreased to 34% by 1910. After 1910, forest area has remained almost constant although the U.S. population has increased substantially. In the late 19th century, the USFS was established in part to address the concern of natural disasters due to deforestation, and new reforestation programs and federal laws such as the Knutson-Vandenberg Act (1930) were implemented. The USFS states that human-directed reforestation is required to support natural regeneration and the agency engages in ongoing research into effective ways to restore forests.

As for the year 2020, the U.S. planted 2.5 billion trees per year. At the beginning of the year 2020, a bill that will increase the number to 3.3 billion, was proposed by the Republican Party, after President Donald Trump joined the Trillion Tree Campaign.

=== Latin America ===
====Bolivia====
Training in reforestation for young people in Bolivia has been provided by Oxfam Intermón.

==== Costa Rica ====

Through reforestation and environmental conservation, Costa Rica doubled its forest cover in 30 years.

Costa Rica has a long-standing commitment to the environment. The country is now one of the leaders of sustainability, biodiversity, and other protections. It wants to be completely fossil fuel free by 2050. The country has generated all of its electric power from renewable sources for three years as of 2019. It has committed to be carbon-free and plastic-free by 2021.

As of 2019, half of the country&#x27;s land surface is covered with forests. They absorb a huge amount of carbon dioxide, combating climate change.

In the 1940s, more than 75% of the country was covered in mostly tropical rainforests and other indigenous woodlands. Between the 1940s and 1980s, extensive, uncontrolled logging led to severe deforestation. By 1983, only 26% of the country had forest cover. Realizing the devastation, policymakers took a stand. Through a continued environmental focus they were able to turn things around to the point that today forest cover has increased to 52%, two times more than 1983 levels.

An honorable world leader for ecotourism and conservation, Costa Rica has pioneered the development of payments for environmental services. Costa Rica&#x27;s extensive system of environmental protection has been encouraging conservation and reforestation of the land by providing grants for environmental services. The system is not just advanced for its time but is also unparalleled in the world. It received great international attention.

Costa Rica doubled its forest cover in 30 years using its system of grants and other payments for environmental services, including compensation for landowners. One of the main programs established in Costa Rica was the Forest Promotion Certificate in 1979 and is funded by international donations and nationwide taxes. The initiative is helping to protect the forests in the country, and is now helped pass both the Forest Law in 1986 and FONAFIFO in 1990 which insures the continuity of the conservation programs.

Costa Rica&#x27;s ambitious reforestation initiatives have transformed the landscape, fostering biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and sustainable land management practices.

==== Peru ====
Approximately 59% of Peru is covered by forest. A history of political turmoil and the government&#x27;s inability to enforce environmental regulations has led to the degradation of the forest and environment in Peru. A military coup in 1968 caused a loss of economic mobility in the Talara region and sparked a boom in illegal logging due to the lack of alternative economic opportunities. Illegal mining and logging operations are responsible for a great deal of Peru&#x27;s deforestation and environmental damage. The Peruvian government has not been able to enforce an environmentally conscious mining formalization plan to protect the Amazon forest in the Madre de Dios region. The 1980s were known in Peru as the &quot;lost decade&quot; due to a nationwide internal conflict and severe economic crisis almost destroying the country and resulting in the state losing control over several regions. Many areas in Peru, including Madre de Dios, had no state presence until the government initiated a movement to &#x27;conquer and populate the Amazon,&#x27; with the hopes of minimizing illegal and informal mining operations that had expanded in the region and were polluting the Amazonian rivers and the destroying of its forests.

Reforestation initiatives have expanded in the country since. In Peru, reforestation is essential to preserving the livelihoods of rural communities because much of the population relies on the forest in some way. Deforestation also disproportionally affects indigenous communities in Peru, which is why reforestation efforts are essential for the protection of many communities&#x27; livelihoods.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
One plan in this region, called Great Green Wall (Africa), involves planting a nine-mile width of trees on the Southern Border of the Sahara Desert for stopping its expansion to the south. However, this is more of an afforestation project than a reforestation one.

In 2019, Ethiopia begun a massive tree planting campaign &quot;Green Legacy&quot; with a target to plant 4 billion trees in one year. In one day only, over 350 million trees were planted.

==== Nigeria ====
== Organizations and programs ==

* Ecosia is a non-profit organization based in Berlin, Germany, that has planted over 100 million trees worldwide as of July 2020.
* Trees for the Future has assisted more than 170,000 families, in 6,800 villages of Asia, Africa and the Americas, to plant over 35 million trees.
* Ecologi is an organization that offers its members ways to support climate change solutions. This includes offsetting their carbon emissions and tree planting. So far over 50 million trees have been planted through Ecologi, as well a more than 2.2 million tonnes of CO2e reduced.
* Wangari Maathai, 2004 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, founded the Green Belt Movement which planted over 47 million trees to restore the Kenyan environment.
* Team Trees was a 2019 fundraiser with an initiative to plant 20 million trees. The initiative was started by American YouTubers MrBeast and Mark Rober, and was mostly supported by YouTubers. The Arbor Day Foundation will work with its local partners around the world to plant one tree for each dollar they raise.
* Trees For Life (Brooklyn Park) is a state based organization, which was established back in 1981 and delivers conservation, revegetation and community training programs. It now has thousands of active supporters and energizes activity within communities.
* Many companies are trying to achieve carbon offsets by nature-based solutions like reforestation, including mangrove forests and soil restoration. Among them are Microsoft and Eni. Increasing the forest cover of Earth by 25% will offset the human emissions in the last 20 years. In any case it will be necessary to pull from the atmosphere the that already have been emitted. However, this can work only if the companies will stop new emissions and stop deforestation.
* The 2020 World Economic Forum, held in Davos, announced the creation of the Trillion Tree Campaign, which is an initiative aiming to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe. The implementation can have big environmental and societal benefits but needs to be tailored to local conditions.
* The forest landscape restoration strategy seeks to rehabilitate landscapes and repair marginal and degraded areas in order to generate productive forest landscapes that are resilient and long-term. It aims to guarantee that diverse ecological and land-use functions are restored, safeguarded, and preserved over time.

<text>A woodland () is, in the broad sense, land covered with woody plants (trees and shrubs), or in a narrow sense, synonymous with wood (or in the U.S., the &quot;plurale tantum&quot; woods), a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade (see differences between British, American and Australian English explained below). Some savannas may also be woodlands, such as &quot;savanna woodland&quot;, where trees and shrubs form a light canopy.

Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher-density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are often referred to as forests. 

Extensive efforts by conservationist groups have been made to preserve woodlands from urbanization and agriculture. For example, the woodlands of Northwest Indiana have been preserved as part of the Indiana Dunes.

==Definitions ==
===United Kingdom=== 
&quot;Woodland&quot; is used in British woodland management to mean tree-covered areas which arose naturally and which are then managed. At the same time, forest is usually used in the British Isles to describe plantations, usually more extensive, or hunting Forests, which are a land use with a legal definition and may not be wooded at all. The term &quot;ancient woodland&quot; is used in British nature conservation to refer to any wooded land that has existed since 1600, and often (though not always) for thousands of years, since the last Ice Age (equivalent to the American term old-growth forest)

===North America===
Woodlot is a closely related term in American forest management, which refers to a stand of trees generally used for firewood. While woodlots often technically have closed canopies, they are so small that light penetration from the edge makes them ecologically closer to woodland than forest. North American forests vary widely in their ecology and are greatly dependent on abiotic factors such as climate and elevation. Much of the old-growth deciduous and pine-dominated forests of the eastern United States was harvested for lumber, paper pulp, telephone poles, creosote, pitch, and tar. 

===Australia===
In Australia, a woodland is defined as an area with a sparse (10–30%) cover of trees, and an open woodland has a very sparse (&lt;10%) cover. Woodlands are also subdivided into tall woodlands or low woodlands if their trees are over or under high, respectively. This contrasts with forests, which have more than 30% of their area covered by trees.

<doc id="66988" wikidata="Q230830" url="?curid=66988" title="Aksai Chin">
<text>Aksai Chin is a region administered by China partly in Hotan County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang and partly in Rutog County, Ngari Prefecture, Tibet and constituting the easternmost portion of the larger Kashmir region that has been the subject of a dispute between India and China since 1959. It is claimed by India as part of its Nubra district, Ladakh Union Territory.

==Name==
Aksai Chin was first mentioned by Muhammad Amin, the Yarkandi guide of the Schlagintweit brothers, who were contracted in 1854 by the British East India Company to explore Central Asia. Amin explained its meaning as &quot;the great white sand desert&quot;. Linguist George van Driem states that the name intended by Amin was &quot;Aqsai Chöl&quot; (; ) which could mean &quot;white ravine desert&quot; or &quot;white coomb desert&quot;. The word &quot;chöl&quot; for desert seems to have been corrupted in English transliteration into &quot;chin&quot;.

Some sources have interpreted &quot;Aksai&quot; to have the Uyghur meaning &quot;white stone desert&quot;, including several British colonial, modern Western, Chinese, and Indian sources. Some modern sources interpret it to mean &quot;white brook&quot; instead. At least one source interprets &quot;Aksai&quot; to mean &quot;eastern&quot; in the Yarkandi Uyghur dialect.

The word &quot;Chin&quot; was taken to mean &quot;China&quot; by some Chinese, Western, and Indian sources. At least one source takes it to mean &quot;pass&quot;. Other sources omit &quot;Chin&quot; in their interpretations. Van Driem states that there is no Uyghur word resembling &quot;chin&quot; for China.

Amin&#x27;s Aksai Chin was not a defined region, stretching indefinitely east into Tibet south of the Kunlun Mountains. In 1895, the British envoy to Kashgar told the Chinese Taotai that Aksai Chin was a &quot;loose name for an ill-defined, elevated tableland&quot;, part of which lay in Indian and part in Chinese territory. 

The current meaning of the term is the area under dispute between India and China, having evolved in repeated usage since Indian independence in 1947.

==History==
Because of its elevation, the desolation of Aksai Chin meant that it had no human importance. For military campaigns, the region held great importance, as it was on the only route from the Tarim Basin to Tibet that was passable all year round.

Ladakh was conquered in 1842 by the armies of Raja Gulab Singh (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire. The British defeat of the Sikhs in 1846 resulted in the transfer of the Jammu and Kashmir region including Ladakh to the British, who then installed Gulab Singh as the Maharaja under their suzerainty. The British appointed a boundary commission headed by Alexander Cunningham to determine the boundaries of the state. Chinese and Tibetan officials were invited to jointly demarcate the border, but they did not show any interest. The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern part of the boundary up to the Chang Chenmo Valley, but regarded the area north of it as &quot;terra incognita&quot;.

=== The Johnson Line ===

William Johnson, a civil servant with the Survey of India proposed the &quot;Johnson Line&quot; in 1865, which put Aksai Chin in Kashmir. This was the time of the Dungan revolt, when China did not control most of Xinjiang, so this line was never presented to the Chinese. Johnson presented this line to the Maharaja of Kashmir, who then claimed the 18,000 square kilometres contained within, and by some accounts territory further north as far as the Sanju Pass in the Kun Lun Mountains. The Maharajah of Kashmir constructed a fort at Shahidulla (modern-day Xaidulla), and had troops stationed there for some years to protect caravans. Eventually, most sources placed Shahidulla and the upper Karakash River firmly within the territory of Xinjiang (see accompanying map). According to Francis Younghusband, who explored the region in the late 1880s, there was only an abandoned fort and not one inhabited house at Shahidulla when he was there – it was just a convenient staging post and a convenient headquarters for the nomadic Kirghiz. The abandoned fort had apparently been built a few years earlier by the Kashmiris. In 1878 the Chinese had reconquered Xinjiang, and by 1890 they already had Shahidulla before the issue was decided. By 1892, China had erected boundary markers at Karakoram Pass.

In 1897, a British military officer, Sir John Ardagh, proposed a boundary line along the crest of the Kun Lun Mountains north of the Yarkand River. At that time, Britain was concerned about the danger of Russian expansion as China weakened, and Ardagh argued that his line was more defensible. The Ardagh line was effectively a modification of the Johnson line, and became known as the &quot;Johnson-Ardagh Line&quot;.

=== The Macartney–Macdonald Line ===


In 1893, Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at St. Petersburg, gave maps of the region to George Macartney, the British consul general at Kashgar, which coincided in broad details. In 1899, Britain proposed a revised boundary, initially suggested by Macartney and developed by the Governor General of India Lord Elgin. This boundary placed the Lingzi Tang plains, which are south of the Laktsang range, in India, and Aksai Chin proper, which is north of the Laktsang range, in China. This border, along the Karakoram Mountains, was proposed and supported by British officials for a number of reasons. The Karakoram Mountains formed a natural boundary, which would set the British borders up to the Indus River watershed while leaving the Tarim River watershed in Chinese control, and Chinese control of this tract would present a further obstacle to Russian advance in Central Asia. The British presented this line, known as the Macartney–MacDonald Line, to the Chinese in 1899 in a note by Sir Claude MacDonald. The Qing government did not respond to the note. According to some commentators, China believed that this had been the accepted boundary.

=== McMahon line ===

The line is named after Henry McMahon, foreign secretary of British India and the chief British negotiator of the conference at Simla. The bilateral agreement between Tibet and Britain was signed by McMahon on behalf of the British government and Lonchen Shatra on behalf of the Tibetan government.

=== 1899 to 1947 ===
Both the Johnson-Ardagh and the Macartney-MacDonald lines were used on British maps of India. Until at least 1908, the British took the Macdonald line to be the boundary, but in 1911, the Xinhai Revolution resulted in the collapse of central power in China, and by the end of World War I, the British officially used the Johnson Line. However they took no steps to establish outposts or assert actual control on the ground. In 1927, the line was adjusted again as the government of British India abandoned the Johnson line in favor of a line along the Karakoram range further south. However, the maps were not updated and still showed the Johnson Line.

From 1917 to 1933, the &quot;Postal Atlas of China&quot;, published by the Government of China in Peking had shown the boundary in Aksai Chin as per the Johnson line, which runs along the Kunlun Mountains. The &quot;Peking University Atlas&quot;, published in 1925, also put the Aksai Chin in India. When British officials learned of Soviet officials surveying the Aksai Chin for Sheng Shih-tsai, warlord of Xinjiang in 1940–1941, they again advocated the Johnson Line. At this point the British had still made no attempts to establish outposts or control over the Aksai Chin, nor was the issue ever discussed with the governments of China or Tibet, and the boundary remained undemarcated at India&#x27;s independence.

=== Since 1947 ===

After Jammu and Kashmir acceded to the newly independent India in October 1947, the government of India used the Johnson Line as the basis for its official boundary in the west, which included the Aksai Chin. From the Karakoram Pass (which is not under dispute), the Indian claim line extends northeast of the Karakoram Mountains through the salt flats of the Aksai Chin, to set a boundary at the Kunlun Mountains, and incorporating part of the Karakash River and Yarkand River watersheds. From there, it runs east along the Kunlun Mountains, before turning southwest through the Aksai Chin salt flats, through the Karakoram Mountains, and then to Panggong Lake.

On 1 July 1954, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a memo directing that the maps of India be revised to show definite boundaries on all frontiers. Up to this point, the boundary in the Aksai Chin sector, based on the Johnson Line, had been described as &quot;undemarcated.&quot;

Despite this region being nearly uninhabitable and having no resources, it remains strategically important for China as it connects Tibet and Xinjiang. During the 1950s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China built a 1,200 km (750 mi) road connecting Xinjiang and western Tibet, of which 179 km (112 mi) ran south of the Johnson Line through the Aksai Chin region claimed by India. Aksai Chin was easily accessible to the Chinese, but was more difficult for the Indians on the other side of the Karakorams to reach. The Indians did not learn of the existence of the road until 1957, which was confirmed when the road was shown in Chinese maps published in 1958. The construction of this highway was one of the triggers for the Sino-Indian War of 1962.

The Indian position, as stated by Prime Minister Nehru, was that the Aksai Chin was &quot;part of the Ladakh region of India for centuries&quot; and that this northern border was a &quot;firm and definite one which was not open to discussion with anybody&quot;.

The Chinese premier Zhou Enlai argued that the western border had never been delimited, that the Macartney-MacDonald Line, which left the Aksai Chin within Chinese borders was the only line ever proposed to a Chinese government, and that the Aksai Chin was already under Chinese jurisdiction, and that negotiations should take into account the status quo.

In June 2006, satellite imagery on the Google Earth service revealed a 1:500 scale terrain model of eastern Aksai Chin and adjacent Tibet, built near the town of Huangyangtan, about southwest of Yinchuan, the capital of the autonomous region of Ningxia in China. A visual side-by-side comparison shows a very detailed duplication of Aksai Chin in the camp. The model was surrounded by a substantial facility, with rows of red-roofed buildings, scores of olive-coloured trucks and a large compound with elevated lookout posts and a large communications tower. Such terrain models are known to be used in military training and simulation, although usually on a much smaller scale.

Local authorities in Ningxia claim that their model of Aksai Chin is part of a tank training ground, built in 1998 or 1999.

In August 2017, Indian and Chinese forces near Pangong Tso threw rocks at each other.

On 11 September 2019, People&#x27;s Liberation Army troops confronted Indian troops on the northern bank of Pangong Lake.

A continued face-off in the 2020 China–India skirmishes of May and June 2020 between Indian and Chinese troops near Pangong Tso Lake culminated in a violent clash on 16 June 2020, with at least 20 deaths from the Indian side and no official reported deaths from the Chinese side. In 2021, Chinese state media reported 4 Chinese deaths. Both sides claimed provocation from the other.

==Geography==

Aksai Chin is one of the two large disputed border areas between India and China. India claims Aksai Chin as the easternmost part of the union territory of Ladakh. China claims that Aksai Chin is part of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet Autonomous Region. The line that separates Indian-administered areas of Ladakh from Aksai Chin is known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and is concurrent with the Chinese Aksai Chin claim line.

The Aksai region is a sparsely populated region with few settlements such as Heweitan, Khurnak Fort, Tianshuihai and Dahongliutan and Kangxiwar which lays north of it, with the latter being the forward headquarters of the Xinjiang Military Command during the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

Aksai Chin covers an area of approximately . The area is largely a vast high-altitude desert with a low point (on the &quot;Karakash River&quot;) at about above sea level. In the southwest, mountains up to extending southeast from the Depsang Plains form the &quot;de facto&quot; border (Line of Actual Control) between Aksai Chin and Indian-controlled Kashmir.

In the north, the Kunlun Range separates Aksai Chin from the Tarim Basin, where the rest of Hotan County is situated. According to a recent detailed Chinese map, no roads cross the Kunlun Range within Hotan Prefecture, and only one track does so, over the Hindutash Pass.

Aksai Chin area has number of endorheic basins with many salt or soda lakes. The major salt lakes are Surigh Yilganing Kol, Tso Tang, Aksai Chin Lake, Hongshan Lake, etc. Much of the northern part of Aksai Chin is referred to as the Soda Plains, located near Aksai Chin&#x27;s largest river, the Karakash, which receives meltwater from a number of glaciers, crosses the Kunlun farther northwest, in Pishan County and enters the Tarim Basin, where it serves as one of the main sources of water for Karakax and Hotan Counties.

The western part of Aksai Chin region is drained by the Tarim River. The eastern part of the region contains several small endorheic basins. The largest of them is that of the Aksai Chin Lake, which is fed by the river of the same name. The region as a whole receives little precipitation as the Himalayas and the Karakoram block the rains from the Indian monsoon.

The nearby Trans-Karakoram Tract is also the subject of ongoing dispute between China and India in the Kashmir dispute.

==Demographics and economics==
Prior to 1950, the visitors of Aksai Chin were, for the most part, the occasional explorers, hunters, and nomads who passed through the area.

Prior to European exploration in the 1860s, there were some jade mining operations on the Xinjiang side of Aksai Chin. They were abandoned by the time European explorers reached the area. In the 1860s to 1870s, in order to facilitate trade between the Indian subcontinent and Tarim Basin, the British attempted to promote a caravan route via the western side of Aksai Chin as an alternative to the difficult and tariffed Karakoram Pass. The route, referred to as the Chang Chenmo line after the starting point in Chang Chenmo River valley, was discussed in the House of Commons in 1874. In addition of being longer and higher elevation than Karakoram Pass, it also goes through the desolate desert of Aksai Chin. By 1890s, traders had mostly given up on this route.

In the 1950s, India collected salt from various lakes in Aksai Chin to study the economic feasibility of salt mining operations in the area.

By the end of the 1950s, in addition to having constructed a road, numerous PLA Ground Force outposts were constructed in a few locations, including at Tianwendian, Kongka Pass, Heweitan and Tianshuihai. The road was later upgraded to the China National Highway 219. In the modern day, there are a few businesses along the highway serving motorists.

In the 2010s, geological surveys were conducted in the Western Kunlun region, which Aksai Chin is part of. Huoshaoyun, a major lead-zinc deposit, and numerous smaller deposits were discovered in the region. Huoshaoyun is a mountain located in Aksai Chin near the Tibetan border. The mining development for Huoshaoyun started in 2017.

==Transportation==
China National Highway 219 runs through Aksai Chin connecting Tibet (Ngari Prefecture) and Xinjiang (Hotan Prefecture).

In July 2022, Ministry of Transport of China published updated &quot;China National Highway Network Plan&quot; that includes China National Highway 695 which will go from Lhünzê Town, Lhünzê County, Tibet to Mazar Township, Yining County, Xinjiang travelling through Aksai Chin.

<text>The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design is a 1986 book by Richard Dawkins, in which the author presents an explanation of, and argument for, the theory of evolution by means of natural selection. He also presents arguments to refute certain criticisms made on his first book, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;. (Both books espouse the gene-centric view of evolution.) An unabridged audiobook edition was released in 2011, narrated by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward.

== Synopsis ==
The title of the book refers to the watchmaker analogy made famous by William Paley in his 1802 book &quot;Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity&quot;. Paley, writing long before Charles Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, held that the complexity of living organisms was evidence of the existence of a divine creator by drawing a parallel with the way in which the existence of a watch compels belief in an intelligent watchmaker. Dawkins, in contrasting the differences between human design and its potential for planning with the workings of natural selection, therefore dubbed evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker.

To dispel the idea that complexity cannot arise without the intervention of a &quot;creator&quot;, Dawkins uses the example of the eye. Beginning with a simple organism, capable only of distinguishing between light and dark, in only the crudest fashion, he takes the reader through a series of minor modifications, which build in sophistication until we arrive at the elegant and complex mammalian eye. In making this journey, he points to several creatures whose various seeing apparatus are, whilst still useful, living examples of intermediate levels of complexity.

In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins&#x27; first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity as a result of pure randomness, as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer simulation of artificial selection implemented in a program also called &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.

The program displayed a two-dimensional shape (a &quot;biomorph&quot;) made up of straight black lines, the length, position, and angle of which were defined by a simple set of rules and instructions (analogous to a genome). Adding new lines (or removing them) based on these rules offered a discrete set of possible new shapes (mutations), which were displayed on screen so that the user could choose between them. The chosen mutation would then be the basis for another generation of biomorph mutants to be chosen from, and so on. Thus, the user, by selection, could steer the evolution of biomorphs. This process often produced images which were reminiscent of real organisms for instance beetles, bats, or trees. Dawkins speculated that the unnatural selection role played by the user in this program could be replaced by a more natural agent if, for example, colourful biomorphs could be selected by butterflies or other insects, via a touch-sensitive display set up in a garden.

In an appendix to the 1996 edition of the book, Dawkins explains how his experiences with computer models led him to a greater appreciation of the role of embryological constraints on natural selection. In particular, he recognised that certain patterns of embryological development could lead to the success of a related &quot;group&quot; of species in filling varied ecological niches, though he emphasised that this should not be confused with group selection. He dubbed this insight &quot;the evolution of evolvability&quot;.

After arguing that evolution is capable of explaining the origin of complexity, near the end of the book Dawkins uses this to argue against the existence of God: &quot;a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution ... must already have been vastly complex in the first place ...&quot; He calls this &quot;postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation&quot;.

In the preface, Dawkins states that he wrote the book &quot;to persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view &quot;happens&quot; to be true, but that it is the only known theory that &quot;could&quot;, in principle, solve the mystery of our existence&quot;.

==Reception==
Tim Radford, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noted that despite Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;combative secular humanism&quot;, he had written &quot;a patient, often beautiful book... that begins in a generous mood and sustains its generosity to the end.&quot; 30 years on, people still read the book, Radford argues, because it is &quot;one of the best books ever to address, patiently and persuasively, the question that has baffled bishops and disconcerted dissenters alike: how did nature achieve its astonishing complexity and variety?&quot;

Philosopher and historian of biology Michael T. Ghiselin, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, comments that Dawkins &quot;succeeds admirably in showing how natural selection allows biologists to dispense with such notions as purpose and design&quot;. He notes that analogies with computer programs have their limitations, but are still useful. Ghiselin observes that Dawkins is &quot; content with rebutting creationists&quot; but goes on to press home his arguments against alternative theories to neo-Darwinism. He thinks the book fills the need to know more about evolution that creationists &quot;would conceal from them.&quot; He concludes that &quot;Readers who are not outraged will be delighted.&quot;

The American philosopher of religion Dallas Willard, reflecting on the book, denies the connection of evolution to the validity of arguments from design to God: whereas, he asserts, Dawkins seems to consider the arguments to rest entirely on that basis. Willard argues that Chapter 6, &quot;Origins and Miracles&quot;, attempts the &quot;hard task&quot; of making not just a blind watchmaker but &quot;a blind watchmaker watchmaker&quot;, which he comments would have made an &quot;honest&quot; title for the book. He notes that Dawkins demolishes several &quot;weak&quot; arguments, such as the argument from personal incredulity. He denies that Dawkins&#x27;s computer &quot;exercises&quot; and arguments from gradual change show that complex forms of life could have evolved. Willard concludes by arguing that in writing this book, Dawkins is not functioning as a scientist &quot;in the line of Darwin&quot;, but as &quot;just a naturalist metaphysician&quot;.

==Influence==
The engineer Theo Jansen read the book in 1986 and became fascinated by evolution and natural selection. Since 1990 he has been building kinetic sculptures, the &quot;Strandbeest&quot;, capable of walking when impelled by the wind.

The journalist Dick Pountain described Sean B. Carroll&#x27;s 2005 account of evolutionary developmental biology, &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot;, as the most important popular science book since &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, &quot;and in effect a sequel [to it].&quot;

<text>Shade is the blocking of sunlight (in particular direct sunshine) by any object, and also the shadow created by that object. It may refer to blocking of sunlight by a roof, a tree, an umbrella, a window shade or blind, wall, curtains, or other objects.

==As a resource==
In temperate and tropical zones (most places on Earth), shade is an important issue in providing cooling and shelter from harmful heat and ultraviolet emitted by the Sun.

==Plants==
Green plants produce shade by absorbing sunlight to invest as energy in photosynthesis to produce sugar. They also actively transpire, producing an additional cooling effect.

In gardening terms, there are various types of shade:
*Full sun – more than five hours of direct sun per day.
*Part shade – two to five hours of direct sun, or all-day &quot;&quot; (sunlight shining through open trees).
*Full shade – less than two hours of direct sun per day.

Under a dense forest canopy, light intensity can be very low. Special adaptations produce the shade tolerance that allows plants to survive in the understory.
In addition, shade within a canopy can elicit shade avoidance responses whereby plants elongate their shoots in order to reach light for optimal photosynthesis.

<doc id="66996" wikidata="Q741598" url="?curid=66996" title="Kin selection">
<text>Kin selection is a process whereby natural selection favours a trait due to its positive effects on the reproductive success of an organism&#x27;s relatives, even when at a cost to the organism&#x27;s own survival and reproduction. Kin selection can lead to the evolution of altruistic behaviour. It is related to inclusive fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others (weighted by the relatedness between individuals). A broader definition of kin selection includes selection acting on interactions between individuals who share a gene of interest even if the gene is not shared due to common ancestry.

Charles Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his 1859 book, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects, such as honey bees, which leave reproduction to their mothers, arguing that a selection benefit to related organisms (the same &quot;stock&quot;) would allow the evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the same time. J.B.S. Haldane in 1955 briefly alluded to the principle in limited circumstances (Haldane famously joked that he would willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins), and R.A. Fisher mentioned a similar principle even more briefly in 1930. However, it was not until 1964 that W.D. Hamilton generalised the concept and developed it mathematically (resulting in Hamilton&#x27;s rule) that it began to be widely accepted. The mathematical treatment was made more elegant in 1970 due to advances made by George R. Price. The term &quot;kin selection&quot; was first used by John Maynard Smith in 1964.

According to Hamilton&#x27;s rule, kin selection causes genes to increase in frequency when the genetic relatedness of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient is greater than the reproductive cost to the actor. Hamilton proposed two mechanisms for kin selection. First, kin recognition allows individuals to be able to identify their relatives. Second, in viscous populations, populations in which the movement of organisms from their place of birth is relatively slow, local interactions tend to be among relatives by default. The viscous population mechanism makes kin selection and social cooperation possible in the absence of kin recognition. In this case, nurture kinship, the interaction between related individuals, simply as a result of living in each other&#x27;s proximity, is sufficient for kin selection, given reasonable assumptions about population dispersal rates. Kin selection is not the same thing as group selection, where natural selection is believed to act on the group as a whole.

In humans, altruism is both more likely and on a larger scale with kin than with unrelated individuals; for example, humans give presents according to how closely related they are to the recipient. In other species, vervet monkeys use allomothering, where related females such as older sisters or grandmothers often care for young, according to their relatedness. The social shrimp &quot;Synalpheus regalis&quot; protects juveniles within highly related colonies.

==Historical overview==

Charles Darwin was the first to discuss the concept of kin selection (without using that term). In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, he wrote about the conundrum represented by altruistic sterile social insects that:

In this passage &quot;the family&quot; and &quot;stock&quot; stand for a kin group. These passages and others by Darwin about kin selection are highlighted in D.J. Futuyma&#x27;s textbook of reference &quot;Evolutionary Biology&quot; and in E. O. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Kin selection was briefly referred to by R.A. Fisher in 1930 and J.B.S. Haldane in 1932 and 1955. J.B.S. Haldane grasped the basic quantities in kin selection, famously writing &quot;I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins&quot;. Haldane&#x27;s remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life to save two siblings, four nephews, or eight cousins, it is a &quot;fair deal&quot; in evolutionary terms, as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent, nephews 25%, and cousins 12.5% (in a diploid population that is randomly mating and previously outbred). But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to save more than a single identical twin of his or more than two full siblings. In 1955 he clarified:

W. D. Hamilton, in 1963 and especially in 1964 generalised the concept and developed it mathematically, showing that it holds for genes even when they are not rare, deriving Hamilton&#x27;s rule and defining a new quantity known as an individual&#x27;s inclusive fitness. He is widely credited as the founder of the field of social evolution. A more elegant mathematical treatment was made possible by George Price in 1970.

John Maynard Smith may have coined the actual term &quot;kin selection&quot; in 1964:

Kin selection causes changes in gene frequency across generations, driven by interactions between related individuals. This dynamic forms the conceptual basis of the theory of sociobiology. Some cases of evolution by natural selection can only be understood by considering how biological relatives influence each other&#x27;s fitness. Under natural selection, a gene encoding a trait that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase in frequency within the population; and conversely, a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated. However, a hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behaviour, may nonetheless increase in frequency, because relatives often carry the same gene. According to this principle, the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour, making kin selection possible. This is a special case of a more general model, &quot;inclusive fitness&quot;. This analysis has been challenged, Wilson writing that &quot;the foundations of the general theory of inclusive fitness based on the theory of kin selection have crumbled&quot; and that he now relies instead on the theory of eusociality and &quot;gene-culture co-evolution&quot; for the underlying mechanics of sociobiology. Inclusive fitness theory is still generally accepted however, as demonstrated by the publication of a rebuttal to Wilson&#x27;s claims in &quot;Nature&quot; from over a hundred researchers.

Kin selection is contrasted with group selection, according to which a genetic trait can become prevalent within a group because it benefits the group as a whole, regardless of any benefit to individual organisms. All known forms of group selection conform to the principle that an individual behaviour can be evolutionarily successful only if the genes responsible for this behaviour conform to Hamilton&#x27;s Rule, and hence, on balance and in the aggregate, benefit from the behaviour.

==Hamilton&#x27;s rule==

Formally, genes should increase in frequency when

:formula_1

where
:&quot;r&quot; = the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor, often defined as the probability that a gene picked randomly from each at the same locus is identical by descent.
:&quot;B&quot; = the additional reproductive benefit gained by the recipient of the altruistic act,
:&quot;C&quot; = the reproductive cost to the individual performing the act.

This inequality is known as Hamilton&#x27;s rule after W. D. Hamilton who in 1964 published the first formal quantitative treatment of kin selection.

The relatedness parameter (&quot;r&quot;) in Hamilton&#x27;s rule was introduced in 1922 by Sewall Wright as a coefficient of relationship that gives the probability that at a random locus, the alleles there will be identical by descent. Modern formulations of the rule use Alan Grafen&#x27;s definition of relatedness based on the theory of linear regression.

A 2014 review of many lines of evidence for Hamilton&#x27;s rule found that its predictions were confirmed in a wide variety of social behaviours across a broad phylogenetic range of birds, mammals and insects, in each case comparing social and non-social taxa. Among the experimental findings, a 2010 study used a wild population of red squirrels in Yukon, Canada. Surrogate mothers adopted related orphaned squirrel pups but not unrelated orphans. The cost of adoption was calculated by measuring a decrease in the survival probability of the entire litter after increasing the litter by one pup, while benefit was measured as the increased chance of survival of the orphan. The degree of relatedness of the orphan and surrogate mother for adoption to occur depended on the number of pups the surrogate mother already had in her nest, as this affected the cost of adoption. Females always adopted orphans when &quot;rB&quot; was greater than &quot;C&quot;, but never adopted when &quot;rB&quot; was less than &quot;C&quot;, supporting Hamilton&#x27;s rule.

==Mechanisms==

Altruism occurs where the instigating individual suffers a fitness loss while the receiving individual experiences a fitness gain. The sacrifice of one individual to help another is an example.

Hamilton outlined two ways in which kin selection altruism could be favoured:

=== Kin recognition and the green beard effect===

First, if individuals have the capacity to recognise kin and to discriminate (positively) on the basis of kinship, then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough for kin selection. Because of the facultative nature of this mechanism, kin recognition and discrimination were expected to be unimportant except among &#x27;higher&#x27; forms of life. However, as molecular recognition mechanisms have been shown to operate in organisms such as slime moulds kin recognition has much wider importance than previously recognised. Kin recognition may be selected for inbreeding avoidance, and little evidence indicates that &#x27;innate&#x27; kin recognition plays a role in mediating altruism. A thought experiment on the kin recognition/discrimination distinction is the hypothetical &#x27;green beard&#x27;, where a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there should be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed, making common ancestry the most likely form of inclusive fitness. This suppression is overcome if new phenotypes -other beard colours- are formed through mutation or introduced into the population from time to time. This proposed mechanism goes by the name of &#x27;beard chromodynamics&#x27;.

=== Viscous populations ===

Secondly, indiscriminate altruism may be favoured in &quot;viscous&quot; populations, those with low rates or short ranges of dispersal. Here, social partners are typically related, and so altruism can be selective advantageous without the need for kin recognition and kin discrimination faculties—spatial proximity, together with limited dispersal, ensures that social interactions are more often with related individuals. This suggests a rather general explanation for altruism. Directional selection always favours those with higher rates of fecundity within a certain population. Social individuals can often enhance the survival of their own kin by participating in and following the rules of their own group.

Hamilton later modified his thinking to suggest that an innate ability to recognise actual genetic relatedness was unlikely to be the dominant mediating mechanism for kin altruism:

Hamilton&#x27;s later clarifications often go unnoticed. Stuart West and colleagues have countered the long-standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin recognition. Another doubtful assumption is that social cooperation must be based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context. Such ideas have obscured the progress made in applying kin selection to species including humans, on the basis of cue-based mediation of social bonding and social behaviours.

== Special cases ==

===Eusociality===


Eusociality (true sociality) occurs in social systems with three characteristics: an overlap in generations between parents and their offspring, cooperative brood care, and specialised castes of non-reproductive individuals. The social insects provide good examples of organisms with what appear to be kin selected traits. The workers of some species are sterile, a trait that would not occur if individual selection was the only process at work. The relatedness coefficient &quot;r&quot; is abnormally high between the worker sisters in a colony of Hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy. Hamilton&#x27;s rule is presumed to be satisfied because the benefits in fitness for the workers are believed to exceed the costs in terms of lost reproductive opportunity, though this has never been demonstrated empirically. Competing hypotheses have been offered to explain the evolution of social behaviour in such organisms.

The eusocial shrimp &quot;Synalpheus regalis&quot; protects juveniles in the colony. By defending the young, the large defender shrimp can increase its inclusive fitness. Allozyme data demonstrated high relatedness within colonies, averaging 0.50. This means that colonies represent close kin groups, supporting the hypothesis of kin selection.

=== Allomothering ===


Vervet monkeys utilise allomothering, parenting by group members other than the actual mother or father, where the allomother is typically an older female sibling or a grandmother. Individuals act aggressively toward other individuals that were aggressive toward their relatives. The behaviour implies kin selection between siblings, between mothers and offspring, and between grandparents and grandchildren.

==In humans==
Whether or not Hamilton&#x27;s rule always applies, relatedness is often important for human altruism, in that humans are inclined to behave more altruistically toward kin than toward unrelated individuals. Many people choose to live near relatives, exchange sizeable gifts with relatives, and favour relatives in wills in proportion to their relatedness.

===Experimental studies, interviews, and surveys===
Interviews of several hundred women in Los Angeles showed that while non-kin friends were willing to help one another, their assistance was far more likely to be reciprocal. The largest amounts of non-reciprocal help, however, were reportedly provided by kin. Additionally, more closely related kin were considered more likely sources of assistance than distant kin. Similarly, several surveys of American college students found that individuals were more likely to incur the cost of assisting kin when a high probability that relatedness and benefit would be greater than cost existed. Participants&#x27; feelings of helpfulness were stronger toward family members than non-kin. Additionally, participants were found to be most willing to help those individuals most closely related to them. Interpersonal relationships between kin in general were more supportive and less Machiavellian than those between non-kin.

In one experiment, the longer participants (from both the UK and the South African Zulus) held a painful skiing position, the more money or food was presented to a given relative. Participants repeated the experiment for individuals of different relatedness (parents and siblings at r=.5, grandparents, nieces, and nephews at r=.25, etc.). The results showed that participants held the position for longer intervals the greater the degree of relatedness between themselves and those receiving the reward.

===Observational studies===
A study of food-sharing practices on the West Caroline islets of Ifaluk determined that food-sharing was more common among people from the same islet, possibly because the degree of relatedness between inhabitants of the same islet would be higher than relatedness between inhabitants of different islets. When food was shared between islets, the distance the sharer was required to travel correlated with the relatedness of the recipient—a greater distance meant that the recipient needed to be a closer relative. The relatedness of the individual and the potential inclusive fitness benefit needed to outweigh the energy cost of transporting the food over distance.

Humans may use the inheritance of material goods and wealth to maximise their inclusive fitness. By providing close kin with inherited wealth, an individual may improve his or her kin&#x27;s reproductive opportunities and thus increase his or her own inclusive fitness even after death. A study of a thousand wills found that the beneficiaries who received the most inheritance were generally those most closely related to the will&#x27;s writer. Distant kin received proportionally less inheritance, with the least amount of inheritance going to non-kin.

A study of childcare practices among Canadian women found that respondents with children provide childcare reciprocally with non-kin. The cost of caring for non-kin was balanced by the benefit a woman received—having her own offspring cared for in return. However, respondents without children were significantly more likely to offer childcare to kin. For individuals without their own offspring, the inclusive fitness benefits of providing care to closely related children might outweigh the time and energy costs of childcare.

Family investment in offspring among black South African households also appears consistent with an inclusive fitness model. A higher degree of relatedness between children and their caregivers was correlated with a higher degree of investment in the children, with more food, health care, and clothing. Relatedness was also associated with the regularity of a child&#x27;s visits to local medical practitioners and with the highest grade the child had completed in school, and negatively associated with children being behind in school for their age.

Observation of the Dolgan hunter-gatherers of northern Russia suggested that there are larger and more frequent asymmetrical transfers of food to kin. Kin are more likely to be welcomed to non-reciprocal meals, while non-kin are discouraged from attending. Finally, when reciprocal food-sharing occurs between families, these families are often closely related, and the primary beneficiaries are the offspring.

Violence in families is more likely when step-parents are present, and that &quot;genetic relationship is associated with a softening of conflict, and people&#x27;s evident valuations of themselves and of others are systematically related to the parties&#x27; reproductive values&quot;. Numerous studies suggest how inclusive fitness may work amongst different peoples, such as the Ye&#x27;kwana of southern Venezuela, the Gypsies of Hungary, and the doomed Donner Party of the United States.

===Human social patterns===


Evolutionary psychologists, following early human sociobiologists&#x27; interpretation of kin selection theory initially attempted to explain human altruistic behaviour through kin selection by stating that &quot;behaviors that help a genetic relative are favored by natural selection.&quot; However, many evolutionary psychologists recognise that this common shorthand formulation is inaccurate:

As with the earlier sociobiological forays into the cross-cultural data, typical approaches are not able to find explanatory fit with the findings of ethnographers insofar that human kinship patterns are not necessarily built upon blood-ties. However, as Hamilton&#x27;s later refinements of his theory make clear, it does not simply predict that genetically related individuals will inevitably recognise and engage in positive social behaviours with genetic relatives: rather, indirect context-based mechanisms may have evolved, which in historical environments have met the inclusive fitness criterion. Consideration of the demographics of the typical evolutionary environment of any species is crucial to understanding the evolution of social behaviours. As Hamilton himself put it, &quot;Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start&quot;.

Under this perspective, and noting the necessity of a reliable context of interaction being available, the data on how altruism is mediated in social mammals is readily made sense of. In social mammals, primates and humans, altruistic acts that meet the kin selection criterion are typically mediated by circumstantial cues such as shared developmental environment, familiarity and social bonding. That is, it is the context that mediates the development of the bonding process and the expression of the altruistic behaviours, not genetic relatedness as such. This interpretation is compatible with the cross-cultural ethnographic data and has been called nurture kinship.

== In plants ==

=== Observations ===

Though originally thought unique to the animal kingdom, evidence of kin selection has been identified in the plant kingdom.

Competition for resources between developing zygotes in plant ovaries increases when seeds had been pollinated with male gametes from different plants. How developing zygotes differentiate between full siblings and half-siblings in the ovary is undetermined, but genetic interactions are thought to play a role. Nonetheless, competition between zygotes in the ovary is detrimental to the reproductive success of the (female) plant, and fewer zygotes mature into seeds. As such, the reproductive traits and behaviors of plants suggests the evolution of behaviors and characteristics that increase the genetic relatedness of fertilized eggs in the plant ovary, thereby fostering kin selection and cooperation among the seeds as they develop. These traits differ among plant species. Some species have evolved to have fewer ovules per ovary, commonly one ovule per ovary, thereby decreasing the chance of developing multiple, differently fathered seeds within the same ovary. Multi-ovulated plants have developed mechanisms that increase the chances of all ovules within the ovary being fathered by the same parent. Such mechanisms include dispersal of pollen in aggregated packets and closure of the stigmatic lobes after pollen is introduced. The aggregated pollen packet releases pollen gametes in the ovary, thereby increasing likelihood that all ovules are fertilized by pollen from the same parent. Likewise, the closure of the ovary pore prevents entry of new pollen. Other multi-ovulated plants have evolved mechanisms that mimic the evolutionary adaption of single-ovulated ovaries; the ovules are fertilized by pollen from different individuals, but the mother ovary then selectively aborts fertilized ovules, either at the zygotic or embryonic stage.

After seeds are dispersed, kin recognition and cooperation affects root formation in developing plants. Studies have found that the total root mass developed by &quot;Ipomoea hederacea&quot; (morning glory shrubs) grown next to kin is significantly smaller than those grown next to non-kin; shrubs grown next to kin thus allocate less energy and resources to growing the larger root systems needed for competitive growth. When seedlings were grown in individual pots placed next to kin or non-kin relatives, no difference in root growth was observed. This indicates that kin recognition occurs via signals received by the roots. Further, groups of &quot;I. hederacea&quot; plants are more varied in height when grown with kin than when grown with non-kin. The evolutionary benefit provided by this was further investigated by researchers at the Université de Montpellier. They found that the alternating heights seen in kin-grouped crops allowed for optimal light availability to all plants in the group; shorter plants next to taller plants had access to more light than those surrounded by plants of similar height.

The above examples illustrate the effect of kin selection in the equitable allocation of light, nutrients, and water. The evolutionary emergence of single-ovulated ovaries in plants has eliminated the need for a developing seed to compete for nutrients, thus increasing its chance of survival and germination. Likewise, the fathering of all ovules in multi-ovulated ovaries by one father, decreases the likelihood of competition between developing seeds, thereby also increasing the seeds&#x27; chances of survival and germination. The decreased root growth in plants grown with kin increases the amount of energy available for reproduction; plants grown with kin produced more seeds than those grown with non-kin. Similarly, the increase in light made available by alternating heights in groups of related plants is associated with higher fecundity.

Kin selection has also been observed in plant responses to herbivory. In an experiment done by Richard Karban et al., leaves of potted &quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot; (sagebrushes) were clipped with scissors to simulate herbivory. The gaseous volatiles emitted by the clipped leaves were captured in a plastic bag. When these volatiles were transferred to leaves of a closely related sagebrush, the recipient experienced lower levels of herbivory than those that had been exposed to volatiles released by non-kin plants. Sagebrushes do not uniformly emit the same volatiles in response to herbivory: the chemical ratios and composition of emitted volatiles vary from one sagebrush to another. Closely related sagebrushes emit similar volatiles, and the similarities decrease as relatedness decreases. This suggests that the composition of volatile gasses plays a role in kin selection among plants. Volatiles from a distantly related plant are less likely to induce a protective response against herbivory in a neighboring plant, than volatiles from a closely related plant. This fosters kin selection, as the volatiles emitted by a plant will activate the herbivorous defense response in related plants only, thus increasing their chance of survival and reproduction.

Kin selection may play a role in plant-pollinator interactions, especially because pollinator attraction is influenced not only by floral displays, but by the spatial arrangement of plants in a group, which is referred to as the &quot;magnet effect&quot;. For example, in an experiment performed on &quot;Moricandia moricandioides&quot;, Torices et al. demonstrated that focal plants in the presence of kin show increased advertising effort (defined as total petal mass of plants in a group divided by the plant biomass) compared to those in the presence of non-kin, and that this effect is greater in larger groups. &quot;M. moricandioides&quot; is a good model organism for the study of plant-pollinator interactions because it relies on pollinators for reproduction, as it is self-incompatible. The study design for this experiment included planting establishing pots of &quot;M. moricandioides&quot; with zero, three or six neighbors (either unrelated or half-sib progeny of the same mother) and advertising effort was calculated after 26 days of flowering. The exact mechanism of kin recognition in &quot;M. moricandioides&quot; is unknown, but possible mechanisms include above-ground communication with volatile compounds, or below-ground communication with root exudates.

=== Mechanisms in plants ===

The ability to differentiate between kin and non-kin is not necessary for kin selection in many animals. However, because plants do not reliably germinate in close proximity to kin, it is thought that, within the plant kingdom, kin recognition is especially important for kin selection there, but the mechanism remains unknown.

One proposed mechanism for kin recognition involves communication through roots, with secretion and reception of root exudates. This would require exudates to be actively secreted by roots of one plant, and detected by roots of neighboring plants. The root exudate allantoin produced by rice plants, &quot;Oryza sativa&quot;, has been documented to be in greater production when growing next to cultivars that are largely unrelated. High production levels of Allantoin correlated to up regulation of auxin and auxin transporters, resulting in increased lateral root development and directional growth of their roots towards non kin, maximizing competition. This is mainly not observed in &quot;Oryza Sativa&quot; when surrounded by kin, invoking altruistic behaviors to promote inclusive fitness. However the root receptors responsible for recognition of kin exudates, and the pathway induced by receptor activation, remain unknown. The mycorrhiza associated with roots might facilitate reception of exudates, but again the mechanism is unknown.

Another possibility is communication through green leaf volatiles. Karban et al. studied kin recognition in sagebrushes, &quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot;. The volatile-donating sagebrushes were kept in individual pots, separate from the plants that received the volatiles, finding that plants responded to herbivore damage to a neighbour&#x27;s leaves. This suggests that root signalling is not necessary to induce a protective response against herbivory in neighbouring kin plants. Karban et al. suggest that plants may be able to differentiate between kin and non-kin based on the composition of volatiles. Because only the recipient sagebrush&#x27;s leaves were exposed the volatiles presumably activated a receptor protein in the plant&#x27;s leaves. The identity of this receptor, and the signalling pathway triggered by its activation, both remain to be discovered.

==Objections==

The theory of kin selection has been criticised by W. J. Alonso (in 1998) and by Alonso and C. Schuck-Paim (in 2002). They argue that the behaviours which kin selection attempts to explain are not altruistic (in pure Darwinian terms) because: (1) they may directly favour the performer as an individual aiming to maximise its progeny (so the behaviours can be explained as ordinary individual selection); (2) these behaviours benefit the group (so they can be explained as group selection); or (3) they are by-products of a developmental system of many &quot;individuals&quot; performing different tasks (like a colony of bees, or the cells of multicellular organisms, which are the focus of selection). They also argue that the genes involved in sex ratio conflicts could be treated as &quot;parasites&quot; of (already established) social colonies, not as their &quot;promoters&quot;, and, therefore the sex ratio in colonies would be irrelevant to the transition to eusociality. Those ideas were mostly ignored until they were put forward again in a series of controversial papers by E. O. Wilson, Bert Hölldobler, Martin Nowak and Corina Tarnita. Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson argued that

They, like Alonso and Schuck-Paim, argue for a multi-level selection model instead. This aroused a strong response, including a rebuttal published in &quot;Nature&quot; from over a hundred researchers.

<text>Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where), patterns and determinants of health and disease conditions in a defined population, and application of this knowledge to prevent diseases.

It is a cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.

Major areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance, environmental epidemiology, forensic epidemiology, occupational epidemiology, screening, biomonitoring, and comparisons of treatment effects such as in clinical trials. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and distal causes, and engineering for exposure assessment.

&quot;Epidemiology&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the study of what is upon the people&quot;, is derived , suggesting that it applies only to human populations. However, the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations (veterinary epidemiology), although the term &quot;epizoology&quot; is available, and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations (botanical or plant disease epidemiology).

The distinction between &quot;epidemic&quot; and &quot;endemic&quot; was first drawn by Hippocrates, to distinguish between diseases that are &quot;visited upon&quot; a population (epidemic) from those that &quot;reside within&quot; a population (endemic). The term &quot;epidemiology&quot; appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician in &quot;Epidemiología Española&quot;. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a syndemic.

The term epidemiology is now widely applied to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic, infectious disease, but of disease in general, including related conditions. Some examples of topics examined through epidemiology include as high blood pressure, mental illness and obesity. Therefore, this epidemiology is based upon how the pattern of the disease causes change in the function of human beings.

== History ==

The Greek physician Hippocrates, taught by Democritus, was known as the father of medicine, sought a logic to sickness; he is the first person known to have examined the relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental influences. Hippocrates believed sickness of the human body to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors (black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). The cure to the sickness was to remove or add the humor in question to balance the body. This belief led to the application of bloodletting and dieting in medicine. He coined the terms &quot;endemic&quot; (for diseases usually found in some places but not in others) and &quot;epidemic&quot; (for diseases that are seen at some times but not others).

=== Modern era ===

In the middle of the 16th century, a doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that the very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted Galen&#x27;s miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book &quot;De contagione et contagiosis morbis&quot;, in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.

During the Ming dynasty, Wu Youke (1582–1652) developed the idea that some diseases were caused by transmissible agents, which he called &quot;Li Qi&quot; (戾气 or pestilential factors) when he observed various epidemics rage around him between 1641 and 1644. His book &quot;Wen Yi Lun&quot; (瘟疫论, Treatise on Pestilence/Treatise of Epidemic Diseases) can be regarded as the main etiological work that brought forward the concept. His concepts were still being considered in analysing SARS outbreak by WHO in 2004 in the context of traditional Chinese medicine.

Another pioneer, Thomas Sydenham (1624–1689), was the first to distinguish the fevers of Londoners in the later 1600s. His theories on cures of fevers met with much resistance from traditional physicians at the time. He was not able to find the initial cause of the smallpox fever he researched and treated.

John Graunt, a haberdasher and amateur statistician, published &quot;Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality&quot; in 1662. In it, he analysed the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague, presented one of the first life tables, and reported time trends for many diseases, new and old. He provided statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and also refuted some widespread ideas on them.
John Snow is famous for his investigations into the causes of the 19th-century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) Epidemiology. He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of epidemiology. Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology, having helped shape public health policies around the world. However, Snow&#x27;s research and preventive measures to avoid further outbreaks were not fully accepted or put into practice until after his death due to the prevailing Miasma Theory of the time, a model of disease in which poor air quality was blamed for illness. This was used to rationalize high rates of infection in impoverished areas instead of addressing the underlying issues of poor nutrition and sanitation, and was proven false by his work.

Other pioneers include Danish physician Peter Anton Schleisner, who in 1849 related his work on the prevention of the epidemic of neonatal tetanus on the Vestmanna Islands in Iceland. Another important pioneer was Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who in 1847 brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure. His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill-received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister &#x27;discovered&#x27; antiseptics in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur.

In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross, Janet Lane-Claypon, Anderson Gray McKendrick, and others. In a parallel development during the 1920s, German-Swiss pathologist Max Askanazy and others founded the International Society for Geographical Pathology to systematically investigate the geographical pathology of cancer and other non-infectious diseases across populations in different regions. After World War II, Richard Doll and other non-pathologists joined the field and advanced methods to study cancer, a disease with patterns and mode of occurrences that could not be suitably studied with the methods developed for epidemics of infectious diseases. Geography pathology eventually combined with infectious disease epidemiology to make the field that is epidemiology today.

Another breakthrough was the 1954 publication of the results of a British Doctors Study, led by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill, which lent very strong statistical support to the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer.

In the late 20th century, with the advancement of biomedical sciences, a number of molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease. Epidemiology research to examine the relationship between these biomarkers analyzed at the molecular level and disease was broadly named &quot;molecular epidemiology&quot;. Specifically, &quot;genetic epidemiology&quot; has been used for epidemiology of germline genetic variation and disease. Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes.

=== 21st century ===
Since the 2000s, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.

While most molecular epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease diagnosis and classification systems, it is increasingly recognized that disease progression represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual (&quot;the unique disease principle&quot;), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges, including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, &quot;molecular pathology&quot; and &quot;epidemiology&quot; was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of &quot;molecular pathological epidemiology&quot; (MPE), defined as &quot;epidemiology of molecular pathology and heterogeneity of disease&quot;. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.

By 2012, it was recognized that many pathogens&#x27; evolution is rapid enough to be highly relevant to epidemiology, and that therefore much could be gained from an interdisciplinary approach to infectious disease integrating epidemiology and molecular evolution to &quot;inform control strategies, or even patient treatment.&quot; Modern epidemiological studies can use advanced statistics and machine learning to create predictive models as well as to define treatment effects. There is increasing recognition that a wide range of modern data sources, many not originating from healthcare or epidemiology, can be used for epidemiological study. Such digital epidemiology can include data from internet searching, mobile phone records and retail sales of drugs.

== Types of studies ==
Epidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive (involving the assessment of data covering time, place, and person), analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). In observational studies, nature is allowed to &quot;take its course&quot;, as epidemiologists observe from the sidelines. Conversely, in experimental studies, the epidemiologist is the one in control of all of the factors entering a certain case study. Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between exposures such as alcohol or smoking, biological agents, stress, or chemicals to mortality or morbidity. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology. Modern epidemiologists use informatics and infodemiology as tools.

Observational studies have two components, descriptive and analytical. Descriptive observations pertain to the &quot;who, what, where and when of health-related state occurrence&quot;. However, analytical observations deal more with the &#x27;how&#x27; of a health-related event. Experimental epidemiology contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for a new medicine or drug testing), field trials (conducted on those at a high risk of contracting a disease), and community trials (research on social originating diseases).

The term &#x27;epidemiologic triad&#x27; is used to describe the intersection of &quot;Host&quot;, &quot;Agent&quot;, and &quot;Environment&quot; in analyzing an outbreak.

=== Case series ===
Case-series may refer to the qualitative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.

The former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient&#x27;s history, may lead to a formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case-control studies or prospective studies. A case-control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease&#x27;s natural history.

The latter type, more formally described as self-controlled case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects Poisson regression processes to compare the incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively used in the study of adverse reactions to vaccination and has been shown in some circumstances to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.

=== Case-control studies ===
Case-control studies select subjects based on their disease status. It is a retrospective study. A group of individuals that are disease positive (the &quot;case&quot; group) is compared with a group of disease negative individuals (the &quot;control&quot; group). The control group should ideally come from the same population that gave rise to the cases. The case-control study looks back through time at potential exposures that both groups (cases and controls) may have encountered. A 2×2 table is constructed, displaying exposed cases (A), exposed controls (B), unexposed cases (C) and unexposed controls (D). The statistic generated to measure association is the odds ratio (OR), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases (A/C) to the odds of exposure in the controls (B/D), i.e. OR = (AD/BC).

If the OR is significantly greater than 1, then the conclusion is &quot;those with the disease are more likely to have been exposed&quot;, whereas if it is close to 1 then the exposure and disease are not likely associated. If the OR is far less than one, then this suggests that the exposure is a protective factor in the causation of the disease.
Case-control studies are usually faster and more cost-effective than cohort studies but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should be representative of the distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.

A major drawback for case control studies is that, in order to be considered to be statistically significant, the minimum number of cases required at the 95% confidence interval is related to the odds ratio by the equation:

:formula_1

where N is the ratio of cases to controls.
As the odds ratio approaches 1, the number of cases required for statistical significance grows towards infinity; rendering case-control studies all but useless for low odds ratios. For instance, for an odds ratio of 1.5 and cases = controls, the table shown above would look like this:

For an odds ratio of 1.1:

=== Cohort studies ===
Cohort studies select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, &quot;P&quot;e = &quot;A&quot; / (&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, &quot;P&quot;&quot;u&quot; = &quot;C&quot; / (&quot;C&quot; + &quot;D&quot;), i.e. &quot;RR&quot; = &quot;P&quot;e / &quot;P&quot;u.

As with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read &quot;those with the exposure were more likely to develop the disease.&quot;

Prospective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.

Cohort studies also are limited by the same equation for number of cases as for cohort studies, but, if the base incidence rate in the study population is very low, the number of cases required is reduced by .

== Causal inference ==

Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering &quot;causal&quot; relationships.

&quot;Correlation does not imply causation&quot; is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term inference. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for the inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.

Epidemiologists emphasize that the &quot;one cause – one effect&quot; understanding is a simplistic mis-belief. Most outcomes, whether disease or death, are caused by a chain or web consisting of many component causes. Causes can be distinguished as necessary, sufficient or probabilistic conditions. If a necessary condition can be identified and controlled (e.g., antibodies to a disease agent, energy in an injury), the harmful outcome can be avoided (Robertson, 2015). One tool regularly used to conceptualize the multicausality associated with disease is the causal pie model.

=== Bradford Hill criteria ===

In 1965, Austin Bradford Hill proposed a series of considerations to help assess evidence of causation, which have come to be commonly known as the &quot;Bradford Hill criteria&quot;. In contrast to the explicit intentions of their author, Hill&#x27;s considerations are now sometimes taught as a checklist to be implemented for assessing causality. Hill himself said &quot;None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required &quot;sine qua non&quot;.&quot;

# Strength of Association: A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.
# Consistency of Data: Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.
# Specificity: Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.
# Temporality: The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).
# Biological gradient: Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.
# Plausibility: A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).
# Coherence: Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that &quot;... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations&quot;.
# Experiment: &quot;Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence&quot;.
# Analogy: The effect of similar factors may be considered.

=== Legal interpretation ===
Epidemiological studies can only go to prove that an agent could have caused, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case:

In United States law, epidemiology alone cannot prove that a causal association does not exist in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a causal association does exist, based upon a balance of probability.

The subdiscipline of forensic epidemiology is directed at the investigation of specific causation of disease or injury in individuals or groups of individuals in instances in which causation is disputed or is unclear, for presentation in legal settings.

== Population-based health management ==
Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.

Population-based health management encompasses the ability to:
* Assess the health states and health needs of a target population;
* Implement and evaluate interventions that are designed to improve the health of that population; and
* Efficiently and effectively provide care for members of that population in a way that is consistent with the community&#x27;s cultural, policy and health resource values.

Modern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical, etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward-looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.

Examples of organizations that use population-based health management that leverage the work and results of epidemiological practice include Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control, Health Canada Tobacco Control Programs, Rick Hansen Foundation, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative.

Each of these organizations uses a population-based health management framework called Life at Risk that combines epidemiological quantitative analysis with demographics, health agency operational research and economics to perform:
* &quot;Population Life Impacts Simulations&quot;: Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the population with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death as well as potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* &quot;Labour Force Life Impacts Simulations&quot;: Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the labour force with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death and potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* &quot;Economic Impacts of Disease Simulations&quot;: Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon private sector disposable income impacts (wages, corporate profits, private health care costs) and public sector disposable income impacts (personal income tax, corporate income tax, consumption taxes, publicly funded health care costs).

== Applied field epidemiology ==

Applied epidemiology is the practice of using epidemiological methods to protect or improve the health of a population. Applied field epidemiology can include investigating communicable and non-communicable disease outbreaks, mortality and morbidity rates, and nutritional status, among other indicators of health, with the purpose of communicating the results to those who can implement appropriate policies or disease control measures.

=== Humanitarian context ===

As the surveillance and reporting of diseases and other health factors become increasingly difficult in humanitarian crisis situations, the methodologies used to report the data are compromised. One study found that less than half (42.4%) of nutrition surveys sampled from humanitarian contexts correctly calculated the prevalence of malnutrition and only one-third (35.3%) of the surveys met the criteria for quality. Among the mortality surveys, only 3.2% met the criteria for quality. As nutritional status and mortality rates help indicate the severity of a crisis, the tracking and reporting of these health factors is crucial.

Vital registries are usually the most effective ways to collect data, but in humanitarian contexts these registries can be non-existent, unreliable, or inaccessible. As such, mortality is often inaccurately measured using either prospective demographic surveillance or retrospective mortality surveys. Prospective demographic surveillance requires much manpower and is difficult to implement in a spread-out population. Retrospective mortality surveys are prone to selection and reporting biases. Other methods are being developed, but are not common practice yet.

== Characterization, validity, and bias ==
===Epidemic wave===
The concept of waves in epidemics has implications especially for communicable diseases. A working definition for the term &quot;epidemic wave&quot; is based on two key features: 1) it comprises periods of upward or downward trends, and 2) these increases or decreases must be substantial and sustained over a period of time, in order to distinguish them from minor fluctuations or reporting errors. The use of a consistent scientific definition is to provide a consistent language that can be used to communicate about and understand the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, which would aid healthcare organizations and policymakers in resource planning and allocation.

===Validities===
Different fields in epidemiology have different levels of validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). In genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies may produce over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology, as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast, other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.

=== Random error ===
Random error is the result of fluctuations around a true value because of sampling variability. Random error is just that: random. It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis. Examples of random errors include poorly worded questions, a misunderstanding in interpreting an individual answer from a particular respondent, or a typographical error during coding. Random error affects measurement in a transient, inconsistent manner and it is impossible to correct for random error. There is a random error in all sampling procedures sampling error.

Precision in epidemiological variables is a measure of random error. Precision is also inversely related to random error, so that to reduce random error is to increase precision. Confidence intervals are computed to demonstrate the precision of relative risk estimates. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the relative risk estimate.

There are two basic ways to reduce random error in an epidemiological study. The first is to increase the sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise measuring device or by increasing the number of measurements.

Note, that if sample size or number of measurements are increased, or a more precise measuring tool is purchased, the costs of the study are usually increased. There is usually an uneasy balance between the need for adequate precision and the practical issue of study cost.

=== Systematic error ===
A systematic error or bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of systematic error is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).

A mistake in coding that affects &quot;all&quot; responses for that particular question is another example of a systematic error.

The validity of a study is dependent on the degree of systematic error. Validity is usually separated into two components:
* Internal validity is dependent on the amount of error in measurements, including exposure, disease, and the associations between these variables. Good internal validity implies a lack of error in measurement and suggests that inferences may be drawn at least as they pertain to the subjects under study.
* External validity pertains to the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.

==== Selection bias ====
Selection bias occurs when study subjects are selected or become part of the study as a result of a third, unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest. For instance, it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates. (Sackett D cites the example of Seltzer et al., in which 85% of non smokers and 67% of smokers returned mailed questionnaires.) Such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups.

==== Information bias ====
Information bias is bias arising from systematic error in the assessment of a variable. An example of this is recall bias. A typical example is again provided by Sackett in his discussion of a study examining the effect of specific exposures on fetal health: &quot;in questioning mothers whose recent pregnancies had ended in fetal death or malformation (cases) and a matched group of mothers whose pregnancies ended normally (controls) it was found that 28% of the former, but only 20% of the latter, reported exposure to drugs which could not be substantiated either in earlier prospective interviews or in other health records&quot;. In this example, recall bias probably occurred as a result of women who had had miscarriages having an apparent tendency to better recall and therefore report previous exposures.

==== Design-related bias ====
Next to sample- and variable-related bias, bias can also arise from an imperfect study design. One example is immortal time bias, where during study period, there is some interval during which the outcome event cannot occur (making these individual &quot;immortal&quot;).

==== Confounding ====
Confounding has traditionally been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest. A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of &quot;counterfactual&quot; effects. According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure &quot;X&quot; = 1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be &quot;R&quot;A1. The counterfactual or unobserved risk &quot;R&quot;A0 corresponds to the risk which would have been observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. &quot;X&quot; = 0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: &quot;R&quot;A1 − &quot;R&quot;A0 (if one is interested in risk differences) or &quot;R&quot;A1/&quot;R&quot;A0 (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk &quot;R&quot;A0 is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: &quot;R&quot;A1 − &quot;R&quot;B0 or &quot;R&quot;A1/&quot;R&quot;B0. In this situation, confounding occurs when &quot;R&quot;A0 ≠ &quot;R&quot;B0. (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.)

Some epidemiologists prefer to think of confounding separately from common categorizations of bias since, unlike selection and information bias, confounding stems from real causal effects.

== The profession ==
Few universities have offered epidemiology as a course of study at the undergraduate level. An undergraduate program exists at Johns Hopkins University in which students who major in public health can take graduate-level courses—including epidemiology—during their senior year at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. In addition to its master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in epidemiology, the University of Michigan School of Public Health has offered undergraduate degree programs since 2017 that include coursework in epidemiology. 

Although epidemiologic research is conducted by individuals from diverse disciplines, variable levels of training in epidemiologic methods are provided during pharmacy, medical, veterinary, social work, podiatry, nursing, physical therapy, and clinical psychology doctoral programs in addition to the formal training master&#x27;s and doctoral students in public health fields receive. 

As public health practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work &quot;in the field&quot; (i.e., in the community; commonly in a public health service), and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals, or larger government entities (e.g., state and local health departments in the United States), ministries of health, Doctors without Borders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Protection Agency, the World Health Organization (WHO), or the Public Health Agency of Canada. Epidemiologists can also work in for-profit organizations (e.g., pharmaceutical and medical device companies) in groups such as market research or clinical development.

===COVID-19===
An April 2020 University of Southern California article noted that, &quot;The coronavirus epidemic... thrust epidemiology – the study of the incidence, distribution and control of disease in a population – to the forefront of scientific disciplines across the globe and even made temporary celebrities out of some of its practitioners.&quot;

<doc id="67000" wikidata="Q457185" url="?curid=67000" title="Stephen R. Donaldson">
<text>Stephen Reeder Donaldson (born May 13, 1947) is an American fantasy, science fiction and mystery novelist, most famous for &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;, his ten-novel fantasy series. His work is characterized by psychological complexity, conceptual abstractness, moral bleakness, and the use of an arcane vocabulary, and has attracted critical praise for its &quot;imagination, vivid characterizations, and fast pace&quot;. Donaldson earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from The College of Wooster and a master&#x27;s degree from Kent State University. He currently resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

==Personal life==
Donaldson spent part of his youth in India, where his father, a medical missionary, worked with lepers. Donaldson attended what is now the Kodaikanal International School. He was attending Kent State University as a graduate student at the time of the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970. Though he was not on campus at the time of the shootings, his apartment was one and a half blocks away, and he was forced to live under martial law for three days afterwards. Donaldson does not like to discuss the incident, as he finds the memories disturbing.

Donaldson is a fan of opera, and has said that he &quot;love[s] that direct expression of passionate emotion in beautiful sound&quot;. In 1994, he gained a black belt in Shotokan karate.

==Major influences==
Donaldson is part of the generation of fantasy authors which came to prominence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like that of many of his peers, his writing is heavily influenced by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. However, Donaldson&#x27;s stories show a wide range of other influences, including Mervyn Peake, C. S. Lewis, Robert E. Howard, and the operas of Richard Wagner. Donaldson is also a great fan of Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Amber&quot; novels, which were a direct inspiration for his own &quot;Mordant&#x27;s Need&quot; series. Also, in the &quot;Gradual Interview&quot; section of his website, Donaldson mentions his extensive study of Joseph Conrad, Henry James and William Faulkner to further develop his narrative style.

==Ideas==
In &quot;Creative Cognition, Conceptual Combination, and the Creative Writing of Stephen R. Donaldson,&quot; Thomas Ward quotes Donaldson&#x27;s note in &quot;The Gap into Conflict: The Real Story&quot;: &quot;... a fair number of my best stories arise, not from one idea, but from two.&quot; Donaldson has said, &quot;two inert elements combine to produce something of frightening potency.&quot; For the Thomas Covenant books, when he put unbelief and leprosy together, &quot;... my brain took fire.&quot;

==&quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;==
Donaldson&#x27;s most celebrated series is &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;, which centers on a cynical leper, shunned by society, who is destined to become the heroic savior of another world. Covenant struggles against the tyrannical Lord Foul, who intends to break the physical universe in order to escape his bondage and wreak revenge upon his arch enemy, The Creator.

The &quot;Chronicles&quot; were originally published as two trilogies of novels between 1977 and 1983. According to his current publisher, Putnam&#x27;s, those two series sold more than 10 million copies. A third series, &quot;The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;, began publication in 2004 with the novel &quot;The Runes of the Earth&quot;. With the second book of that series, &quot;Fatal Revenant&quot;, Donaldson again attained bestseller status when the book reached number 12 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List in October 2007.

===The First Chronicles===
# &quot;Lord Foul&#x27;s Bane&quot; (1977)
# &quot;The Illearth War&quot; (1977)
# &quot;The Power That Preserves&quot; (1979)

===The Second Chronicles===
# &quot;The Wounded Land&quot; (1980)
# &quot;The One Tree&quot; (1982)
# &quot;White Gold Wielder&quot; (1983)

===The Last Chronicles===
# &quot;The Runes of the Earth&quot; (2004)
# &quot;Fatal Revenant&quot; (2007)
# &quot;Against All Things Ending&quot; (2010)
# &quot;The Last Dark&quot; (2013)

==The Gap Cycle==
A science fiction epic set in a future where humans have pushed far out into space in the attempt to replace depleted resources, &quot;The Gap Cycle&quot; follows two concurrent story arcs. The first concerns an ensign in the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), Morn Hyland, who is attempting simply to stay alive after being captured by a marauder named Angus Thermopyle. The second follows the Byzantine political maneuvering of the head of the UMCP, Warden Dios, as he attempts to thwart the machinations of his boss, Holt Fasner, who is the CEO of United Mining Companies (UMC) and the most powerful man in human space.

Each of the epics takes place against the backdrop of a threat to human survival itself from an alien species called the Amnion who use genetic mutation as a way to assimilate and overcome. Trade in raw materials (mostly ores) is carried out with the Amnion in exchange for technology, by both the UMC and illegals. Some illegals trade in Amnion territorial space, referred to as &quot;forbidden space&quot;, out of bounds to the UMCP by treaty.

Donaldson wrote the series in part to be a reworking of Wagner&#x27;s Ring Cycle. The &quot;Gap&quot; of the title refers to the faster-than-light drives used by the space vessels in order to cross great distances, an instantaneous occurrence similar to the notion of &quot;folding&quot; space.

===The Gap series===
# &quot;The Gap into Conflict: The Real Story&quot; (1991)
# &quot;The Gap into Vision: Forbidden Knowledge&quot; (1991)
# &quot;The Gap into Power: A Dark and Hungry God Arises&quot; (1992)
# &quot;The Gap into Madness: Chaos and Order&quot; (1994)
# &quot;The Gap into Ruin: This Day All Gods Die&quot; (1996)

The 2008 reprinting of the series combines &quot;The Real Story&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Knowledge&quot; into a single volume. According to Donaldson&#x27;s website, this was done at his request.

==Other works==

===Early work===
Donaldson has stated that, when he was younger, he wrote two fan-fiction novellas: one based on Marvel Comics&#x27; Thor, and the other based on Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. These have never been published. As Donaldson grew older, he discovered that the sensation that he was &quot;making it all up&quot; himself was necessary for his imagination to work well. He now regards these early novellas as failed experiments in the process of discovering himself as a writer. He feels the same way about a play he wrote, whose performance at Kent State University convinced him that he was &quot;not cut out to be a playwright&quot;.

===&quot;Mordant&#x27;s Need&quot;===

# &quot;The Mirror of Her Dreams&quot; (1986)
# &quot;A Man Rides Through&quot; (1987)

===&quot;The Man Who&quot;===
&quot;The Man Who&quot; is a series of mystery novels written by Donaldson and published under the pseudonym Reed Stephens, derived from his full name, &quot;Stephen Reeder Donaldson&quot;. The books focus on the partnership of private detectives Mick Axbrewder and Ginny Fistoulari. Donaldson &quot;always hated&quot; writing under a false name, but was forced to do so by his publisher, Ballantine Books, who had a firm belief in &quot;category publishing&quot; and thought that readers would feel betrayed if books of such different genres were published under the name of a single author. However, the books sold poorly even when they were re-printed under Donaldson&#x27;s name by Tor/Forge Books.

* &quot;The Man Who Killed His Brother&quot; (1980)
* &quot;The Man Who Risked His Partner&quot; (1984)

* &quot;The Man Who Fought Alone&quot; (2001)

Donaldson has indicated that he intends to write at least one more &quot;The Man Who&quot; novel after completion of &quot;The Last Chronicles&quot;.

===&quot;The Great God&#x27;s War&quot;===
The &quot;Seventh Decimate&quot;, the first book in &quot;The Great God&#x27;s War&quot; trilogy, features fantasy kingdoms Amika and Belleger, who fight &quot;against each other in a sorcery-saturated battle of mutual destruction, with a charismatic prince searching for a legendary conjuror&#x27;s library.&quot;

<doc id="67003" wikidata="Q623394" url="?curid=67003" title="Carrie (novel)">
<text>Carrie is a 1974 horror novel, the first by American author Stephen King. Set in the town of Chamberlain, Maine, the plot revolves around Carrie White, a friendless, bullied high school girl from an abusive religious household who discovers she has telekinetic powers. After a revenge prank pulled by one of her bullies on prom night humiliates Carrie, she decides to destroy the town with her powers out of revenge. An epistolary novel, &quot;Carrie&quot; deals with themes of ostracization and revenge, with the opening shower scene and the destruction of Chamberlain being pivotal scenes.

King wrote &quot;Carrie&quot; with the intention of submitting it to be published originally as a short story for the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Cavalier&quot; following the suggestion of a friend that he write a story about a female character. Though King initially gave up on &quot;Carrie&quot; due to discomfort and apathy, and felt it would never be successful, his wife Tabitha convinced him to continue writing, and rescued the first three pages of the story from the trash. He followed her advice and expanded it into a novel. King based the character of Carrie on two girls he knew in high school and enjoyed fabricating the documents for the narrative. After Doubleday accepted &quot;Carrie&quot; to be published, King worked with editor Bill Thompson to revise the novel.

&quot;Carrie&quot; was published on April 5, 1974, with a print run of 30,000 copies, and a paperback edition was published by New American Library in April 1975. The paperback edition became a best seller, particularly after the release of the 1976 film adaptation, reaching four million sales. The novel received generally positive reviews, both contemporaneously and retrospectively. &quot;Carrie&quot;, King&#x27;s debut novel, helped launch his career and achieve him mainstream success. It has also been credited with reviving mainstream interest in horror fiction and being influential among contemporary horror writers. Three film adaptations have been released, with one getting a sequel, and a musical adaptation was released in 1988.

==Plot==
In 1979, Carietta &quot;Carrie&quot; White, a 16-year-old girl in Chamberlain, Maine, is ridiculed for her weight, frumpy appearance and unusual religious beliefs instilled by her despotic mother Margaret. One day, Carrie has her first period while showering in the girls&#x27; locker room after physical education class. Carrie is terrified, having no understanding of menstruation as her mother, who finds sexuality sinful, never taught her. While Carrie panics, her classmates, led by a wealthy, popular girl named Chris Hargensen, mock her and throw tampons and sanitary napkins. The gym teacher, Rita Desjardin, has Carrie compose herself and sends her home. On the way, Carrie practices her unusual ability to control objects from a distance. She recalls using this power when she was three to cause stones to fall from the sky. Once Carrie gets home, Margaret furiously accuses Carrie of sin and locks her in a closet.

The next day, Desjardin reprimands the girls who bullied Carrie and gives them a week&#x27;s detention; Chris refuses to comply and is punished with suspension and exclusion from the prom. After her influential father fails to reinstate her, Chris decides to take revenge on Carrie. Sue Snell, another popular girl who bullied Carrie in the locker room, grows remorseful, and asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to invite Carrie to the prom instead. Carrie is suspicious but accepts and begins sewing a prom dress. Meanwhile, Chris persuades her boyfriend Billy Nolan and his gang of greasers to gather two buckets of pig blood as she prepares to rig the prom queen election in Carrie&#x27;s favor.

The prom initially goes well for Carrie: Tommy&#x27;s friends are welcoming, and Tommy finds he is attracted to Carrie. Chris successfully rigs the election, and Carrie and Tommy are elected prom queen and king. However, at the moment of the coronation, Chris, from outside, dumps the pig blood onto Carrie&#x27;s and Tommy&#x27;s heads. Tommy is hit by one of the buckets and dies. The sight of Carrie drenched in blood evokes laughter from the audience. Carrie leaves the building, humiliated.

Outside, Carrie remembers her telekinesis and decides to enact vengeance on her tormentors. Using her powers, she seals the gym, and activates the sprinkler system, inadvertently electrocuting many of her classmates, and causing a fire that eventually ignites the school&#x27;s fuel tanks, destroying the building in a massive explosion. Only a few staff and students, including Desjardin, narrowly escape. Carrie, overwhelmed by rage, thwarts any incoming effort to fight the fire by opening the hydrants within the school&#x27;s vicinity, then destroys gas stations and cuts power lines on her way home. She unleashes her telekinetic powers on the entire town, destroying several buildings and killing hundreds of people. As she does this, she broadcasts a telepathic message, showing the townspeople that the mayhem was caused by her.

Carrie returns home to confront Margaret, who believes Carrie has been possessed by Satan and must be killed. Margaret tells her that her conception was a result of what may have been marital rape. She stabs Carrie in the shoulder with a kitchen knife, and Carrie stops Margaret&#x27;s heart as Margaret begins praying. Mortally wounded, Carrie makes her way to the roadhouse where she was conceived. She sees Chris and Billy leaving, having been informed of the town&#x27;s destruction by one of Billy&#x27;s friends. After Billy attempts to run over Carrie, she takes control of his car and sends it into a wall, killing both him and Chris.

Sue, who has been following Carrie&#x27;s &quot;broadcast&quot;, finds her collapsed in the parking lot, bleeding from the knife wound. The two have a brief telepathic conversation. Carrie had believed that Sue and Tommy had set up the prank but then realized they were innocent. Carrie dies, crying out for her mother. A state of emergency is declared and the survivors make plans to relocate. Chamberlain foresees desolation in spite of the government assisting on rehabilitating the worker districts. Desjardin and the school&#x27;s principal blame themselves for the disaster and resign from teaching. Sue publishes a memoir based on her experiences. A &quot;White Committee&quot; report investigating paranormal abilities concludes that there will be others like Carrie.

As the novel ends, an Appalachian woman enthusiastically writes a letter to her sister about her baby daughter&#x27;s telekinetic powers and reminisces about their grandmother, who had similar abilities.

==Style and themes==
&quot;Carrie&quot; is a horror novel as well as an example of supernatural and gothic fiction. It is in part an epistolary novel: the narrative is organized around a framing device consisting of multiple narrators, and a collection of reports and excerpts in approximate chronological order. Leigh A. Ehlers, a literary scholar, has argued that this structure is used to indicate that no particular viewpoint, scientific or otherwise, can explain Carrie and the prom night event.

&quot;Carrie&quot; deals with themes of ostracism, centering around Carrie being ostracized for not conforming to societal norms. A driving force of the novel is her first period in the shower leading to her being pelted with tampons and further scorned. Sue is one of the few people to feel genuine remorse for Carrie and arranges a date with Sue&#x27;s boyfriend, Tommy, for the Spring Ball. However, Chris&#x27;s need for vengeance against Carrie results in pig blood being dumped on Carrie during the Spring Ball. This results in Carrie committing a massacre among the school and Chamberlain. Following the massacre, Sue is subject to the same exclusion as Carrie, despite her altruistic motives. John Kerrigan, a literary scholar, and Victoria Madden have observed that throughout the novel, Carrie is often associated with pigs, which are considered &quot;disgusting&quot; animals.

Another theme found in the novel is vengeance. Throughout the novel, Carrie is forced through various hardships that she manages to endure for years without using her supernatural powers. However, after being invited to a prom only to have pig blood dumped on her, Carrie &quot;breaks&quot; and annihilates the city. Kerrigan considers &quot;Carrie&quot; to be an example of a revenge tragedy. Ray B. Browne argues that the novel serves as a &quot;revenge fantasy&quot;, while novelist Charles L. Grant has stated that &quot;[Stephen] King uses the evil/victim device for terror&quot;. Some scholars have argued that &quot;Carrie&quot; is a social commentary. Linda J. Holland-Toll has stated that &quot;&quot;Carrie&quot; is about disaffirmation because society makes the human monster, cannot control the monster, yet still denies the possibility of actual monster existence while simultaneously defining humans as monsters&quot;.

==Background and writing==

By the time of writing &quot;Carrie&quot;, King lived in a trailer in Hermon, Maine with his wife Tabitha and two children. He had a job teaching English at Hampden Academy, and wrote short stories for men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Cavalier&quot;. &quot;Carrie&quot; was originally a short story intended for &quot;Cavalier&quot;, and King started conceptualizing the story after a friend suggested writing a story about a female character.

The basis of the story was King imagining a scene of a girl menstruating for the first time in the shower similar to the opening scene of &quot;Carrie&quot; and an article from &quot;Life&quot; about telekinesis. As he wrote the opening shower scene, King experienced discomfort due to not being female and not knowing how he would react to the scene if he were female. He also felt apathy toward Carrie when writing the scene. After three pages, King eventually threw away the manuscript of the story. The next day, Tabitha retrieved the pages from the trash and convinced King to continue writing the story with input from her. King was ultimately able to emotionally connect to Carrie through the influence of two girls he knew. One was constantly abused at school due to her family&#x27;s poverty forcing her to wear only one outfit to school. The other was a timid girl from a devoutly religious family.

King believed &quot;Carrie&quot; would not be successful, thinking it would not be marketable in any genre or to any audience. He also found writing it to be a &quot;waste of time&quot; and found no point in sending out what he perceived as a failed story. King only continued writing it in order to please his wife and because he was unable to think of anything else to write. When King finished the first draft, &quot;Carrie&quot; was a 98-page-long novella that he detested. In December 1972, King decided to rewrite &quot;Carrie&quot; and strive for it to become novel-length. He wrote in fabricated documents that were purported to be from periodicals such as &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, imitating their style accordingly; a process that King found entertaining. After &quot;Carrie&quot; was accepted by the publisher Doubleday, King revised the novel with editor and friend Bill Thompson. The original ending of &quot;Carrie&quot; had Carrie growing demon horns and destroying an airplane thousands of miles above her. Thompson convinced King to rewrite the ending to be more subtle.

==Publication==

King&#x27;s manuscript for &quot;Carrie&quot; was given to Thompson in November 1973. Seeing potential in the novel in light of recent horror novels such as &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1967), Thompson convinced Lee Barker, executive editor of Doubleday, to accept the novel. In 1973, after much revision, advanced copies of &quot;Carrie&quot; were sent to salesmen to secure an advance. Eventually, the novel was approved for an advance of $1,500. Thompson convinced Doubleday to boost the advance to $2,500, moderately high for a debut novel at the time, and it was announced to King via telegram. With a print run of 30,000 copies, the hardback edition of &quot;Carrie&quot; was ultimately published on April 5, 1974. Although &quot;Carrie&quot; was marketed as an &quot;occult&quot; novel, trade reviewers called it a horror novel, unusual for the time.

On May 3, 1974, &quot;Carrie&quot; was received by the publishing company New English Library and was read overnight by president Bob Tanner. Tanner sent a copy to the parent company, New American Library, which then offered Doubleday $400,000 for rights to mass-market paperback publication of &quot;Carrie&quot;, of which King received $200,000. New English Library published &quot;Carrie&quot; in May 1974, and New American Library published &quot;Carrie&quot; under its Signet Books imprint in April 1975. With the goal of persuading the reader to buy the book, New American Library designed the novel to be &quot;double-covered&quot;. The original cover of the paperback edition did not feature the title or the author&#x27;s name; it consisted of the face of a girl in front of a silhouette. Behind the cover was a two-page picture of New England on fire, with the title and author&#x27;s name on the far right. New American Library planned for the girl&#x27;s silhouette to be scored to allow the reader to see the burning New England picture. The printers refused to produce the technique, and the edition was published without the scoring. Since initial publication, &quot;Carrie&quot; has remained in continual print and has been published throughout Europe. On March 26, 2024, a British publishing company Hodder &amp; Stoughton published the 50th anniversary edition of &quot;Carrie&quot;, which included a new introduction by Margaret Atwood.

==Reception==
The hardback edition of &quot;Carrie&quot; sold modestly; it was not a best seller. Sources of the number of sales for the hardback edition vary, ranging from 13,000 copies to 17,000 copies. In contrast, the paperback edition sold exceedingly well. In its first year, the edition sold one million copies. The sales were bolstered by the 1976 film adaptation, totaling four million sales. &quot;Carrie&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller, debuting on the list in December 1976 and remaining on it for 14 weeks, peaking at number 3.

&quot;Carrie&quot; received generally positive reviews and has become a fan favorite. Several critics considered it an impressive literary debut. Harold C. Schonberg, writing as Newgate Callendar for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stated that despite being a debut novel, &quot;King writes with the kind of surety normally associated only with veteran writers&quot;. The &quot;Daily Times-Advocate&quot; Ina Bonds called &quot;Carrie&quot; an &quot;admirable achievement&quot; for a first novel, and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that &quot;King handles his first novel with considerable accomplishment and very little hokum&quot;. Bob Cormier from the &quot;Daily Sentinel &amp; Leominster Enterprise&quot; wrote that the novel could have failed because of the subject matter, but did not, and thus found King to be &quot;no ordinary writer&quot;.

Various critics wrote that the plot will scare readers, with &quot;Library Journal&quot; declaring the novel &quot;a terrifying treat for both horror and parapsychology fans&quot;. Mary Schedl of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote that &quot;Carrie&quot; &quot;goes far beyond the usual limitations of the [horror] genre&quot; to deliver a message about humanity. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the novel for its sympathetic portrayal of Carrie. Both Joy Antos of &quot;Progress Bulletin&quot; and Gary Bogart of &quot;Wilson Library Journal&quot; wrote of enjoying &quot;Carrie&quot; despite the foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, &quot;Booklist&quot; stated that reading the novel required a &quot;willing suspension of disbelief and taste&quot;.

Retrospectively, &quot;Carrie&quot; has received appraisal. Michael R. Collings and Adam Nevill declared that the plot holds up decades after publication. Collings attributed it to focus and conciseness, and Nevill attributed it to the characterization and structure. In his literary analysis, Rocky Wood called the plot &quot;remarkably short but compelling&quot;. Michael Berry of Common Sense Media lauded the characterization and said that the epistolary structure &quot;lend[s] a sense of realism to the outlandish proceedings&quot;. While both Grady Hendrix and James Smythe similarly praised the story, Hendrix felt that the writing was awkward much of the time, and Smythe found the epistolary-style extracts to be the &quot;worst [and slowest] parts of the novel&quot;. Although Harold Bloom found the characterization and style to be unremarkable, he thought the novel had strong imagery and said that &quot;Carrie at the prom scene... is a marvelous culmination of melodrama.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Carrie&quot; launched King&#x27;s career as an author; the $200,000 King received when &quot;Carrie&quot; was accepted for mass-market publication allowed King to quit his job as a teacher and become a full-time author. The novel established King as a horror writer who wrote about &quot;the supernatural, the dark, and the bizarre&quot;. Following &quot;Carrie&quot; publication, King underwent a six-month period of prolific writing. During this period, King wrote rough drafts for &quot;Blaze&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, the latter of which became his second published novel, being published in 1975. Both &quot;Carrie&quot; and its 1976 film adaptation brought King into the mainstream, and he has since become one of the most successful authors in the modern era, with his novels consistently becoming best sellers.

For decades prior to the 1970s, horror literature had not been in the mainstream; the last novel to reach the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; best-seller list was &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1938). &quot;Carrie&quot; is credited as one of four novels to create a contemporary mainstream interest in horror literature. This interest was especially bolstered by their respective adaptations, allowing these novels to become best sellers. &quot;Carrie&quot; has been influential among contemporary writers, with writers such as Sarah Pinborough, James Smythe, and Sarah Lotz claiming to be influenced by &quot;Carrie&quot;. Joanne Harris refers to her 2023 novel, &quot;Broken Light&quot;, as &quot;an homage to &quot;Carrie&quot;&quot;. The prom scene when Carrie is covered in pig blood has been referenced in pop culture, with examples including &quot;Monsters University&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot; comics, and horror media such as &quot;It Follows&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot;. Author Jeff VanderMeer said of &quot;Carrie&quot; influence:

&quot;Carrie&quot; has received three film adaptations and a musical adaptation. The first, directed by Brian De Palma and starring Sissy Spacek in the title role, was released on November 3, 1976, to critical acclaim and commercial success, and is considered a noteworthy example of 1970s horror films and a major factor to King&#x27;s success. A sequel to the 1976 film adaptation titled &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot; was released in 1999 to mixed reviews. From May 12 to 15, 1988, a musical adaptation was performed five times by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Virginia Theater before closing. It was a commercial and critical failure, losing more than $7 million, among the most expensive failures by Broadway theatre. A 2002 film adaptation received negative reviews, and a 2013 film adaptation received mixed reviews. An off-Broadway revival of the musical was performed from March 1 to April 8, 2012. The television series &quot;Riverdale&quot; aired an episode titled &quot;Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember&quot; in 2018 based on the musical. In 2024, Mike Flanagan was announced to be helming a television adaptation of the novel with Amazon MGM Studios.

<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional legendarium, Beleriand () was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;: It tells the story of the early Ages of Middle-earth, in a style similar to that of the epics of Nordic literature—stories pervaded by a tone of impending doom. Beleriand also appears in the works &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;, and &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;.

In Tolkien&#x27;s early writing, he coined many prospective names for the region. Among them were &quot;Broceliand&quot;, the name of an enchanted forest in medieval romance, and &quot;Ingolondë&quot;—a play on the name &quot;England&quot;—when he hoped to root a mythology for England in the region. The scholar Gergely Nagy looked at the prose of the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; and found what may be evidence of the structure and syntax of Beleriand&#x27;s poetry.

== Fictional history ==

Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in the second half of the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;, which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Norse mythology. Beleriand also appears in the works &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;, and in the epic poems of &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;.

The land is occupied by Teleri Elves of King Thingol from the east, who founded the city of in the forest realm of Doriath. Other Elves, the Vanyar and Noldor, cross the Belegaer sea to Valinor. Some of the Noldor return to Beleriand to retrieve the Silmarils from the evil Vala Morgoth, but they are resented by the Teleri. Later, Men arrive from the east. Morgoth gathers an army of Orcs, Balrogs and other monsters in his fortress of beneath the mountains in the north of Beleriand, and attacks the Elves repeatedly. Despite the threat, Thingol refuses to fight alongside the Noldor. One by one, the realm of Doriath as well as the Noldor kingdoms Nargothrond and Gondolin fall to assaults, assisted by betrayals and disputes among Elves, Men, and Dwarves. Finally, Earendil crosses the Belegaer Sea to ask the Valar to stop Morgoth. They send an army to overcome Morgoth in the War of Wrath. This ends the First Age of Middle-earth: Angband is destroyed, and Morgoth is banished to the void. Beleriand&#x27;s inhabitants flee, and much of Beleriand sinks into the sea. Only a small section of the eastern edge of Beleriand survives, including part of the Ered Luin (Blue Mountain) range and the land of Lindon, which became part of the far northwestern shore of Middle-earth.

== Fictional geography ==

Beleriand is a region in the far northwest of Middle-earth, bordering the great sea, Belegaer. It is bounded to the north by the Ered Engrin, the Iron Mountains, and to the east by the Ered Luin, the Blue Mountains.

== Analysis ==

=== Naming ===

Beleriand had many different names in Tolkien&#x27;s early writings, including Broceliand, the name of an enchanted forest in medieval romance, Golodhinand, Noldórinan (&quot;valley of the Noldor&quot;), Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, and Ossiriand (later used for the easternmost part of Beleriand).

One of Beleriand&#x27;s early names was Ingolondë, a play on &quot;England&quot;, part of Tolkien&#x27;s long-held but ultimately unsuccessful aim to create what Shippey calls &quot;a mighty patron for his country, a foundation-myth more far-reaching than Hengest and Horsa, one to which he could graft his own stories.&quot; Tolkien&#x27;s aim had been to root his mythology for England in the scraps of names and myths that had survived, and to situate it in a land in the northwest of the continent, by the sea.

=== A sense of doom ===

Shippey writes that the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; has a tightly-woven plot, each part leading ultimately to tragedy. There are three Hidden Elvish Kingdoms in Beleriand, founded by relatives, and they are each betrayed and destroyed. The Kingdoms are each penetrated by a mortal Man, again all related to each other; and the sense of doom, which Shippey glosses as &quot;future disaster&quot;, hangs heavy over all of the characters in the tale.

Shippey writes that the human race seen in Beleriand in the First Age did not &quot;originate &#x27;on stage&#x27; in Beleriand, but drifts into it, already sundered in speech, from the East [the main part of Middle-earth]. There something terrible has happened to them of which they will not speak: &#x27;A darkness lies behind us... and we have turned our backs upon it&#x27;&quot;. He comments that the reader is free to assume that the Satanic Morgoth has carried out the Biblical serpent&#x27;s temptation of Adam and Eve, and that &quot;the incoming Edain and Easterlings are all descendants of Adam flying from Eden and subject to the curse of Babel.&quot;

=== &quot;Lost&quot; poetry ===

The Tolkien scholar Gergely Nagy, writing in 2004, notes that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; does not contain explicitly embedded samples of Beleriand&#x27;s poetry in its prose, as Tolkien had done with his many poems in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Instead, the prose of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; hints repeatedly at the structure and syntax of its &quot;lost&quot; poetry. Nagy notes David Bratman&#x27;s description of the book as containing prose styles that he classifies as &quot;the Annalistic, [the] Antique, and the Appendical&quot;. The implication of the range of styles is that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is meant to represent, in Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s words, &quot;a compilation, a compendious narrative, made long afterwards from sources of great diversity (poems, and annals, and oral tales)&quot;. Nagy infers from verse-like fragments of text in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; that the poetry of Beleriand used alliteration, rhyme, and rhythm including possibly iambics.

This applies to the Ainulindalë, Tolkien&#x27;s account of the godlike Ainur:

It applies, too, to the narrative of Elves and Men in the Beleriand landscape, in the &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;:

In a few places, it is possible to relate the adapted verse in the prose to actual verse in Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. This can be done, for instance, in parts of the story of Túrin. Here, he realizes he has just killed his friend Beleg:

== Synopsis ==

King John receives an ambassador from France who demands with a threat of war that he renounce his throne in favour of his nephew, Arthur, whom the French King Philip believes to be the rightful heir to the throne under primogeniture.

John adjudicates an inheritance dispute between Robert Faulconbridge and his older brother Philip, whom Robert accuses of illegitimacy. Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, the mother to King John, notes that that Philip looks very similar to her late son King Richard the Lionheart. Queen Eleanor accordingly suggests that Philip renounce his claim to the Faulconbridge estates in exchange for a non-inheriting position within the House of Plantagenet and a knighthood. After mocking Robert Faulconbridge&#x27;s ugliness at length, Philip enthusiastically agrees and Queen Eleanor praises Philip as possessing &quot;the very spirit of Plantagenet&quot;. King John knights Philip as Sir Richard the Plantagenet. Afterwards, learning Philip has renounced his inheritance, Lady Faulconbridge reluctantly confirms Queen Eleanor&#x27;s suspicions about her son&#x27;s secret parentage to him.
As part of his efforts to back regime change in the Angevin Empire, King Philip and his forces besiege the Angevin walled city of Angers, threatening to put them to the sack unless the citizens accept Prince Arthur as their King. Philip is supported by the Duke of Austria, who is alleged to have killed Richard the Lionheart. The English Army arrives. Queen Eleanor then trades insults with Constance, Arthur&#x27;s mother. Kings Philip and John argue their claims in front of Angers&#x27; citizens, but to no avail: their representative says that they will support the rightful king, whoever that turns out to be upon the battlefield.

The French and English armies clash, but no clear victor emerges. Each army dispatches a herald claiming victory, but Angers&#x27; citizens continue to refuse to recognize either claimant because neither army has proven victorious.

Philip the Bastard proposes that the armies of England and France unite against Angers. The citizens suggest an alternative proposal: that Philip&#x27;s son, Louis the Lion, marry John&#x27;s niece Blanche of Castile. The proposal would give John a stronger claim to the throne while Louis would gain territory for France. Though a furious Constance denounces King Philip for abandoning the claims of Prince Arthur, Louis and Blanche are married offstage.

Cardinal Pandolf arrives from Pope Innocent III bearing a formal accusation. As the latest salvo of the Investiture Controversy, King John is blocking the Pope&#x27;s chosen Archbishop, Stephen Langton, from the Diocese of Canterbury and has further imposed Caesaropapism upon the Catholic Church in England. John defies the Holy See and vows that &quot;No Italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions&quot;, whereupon the Cardinal declares him excommunicated and invokes the Papal deposing power to remove him as King. Pandolf demands that the French king renounce the new treaty, though Philip is hesitant, having just established familial ties to King John. Cardinal Pandolf points out that Philip&#x27;s links to the Vatican are older and firmer.

Battle breaks out; the Duke of Austria is slain and beheaded by the Bastard in revenge for his father&#x27;s death; and both Angers and Prince Arthur are captured by John&#x27;s army. Queen Eleanor is left in charge of the Angevin Empire in France, while the Bastard is sent to extort funds from English monasteries. John secretly orders Hubert to kill Arthur. Pandolf informs Louis that he now has as strong a claim to the English throne as Arthur or John, and Louis agrees to invade England.
Hubert is reluctant to blind and kill Prince Arthur and spares him in secret. The English nobility demand Arthur&#x27;s release. John agrees, but Hubert then tells him that Arthur is dead. The nobles, believing the Prince was murdered by his own uncle, defect to Louis&#x27; side. Equally upsetting, and more heartbreaking to John, is the news of his mother&#x27;s death, along with that of Lady Constance. The Bastard reports that the monasteries are unhappy about John&#x27;s attempt to steal their lands and gold. Hubert has a furious argument with John, during which he reveals that Arthur is still alive. John, delighted, sends him to report the news to the nobles.
Arthur dies after jumping from a castle wall during an escape attempt. The nobles find his body, believe he was murdered by John, and refuse to believe Hubert&#x27;s entreaties. A defeated John surrenders his crown to Pandolf, who reverses John&#x27;s excommunication and gives the crown back in return for the restored independence of the English Church from control by the State. John orders the Bastard, one of his few remaining loyal subjects, to lead the English army against the invading forces from France.

While the English nobility swears allegiance to Louis, Pandolf arrives and explains that John has renounced his claims of supreme authority over the English Church, but Prince Louis vows to continue his invasion anyway and seize the Crown of England for himself. Pandulf excommunicates the Prince and the Bastard arrives with an English army and also threatens Louis, but to no avail. The First Barons&#x27; War breaks out with substantial losses on each side, including Louis&#x27; reinforcements, who are shipwrecked and drowned during the sea crossing. Many English nobles return to John&#x27;s side after a dying French nobleman, Melun, warns them that Louis plans to kill them in a political purge after his victory.

John is poisoned offstage by a monk, whose loyalties and motivations are left unexplained. His nobles gather around him as he dies. The Bastard plans a second assault on Louis&#x27; forces, until he learns that Cardinal Pandolf has ended the invasion by forcing Louis to sign the Treaty of Lambeth. Starting with his cousin, Philip the Bastard, the English nobility all swear allegiance to John&#x27;s son Prince Henry, who decrees that his father shall be buried in Worcester, as he himself had wished. Before the curtain falls, Philip the Bastard reflects:
:&quot;O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
:Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
:This England never did and never shall,
:Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
:But when it first did help to wound itself. 
:Now these her princes are come home again,
:Come the three corners of the world in arms, 
:And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
:If England to itself do rest but true.&quot;

== Sources ==

&quot;King John&quot; is closely related to an anonymous history play, &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (c. 1589), the &quot;masterly construction&quot; the infelicitous expression of which led Peter Alexander to argue that Shakespeare&#x27;s was the earlier play. E. A. J. Honigmann elaborated these arguments, both in his preface to the second Arden edition of &quot;King John&quot;, and in his 1982 monograph on Shakespeare&#x27;s influence on his contemporaries. The majority view, however, first advanced in a rebuttal of Honigmann&#x27;s views by Kenneth Muir, holds that the &quot;Troublesome Reign&quot; antedates &quot;King John&quot; by a period of several years; and that the skilful plotting of the &quot;Troublesome Reign&quot; is neither unparalleled in the period, nor proof of Shakespeare&#x27;s involvement.

Shakespeare derived from &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; certain verbal collocations and points of action. Honigmann discerned in the play the influence of John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;, Matthew Paris&#x27; &quot;Historia Maior&quot;, and the Latin &quot;Wakefield Chronicle&quot;, but Muir demonstrated that this apparent influence could be explained by the priority of the &quot;Troublesome Reign&quot;, which contains similar or identical matter.

== Date and text ==

The date of composition is unknown, but must lie somewhere between 1587, the year of publication of the second, revised edition of &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, upon which Shakespeare drew for this and other plays, and 1598, when &quot;King John&quot; was mentioned among Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in the &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; of Francis Meres. The editors of the Oxford Shakespeare conclude from the play&#x27;s incidence of rare vocabulary, use of colloquialisms in verse, pause patterns, and infrequent rhyming that the play was composed in 1596, after &quot;Richard II&quot; but before &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot;.

&quot;King John&quot; was first printed in 1623 as part of the First Folio. A play titled &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; attributed to Shakespeare first printed in 1591 exists, but modern scholars dismiss the attribution as extremely unlikely to be legitimate.

&quot;King John&quot; is one of only two plays by Shakespeare that are entirely written in verse, the other being &quot;Richard II&quot;.

== Performance history ==
The earliest documented performance dates from 1737, when John Rich staged a production at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1745, the year of the Jacobite rebellion, competing productions were staged by Colley Cibber at Covent Garden and David Garrick at Drury Lane. Charles Kemble&#x27;s 1823 production made a serious effort at historical accuracy, inaugurating the 19th century tradition of striving for historical accuracy in Shakespearean production. Other successful productions of the play were staged by William Charles Macready (1842) and Charles Kean (1846). Twentieth century revivals include Robert B. Mantell&#x27;s 1915 production (the last production to be staged on Broadway) and Peter Brook&#x27;s 1945 staging, featuring Paul Scofield as the Bastard.

In the Victorian era, &quot;King John&quot; was one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most frequently staged plays, in part because its spectacle and pageantry were congenial to Victorian audiences. &quot;King John&quot;, however, has decreased in popularity: it is now one of Shakespeare&#x27;s least-known plays and stagings of it are very rare. It has been staged four times on Broadway, the last time in 1915. It has also been staged five times from 1953 to 2014 at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival.

Herbert Beerbohm Tree made a silent film version in 1899 entitled &quot;King John&quot;. It is a short film consisting of the King&#x27;s death throes in Act V, Scene vii and is the earliest surviving film adaptation of a Shakespearean play. &quot;King John&quot; has been produced for television twice: in 1951 with Donald Wolfit and in 1984 with Leonard Rossiter as part of the BBC Television Shakespeare series of adaptations.

George Orwell specifically praised the play in 1942 for its view of politics: &quot;When I had read it as a boy it seemed to me archaic, something dug out of a history book and not having anything to do with our own time. Well, when I saw it acted, what with its intrigues and doublecrossings, non-aggression pacts, quislings, people changing sides in the middle of a battle, and what-not, it seemed to me extraordinarily up to date.&quot;

=== Selected recent revivals ===
The Royal Shakespeare Company based in Stratford-upon-Avon presented three productions of &quot;King John&quot;: in 2006 directed by Josie Rourke as part of their Complete Works Festival, in 2012 directed by Maria Aberg who cast a woman, Pippa Nixon, in the role of the Bastard, and in 2020, directed by Eleanor Rhode and with a woman, Rosie Sheehy, cast in the role of King John. The company&#x27;s 1974–5 production was heavily rewritten by director John Barton, who included material from &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot;, John Bale &quot;King Johan&quot; (thought to be Shakespeare&#x27;s own sources) and other works.

The Oregon Shakespeare Festival has staged the play several times, most recently in 2022 in a production with a cast of women and non-binary actors.

The Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier presented the play in its 1990-1991 season and again in 2003-2004.

In 2008, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey produced &quot;King John&quot; as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series. Director Tony White set the action in the medieval era but used a multi-ethnic and gender swapping cast.

New York&#x27;s Theater for a New Audience presented a &quot;remarkable&quot; in-the-round production in 2000, emphasising Faulconbridge&#x27;s introduction to court realpolitik to develop the audience&#x27;s own awareness of the characters&#x27; motives. The director was Karin Coonrod.

In 2012, Bard on the Beach in Vancouver, British Columbia put on a production. It was also performed as part of the 2013 season at the Utah Shakespeare Festival, recipient of America&#x27;s Outstanding Regional Theatre Tony Award (2000), presented by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres and Producers.

The play was presented at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, directed by James Dacre, as part of the summer season 2015 in the 800th anniversary year of Magna Carta. A co-production with Royal &amp; Derngate, this production also played in Salisbury Cathedral, Temple Church and The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton.

The Rose Theatre, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey hosted Sir Trevor Nunn&#x27;s direction of the play during May and June 2016, in the quatercentenary year of Shakespeare&#x27;s death and the 800th anniversary year of King John&#x27;s death.

The Worcester Repertory Company staged a production of the play (directed by Ben Humphrey) in 2016 around the tomb of King John in Worcester Cathedral on the 800th anniversary of the king&#x27;s death. King John was played by Phil Leach.

<doc id="67015" wikidata="Q128610" url="?curid=67015" title="Love's Labour's Lost">
<text>Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost is one of William Shakespeare&#x27;s early comedies, believed to have been written in the mid-1590s for a performance at the Inns of Court before Queen Elizabeth I. It follows the King of Navarre and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting. Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of France and her ladies makes them forsworn (break their oath). In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess&#x27;s father, and all weddings are delayed for a year. The play draws on themes of masculine love and desire, reckoning and rationalisation, and reality versus fantasy.

Though first published in quarto in 1598, the play&#x27;s title page suggests a revision of an earlier version of the play. There are no obvious sources for the play&#x27;s plot. The use of apostrophes in the play&#x27;s title varies in early editions, though it is most commonly given as &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;.

Shakespeare&#x27;s audiences were familiar with the historical personages portrayed and the political situation in Europe relating to the setting and action of the play. Scholars suggest the play lost popularity as these historical and political portrayals of Navarre&#x27;s court became dated and less accessible to theatergoers of later generations. The play&#x27;s sophisticated wordplay, pedantic humour and dated literary allusions may also be causes for its relative obscurity, as compared with Shakespeare&#x27;s more popular works. &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; was rarely staged in the 19th century, but it has been seen more often in the 20th and 21st centuries, with productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre, and the Stratford Festival of Canada, among others. It has also been adapted as a musical, an opera, for radio and television and as a musical film.

&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; features the longest scene (5.2), the longest single word &#x27;honorificabilitudinitatibus&#x27; (5.1.39–40), and (depending on editorial choices) the longest speech (4.3.284–361) in all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (see &quot;Date and Text&quot; below).

==Synopsis==
Ferdinand, King of Navarre, and his three noble companions, the Lords Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville, take an oath not to give in to the company of women. They devote themselves to three years of study and fasting; Berowne agrees somewhat more hesitantly than the others. The King declares that no woman should come within a mile of the court. Don Adriano de Armado, a Spaniard visiting the court, writes a letter to tell the King of a tryst between Costard and Jaquenetta. After the King sentences Costard, Don Armado confesses his own love for Jaquenetta to his page, Moth. Don Armado writes Jaquenetta a letter and asks Costard to deliver it.

The Princess of France and her ladies arrive, wishing to speak to the King regarding the cession of Aquitaine, but must ultimately make their camp outside the court due to the decree. In visiting the Princess and her ladies at their camp, the King falls in love with the Princess, as do the lords with the ladies. Berowne gives Costard a letter to deliver to the lady Rosaline, which Costard switches with Don Armado&#x27;s letter that was meant for Jaquenetta. Jaquenetta consults two scholars, Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel, who conclude that the letter is written by Berowne and instruct her to tell the King.

The King and his lords lie in hiding and watch one another as each subsequently reveals his feelings of love. The King ultimately chastises the lords for breaking the oath, but Berowne reveals that the King is likewise in love with the Princess. Jaquenetta and Costard enter with Berowne&#x27;s letter and accuse him of treason. Berowne confesses to breaking the oath, explaining that the only study worthy of mankind is that of love, and he and the other men collectively decide to relinquish the vow. Arranging for Holofernes to entertain the ladies later, the men then dress as Muscovites and court the ladies in disguise. The Queen&#x27;s courtier Boyet, having overheard their planning, helps the ladies trick the men by disguising themselves as each other. When the lords return as themselves, the ladies taunt them and expose their ruse.

Impressed by the ladies&#x27; wit, the men apologize, and when all identities are righted, they watch Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel, Costard, Moth and Don Armado present the Nine Worthies. The four lords and Boyet heckle the play, saving their sole praise for Costard. Don Armado and Costard almost come to blows when Costard reveals mid-pageant that Don Armado has got Jaquenetta pregnant. Their spat is interrupted by news that the Princess&#x27;s father has died. The Princess makes plans to leave at once, and she and her ladies, readying for mourning, declare that the men must wait a year and a day to prove their loves lasting. Don Armado announces he will swear a similar oath to Jaquenetta and then presents the nobles with a song.

==Sources==
&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; may be found to have a number of sources for various aspects, but a primary source for the story is not extant. It has this in common with two other Shakespeare plays – &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Some possible influences on &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; can be found in the early plays of John Lyly, Robert Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Cobbler&#x27;s Prophecy&quot; (c. 1590) and Pierre de La Primaudaye&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Academie française&quot; (1577). Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells comment that it has often been conjectured that the plot derives from &quot;a now lost account of a diplomatic visit made to Henry in 1578 by Catherine de&#x27; Medici and her daughter Marguerite de Valois, Henry&#x27;s estranged wife, to discuss the future of Aquitaine, but this is by no means certain.&quot;

The four main male characters are all loosely based on historical figures; Navarre is based on Henry of Navarre (who later became Henry IV of France), Berowne on Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, Dumain on Charles, duc de Mayenne and Longaville on Henri I d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville. Biron in particular was well known in England because Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, had joined forces with Biron&#x27;s army in support of Henry in 1591. Albert Tricomi states that &quot;the play&#x27;s humorous idealization could remain durable as long as the French names of its principal characters remained familiar to Shakespeare&#x27;s audiences. This means that the witty portrayal of Navarre&#x27;s court could remain reasonably effective until the assassination of Henry IV in 1610. ... Such considerations suggest that the portrayals of Navarre and the civil-war generals presented Elizabethan audiences not with a mere collection of French names in the news, but with an added dramatic dimension which, once lost, helps to account for the eclipse &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; soon underwent.&quot;

Critics have attempted to draw connections between notable Elizabethan English persons and the characters of Don Armado, Moth, Sir Nathaniel, and Holofernes, with little success.

==Date and text==
Most scholars believe the play was written in 1594–1595, but not later than 1598. &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; was first published in quarto in 1598 by the bookseller Cuthbert Burby. The title page states that the play was &quot;Newly corrected and augmented by W. Shakespere,&quot; which has suggested to some scholars a revision of an earlier version.

Dating to 1598, Edinburgh University&#x27;s manuscript is one of the earliest known copies of the work and according to its title page, is the same version as that which was presented to Queen Elizabeth I the previous Christmas, in 1597. It is in quarto format and was donated to Edinburgh University between 1626 and 1636 by former student William Drummond of Hawthornden, making it part of the university&#x27;s first literature collection.

The play next appeared in print in the First Folio in 1623, with a later quarto in 1631. &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot; is considered by some to be a lost sequel.

&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; features the longest scene in all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (5.2), which, depending upon formatting and editorial decisions, ranges from around 920 lines to just over 1000 lines. The First Folio records the scene at 942 lines.

The play also features the single longest word in all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays: &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot;, spoken by Costard at 5.1.30.

The speech given by Berowne at 4.3.284–361 is potentially the longest in all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, depending on editorial choices. Shakespeare critic and editor Edward Capell has pointed out that certain passages within the speech seem to be redundant and argues that these passages represent a first draft which was not adequately corrected before going to print. Specifically, lines 291–313 are &quot;repeated in substance&quot; further in the speech and are sometimes omitted by editors. With no omissions, the speech is 77 lines and 588 words.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Title===
The title is normally given as &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. The use of apostrophes varies in early editions. In its first 1598 quarto publication it appears as &quot;Loues labors loſt&quot;. In the 1623 First Folio it is &quot;Loues Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; and in the 1631 quarto it is &quot;Loues Labours Lost&quot;. In the Third Folio it appears for the first time with the modern punctuation and spelling as &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. Historian John Hale notes that the title could be read as &quot;love&#x27;s labour is lost&quot; or &quot;the lost labours of love&quot; depending on punctuation. Hale suggests that this parallel nature of product and process was intended and is derived from existing Latin idioms. Hale suggests that the witty alliteration of the title is in keeping with the pedantic nature of the play. In 1935 Frances Yates asserted that the title derived from a line in John Florio&#x27;s &quot;His firste Fruites&quot; (1578): &quot;We neede not speak so much of loue, al books are ful of lou, with so many authours, that it were labour lost to speake of Loue&quot;, a source from which Shakespeare also took the untranslated Venetian proverb &quot;Venetia, Venetia/Chi non ti vede non ti pretia&quot; (LLL 4.2.92–93) (&quot;Venice, Venice, Who does not see you cannot praise you&quot;).

===Reputation===
&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; abounds in sophisticated wordplay, puns, and literary allusions and is filled with clever pastiches of contemporary poetic forms. Critic and historian John Pendergast states that &quot;perhaps more than any other Shakespearean play, it explores the power and limitations of language, and this blatant concern for language led many early critics to believe that it was the work of a playwright just learning his art.&quot; In &quot;The Western Canon&quot; (1994), Harold Bloom lauds the work as &quot;astonishing&quot; and refers to it as Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;first absolute achievement&quot;. It is often assumed that the play was written for performance at the Inns of Court, whose students would have been most likely to appreciate its style. It has never been among Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular plays, probably because its pedantic humour and linguistic density are extremely demanding of contemporary theatregoers. The satirical allusions of Navarre&#x27;s court are likewise inaccessible, &quot;having been principally directed to fashions of language that have long passed away, and [are] consequently little understood, rather than in any great deficiency of invention.&quot;

===Themes===

====Masculine desire====
Masculine desire structures the play and helps to shape its action. The men&#x27;s sexual appetite manifests in their desire for fame and honour; the notion of women as dangerous to masculinity and intellect is established early on. The King and his Lords&#x27; desires for their idealized women are deferred, confused, and ridiculed throughout the play. As the play comes to a close, their desire is deferred yet again, resulting in an increased exaltation of the women.

Critic Mark Breitenberg commented that the use of idealistic poetry, popularized by Petrarch, effectively becomes the textualized form of the male gaze. In describing and idealizing the ladies, the King and his Lords exercise a form of control over women they love. Don Armado also represents masculine desire through his relentless pursuit of Jacquenetta. The theme of desire is heightened by the concern of increasing female sexuality throughout the Renaissance period and the consequent threat of cuckoldry. Politics of love, marriage, and power are equally forceful in shaping the thread of masculine desire that drives the plot.

====Reckoning and rationalization====
The term &#x27;reckoning&#x27; is used in its multiple meanings throughout the Shakespeare canon. In &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; in particular, it is often used to signify a moral judgement; most notably, the idea of a final reckoning as it relates to death. Though the play entwines fantasy and reality, the arrival of the messenger to announce the death of the Princess&#x27;s father ultimately brings this notion to a head. Scholar Cynthia Lewis suggested that the appearance of the final reckoning is necessary in reminding the lovers of the seriousness of marriage. The need to settle the disagreement between Navarre and France likewise suggests an instance of reckoning, though this particular reckoning is settled offstage. This is presented in stark contrast to the final scene, in which the act of reckoning cannot be avoided. In acknowledging the consequences of his actions, Don Armado is the only one to deal with his reckoning in a noble manner. The Lords and the King effectively pass judgement on themselves, revealing their true moral character when mocking the players during the representation of the Nine Worthies.

Similar to reckoning is the notion of rationalization, which provides the basis for the swift change in the ladies&#x27; feelings for the men. The ladies are able to talk themselves into falling in love with the men due to the rationalization of the men&#x27;s purported flaws. Lewis concluded that &quot;the proclivity to rationalize a position, a like, or a dislike, is linked in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; with the difficulty of reckoning absolute value, whose slipperiness is indicated throughout the play.&quot;

====Reality versus fantasy====

Critic Joseph Westlund wrote that &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; functions as a &quot;prelude to the more extensive commentary on imagination in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.&quot; There are several plot points driven by fantasy and imagination throughout the play. The Lords and the King&#x27;s declaration of abstinence is a fancy that falls short of achievement. This fantasy rests on the men&#x27;s idea that the resulting fame will allow them to circumvent death and oblivion, a fantastical notion itself. Within moments of swearing their oath, it becomes clear that their fantastical goal is unachievable given the reality of the world, the unnatural state of abstinence itself, and the arrival of the Princess and her ladies. This juxtaposition ultimately lends itself to the irony and humour in the play.

The commoners represent the theme of reality and achievement versus fantasy via their production regarding the Nine Worthies. Like the men&#x27;s fantastical pursuit of fame, the play within a play represents the commoners&#x27; concern with fame. The relationship between the fantasy of love and the reality of worthwhile achievement, a popular Renaissance topic, is also utilized throughout the play. Don Armado attempts to reconcile these opposite desires using Worthies who fell in love as model examples. Time is suspended throughout the play and is of little substance to the plot. The Princess, though originally &quot;craving quick dispatch,&quot; quickly falls under the spell of love and abandons her urgent business. This suggests that the majority of the action takes place within a fantasy world. Only with the news of the Princess&#x27;s father&#x27;s death are time and reality reawakened.

===Music===
Unlike many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, music plays a role only in the final scene of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. The songs of spring and winter, titled &quot;Ver and Hiems&quot; and &quot;The Cuckoo and the Owl&quot;, respectively, occur near the end of the play. Given the critical controversy regarding the exact dating of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, there is some indication that &quot;the songs belong to the 1597 additions.&quot;

Different interpretations of the meaning of these songs include: optimistic commentary for the future, bleak commentary regarding the recent announcement of death, or an ironic device by which to direct the King and his Lords towards a new outlook on love and life. In keeping with the theme of time as it relates to reality and fantasy, these are seasonal songs that restore the sense of time to the play. Due to the opposing nature of the two songs, they can be viewed as a debate on the opposing attitudes on love found throughout the play. Catherine McLay comments that the songs are functional in their interpretation of the central themes in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. McLay also suggests that the songs negate what many consider to be a &quot;heretical&quot; ending for a comedy. The songs, a product of traditional comedic structure, are a method by which the play can be &quot;[brought] within the periphery of the usual comic definition.&quot;

Critic Thomas Berger states that, regardless of the meaning of these final songs, they are important in their contrast with the lack of song throughout the rest of the play. In cutting themselves off from women and the possibility of love, the King and his Lords have effectively cut themselves off from song. Song is allowed into the world of the play at the beginning of Act III, after the Princess and her ladies have been introduced and the men begin to fall in love. Moth&#x27;s song &quot;Concolinel&quot; indicates that the vows will be broken. In Act I, Scene II, Moth recites a poem but fails to sing it. Don Armado insists that Moth sing it twice, but he does not. Berger infers that a song was intended to be inserted at this point, but was never written. Had a song been inserted at this point of the play, it would have followed dramatic convention of the time, which often called for music between scenes.

==Performance history==

The earliest recorded performance of the play occurred at Christmas in 1597 at the Court before Queen Elizabeth. A second performance is recorded to have occurred in 1605, either at the house of the Earl of Southampton or at that of Robert Cecil, Lord Cranborne. The first known production after Shakespeare&#x27;s era was not until 1839, at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, with Madame Vestris as Rosaline. &quot;The Times&quot; was unimpressed, stating: &quot;The play moved very heavily. The whole dialogue is but a string of brilliant conceits, which, if not delivered well, are tedious and unintelligible. The manner in which it was played last night destroyed the brilliancy completely, and left a residuum of insipidity which was encumbered rather than relieved by the scenery and decorations.&quot; The only other performances of the play recorded in England in the 19th century were at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1857 and the St. James&#x27;s Theatre in 1886.

Notable 20th-century British productions included a 1936 staging at the Old Vic featuring Michael Redgrave as Ferdinand and Alec Clunes as Berowne. In 1949, the play was given at the New Theatre with Redgrave in the role of Berowne. The cast of a 1965 Royal Shakespeare Company production included Glenda Jackson, Janet Suzman and Timothy West. In 1968, the play was staged by Laurence Olivier for the National Theatre, with Derek Jacobi as the Duke and Jeremy Brett as Berowne. The Royal Shakespeare Company produced the play again in 1994. The critic Michael Billington wrote in his review of the production: &quot;The more I see &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, the more I think it Shakespeare&#x27;s most beguiling comedy. It both celebrates and satisfies linguistic exuberance, explores the often painful transition from youth to maturity, and reminds us of our common mortality.&quot;

In late summer 2005, an adaptation of the play was staged in the Dari language in Kabul, Afghanistan by a group of Afghan actors, and was reportedly very well received.

A 2009 staging by Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe theatre, with artistic direction by Dominic Dromgoole, toured internationally. Ben Brantley, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the production, seen at Pace University, &quot;sophomoric&quot;. He postulated that the play itself &quot;may well be the first and best example of a genre that would flourish in less sophisticated forms five centuries later: the college comedy.&quot;

In 2014, the Royal Shakespeare Company completed a double-feature in which &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, set on the eve of the First World War, is followed by &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (re-titled &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;). Dominic Cavendish of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;the most blissfully entertaining and emotionally involving RSC offering I&#x27;ve seen in ages&quot; and remarked that &quot;Parallels between the two works – the sparring wit, the sex-war skirmishes, the shift from showy linguistic evasion to heart-felt earnestness – become persuasively apparent.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Literature===

Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Princess&quot; (and, by extension, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Princess Ida&quot;) is speculated by Gerhard Joseph to have been inspired by &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;.

Thomas Mann in his novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1943) has the fictional German composer Adrian Leverkühn attempt to write an opera on the story of the play.

=== Musical theatre, opera, and plays ===

An opera of the same title as the play was composed by Nicolas Nabokov, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, and first performed in 1973.

In the summer of 2013, The Public Theater in New York City presented a musical adaptation of the play as part of their Shakespeare in the Park programming. This production marked the first new Shakespeare-based musical to be produced at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park since the 1971 mounting of &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; with music by Galt MacDermot. The adaptation of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; featured a score by &quot;Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson&quot; collaborators Michael Friedman and Alex Timbers. Timbers also directed the production, which starred Daniel Breaker, Colin Donnell, Rachel Dratch, and Patti Murin, among others.

The 2004 ska musical &quot;The Big Life&quot; is based on &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, reworked to be about the Windrush generation arriving in London.

Marc Palmieri&#x27;s 2015 play &quot;The Groundling&quot;, a farce the &quot;New York Times&quot; referred to as &quot;half comedy and half tragedy&quot;, was billed as a &quot;meditation on the meaning of the final moments of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;.

===Film, television and radio===

Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 2000 film adaptation relocated the setting to the 1930s and attempted to make the play more accessible by turning it into a musical. The film was a box office disappointment.

The play was one of the last works to be recorded for the BBC Television Shakespeare project, broadcast in 1985. The production set events in the eighteenth century, the costumes and sets being modeled on the paintings of Jean-Antoine Watteau. This was the only instance in the project of a work set in a period after Shakespeare&#x27;s death. The play is featured in an episode of the British TV show, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The episode, entitled &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;, focuses on Shakespeare himself and a hypothetical follow-up play, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;, whose final scene is used as a portal for alien witches to invade Earth. All copies of this play disappear along with the witches.

BBC Radio 3 aired a radio adaptation on 16 December 1946, directed by Noel Illif, with music by Gerald Finzi scored for a small chamber orchestra. The cast included Paul Scofield. The music was subsequently converted into an orchestral suite. BBC Radio 3 aired another radio adaptation on 22 February 1979, directed by David Spenser, with music by Derek Oldfield. The cast included Michael Kitchen as Ferdinand; John McEnery as Berowne; Anna Massey as the Princess of France; Eileen Atkins as Rosaline; and Paul Scofield as Don Adriano.

A modern-language adaptation of the play, titled &quot;Groups of Ten or More People&quot;, was released online by Chicago-based company Littlebrain Theatre in July 2020. This adaptation, set during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, was filmed entirely over the digital conferencing program Zoom.

<doc id="67018" wikidata="Q93157" url="?curid=67018" title="Eugene O'Neill">
<text>Eugene Gladstone O&#x27;Neill (October 16, 1888 – November 27, 1953) was an American playwright. His poetically titled plays were among the first to introduce into the U.S. the drama techniques of realism, earlier associated with Chekhov, Ibsen, and Strindberg. The tragedy &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; is often included on lists of the finest U.S. plays in the 20th century, alongside Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. He was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature. O&#x27;Neill is also the only playwright to win four Pulitzer Prizes for Drama.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plays were among the first to include speeches in American English vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society. They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, ultimately sliding into disillusion and despair. Of his very few comedies, only one is well-known (&quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot;). Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.

==Early life==

O&#x27;Neill was born on October 16, 1888, in a hotel, the Barrett House, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square) in New York City. A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, shops and the ABC Studios.

He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O&#x27;Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. His father suffered from alcoholism; his mother from an addiction to morphine, prescribed to relieve the pains of the difficult birth of Eugene, who was her third son. Because his father was often on tour with a theatrical company, accompanied by Eugene&#x27;s mother, in 1895 O&#x27;Neill was sent to St. Aloysius Academy for Boys, a Catholic boarding school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1900, he became a day student at the De La Salle Institute on 59th Street in Manhattan.

The O&#x27;Neill family reunited for summers at the Monte Cristo Cottage in New London, Connecticut. He also briefly attended Betts Academy in Stamford. He attended Princeton University for one year. Accounts vary as to why he left. He may have been dropped for attending too few classes, been suspended for &quot;conduct code violations&quot;, or &quot;for breaking a window&quot;, or according to a more concrete but possibly apocryphal account, because he threw &quot;a beer bottle into the window of Professor Woodrow Wilson&quot;, the future president of the United States.

O&#x27;Neill spent several years at sea, during which he suffered from depression, alcoholism and despair. Despite this, he had a deep love for the sea and it became a prominent theme in many of his plays, several of which are set on board ships like those on which he worked. O&#x27;Neill joined the Marine Transport Workers Union of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which was fighting for improved living conditions for the working class using quick &#x27;on the job&#x27; direct action. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s parents and elder brother Jamie (who drank himself to death at the age of 45) died within three years of one another, not long after he had begun to make his mark in the theater.

==Career==
After his experience in 1912–13 at a sanatorium where he was recovering from tuberculosis, he decided to devote himself full-time to writing plays (the events immediately prior to going to the sanatorium are dramatized in his masterpiece, &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;). O&#x27;Neill had previously been employed by the &quot;New London Telegraph&quot;, writing poetry as well as reporting. In the fall of 1914, he entered Harvard University to attend a course in dramatic technique given by George Piece Baker, but left after one year.

During the 1910s O&#x27;Neill was a regular on the Greenwich Village literary scene, where he also befriended many radicals, most notably Communist Labor Party of America founder John Reed. O&#x27;Neill also had a brief romantic relationship with Reed&#x27;s wife, writer Louise Bryant. O&#x27;Neill was portrayed by Jack Nicholson in the 1981 film &quot;Reds&quot;, about the life of John Reed; Louise Bryant was portrayed by Diane Keaton.
His involvement with the Provincetown Players began in mid-1916. Terry Carlin reported that O&#x27;Neill arrived for the summer in Provincetown with &quot;a trunk full of plays&quot;, but this was an exaggeration. Susan Glaspell describes a reading of &quot;Bound East for Cardiff&quot; that took place in the living room of Glaspell and her husband George Cram Cook&#x27;s home on Commercial Street, adjacent to the wharf (pictured) that was used by the Players for their theater: &quot;So Gene took &quot;Bound East for Cardiff&quot; out of his trunk, and Freddie Burt read it to us, Gene staying out in the dining-room while reading went on. He was not left alone in the dining-room when the reading had finished.&quot; The Provincetown Players performed many of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s early works in their theaters both in Provincetown and on MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. Some of these early plays, such as &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, began downtown and then moved to Broadway.

In an early one-act play, &quot;The Web&quot;, written in 1913, O&#x27;Neill first explored the darker themes that he later thrived on. Here he focused on the brothel world and the lives of prostitutes, which also play a role in some fourteen of his later plays. In particular, he memorably included the birth of an infant into the world of prostitution. At the time, such themes constituted a huge innovation, as these sides of life had never before been presented with such success.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first published play, &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot;, opened on Broadway in 1920 to great acclaim, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. His first major hit was &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, which ran on Broadway in 1920 and obliquely commented on the U.S. occupation of Haiti that was a topic of debate in that year&#x27;s presidential election. His best-known plays include &quot;Anna Christie&quot; (Pulitzer Prize 1922), &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; (1924), &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (Pulitzer Prize 1928), &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1931), and his only well-known comedy, &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot;, a wistful re-imagining of his youth as he wished it had been.

O&#x27;Neill was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1935. In 1936, O&#x27;Neill received the Nobel Prize in Literature after he had been nominated that year by Henrik Schück, member of the Swedish Academy. O&#x27;Neill was profoundly influenced by the work of Swedish writer August Strindberg, and upon receiving the Nobel Prize, dedicated much of his acceptance speech to describing Strindberg&#x27;s influence on his work. In conversation with Russel Crouse, O&#x27;Neill said that &quot;the Strindberg part of the speech is no &#x27;telling tale&#x27; to please the Swedes with a polite gesture. It is absolutely sincere. [...] And it&#x27;s absolutely true that I am proud of the opportunity to acknowledge my debt to Strindberg thus publicly to his people&quot;. Before the speech was sent to Stockholm, O&#x27;Neill read it to his friend Sophus Keith Winther. As he was reading, he suddenly interrupted himself with the comment: &quot;I wish immortality were a fact, for then some day I would meet Strindberg&quot;. When Winther objected that &quot;that would scarcely be enough to justify immortality&quot;, O&#x27;Neill answered quickly and firmly: &quot;It would be enough for me&quot;.

After a ten-year pause, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s now-renowned play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; was produced in 1946. The following year&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot; failed, and it was decades before coming to be considered as among his best works.

He was also part of the modern movement to partially revive the classical heroic mask from ancient Greek theatre and Japanese Noh theatre in some of his plays, such as &quot;The Great God Brown&quot; and &quot;Lazarus Laughed.&quot;

==Family life==
O&#x27;Neill was married to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909, to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Jr. (1910–1950). In 1917, O&#x27;Neill met Agnes Boulton, a successful writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, after their marriage. The years of their marriage—during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona—are described vividly in her 1958 memoir &quot;Part of a Long Story&quot;. They divorced on July 2, 1929, after O&#x27;Neill abandoned Boulton and the children, for the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O&#x27;Neill and Carlotta married less than a month after he officially divorced his previous wife.

In 1929, O&#x27;Neill and Monterey moved to the Loire Valley in central France, where they lived in the Château du Plessis in Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher, Indre-et-Loire. During the early 1930s they returned to the United States and lived in Sea Island, Georgia, at a house called Casa Genotta. He moved to Danville, California, in 1937 and lived there until 1944. His house there, &quot;Tao House&quot;, is today the Eugene O&#x27;Neill National Historic Site.

In their first years together, Monterey organized O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s life, enabling him to devote himself to writing. She later became addicted to potassium bromide, and the marriage deteriorated, resulting in a number of separations, although they never divorced.

In 1943, O&#x27;Neill disowned his daughter Oona for marrying the English actor, director, and producer Charlie Chaplin when she was 18 and Chaplin was 54. He never saw Oona again.

He also had distant relationships with his sons. Eugene O&#x27;Neill Jr., a Yale classicist, suffered from alcoholism and committed suicide in 1950 at the age of 40. Shane O&#x27;Neill became a heroin addict and moved into the family home in Bermuda, &quot;Spithead,&quot; with his new wife, where he supported himself by selling off the furnishings. He was disowned by his father before also committing suicide (by jumping out of a window) a number of years later. Oona ultimately inherited Spithead and the connected estate (subsequently known as the Chaplin Estate). In 1950 O&#x27;Neill joined The Lambs, the famed theater club.

==Illness and death==

After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O&#x27;Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinson&#x27;s-like tremor in his hands that made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he tried dictation but found himself unable to compose that way. While at Tao House, O&#x27;Neill had intended to write a collection of works he called &quot;the Cycle&quot; chronicling American life spanning from 1755 to 1932. Only two of the eleven plays O&#x27;Neill proposed, &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; and &quot;More Stately Mansions&quot;, were completed. As his health worsened, O&#x27;Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, and &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;, which he completed in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. The book &quot;&quot;Love and Admiration and Respect&quot;: The O&#x27;Neill-Commins Correspondence&quot;&quot; includes an extended account written by Saxe Commins, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s publisher, in which he talks of &quot;snatches of dialogue&quot; between Carlotta and O&#x27;Neill over the disappearance of a group of manuscripts that O&#x27;Neill had brought with him from San Francisco. &quot;When the table was cleared I learned the cause of the tension; the manuscripts were lost. They had disappeared mysteriously during the day and there was no clue to their whereabouts.&quot;

O&#x27;Neill died at the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University&#x27;s Kilachand Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at age 65. As he was dying, he whispered: &quot;I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.&quot; He is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston&#x27;s Jamaica Plain neighborhood.

In 1956, Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. It is widely considered his finest play. Other posthumously published works include &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; (1958) and &quot;More Stately Mansions&quot; (1967).

In 1967, the United States Postal Service honored O&#x27;Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965–1978) $1 postage stamp.

In 2000, a team of researchers studying O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s autopsy report concluded that he died of cerebellar cortical atrophy, a rare form of brain deterioration unrelated to either alcohol use or Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Legacy ==
In Warren Beatty&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Reds&quot;, O&#x27;Neill is portrayed by Jack Nicholson, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

George C. White founded the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut in 1964.

Eugene O&#x27;Neill is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

O&#x27;Neill is referenced by Upton Sinclair in &quot;The Cup of Fury&quot; (1956), Dianne Wiest&#x27;s character in &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), by J.K. Simmons&#x27; character in &quot;Whiplash&quot; (2014), by Tony Stark in &quot;&quot; (2015), specifically &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, and &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; is also referenced by Patrick Wilson&#x27;s character in &quot;Purple Violets&quot; (2007).

O&#x27;Neill is referred to in Moss Hart&#x27;s 1959 book &quot;Act One&quot;, later a Broadway play.

==Museums and collections==
O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s home in New London, Monte Cristo Cottage, was made a National Historic Landmark in 1971. His home in Danville, California, near San Francisco, was preserved as the Eugene O&#x27;Neill National Historic Site in 1976.

Connecticut College maintains the Louis Sheaffer Collection, consisting of material collected by the O&#x27;Neill biographer. The principal collection of O&#x27;Neill papers is at Yale University. The Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut, fosters the development of new plays under his name.

There is also a theatre in New York City named after him located at 230 West 49th Street in midtown-Manhattan. The Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre has housed musicals and plays such as &quot;Yentl&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;.

<text>The SSM-N-8A Regulus or the Regulus I was a United States Navy-developed ship-and-submarine-launched, nuclear-capable turbojet-powered second generation cruise missile, deployed from 1955 to 1964. Its development was an outgrowth of U.S. Navy tests conducted with the German V-1 missile at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in California. Its barrel-shaped fuselage resembled that of numerous fighter aircraft designs of the era, but without a cockpit. Test articles of the Regulus were equipped with landing gear and could take off and land like an airplane. When the missiles were deployed they were launched from a rail launcher, and equipped with a pair of Aerojet JATO bottles on the aft end of the fuselage.

==History==
===Design and development===
In October 1943, Chance Vought Aircraft Company signed a study contract for a range missile to carry a warhead. The project stalled for four years, however, until May 1947, when the United States Army Air Forces awarded Martin Aircraft Company a contract for a turbojet powered subsonic missile, the Matador. The Navy saw Matador as a threat to its role in guided missiles and, within days, started a Navy development program for a missile that could be launched from a submarine and use the same J33 engine as the Matador. In August 1947, the specifications for the project, now named &quot;Regulus,&quot; were issued: Carry a warhead, to a range of , at Mach 0.85, with a circular error probable (CEP) of 0.5% of the range. At its extreme range the missile had to hit within of its target 50% of the time.

Regulus development was preceded by Navy experiments with the JB-2 Loon missile, a close derivative of the German V-1 flying bomb, beginning in the last year of World War II. Submarine testing was performed from 1947 to 1953 at the Navy&#x27;s facility at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, with and converted as test platforms, initially carrying the missile unprotected, thus unable to submerge until after launch.

Regulus was designed to be long, in wingspan, in diameter, and would weigh between . The missile somewhat resembled the contemporary F-84 Thunderjet fighter aircraft, but without a cockpit, and test versions were equipped with landing gear so that they could be recovered and re-used. After launch, Regulus would be guided toward its target by control stations, typically by submarines or surface ships equipped with guidance equipment. It could also be flown remotely by chase aircraft. (Later, with the &quot;Trounce&quot; system (Tactical Radar Omnidirectional Underwater Navigational Control Equipment), one submarine could guide it). Army-Navy competition complicated both the Matador&#x27;s and the Regulus&#x27; developments. The missiles looked alike and used the same engine. They had nearly identical performances, schedules, and costs. Under pressure to reduce defense spending, the United States Department of Defense ordered the Navy to determine if Matador could be adapted for their use. The Navy concluded that the Navy&#x27;s Regulus could perform the Navy mission better.

Regulus had some advantages over Matador. It required only two guidance stations while Matador required three. It could also be launched quicker, as Matador&#x27;s boosters had to be fitted while the missile was on the launcher while Regulus was stowed with its boosters attached. Finally, Chance Vought built a recoverable version of the missile, designated KDU-1 and also used as a target drone, so that even though a Regulus test vehicle was more expensive to build, Regulus was cheaper to use over a series of tests. The Navy program continued, and the first Regulus flew in March 1951.

Due to its size and regulations concerning oversize loads on highways, Chance Vought collaborated with a firm that specialized in trucking oversize loads to develop a special tractor trailer combination which could move a Regulus I missile.

===Ships and submarines deployed with Regulus I===

The first launch from a submarine occurred in July 1953 from the deck of , a World War II fleet boat modified to carry Regulus. &quot;Tunny&quot; and her sister boat were the United States&#x27;s first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines. They were joined in 1958 by two purpose-built Regulus submarines, and , and, later, by the nuclear-powered . &quot;Halibut&quot;, with its extremely large internal hangar could carry five missiles and was intended to be the prototype of a whole new class of cruise missile firing SSG-N submarines.
The Navy strategy called for four Regulus missiles to be at sea at any given time. Thus, &quot;Barbero&quot; and &quot;Tunny&quot;, each of which carried two Regulus missiles, patrolled simultaneously. &quot;Growler&quot; and &quot;Grayback&quot;, with four missiles each, or &quot;Halibut&quot;, with five, could patrol alone. Operating from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the five Regulus submarines made 40 nuclear deterrent patrols in the Northern Pacific Ocean between October 1959 and July 1964, including during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. According to the documentary &quot;Regulus: The First Nuclear Missile Submarines&quot; by Nick T. Spark, their primary task in the event of a nuclear exchange would be to eliminate the Soviet naval base at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. These deterrent patrols represented the first ever in the history of the submarine Navy and preceded those made by the Polaris missile firing submarines.
The Regulus firing submarines were relieved by the s carrying the Polaris missile system. &quot;Barbero&quot; also earned the distinction of launching the only delivery of missile mail.

Additional submarines including USS &quot;Cusk&quot; and USS &quot;Carbonero&quot; were equipped with control systems that allowed them to take control of a Regulus in flight, thus extending its range in a tactical situation.
Regulus was also deployed by the U.S. Navy in 1955 in the Pacific on board the cruiser . In 1956, three more followed: , , and . These four s each carried three Regulus missiles on operational patrols in the Western Pacific. &quot;Macon&quot; last Regulus patrol was in 1958, &quot;Toledo&quot; in 1959, &quot;Helena&quot; in 1960, and &quot;Los Angeles&quot; in 1961.

Ten aircraft carriers were configured to operate Regulus missiles (though only six ever launched one). did not deploy with the missile but conducted the first launch of a Regulus from a warship. also did not deploy but was involved in two demonstration launches. and each conducted one test launch. deployed to the Mediterranean carrying three Regulus missiles. deployed once to the Western Pacific with four missiles in 1955. &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Hancock&quot;, , and were involved in the development of the Regulus Assault Mission (RAM) concept. RAM converted the Regulus cruise missiles into an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV): Regulus missiles would be launched from cruisers or submarines, and once in flight, guided to their targets by carrier-based pilots with remote control equipment.

===Replacement and legacy===
Despite being the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first underwater nuclear capability, the Regulus missile system had significant operational drawbacks. In order to launch, the submarine had to surface and assemble the missile in whatever sea conditions it was in. Because it required active radar guidance, which only had a range of , the ship had to stay stationary on the surface to guide it to the target while effectively broadcasting its location. This guidance method was susceptible to jamming and since the missile was subsonic, the launch platform remained exposed and vulnerable to attack during its flight duration; destroying the ship would effectively disable the missile in flight.

Production of Regulus was phased out in January 1959 with delivery of the 514th missile; in 1962, it was redesignated RGM-6. It was removed from service in August 1964. Some of the obsolete missiles were expended as targets at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Regulus not only provided the first nuclear strategic deterrence force for the United States Navy during the first years of the Cold War and especially during the Cuban Missile Crisis, preceding the Polaris missiles, Poseidon missiles, and Trident missiles that followed, but it was also the forerunner of the Tomahawk cruise missile.

Following retirement, a number of Regulas I missiles were converted for target drone usage under the designation BQM-6C.

==Regulus II==

A second generation supersonic Vought SSM-N-9 Regulus II cruise missile with a range of and a speed of Mach 2 was developed and successfully tested, including a test launch from &quot;Grayback&quot;, but the program was canceled in favor of the UGM-27 Polaris nuclear ballistic missile.

The Regulus II missile was a completely new design with improved guidance and double the range, and was intended to replace the Regulus I missile. Regulus II-equipped submarines and ships would have been fitted with the Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS), allowing the missiles to be aligned accurately before take-off.

Forty-eight test flights of Regulus II prototypes were carried out, 30 of which were successful, 14 partially successful and four failures. A production contract was signed in January 1958 and the only submarine launch was carried out from &quot;Grayback&quot; in September 1958.

Due to the high cost of the Regulus II (approximately one million dollars each), budgetary pressure, and the emergence of the UGM-27 Polaris SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile), the Regulus II program was canceled on 18 December 1958. At the time of cancellation Vought had completed 20 Regulus II missiles with 27 more on the production line. Production of Regulus I missiles continued until January 1959 with delivery of the 514th missile, and it was withdrawn from service in August 1964.

Both Regulus I and Regulus II were used as target drones after 1964.

<text>Lionel Barrymore (born Lionel Herbert Blyth; April 28, 1878 – November 15, 1954) was an American actor of stage, screen and radio as well as a film director. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931) and is known to modern audiences for the role of villainous Mr. Potter in Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

He is also particularly remembered as Ebenezer Scrooge in annual broadcasts of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; during his last two decades. He is also known for playing Dr Leonard Gillespie in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s nine Dr Kildare films, a role he reprised in a further six films focusing solely on Gillespie and in a radio series titled &quot;The Story of Dr Kildare&quot;. He was a member of the theatrical Barrymore family.

==Early life==
Lionel Barrymore was born Lionel Herbert Blyth in Philadelphia, the son of actors Georgiana Drew Barrymore and Maurice Barrymore (born Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blyth). He was the elder brother of Ethel and John Barrymore, the uncle of John Drew Barrymore and Diana Barrymore and the great-uncle of Drew Barrymore, among other members of the Barrymore family. He attended private schools as a child, including the Art Students League of New York. While raised a Roman Catholic, Barrymore attended the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. Barrymore graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School, the Roman Catholic college prep school, in the class of 1891.

Barrymore was married twice, to actresses Doris Rankin and Irene Fenwick, a one-time lover of his brother, John. Doris&#x27;s sister Gladys was married to Lionel&#x27;s uncle Sidney Drew, which made Gladys both his aunt and sister-in-law. Doris Rankin bore Lionel two daughters, Ethel Barrymore II and Mary Barrymore. Neither child survived infancy. Barrymore never truly recovered from the deaths of his girls and their loss undoubtedly strained his marriage to Doris Rankin, which ended in 1922. Years later Barrymore developed a fatherly affection for Jean Harlow, who was born about the same time as his daughters. When Harlow died in 1937, Barrymore and Clark Gable mourned her as though she had been family.

==Stage career==

Reluctant to follow his parents&#x27; career, Barrymore appeared together with his grandmother Louisa Lane Drew on tour and in a stage production of &quot;The Rivals&quot; at the age of 15. He later recounted that &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to act. I wanted to paint or draw. The theater was not in my blood, I was related to the theater by marriage only; it was merely a kind of &quot;in-law&quot; of mine I had to live with.&quot; Nevertheless, he soon found success on stage in character roles and continued to act, although he still wanted to become a painter and also to compose music. He appeared on Broadway in his early twenties with his uncle John Drew Jr. in such plays as &quot;The Second in Command&quot; (1901) and &quot;The Mummy and the Hummingbird&quot; (1902), the latter of which won him critical acclaim. &quot;The Other Girl&quot; in 1903–04 was a long-running success for Barrymore. In 1905, he appeared with John and Ethel in a pantomime, starring as the title character in &quot;Pantaloon&quot; and playing another character in the other half of the bill, &quot;Alice Sit-by-the-Fire&quot;.

In 1906, after a series of disappointing appearances in plays, Barrymore and his first wife, the actress Doris Rankin, left their stage careers and travelled to Paris, where he trained as an artist. Lionel and Doris were in Paris in 1908 when their first baby, Ethel, was born. Lionel confirms in his autobiography, &quot;We Barrymores&quot;, that he and Doris were in France when Bleriot flew the English Channel on July 25, 1909. He did not achieve success as a painter and in 1909 he returned to the US. In December of that year he returned to the stage in &quot;The Fires of Fate&quot;, in Chicago, but left the production later that month after suffering an attack of nerves about the forthcoming New York opening. The producers gave appendicitis as the reason for his sudden departure. Nevertheless, he was soon back on Broadway in &quot;The Jail Bird&quot; in 1910 and continued his stage career with several more plays. He also joined his family troupe, from 1910, in their vaudeville act, where he was happy not to worry as much about memorizing lines.

From 1912 to 1917 Barrymore was away from the stage again while he established his film career, but after the First World War he had several successes on Broadway, where he established his reputation as a dramatic and character actor, often performing with his wife. He returned to the stage in &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot; (1917) with his brother, John, and achieved star billing in &quot;The Copperhead&quot; (1918) (with Doris). He retained star billing for the next 6 years in plays such as &quot;The Jest&quot; (1919) (again with John) and &quot;The Letter of the Law&quot; (1920). Lionel gave a short-lived performance as MacBeth in 1921 opposite veteran actress Julia Arthur as Lady MacBeth, but the production encountered strongly negative criticism. His last stage success was in &quot;Laugh, Clown, Laugh&quot;, in 1923, with his second wife, Irene Fenwick; they met while acting together in &quot;The Claw&quot; the previous year, and after they fell in love he divorced his first wife. He also received negative notices in three productions in a row in 1925. After appearing in &quot;Man or Devil&quot; in 1926, he signed a film contract with MGM and after the advent of sound films in 1927, he never again appeared on stage.

==Film career==
Barrymore joined Biograph Studios in 1909 and began to appear in leading roles by 1911 in films directed by D. W. Griffith. Barrymore made &quot;The Battle&quot; (1911), &quot;The New York Hat&quot; (1912), &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Three Friends&quot; (1913). In 1915, he co-starred with Lillian Russell in a movie called &quot;Wildfire&quot;, one of the legendary Russell&#x27;s few film appearances. He also was involved in writing and directing at Biograph. The last silent film he directed, &quot;Life&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot; (Metro Pictures, 1917), starred his sister, Ethel. He acted in more than 60 silent films with Griffith.
In 1920, Barrymore reprised his stage role in the film adaptation of &quot;The Copperhead&quot;. Also in 1920, he starred in the lead role of &quot;The Master Mind&quot;, with Gypsy O&#x27;Brien co-starring.

Before the formation of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924, Barrymore forged a good relationship with Louis B. Mayer early on at Metro Pictures. He made several silent features for Metro, some of which are now lost. In 1923, Barrymore and Fenwick went to Italy to film &quot;The Eternal City&quot; for Metro Pictures in Rome, combining work with their honeymoon. He occasionally freelanced, returning to Griffith in 1924 to film &quot;America&quot;. In 1925, he left New York for Hollywood.
Prior to his marriage to Irene, Barrymore and his brother John engaged in a dispute over the issue of Irene&#x27;s chastity in the wake of her having been one of John&#x27;s lovers. The brothers didn&#x27;t speak again for two years and weren&#x27;t seen together until the premiere of John&#x27;s film &quot;Don Juan&quot; in 1926, by which time they had patched up their differences. Barrymore signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1926 and his first picture there was &quot;The Barrier&quot;. His first talking picture was &quot;The Lion and the Mouse&quot;; his stage experience allowed him to excel in delivering the dialogue in sound films.

On the occasional loan-out, Barrymore had a big success with Gloria Swanson in 1928&#x27;s &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; and the aforementioned Griffith film, &quot;Drums of Love&quot;. In 1929, he returned to directing films. During this early and imperfect sound film period, he directed the controversial &quot;His Glorious Night&quot;, with John Gilbert; &quot;Madame X&quot;, starring Ruth Chatterton; and &quot;The Rogue Song&quot;, Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s first color film. He was credited with being the first director to move a microphone on a sound stage. Barrymore returned to acting in front of the camera in 1931. In the following year, he won an Academy Award for his role as an alcoholic lawyer in &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931), after being considered in 1930 for Best Director for &quot;Madame X&quot;. He played alongside Greta Garbo in the 1931 film “Mata Hari”. He could play many characters, like the evil Rasputin in the 1932 &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot; (in which he co-starred for the only time with siblings John and Ethel) and the ailing Oliver Jordan in &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933 — also with John, although they had no scenes together). He played Professor Zelen, the Occultist expert, in the classic horror &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; (1935).

On April 27, 1939, Louis B. Mayer threw Barrymore a 61st birthday party (the day before his actual birthday), broadcast live on &quot;Good News of 1939&quot;, and required all MGM employees to attend. This was likely intended to distract from, and prevent MGM attendance of, the &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; premiere that occurred simultaneously. The film was highly controversial due to its anti-Nazi message.

During the 1930s and 1940s, he became stereotyped as a grouchy but sweet elderly man in such films as &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; (1929), &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932, with John Barrymore), Little Colonel (1935, with Shirley Temple and Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson), &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937), &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937, with Jean Harlow), &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938), &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot; (1939, with Cedric Hardwicke), &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), &quot;Three Wise Fools&quot; (1946), and &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948).
In a series of Doctor Kildare movies in the 1930s and 1940s, he played the irascible Doctor Gillespie, a role he repeated in an MGM radio series that debuted in New York in 1950 and was later syndicated. Barrymore had broken his hip in an accident, hence he played Gillespie in a wheelchair. Later, his worsening arthritis kept him in the chair. The injury also precluded his playing Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1938 MGM film version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, a role Barrymore played every year but two (replaced by brother John Barrymore in 1936 and replaced by Orson Welles in 1938) on the radio from 1934 through 1953. He also played the title role in the 1940s radio series &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;.

He is well known for his role as Mr. Potter, the miserly and mean-spirited banker in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) opposite James Stewart.

He had a role with Clark Gable in &quot;Lone Star&quot; in 1952. His final film appearance was a cameo in &quot;Main Street to Broadway&quot;, an MGM musical comedy released in 1953. His sister Ethel also appeared in the film.

==Politics==
Barrymore was a Republican. In 1944, he attended the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who would become Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948 and later the Chief Justice of the United States. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and with short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Among the others in attendance were Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Randolph Scott, Adolphe Menjou, Gary Cooper, Edward Arnold, William Bendix, and Walter Pidgeon.

Barrymore registered for the draft during World War II, despite his age and disability, to encourage others to enlist in the military.

He loathed the income tax, and by the time he was appearing on &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;, MGM withheld a sizable portion of his paychecks, paying back the IRS the amount he owed.

==Medical issues==
Several sources argue that arthritis alone confined Barrymore to a wheelchair. Film historian Jeanine Basinger says that his arthritis was serious by at least 1928, when Barrymore made &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot;. Film historian David Wallace says it was well known that Barrymore was addicted to morphine due to arthritis by 1929. A history of Oscar-winning actors, however, says Barrymore was only suffering from arthritis, not crippled or incapacitated by it. Marie Dressler biographer Matthew Kennedy notes that when Barrymore won his Best Actor Oscar award in 1931, the arthritis was still so minor that it only made him limp a little as he went on stage to accept the honor. Barrymore can be seen being quite physical in late silent films like &quot;The Thirteenth Hour&quot; and &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot;, where he can be seen climbing out of a window.

Paul Donnelly says Barrymore&#x27;s inability to walk was caused by a drawing table falling on him in 1936, breaking Barrymore&#x27;s hip. Barrymore tripped over a cable while filming &quot;Saratoga&quot; in 1937 and broke his hip again. (Film historian Robert Osborne says Barrymore also suffered a broken kneecap.) The injury was so painful that Donnelly, quoting Barrymore, says that Louis B. Mayer bought $400 worth of cocaine for Barrymore every day to help him cope with the pain and allow him to sleep. Author David Schwartz says the hip fracture never healed, which was why Barrymore could not walk, and MGM historian John Douglas Eames describes the injury as &quot;crippling&quot;. Barrymore himself said in 1951, that it was breaking his hip twice that kept him in the wheelchair. He said he had no other problems, and that the hip healed well, but it made walking exceptionally difficult. Film historian Allen Eyles reached the same conclusion.

Lew Ayres biographer Lesley Coffin and Louis B. Mayer biographer Scott Eyman argue that it was the combination of the broken hip and Barrymore&#x27;s worsening arthritis that put him in a wheelchair. Barrymore family biographer Margot Peters says Gene Fowler and James Doane said Barrymore&#x27;s arthritis was caused by syphilis, which they say he contracted in 1925. Eyman, however, explicitly rejects this hypothesis.

Whatever the cause, Barrymore&#x27;s performance in &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; in 1937 was one of the last times he would be seen standing and walking unassisted. On his next picture, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, Barrymore tripped over a cable on set, breaking his hip for the second time in two years and reportedly breaking his knee cap. Afterward, Barrymore was able to get about for a short period of time on crutches even though he was in great pain. During the filming of 1938&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot;, the pain of standing with crutches was so severe that Barrymore required hourly shots of painkillers. By 1938, Barrymore&#x27;s disability forced him to relinquish the role of Ebenezer Scrooge (a role he made famous on the radio) to British actor Reginald Owen in the MGM film version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. From then on, Barrymore used a wheelchair exclusively and never walked again. He could, however, stand for short periods of time such as at his brother&#x27;s funeral in 1942.

==Composer, artist, novelist==

Barrymore also composed music. His works ranged from solo piano pieces to large-scale orchestral works, such as &quot;Tableau Russe,&quot; which was performed twice in &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; (1941) as Cornelia&#x27;s Symphony, first on piano by Nils Asther&#x27;s character and later by a full symphony orchestra. His piano compositions, &quot;Scherzo Grotesque&quot; and &quot;Song Without Words&quot;, were published by G. Schirmer in 1945. Upon the death of his brother John in 1942, he composed a work &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, which was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. His orchestral Partita was given multiple performances. He also composed the theme song of the radio program &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;.

Barrymore had attended art school in New York and Paris and was a skillful illustrator, creating etchings and drawings and was a member of the Society of American Etchers, now known as the Society of American Graphic Artists. For years, he maintained an artist&#x27;s shop and studio attached to his home in Los Angeles. Some of his etchings were included in the &quot;Hundred Prints of the Year&quot;.

He wrote a historical novel, &quot;Mr. Cantonwine: A Moral Tale&quot; (1953).

He was also a horticulturalist, growing roses on his Chatsworth Ranch.

==Death==

Barrymore died on November 15, 1954, from a heart attack in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was entombed in the Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles.

==Tributes==
Barrymore received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960—a motion pictures star and a radio star. The stars are located at 1724 Vine Street for motion pictures, and 1651 Vine Street for radio. He was also inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, along with his siblings, Ethel and John.

<doc id="67023" wikidata="Q829088" url="?curid=67023" title="Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement">
<text>The Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (, abbreviated MRTA) was a Peruvian Marxist-Leninist guerrilla army which started in the early 1980s. Their self-declared goal was to demonstrate to leftist groups in Peru that sought change through the current government the viability of radical revolution. The MRTA also aimed to provide an alternative to another militant group, the Shining Path, which placed them in direct competition. The group was led by Víctor Polay Campos until he was sentenced to 32 years&#x27; imprisonment in 1992 and by Néstor Cerpa Cartolini (&quot;Comrade Evaristo&quot;) until his death in 1997.

The MRTA took its name in homage to Túpac Amaru II, an 18th-century rebel leader who was himself named after his claimed ancestor Túpac Amaru, the last indigenous leader of the Inca people. The MRTA was designated as a terrorist organization by the Peruvian government, the US Department of State, and the European Parliament but was later removed from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations on 8 October 2001.

At the height of its strength, the movement had several hundred active members. Its stated goals were to establish a socialist state and rid the country of all imperialist elements.

== Ideology ==
The ideology of the MRTA is informed by both Peruvian nationalism and Marxism-Leninism. The MRTA takes its name from Sapa Inca Tupac Amaru, the last Inca emperor who led a failed rebellion against the Spanish colonial government and was executed in 1572. One of his descendants, Jose Gabriel Concorcanqui, took the name Tupac Amaru II and led another popular revolt against the Spanish (1780–1782). The MRTA considered itself the vanguard of ideas that already had popular support among oppressed groups, much like the indigenous leader. In their official statements, the MRTA drew a connection to the anti-colonial struggle against the Spanish to the twentieth century, arguing that Peru was still a subordinate economy to the west especially the United States. The MRTA argues that globalization is the mechanism of neo-colonialism, even that there is no real difference. The MRTA sees the IMF and World Bank as important instruments of neo-colonialism, and argues that the policies enforced by these organizations on Peru have caused unemployment and stalled development. In their first radio transmission, the MRTA said, &quot;the war which we begin today is a continuation of the open and clandestine war we Peruvians have waged against foreign and internal oppressors (for centuries).&quot; Drawing upon the works of Jose Carlos Mariategui&#x27;s &quot;Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality&quot;, the MRTA combines an appreciation for Peru&#x27;s indigenous history with the works of Karl Marx. Peruvian Marxists differ from traditional Marxists in a few ways. Notably, the Peruvian Marxist tradition holds that non-industrial workers could become politically conscious and begin a popular uprising, a notion dismissed by European Marxists in Mariategui&#x27;s time. Peruvian Marxists are less concerned with achieving the key precursors of traditional Marxist revolutions, and instead focus on the daily experiences of Peruvians. Revolution, they argue, is the only way to improve the conditions of the Peruvian people.

Peruvian Marxists also valorize Indigenous societies for their communal organization, which is seen as a precursor to socialism. Effectively, Peruvian Marxists equate the establishment of a socialist state in Peru with a return of an Indigenous state, which is considered more just and representative of Peruvian peoples and interests.

In order to achieve their vision, the MRTA declared the necessity of forgoing legal reform in favor of violent revolution. Accordingly, the MRTA aimed to escalate preexisting conflicts and create new ones to demonstrate the feasibility of revolution to a critical mass of Peruvians. Conflict would further deteriorate conditions in Peru, hopefully leading to a transition from a pre-revolutionary state to revolutionary state. The MRTA believed that political organization would be important to a successful revolution, but criticized preexisting leftist groups as naive for believing in a peaceful reform movement. The MRTA believes that &quot;reformism&quot; in general has stalled the progress towards global socialist revolution by preventing the rise of class consciousness.

The MRTA simultaneously preached Peruvian nationalism while arguing they were part of a larger Latin American effort to remove North American interference on the continent. The prominence of Peru&#x27;s Indigenous past in the MRTA&#x27;s rhetoric meant they never aspired to fully merge with a global movement, only that they wished to aid like-minded allies.

==Origins==
The MRTA formed between 1980 and 1982 with merging of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Marxist–Leninist) (PSR-ML) and the militant faction of the Revolutionary Left Movement, &quot;MIR El Militante&quot; (MIR-EM). The former gathered several ex-members of the Peruvian armed forces that participated in the leftist government of Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968–1975), and the latter represented a subdivision of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a Castroist guerrilla faction which was defeated in 1965.
The MRTA attempted to ally with other leftist organizations following the first democratic elections in Peru after a military government period (1968–1980). in the Period of 1982–1984, the MRTA continued to organize its military and political structures internally.

The MRTA maintained an alliance with MIR until 1987.

==Operations==
The first action by the MRTA occurred on 31 May 1982, when five of its members, including Victor Polay Campos and Jorge Talledo Feria (members of the Central Committee) robbed a bank in La Victoria, Lima. During the hold up, Talledo was killed by friendly fire.

On the midnight of 28 September 1984, members of the MRTA fired on the United States Embassy, causing damage but no casualties. The MRTA members were disguised as police, and fled after receiving returning fire from Peruvian guards. The MRTA claimed responsibility for the attack in a message sent to the United States embassy. The group was also linked to further attacks to the Embassy premises in late 1985, April 1986 (protesting US&#x27; Operation Eldorado Canyon) and in February 1990, as well as to a series of attacks to USIS Binational Centers.
Peru&#x27;s counterterrorist program diminished the group&#x27;s ability to carry out guerrilla attacks, and the MRTA suffered from infighting as well as violent clashes with Maoist rival Shining Path, the imprisonment or deaths of senior leaders, and loss of leftist support. The MRTA&#x27;s attempt to expand in to rural areas put them in conflict with the Shining Path, where they failed to compete with the more radical group. Shining Path&#x27;s strength in the countryside forced the MRTA to largely remain in their urban and middle-class base.

On 6 July 1992, MRTA fighters staged a raid on the town of Jaen, Peru, a jungle town located in the northern department of Cajamarca. Two policemen including, Eladio Garcia Tello, responded to the calls for help. After an intense shootout, the guerrillas were driven out of the town. Eladio Garcia Tello perished, after a bullet to the chest.

MRTA&#x27;s last major action resulted in the 1997 Japanese embassy hostage crisis. In December 1996, 14 MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador&#x27;s residence in Lima, holding 72 hostages for more than four months. Under orders from then-President Alberto Fujimori, armed forces stormed the residence in April 1997, rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all 14 MRTA militants. Fujimori was publicly acclaimed for the decisive action, but the affair was later tainted by subsequent revelations that at least three, and perhaps as many as eight, of the MRTistas were summarily executed after they surrendered. The Japanese embassy hostage crisis marked the end of MRTA as any threat to the Peruvian state and effectively dissolved the group.

In 2001, several MRTA members remained imprisoned in Bolivia.

==Trials and convictions==
In September 2003, four Chilean defendants, including Jaime Castillo Petruzzi, were retried and convicted of membership in the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and participation in an attack on the Peruvian North American Cultural Institute and a kidnapping-murder in 1993.

On 22 March 2006, Víctor Polay, the guerrilla leader of the MRTA, was found guilty by a Peruvian court on nearly 30 crimes committed during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In a case that attracted international attention, Lori Berenson, a former MIT student and U.S. socialist activist living in Lima, was arrested on 30 November 1995, by the police and accused of collaborating with the MRTA. She was subsequently sentenced by a military court to life imprisonment (later reduced to 20 years by a civilian court).

==Truth and Reconciliation Commission==
Peru&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission determined that the group was responsible for 1.5% of the deaths investigated. In its final findings published in 2003, the Commission observed:

:Unlike Shining Path, and like other armed Latin American organizations with which it maintained ties, the MRTA claimed responsibility for its actions, its members used uniforms or other identifiers to differentiate themselves from the civilian population, it abstained from attacking the unarmed population and at some points showed signs of being open to peace negotiations. Nevertheless, MRTA also engaged in criminal acts; it resorted to assassinations, such as in the case of General Enrique López Albújar, the taking of hostages and the systematic practice of kidnapping, all crimes that violate not only personal liberty but the international humanitarian law that the MRTA claimed to respect.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission goes on to note one of the MRTA&#x27;s goals was to legitimize politically motivated violence in Peru. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission both condemns this justification of violence, and argues it contributed to the ability of other organizations to inflict greater violence then they might have otherwise. Further, the existence of groups like MRTA, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission argues, legitimized the authoritarian, 
militaristic, and repressive policies of the government of Alberto Fujimori.

<doc id="67025" wikidata="Q154770" url="?curid=67025" title="Arnold Schoenberg">
<text>Arnold Schoenberg or Schönberg (13 September 187413 July 1951) was an Austrian and American composer, music theorist, teacher and writer. He was among the first modernists who transformed the practice of harmony in 20th-century classical music, and a central element of his music was its use of motives as a means of coherence. He propounded concepts like developing variation, the emancipation of the dissonance, and the &quot;unity of musical space&quot;.

Schoenberg&#x27;s early works, like &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot; (1899), represented a Brahmsian–Wagnerian synthesis on which he built. Mentoring Anton Webern and Alban Berg, he became the central figure of the Second Viennese School. They consorted with visual artists, published in &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot;, and wrote atonal, expressionist music, attracting fame and stirring debate. In his String Quartet No. 2 (1907–1908), &quot;Erwartung&quot; (1909), and &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; (1912), Schoenberg visited extremes of emotion; in self-portraits he emphasized his intense gaze. While working on &quot;Die Jakobsleiter&quot; (from 1914) and &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; (from 1923), Schoenberg confronted popular antisemitism by returning to Judaism and substantially developed his twelve-tone technique. He systematically interrelated all notes of the chromatic scale in his twelve-tone music, often exploiting combinatorial hexachords and sometimes admitting tonal elements.

Schoenberg resigned from the Prussian Academy of Arts (1926–1933), emigrating as the Nazis took power; they banned his (and his students&#x27;) music, labeling it &quot;degenerate&quot;. He taught in the US, including at the University of California, Los Angeles (1936–1944), where facilities are named in his honor. He explored writing film music (as he had done idiosyncratically in &quot;Begleitungsmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene&quot;, 1929–1930) and wrote more tonal music, completing his Chamber Symphony No. 2 in 1939. With citizenship (1941) and US entry into World War II, he satirized fascist tyrants in &quot;Ode to Napoleon&quot; (1942, after Byron), deploying Beethoven&#x27;s fate motif and the . Post-war Vienna beckoned with honorary citizenship, but Schoenberg was ill as depicted in his String Trio (1946). As the world learned of the Holocaust, he memorialized its victims in &quot;A Survivor from Warsaw&quot; (1947). The Israel Conservatory and Academy of Music elected him honorary president (1951).

His innovative music was among the most influential and polemicized of 20th-century classical music. At least three generations of composers extended its somewhat formal principles. His aesthetic and music-historical views influenced musicologists Theodor W. Adorno and Carl Dahlhaus. The Arnold Schönberg Center collects his archival legacy.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Arnold Schoenberg was born into a lower middle-class Jewish family in the Leopoldstadt district (in earlier times a Jewish ghetto) of Vienna, at Obere Donaustraße 5. His father Samuel, a native of Szécsény, Hungary, later moved to Pozsony (Pressburg, at that time part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now Bratislava, Slovakia) and then to Vienna, was a shoe-shopkeeper, and his mother Pauline Schoenberg (née Nachod), a native of Prague, was a piano teacher. Arnold was largely self-taught. He took only counterpoint lessons with the composer Alexander Zemlinsky, who was to become his first brother-in-law.

In his twenties, Schoenberg earned a living by orchestrating operettas, while composing his own works, such as the string sextet &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot; (&quot;Transfigured Night&quot;) (1899). He later made an orchestral version of this, which became one of his most popular pieces. Both Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler recognized Schoenberg&#x27;s significance as a composer; Strauss when he encountered Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, and Mahler after hearing several of Schoenberg&#x27;s early works.

Strauss turned to a more conservative idiom in his own work after 1909, and at that point dismissed Schoenberg. Mahler adopted him as a protégé and continued to support him, even after Schoenberg&#x27;s style reached a point Mahler could no longer understand. Mahler worried about who would look after him after his death. Schoenberg, who had initially despised and mocked Mahler&#x27;s music, was converted by the &quot;thunderbolt&quot; of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Third Symphony&quot;, which he considered a work of genius. Afterward he &quot;spoke of Mahler as a saint&quot;.

In 1898 Schoenberg converted to Christianity in the Lutheran church. According to MacDonald (2008, 93) this was partly to strengthen his attachment to Western European cultural traditions, and partly as a means of self-defence &quot;in a time of resurgent anti-Semitism&quot;. In 1933, after long meditation, he returned to Judaism, because he realised that &quot;his racial and religious heritage was inescapable&quot;, and to take up an unmistakable position on the side opposing Nazism. He would self-identify as a member of the Jewish religion later in life.

===1901–1914: experimenting in atonality===

In October 1901, Schoenberg married Mathilde Zemlinsky, the sister of the conductor and composer Alexander von Zemlinsky, with whom Schoenberg had been studying since about 1894. Schoenberg and Mathilde had two children, Gertrud (1902–1947) and Georg (1906–1974). Gertrud would marry Schoenberg&#x27;s pupil in 1921.

During the summer of 1908, Schoenberg&#x27;s wife Mathilde left him for several months for a young Austrian painter, Richard Gerstl (who committed suicide in that November after Mathilde returned to her marriage). This period marked a distinct change in Schoenberg&#x27;s work. It was during the absence of his wife that he composed &quot;You lean against a silver-willow&quot; (), the thirteenth song in the cycle &quot;Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten&quot;, Op. 15, based on the collection of the same name by the German mystical poet Stefan George. This was the first composition without any reference at all to a key.

Also in this year, Schoenberg completed one of his most revolutionary compositions, the String Quartet No. 2. The first two movements, though chromatic in color, use traditional key signatures. The final two movements, again using poetry by George, incorporate a soprano vocal line, breaking with previous string-quartet practice, and daringly weaken the links with traditional tonality. Both movements end on tonic chords, and the work is not fully non-tonal.

During the summer of 1910, Schoenberg wrote his &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; (&quot;Theory of Harmony&quot;, Schoenberg 1922), which remains one of the most influential music-theory books. From about 1911, Schoenberg belonged to a circle of artists and intellectuals who included Lene Schneider-Kainer, Franz Werfel, Herwarth Walden, and Else Lasker-Schüler.

In 1910 he met Edward Clark, an English music journalist then working in Germany. Clark became his sole English student, and in his later capacity as a producer for the BBC he was responsible for introducing many of Schoenberg&#x27;s works, and Schoenberg himself, to Britain (as well as Webern, Berg and others).

Another of his most important works from this atonal or pantonal period is the highly influential &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;, Op. 21, of 1912, a novel cycle of expressionist songs set to a German translation of poems by the Belgian-French poet Albert Giraud. Utilizing the technique of &quot;Sprechstimme&quot;, or melodramatically spoken recitation, the work pairs a female vocalist with a small ensemble of five musicians. The ensemble, which is now commonly referred to as the Pierrot ensemble, consists of flute (doubling on piccolo), clarinet (doubling on bass clarinet), violin (doubling on viola), violoncello, speaker, and piano.

, director of the Vienna Conservatory from 1907, wanted a break from the stale environment personified for him by Robert Fuchs and Hermann Graedener. Having considered many candidates, he offered teaching positions to Schoenberg and Franz Schreker in 1912. At the time Schoenberg lived in Berlin. He was not completely cut off from the Vienna Conservatory, having taught a private theory course a year earlier. He seriously considered the offer, but he declined. Writing afterward to Alban Berg, he cited his &quot;aversion to Vienna&quot; as the main reason for his decision, while contemplating that it might have been the wrong one financially, but having made it he felt content. A couple of months later he wrote to Schreker suggesting that it might have been a bad idea for him as well to accept the teaching position.

===World War I===
World War I brought a crisis in his development. Military service disrupted his life when at the age of 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped &quot;beginnings&quot;.
On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was &quot;this notorious Schoenberg, then&quot;; Schoenberg replied: &quot;Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so I let it be me&quot;. According to Norman Lebrecht, this is a reference to Schoenberg&#x27;s apparent &quot;destiny&quot; as the &quot;Emancipator of Dissonance&quot;.

Schoenberg drew comparisons between Germany&#x27;s assault on France and his assault on decadent bourgeois artistic values. In August 1914, while denouncing the music of Bizet, Stravinsky, and Ravel, he wrote: &quot;Now comes the reckoning! Now we will throw these mediocre kitschmongers into slavery, and teach them to venerate the German spirit and to worship the German God&quot;. Alex Ross described this as an &quot;act of war psychosis&quot;.

The deteriorating relation between contemporary composers and the public led him to found the Society for Private Musical Performances ( in German) in Vienna in 1918. He sought to provide a forum in which modern musical compositions could be carefully prepared and rehearsed, and properly performed under conditions protected from the dictates of fashion and pressures of commerce. 

From its inception until its dissolution amid Austrian hyperinflation, the Society presented 353 performances to paying members, sometimes weekly. During the first year and a half, Schoenberg did not let any of his own works be performed. Instead, audiences at the Society&#x27;s concerts heard difficult contemporary compositions by Scriabin, Debussy, Mahler, Webern, Berg, Reger, and other leading figures of early 20th-century music.

===Development of the twelve-tone method===

Later, Schoenberg was to develop the most influential version of the dodecaphonic (also known as twelve-tone) method of composition, which in French and English was given the alternative name serialism by René Leibowitz and Humphrey Searle in 1947. This technique was taken up by many of his students, who constituted the so-called Second Viennese School. They included Anton Webern, Alban Berg, and Hanns Eisler, all of whom were profoundly influenced by Schoenberg. He published a number of books, ranging from his famous &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; (&quot;Theory of Harmony&quot;) to &quot;Fundamentals of Musical Composition&quot;, many of which are still in print and used by musicians and developing composers.

Schoenberg viewed his development as a natural progression, and he did not deprecate his earlier works when he ventured into serialism. In 1923 he wrote to the Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart:

For the present, it matters more to me if people understand my older works ... They are the natural forerunners of my later works, and only those who understand and comprehend these will be able to gain an understanding of the later works that goes beyond a fashionable bare minimum. I do not attach so much importance to being a musical bogey-man as to being a natural continuer of properly-understood good old tradition!

His first wife died in October 1923, and in August of the next year Schoenberg married Gertrud Kolisch (1898–1967), sister of his pupil, the violinist Rudolf Kolisch. They had three children: Nuria Dorothea (born 1932), Ronald Rudolf (born 1937), and Lawrence Adam (born 1941). Gertrude Kolisch Schoenberg wrote the libretto for Schoenberg&#x27;s one-act opera &quot;Von heute auf morgen&quot; under the pseudonym Max Blonda. At her request Schoenberg&#x27;s (ultimately unfinished) piece, &quot;Die Jakobsleiter&quot; was prepared for performance by Schoenberg&#x27;s student Winfried Zillig. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1951 she founded Belmont Music Publishers devoted to the publication of his works. Arnold used the notes G and E (German: Es, i.e., &quot;S&quot;) for &quot;Gertrud Schoenberg&quot;, in the &quot;Suite&quot;, for septet, Op. 29 (1925). (see musical cryptogram).

Following the death in 1924 of composer Ferruccio Busoni, who had served as Director of a Master Class in Composition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, Schoenberg was appointed to this post the next year, but because of health problems was unable to take up his post until 1926. Among his notable students during this period were the composers Robert Gerhard, Nikos Skalkottas, and Josef Rufer.

Along with his twelve-tone works, 1930 marks Schoenberg&#x27;s return to tonality, with numbers 4 and 6 of the Six Pieces for Male Chorus Op. 35, the other pieces being dodecaphonic.

=== Nazi regime and emigration to the United States===
Schoenberg continued in his post until the Nazis seized power in 1933. While on vacation in France, he was warned that returning to Germany would be dangerous. Schoenberg formally reclaimed membership in the Jewish religion at a Paris synagogue, then emigrated to the United States with his family. He subsequently gave brief consideration to moving again, either to England or the Soviet Union.

His first teaching position in the United States was at the Malkin Conservatory (Boston University). He moved to Los Angeles, where he taught at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles, both of which later named a music building on their respective campuses Schoenberg Hall. He was appointed visiting professor at UCLA in 1935 on the recommendation of Otto Klemperer, music director and conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra; and the next year was promoted to professor at a salary of $5,100 per year, which enabled him in either May 1936 or 1937 to buy a Spanish Revival house at 116 North Rockingham in Brentwood Park, near the UCLA campus, for $18,000. This address was directly across the street from Shirley Temple&#x27;s house, and there he befriended fellow composer (and tennis partner) George Gershwin. The Schoenbergs were able to employ domestic help and began holding Sunday afternoon gatherings that were known for excellent coffee and Viennese pastries. Frequent guests included Otto Klemperer (who studied composition privately with Schoenberg beginning in April 1936), Edgard Varèse, Joseph Achron, Louis Gruenberg, Ernst Toch, and, on occasion, well-known actors such as Harpo Marx and Peter Lorre. Composers Leonard Rosenman and George Tremblay and the Hollywood orchestrator Edward B. Powell studied with Schoenberg at this time.

After his move to the United States, where he arrived on 31 October 1933, the composer used the alternative spelling of his surname &quot;Schoenberg&quot;, rather than &quot;Schönberg&quot;, in what he called &quot;deference to American practice&quot;, though according to one writer he first made the change a year earlier.

He lived there the rest of his life, but at first he was not settled. In 1934, he applied for a teacher of harmony and theory position at the New South Wales State Conservatorium in Sydney. Vincent Plush discovered his application in the 1970s. It bore two notes in different handwriting: &quot;Jewish&quot; in one and &quot;Modernist ideas and dangerous tendencies&quot; in another marked E.B. (Edgar Bainton). Schoenberg also explored the idea of emigrating to New Zealand. His secretary and student Richard Hoffmann, the nephew of Schoenberg&#x27;s mother-in-law Henriette Kolisch, lived in New Zealand in 1935–1947. Schoenberg had since childhood been fascinated with islands and with New Zealand in particular, possibly because of its postage stamps. He abandoned the idea of moving to New Zealand after his health began to decline in 1944.

During this final period, he composed several notable works, including the difficult Violin Concerto, Op. 36 (1934/36), the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot;, Op. 39, for chorus and orchestra (1938), the &quot;Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte&quot;, Op. 41 (1942), the haunting Piano Concerto, Op. 42 (1942), and his memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, &quot;A Survivor from Warsaw&quot;, Op. 46 (1947). He was unable to complete his opera &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; (1932/33), which was one of the first works of its genre written completely using dodecaphonic composition. Along with twelve-tone music, Schoenberg also returned to tonality with works during his last period, like the Suite for Strings in G major (1935), the Chamber Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939), the Variations on a Recitative in D minor, Op. 40 (1941). During this period his notable students included John Cage and Lou Harrison.

In 1941, he became a citizen of the United States. He was the first composer in residence at the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory in Montecito, California.

=== Superstition and death ===

Schoenberg&#x27;s superstitious nature may have triggered his death. The composer had triskaidekaphobia, and according to friend Katia Mann, he feared he would die during a year that was a multiple of 13. This possibly began in 1908 with the composition of the thirteenth song of the song cycle &quot;Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten&quot; Op. 15. He dreaded his sixty-fifth birthday in 1939 so much that a friend asked the composer and astrologer Dane Rudhyar to prepare Schoenberg&#x27;s horoscope. Rudhyar did this and told Schoenberg that the year was dangerous, but not fatal.

But in 1950, on his 76th birthday, an astrologer wrote Schoenberg a note warning him that the year was a critical one: 7 + 6 = 13. This stunned and depressed the composer, for up to that point he had only been wary of multiples of 13 and never considered adding the digits of his age. He died on Friday, 13 July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious, and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45 pm, 15 minutes before midnight. In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, &quot;About a quarter to twelve I looked at the clock and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then the worst is over. Then the doctor called me. Arnold&#x27;s throat rattled twice, his heart gave a powerful beat and that was the end&quot;.

Schoenberg&#x27;s ashes were later interred at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna on 6 June 1974.

==Music==


Schoenberg&#x27;s significant compositions in the repertory of modern art music extend over a period of more than 50 years. Traditionally they are divided into three periods though this division is arguably arbitrary as the music in each of these periods is considerably varied. The idea that his twelve-tone period &quot;represents a stylistically unified body of works is simply not supported by the musical evidence&quot;, and important musical characteristics—especially those related to motivic development—transcend these boundaries completely.

The first of these periods, 1894–1907, is identified in the legacy of the high-Romantic composers of the late nineteenth century, as well as with expressionist movements in poetry and art. The second, 1908–1922, is typified by the abandonment of key centers, a move often described (though not by Schoenberg) as &quot;free atonality&quot;. The third, from 1923 onward, commences with Schoenberg&#x27;s invention of dodecaphonic, or &quot;twelve-tone&quot; compositional method. Schoenberg&#x27;s best-known students, Hanns Eisler, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern, followed Schoenberg faithfully through each of these intellectual and aesthetic transitions, though not without considerable experimentation and variety of approach.

===First period: Late Romanticism===
Beginning with songs and string quartets written around the turn of the century, Schoenberg&#x27;s concerns as a composer positioned him uniquely among his peers, in that his procedures exhibited characteristics of both Brahms and Wagner, who for most contemporary listeners, were considered polar opposites, representing mutually exclusive directions in the legacy of German music. Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Zwei Gesänge&quot;, Op. 1, first performed in 1903, set two contemporary poems to expressive music bordering the limits of the Lied genre. Schoenberg&#x27;s Six Songs, Op. 3 (1899–1903), for example, exhibit a conservative clarity of tonal organization typical of Brahms and Mahler, reflecting an interest in balanced phrases and an undisturbed hierarchy of key relationships. However, the songs also explore unusually bold incidental chromaticism and seem to aspire to a Wagnerian &quot;representational&quot; approach to motivic identity.

The synthesis of these approaches reaches an apex in his &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot;, Op. 4 (1899), a programmatic work for string sextet that develops several distinctive &quot;leitmotif&quot;-like themes, each one eclipsing and subordinating the last. The only motivic elements that persist throughout the work are those that are perpetually dissolved, varied, and re-combined, in a technique, identified primarily in Brahms&#x27;s music, that Schoenberg called &quot;developing variation&quot;. Schoenberg&#x27;s procedures in the work are organized in two ways simultaneously; at once suggesting a Wagnerian narrative of motivic ideas, as well as a Brahmsian approach to motivic development and tonal cohesion.

Citing Berg and Webern on Schoenberg&#x27;s String Quartet No. 1, Op. 7 (1904–1905), Joseph N. Straus emphasized the importance of &quot;motivic coherence&quot; in the three&#x27;s more generally. &quot;Every smallest turn of phrase, even accompanimental figuration is significant&quot;, Berg asserted, parenthetically praising Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;excess unheard-of since Bach&quot;. Webern marveled at how &quot;Schoenberg creates an accompaniment figure from a motivic particle&quot;, proclaiming &quot;everything is thematic! There is ... not a single note ... that does not have a thematic basis.&quot;

===Second period: Free atonality===
The urgency of musical constructions lacking in tonal centers or traditional dissonance-consonance relationships can be traced as far back as Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9 (1906). This work is remarkable for its tonal development of whole-tone and quartal harmony, and its initiation of dynamic and unusual ensemble relationships, involving dramatic interruption and unpredictable instrumental allegiances. Many of these features would typify the timbre-oriented chamber-music aesthetic of the coming century.

Schoenberg&#x27;s music from 1908 onward experiments in a variety of ways with the absence of traditional keys or tonal centers. His first explicitly atonal piece was the second string quartet, Op. 10, with soprano. The last movement of this piece has no key signature, marking Schoenberg&#x27;s formal divorce from diatonic harmonies. Other important works of the era include his song cycle &quot;Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten&quot;, Op. 15 (1908–1909), his Five Orchestral Pieces, Op. 16 (1909), the influential &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;, Op. 21 (1912), as well as his dramatic &quot;Erwartung&quot;, Op. 17 (1909). Surveying Schoenberg&#x27;s Opp. 10, 15–16, and 19, Webern argued: &quot;It creates entirely new expressive values; therefore it also needs new means of expression. Content and form cannot be separated.&quot;

Analysts (most prominently Allen Forte) so emphasized motivic shapes in Schoenberg&#x27;s (and Berg&#x27;s and Webern&#x27;s) &quot;free atonal&quot; music that Benjamin Boretz and William Benjamin suggested referring to it as &quot;motivic&quot; music. Schoenberg himself described his use of a motivic unit &quot;varied and developed in manifold ways&quot; in Four Orchestral Songs, Op. 22 (1913–1916), writing that he was &quot;in the preliminary stages of a procedure ... which allows for a motif to be a constant basis&quot;. Straus considered that the designation &quot;&#x27;motivic&#x27; music&quot; might apply &quot;in a modified way&quot; to twelve-tone music more generally.

===Third period: Twelve-tone and tonal works===
In the aftermath of World War I, Schoenberg sought an ordering principle that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. Thus he arrived at his &quot;method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another&quot;. All twelve pitches of the octave (usually unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. Schoenberg regarded the twelve-tone system as the equivalent in music of Albert Einstein&#x27;s discoveries in physics. Schoenberg told Josef Rufer, &quot;I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years&quot;.

Among Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone works are the &quot;Variations for Orchestra&quot;, Op. 31 (1928); &quot;Begleitungsmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene&quot;, Op. 34 (1930); Piano Pieces, Opp. 33a &amp; b (1931), and the Piano Concerto, Op. 42 (1942). Contrary to its reputation for doctrinaire strictness, Schoenberg&#x27;s technique varied according to the musical demands of each composition. Thus the musical structure of his unfinished opera &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; is fundamentally different from that of his Phantasy for Violin and Piano, Op. 47 (1949).

Ten features of Schoenberg&#x27;s mature twelve-tone practice are generally characteristic, interdependent, and interactive according to Ethan Haimo:
# Hexachordal inversional combinatoriality
# Aggregates
# Linear set presentation
# Partitioning
# Isomorphic partitioning
# Invariants
# Hexachordal levels
# Harmony, &quot;consistent with and derived from the properties of the referential set&quot;
# Metre, established through &quot;pitch-relational characteristics&quot;
# Multidimensional set presentations

==Reception and legacy==
===First works===
After some early difficulties, Schoenberg began to win public acceptance with works such as the tone poem &quot;Pelleas und Melisande&quot; at a Berlin performance in 1907. At the Vienna première of the &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; in 1913, he received an ovation that lasted a quarter of an hour and culminated with Schoenberg&#x27;s being presented with a laurel crown.

Nonetheless, much of his work was not well received. His Chamber Symphony No. 1 premièred unremarkably in 1907. However, when it was played again in the &quot;Skandalkonzert&quot; on 31 March 1913, (which also included works by Berg, Webern and Zemlinsky), &quot;one could hear the shrill sound of door keys among the violent clapping, and in the second gallery the first fight of the evening began.&quot; Later in the concert, during a performance of the &quot;Altenberg Lieder&quot; by Berg, fighting broke out after Schoenberg interrupted the performance to threaten removal by the police of any troublemakers.

===Twelve-tone period===
According to Ethan Haimo, the general understanding of Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone work has been difficult to achieve because of the &quot;truly revolutionary nature&quot; of his new system, misinformation disseminated by some early writers about the system&#x27;s &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;exceptions&quot; that bear &quot;little relation to the most significant features of Schoenberg&#x27;s music&quot;, the composer&#x27;s secretiveness, and the widespread unavailability of his sketches and manuscripts until the late 1970s. During his life, Schoenberg was &quot;subjected to a range of criticism and abuse that is shocking even in hindsight&quot;.
Schoenberg criticized Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s new neoclassical trend in the poem &quot;Vielseitigkeit&quot; (in which he derogates neoclassicism, and obliquely refers to Stravinsky as &quot;Der kleine Modernsky&quot;), which he used as text for the second of his &quot;Drei Satiren&quot;, Op. 28. The third of the &quot;Drei Satiren&quot;, &quot;Der neue Klassizismus&quot;, also takes aim at the neoclassical trend in general. 

Schoenberg&#x27;s serial technique of composition with twelve notes became one of the most central and polemical issues among American and European musicians during the mid- to late-twentieth century. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing to the present day, composers such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono and Milton Babbitt have extended Schoenberg&#x27;s legacy in increasingly radical directions. The major cities of the United States (e.g., Los Angeles, New York, and Boston) have had historically significant performances of Schoenberg&#x27;s music, with advocates such as Babbitt in New York and the Franco-American conductor-pianist Jacques-Louis Monod. Schoenberg&#x27;s students have been influential teachers at major American universities: Leonard Stein at USC, UCLA and CalArts; Richard Hoffmann at Oberlin; Patricia Carpenter at Columbia; and Leon Kirchner and Earl Kim at Harvard. Musicians associated with Schoenberg have had a profound influence on contemporary music performance practice in the US (e.g., Louis Krasner, Eugene Lehner and Rudolf Kolisch at the New England Conservatory of Music; Eduard Steuermann and Felix Galimir at the Juilliard School). In Europe, the work of Hans Keller, , and René Leibowitz has had a measurable influence in spreading Schoenberg&#x27;s musical legacy outside of Germany and Austria. His pupil and assistant Max Deutsch, who later became a professor of music, was also a conductor. who made a recording of three &quot;master works&quot; Schoenberg with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, released posthumously in late 2013. This recording includes short lectures by Deutsch on each of the pieces.

===Criticism===
In the 1920s, Ernst Krenek criticized a certain unnamed brand of contemporary music (presumably Schoenberg and his disciples) as &quot;the self-gratification of an individual who sits in his studio and invents rules according to which he then writes down his notes&quot;. Schoenberg took offense at this remark and answered that Krenek &quot;wishes for only whores as listeners&quot;.

Allen Shawn has noted that, given Schoenberg&#x27;s living circumstances, his work is usually &quot;defended&quot; rather than listened to, and that it is difficult to experience it &quot;apart&quot; from the ideology that surrounds it. Richard Taruskin asserted that Schoenberg committed what he terms a &quot;poietic fallacy&quot;, the conviction that what matters most (or all that matters) in a work of art is the making of it, the maker&#x27;s input, and that the listener&#x27;s pleasure must not be the composer&#x27;s primary objective. Taruskin also criticizes the ideas of measuring Schoenberg&#x27;s value as a composer in terms of his influence on other artists, the overrating of technical innovation, and the restriction of criticism to matters of structure and craft while derogating other approaches as vulgarian.

===Relationship with the general public===

Writing in 1977, Christopher Small observed, &quot;Many music lovers, even today, find difficulty with Schoenberg&#x27;s music&quot;. Small wrote his short biography a quarter of a century after the composer&#x27;s death. According to Nicholas Cook, writing some twenty years after Small, Schoenberg had thought that this lack of comprehension
Ben Earle (2003) found that Schoenberg, while revered by experts and taught to &quot;generations of students&quot; on degree courses, remained unloved by the public. Despite more than forty years of advocacy and the production of &quot;books devoted to the explanation of this difficult repertory to non-specialist audiences&quot;, it would seem that in particular, &quot;British attempts to popularize music of this kind  ... can now safely be said to have failed&quot;.

In his 2018 biography of Schoenberg&#x27;s near contemporary and similarly pioneering composer, Debussy, Stephen Walsh takes issue with the idea that it is not possible &quot;for a creative artist to be both radical and popular&quot;. Walsh concludes, &quot;Schoenberg may be the first &#x27;great&#x27; composer in modern history whose music has not entered the repertoire almost a century and a half after his birth&quot;.

===Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;===
Adrian Leverkühn, the protagonist of Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1947), is a composer whose use of twelve-tone technique parallels the innovations of Arnold Schoenberg. Leverkühn, who may be based on Nietzsche, sells his soul to the Devil and is rewarded with superhuman talent. Schoenberg was unhappy about this and initiated an exchange of letters with Mann following the novel&#x27;s publication. Writer Sean O&#x27;Brien comments that &quot;written in the shadow of Hitler, &quot;Doktor Faustus&quot; observes the rise of Nazism, but its relationship to political history is oblique&quot;. Thomas Mann was always primarily interested in classical music, which also plays a role in many of his works. He sought advice from Theodor W. Adorno on the technical compositional details of Schoenberg&#x27;s new music, who revised the chapters accordingly.

==Personality and extramusical interests==

Schoenberg was a painter of considerable ability, whose works were considered good enough to exhibit alongside those of Franz Marc and Wassily Kandinsky. as fellow members of the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter. From about 1908 to 1910, he would execute approximately two-thirds of a total oeuvre comprising about sixty-five oils.

He was interested in Hopalong Cassidy films, which Paul Buhle and David Wagner (2002, v–vii) attribute to the films&#x27; left-wing screenwriters—a rather odd claim in light of Schoenberg&#x27;s statement that he was a &quot;bourgeois&quot; turned monarchist.

<doc id="67027" wikidata="Q296269" url="?curid=67027" title="Túpac Amaru">
<text>Tupaq Amaru or Thupa Amaru (14 April 154524 September 1572) (first name also spelled Túpac, Tupac, Topa, Tupaq, Thupaq, Thupa, last name also spelled Amaro instead of Amaru) was the last Sapa Inca of the Neo-Inca State, the final remaining independent part of the Inca Empire. He was executed by the Spanish following a months-long pursuit after the fall of the Neo-Inca State.

His name is derived from the Quechua words &quot;thupaq&quot;, meaning &quot;royal&quot; or &quot;shining&quot; and &quot;amaru&quot;, which can either mean &quot;snake&quot; or refer to the snake-like being from Andean mythology.

== Accession ==
Following the Spanish conquest of Peru in the 1530s, a few members of the royal family established the small independent Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, which was located in the relatively inaccessible Upper Amazon to the northeast of Cusco. The founder of this state was Manco Inca Yupanqui (also known as Manco Cápac II), who had initially allied himself with the Spanish, then led an unsuccessful war against them before establishing himself in Vilcabamba in 1540. After a Spanish attack in 1544 in which Manco Inca Yupanqui was killed, his son Sayri Tupac assumed the title of &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; (emperor, literally &quot;only Inca&quot;), before accepting Spanish authority in 1558, moving to Cuzco and dying (perhaps by poison) in 1561. He was succeeded in Vilcabamba by his brother Titu Cusi, who himself died in 1571. Túpac Amaru, another brother of the two preceding emperors, then succeeded to the title in Vilcabamba.

== Final war with and capture by Spanish ==
At this time, the Spanish were still unaware of the death of the previous &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; (Titu Cusi) and had routinely sent two ambassadors to continue ongoing negotiations being held with Titu Cusi. They were both killed on the border by an Inca captain.

Using the justification that the Incas had &quot;broken the inviolate law observed by all nations of the world regarding ambassadors&quot;, the new viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa, decided to attack and conquer Vilcabamba. He declared war on 14 April 1572. The first engagement of the war commenced in the Vilcabamba valley on 1 June. The Inca people attacked first with much spirit despite being only lightly armed. Again and again, they attempted to lift the siege held by the Spanish and their native allies but each time they were forced to retreat. On 24 June the Spanish entered Vilcabamba to find it deserted and the &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; gone. The city had been entirely destroyed and the last remnants of the Inca Empire, the Neo-Inca State now officially ceased to exist.

Túpac Amaru had left the previous day with a party of about 100 and headed west into the lowland forests. The group, which included his generals and family members, had then split up into smaller parties in an attempt to avoid capture.

Three groups of Spanish soldiers pursued them. One group captured Titu Cusi&#x27;s son and wife. A second returned with military prisoners along with gold, silver and other precious jewels. The third group returned with Túpac Amaru&#x27;s two brothers, other relatives and several of his generals. The &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; and his commander remained at large.

Following this, a group of forty hand-picked soldiers under Martín García Óñez de Loyola set out to pursue them. They followed the Masahuay river for 170 miles, where they found an Inca warehouse with quantities of gold and the Inca&#x27;s tableware. The Spanish captured a group of Chunco and compelled them to tell them what they had seen, and if they had seen the &quot;Sapa Inca&quot;. They reported that he had gone down river, by boat, to a place called Momorí. The Spaniards then constructed five rafts and pursued them.

At Momorí, they discovered that Tupac Amaru had escaped by land. They followed with the help of the Manarí, who advised which path the Inca had followed and reported that Túpac was slowed by his wife, who was about to give birth. After a fifty-mile march, they saw a campfire around nine o&#x27;clock at night. They found the &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; Túpac Amaru and his wife warming themselves. They assured them that no harm would come to them and secured their surrender. Túpac Amaru was arrested.

The captives were brought back to the ruins of Vilcabamba and together they were all marched into Cuzco on 21 September. The invaders also brought the mummified remains of Manco Cápac and Titu Cusi and a gold statue of Punchao, a representation of the Inca&#x27;s lineage containing the mortal remains of the hearts of the deceased Inca kings. These sacred items were then destroyed.

== Execution ==
The five captured Inca generals received a summary trial and were sentenced to death by hanging. Several had already died of torture or disease.

The trial of the &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; himself began a couple of days later. Túpac Amaru was convicted of the murder of the priests in Vilcabamba. Túpac Amaru was sentenced to be beheaded. It was reported in various sources in 1598 that numerous Catholic clerics, convinced of Túpac Amaru&#x27;s innocence, pleaded to no avail, on their knees, that the Inca be sent to Spain for a trial instead of being executed.

Many have argued that Viceroy Toledo, in executing a head of state recognized by the Spanish as an independent king, exceeded his authority and committed a crime within the political ideas of his own time. Other claims have been made to the contrary – that Túpac Amaru was in rebellion (his predecessors having allegedly accepted Spanish authority), that Toledo had tried peaceful means to settle differences, that three of his ambassadors to the Inca were murdered and that Túpac Amaru subsequently raised an army to resist the colonial army. The King of Spain, Philip II, disapproved of the execution.

An eyewitness report from the day recalls him riding a mule with hands tied behind his back and a rope around his neck. Other witnesses reported there were great crowds and the &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; was surrounded by hundreds of guards with lances. In front of the Cathedral of Santo Domingo in the central square of Cuzco a black-draped scaffold had been erected. Reportedly 10,000 to 15,000 witnesses were present.

Túpac Amaru mounted the scaffold accompanied by the Bishop of Cuzco. As he did, it was reported by the same witnesses that a &quot;multitude of Indians, who completely filled the square, saw that lamentable spectacle [and knew] that their lord and Inca was to die, they deafened the skies, making them reverberate with their cries and wailing.&quot;

As reported by eyewitnesses Baltasar de Ocampa and Friar Gabriel de Oviedo, Prior of the Dominicans at Cuzco, the &quot;Sapa Inca&quot; raised his hand to silence the crowds and his last words were: &quot;Ccollanan Pachacamac ricuy auccacunac yawarniy hichascancuta.&quot; (&quot;Pacha Kamaq, witness how my enemies shed my blood.&quot;)

== Descendants ==
Nearly forty years after the conquest of Peru began with the execution of Atahualpa, the conquest ended with the execution of his nephew. The Spanish Viceroy rounded up the royal descendants. Several dozen, including Túpac Amaru&#x27;s three-year-old son, were banished to Mexico, Chile, Panama and elsewhere. Some of them were allowed to return home.

Túpac Amaru&#x27;s memory lived on and would become personified in an important late eighteenth century insurgency that was rooted in aspirations toward a revival of Inca status vis-a-vis the Spanish administration. In 1780, José Gabriel Condorcanqui (Túpac Amaru II), who claimed to be a direct descendant of Túpac Amaru, led an indigenous uprising against continued Spanish presence in Peru alongside his wife Micaela Bastidas. Condorcanqui&#x27;s rebellion emerged in response to new Bourbon Reforms implemented by the Spanish crown, which included incremental increases in levels of taxation upon indigenous populations – such as the alcabala or sales tax. Túpac Amaru II&#x27;s rebellion was sparked when he (Condorcanqui) captured and killed the Spanish corregidor Antonio Arriaga in November 1780.

== Legacy ==
Historian El Inca Garcilaso De La Vega claimed that King Philip II disapproved of the public execution of Tupac Amaru. Tupac Amaru&#x27;s death in 1572 has generated great interest centuries after. 

Relatively little is known about Tupac Amaru, but this has not prevented his death from becoming a symbol of power to those in the region. Public figures such as Andean rebel leader Jose Gabriel Condorcanqui resonated with Tupac Amaru ideology, so much so that he changed his name to Tupac Amaru II. Despite Tupac Amaru&#x27;s short life and tragic death his legacy precedes him especially among the Peruvian community.

Primary school number 239 in Warsaw (Mirów), had been named in honor of Túpac Amaru, but it closed in 2001. Rapper Tupac Amaru Shakur was named after Túpac Amaru II.

<text>An umbrella or parasol is a folding canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs that is mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole. It is usually designed to protect a person against rain. The term &quot;umbrella&quot; is traditionally used when protecting oneself from rain, while &quot;parasol&quot; is used when protecting oneself from sunlight, though the terms continue to be used interchangeably. Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof, and some umbrellas are transparent. Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic. There are also combinations of parasol and umbrella that are called en-tout-cas (French for &quot;in any case&quot;).

Generally speaking, parasols and umbrellas are small, handheld, personal use items. Golf umbrellas are the biggest hand-portable umbrellas available. There are two types of umbrellas: completely collapsible umbrellas, which can be folded up into a small enough bag because of the supporting metal pole&#x27;s ability to retract, and non-collapsible umbrellas, which only have the canopy that can be folded up. Manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which open with a button press, can also be distinguished from one another.

Hand-held umbrellas have a type of handle which can be made from wood, a plastic cylinder or a bent &quot;crook&quot; handle (like the handle of a cane). Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality models sold at discount stores to expensive, finely made, designer-labeled models. Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach.

== Etymology ==

The word &#x27; is a combination of the Latin , and , meaning &#x27;sun&#x27;. (French) similarly consists of combined with , which means &#x27;rain&#x27; (which in turn derives from , the Latin word for rain); the usage of this word was prevalent in the nineteenth century. (French) consists of combined with , which means &#x27;snow&#x27; (which in turn derives from , the Latin word for snow). Hence, a parasol shields from sunlight, a parapluie shields from rain, and a paraneige shields from snow.

The word &quot;&quot; evolved from the Latin , meaning &#x27;shaded&#x27; or &#x27;shadow&#x27;. The Oxford English Dictionary records the first recorded usage in this sense in 1611.

In Britain, umbrellas were sometimes referred to as &quot;gamps&quot; after the character Mrs. Gamp in the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; as the character was well known for carrying an umbrella, although this usage is now dated or obsolete.

&quot;Brolly&quot; is a slang word for &quot;umbrella&quot;, used often in Australia, Ireland, Kenya, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Bumbershoot&quot; is a rare and fanciful Americanism from the late 19th century.

A parasol may also be called a sunshade, rainshade, snowshade, or beach umbrella (&quot;US English&quot;). An umbrella may also be called a brolly (&quot;UK slang&quot;), gamp (&quot;British, informal, dated&quot;), or bumbershoot (&quot;rare, facetious American slang&quot;).

== History ==

=== Africa ===

==== Ancient Egypt ====

The earliest known parasols in Ancient Egyptian art date back to the Fifth Dynasty, around 2450 BC. The parasol is found in various shapes. Typically it is depicted as a flabellum, a fan of palm-leaves or coloured feathers fixed on a long handle, resembling those now carried behind the Pope in processions. Gardiner Wilkinson, in his work on Egypt, has an engraving of an Ethiopian princess travelling through Upper Egypt in a chariot; a kind of umbrella fastened to a stout pole rises in the centre, bearing a close affinity to what are now termed chaise umbrellas. According to Wilkinson&#x27;s account, the umbrella was generally used throughout Egypt, partly as a mark of distinction, but more on account of its useful than its ornamental qualities. In some paintings on a temple wall, a parasol is held over the figure of a god carried in procession.

==== Ashanti Empire ====

The exact date when the Ashanti began using umbrellas is uncertain. However, in the 1800s, the Amanhene (senior chiefs) were using large multicolored umbrellas. Umbrellas were used during festivals as streets of Kumasi were paraded with them. Like the Asantehene&#x27;s umbrella bearer, the others also spin their umbrellas in tune with the music produced by drummers while accompanying their &quot;Ohene&quot;. Umbrellas were also used to provide coolness as well as highlight the importance of the various leaders.

=== Americas ===

==== Mesoamerica ====

The At district of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan was reported to have used an umbrella made from feathers and gold as its &quot;pantli&quot;, an identifying marker that is the equivalent of a modern flag. The &quot;pantli&quot; was carried by the army general.

====United States====
Beehler Umbrella Factory est. 1828 was the first umbrella manufacturing company in the United States. Francis Beehler was a woodcarver in his home country of Germany. After he immigrated to Baltimore, Maryland, he noticed a lack of umbrellas. Americans generally scorned the devices for their &quot;ridiculous effeminacy&quot;. Nevertheless he used his talents in making wooden poles and whale bone ribbed umbrellas to create a new market (steel rib designs would not appear until after 1852). Beehler&#x27;s success attracted competitors. Baltimore was long recognized as the umbrella capital of the country; at the industry&#x27;s peak in 1920 there were seven umbrella companies in the city producing millions of umbrellas annually.

=== Asia ===

==== Ancient Near East ====

The oldest extant example of a parasols appears in the archaeological record around 2310 BC, in a victory stele of Sargon of Akkad. In later sculptures at Nineveh, the parasol appears frequently. Austen Henry Layard gives a picture of a bas-relief representing a king in his chariot, with an attendant holding a parasol over his head, dating from c. 710 BC. It has a curtain hanging down behind, but is otherwise exactly like those in use today. It is reserved exclusively for the monarch (who was bald), and is never carried over any other person.

In Persia, the parasol is repeatedly found in the carved work of Persepolis, and Sir John Malcolm has an article on the subject in his 1815 &quot;History of Persia.&quot; In some sculptures, the figure of a king appears attended by a servant, who carries over his head an umbrella, complete with stretchers and runner. In other sculptures on the rock at Taghe-Bostan, supposed to be not less than twelve centuries old, a deer-hunt is represented, at which a king looks on, seated on a horse, and having an umbrella borne over his head by an attendant.

==== China ====
The creation of the umbrella is attributed to the wife of Lu Ban, who invented it during the Warring State Period. Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough-like ribs (the branching out parts of an umbrella). Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent, which remains in an unaltered form to the present day. However, the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air, hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high-ranking (though not necessarily royalty) in China. The use of umbrella as a social marker indicating and classifying the identities and social class of its users started by the post-Wei period and continued up to the Ming dynasty. On at least one occasion, twenty-four umbrellas were carried before the emperor when he went out hunting. The umbrella served in this case as a defence against rain rather than sun. The Chinese and Japanese traditional parasol, often used near temples, remains similar to the original ancient Chinese design.

The ancient book of Chinese ceremonies, called &quot;Zhou Li&quot; (&quot;The Rites of Zhou&quot;), dating some 2,400 years ago, directs that a dais should be placed upon the imperial cars. The figure of this dais contained in &quot;Zhou Li&quot;, and the description of it given in the explanatory commentary of Lin-hi-ye, both identify it with an umbrella. The latter describes the dais to be composed of 28 arcs, which are equivalent to the ribs of the modern instrument, and the staff supporting the covering to consist of two parts, the upper being a rod 3/18 of a Chinese foot in circumference, and the lower a tube 6/10 in circumference, into which the upper half is capable of sliding and closing.

The &quot;Book of Han&quot; contains a reference to a collapsible umbrella, mentioning its usage in the year 21 AD when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang&#x27;s carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula. The Chinese collapsible umbrella may predate Wang&#x27;s tomb, however. Zhou dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which could have been used for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.

A late Song dynasty Chinese divination book, &quot;Book of Physiognomical, Astrological and Ornithomantic Divination according to the Three Schools&quot; () by Yuan Tianwang (), that was printed in about 1270 AD features a picture of a collapsible umbrella that is exactly like the modern umbrella of today&#x27;s China.

The oil-paper umbrella also originated in China and was spread among the common people after the Eastern Han dynasty. It started to be introduced in other countries in the Tang dynasty and eventually spread across several East, South and Southeast Asian countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, where it has been further developed with different characteristics.


==== Ancient India ====


The Sanskrit epic Mahabharata relates the following legend: Jamadagni was a skilled bow shooter, and his devoted wife Renuka would always recover each of his arrows immediately. One time however, it took her a whole day to fetch the arrow, and she later blamed the heat of the sun for the delay. The angry Jamadagni shot an arrow at the sun. The sun begged for mercy and offered Renuka an umbrella.

Jean Baptiste Tavernier, in his 17th century book &quot;Voyage to the East&quot;, says that on each side of the Mogul&#x27;s throne were two umbrellas, and also describes the hall of the King of Ava was decorated with an umbrella. The chháta of the Indian and Burmese princes is large and heavy, and requires a special attendant, who has a regular position in the royal household. In Ava it seems to have been part of the king&#x27;s title, that he was &quot;King of the white elephant, and Lord of the twenty-four umbrellas.&quot;

==== Southeast Asia ====

Simon de la Loubère, who was Envoy Extraordinary from the French King to the King of Siam in 1687 and 1688, wrote an account entitled a &quot;New Historical Relation of the Kingdom of Siam&quot;, which was translated in 1693 into English. According to his account, the use of the umbrella was granted to only some of the subjects by the king. An umbrella with several circles, as if two or three umbrellas were fastened on the same stick, was permitted to the king alone; the nobles carried a single umbrella with painted cloths hanging from it. The Talapoins (who seem to have been a sort of Siamese monks) had umbrellas made of a palm-leaf cut and folded, so that the stem formed a handle.

In 1855 the King of Burma directed a letter to the Marquis of Dalhousie in which he styles himself &quot;His great, glorious, and most excellent Majesty, who reigns over the kingdoms of Thunaparanta, Tampadipa, and all the great umbrella-wearing chiefs of the Eastern countries&quot;.

The Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella is one of the royal regalia of Thailand.

=== Europe ===
The Bronze Age Dupljaja chariot, a ceramic sculpture found in Serbia dating from c. 1300 BC (attributed to the Dubovac culture), depicts a male figure, interpreted as a solar deity, standing in a three-wheeled chariot with an attached parasol held above him.

==== Ancient Greece ====

Parasols are first attested on pottery shards from the late Mycenaean period (c. 1320–1190 BC). Ancient umbrellas could be opened and shut, but rigid examples may have also existed. The earliest archaeological evidence for a collapsible umbrella was unearthed in Samos in a context from about 700 BC and follows closely the shape of a slightly older Phrygian specimen excavated at Gordion. The sliding mechanism of the two pieces is remarkably similar to those in use today.

In Classical Greece, the parasol (&quot;skiadeion&quot;, σκιάδειον), was an indispensable adjunct to a lady of fashion in the late 5th century BC. Aristophanes mentions it among the common articles of female use; they could apparently open and close. Pausanias describes a tomb near Triteia in Achaia decorated with a 4th-century BC painting ascribed to Nikias; it depicted the figure of a woman, &quot;and by her stood a female slave, bearing a parasol&quot;. For a man to carry one was considered a mark of effeminacy. In Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Birds&quot;, Prometheus uses one as a comical disguise.

Cultural changes among the Aristoi of Greece eventually led to a brief period, between 505 and 470 BC, when men used parasols. Vase iconography bears witness to a transition from men carrying swords, then spears, then staffs, then parasols, to eventually nothing. The parasol, at that time of its fashion, displayed the luxury of the user&#x27;s lifestyle. During the period of their usage, Greek style was inspired by the Persian and Lydian nobility&#x27;s way of dressing: loose robes, long decorated hair, gold, jewellery, and perfume.

It also had religious significance. In the Scirophoria, the feast of Athene Sciras, a white parasol was borne by the priestesses of the goddess from the Acropolis to the Phalerus. In the feasts of Dionysos, the umbrella was used, and in an old bas-relief, the same god is represented as descending &quot;ad inferos&quot; (towards the underworld) with a small umbrella in his hand. In the Panathenaea, the daughters of the Metics, or foreign residents, carried parasols over the heads of Athenian women as a mark of inferiority.

During the Panathenaea, daughters of Metics carried the parasols of the Athenian maidens; this service was called &quot;sciadephoria&quot; (σκιαδηφορία).

==== Ancient Rome ====

From Greece it is probable that the use of the parasol passed to Rome, where it seems to have been usually used by women, while it was the custom even for effeminate men to defend themselves from the heat by means of the &quot;Umbraculum&quot;, formed of skin or leather, and capable of being lowered at will. There are frequent references to the umbrella in the Roman Classics, and it appears that it was, not unlikely, a post of honour among maid-servants to bear it over their mistresses. Allusions to it are tolerably frequent in the poets. (Ovid Fast. lib. ii., 1. 31 I.; Martial, lib. xi., Ch. 73.; lib. xiv, Ch. 28, 130; Ovid Ars. Am., ii., 209). From such mentions the umbrella seems to have been employed as a defense from sun, but references to its use as a protection against rain, while rare, also exist (Juvenal, ix., 50.).

According to Gorius, the umbrella came to Rome from the Etruscans who came to Rome for protection, and certainly it appears not infrequently on Etruscan vases and pottery, as also on later gems and rubies. One gem, figured by Pacudius, shows an umbrella with a bent handle, sloping backwards. Strabo describes a sort of screen or umbrella worn by Spanish women, but this is not like a modern umbrella.

==== Middle Ages ====
By the fall of the Roman Empire, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the umbrella and parasol were largely forgotten in Europe, for the next few centuries. Beginning in the 8th century, there are numerous contemporary depictions and descriptions of umbrellas and parasols during the remainder of the Middle Ages, predominantly used in the religious ceremonies of the church. By the 8th century, the umbrella and parasol was firmly established in the church, seen as honorific and symbolic. The earliest visual record is an &quot;8th century image of Bishop John of Pavia, showing him followed by a servant carrying an umbrella.&quot; The earliest known written evidence of the parasol is also from the 8th century, when Pope Paul I (757-767) bestowed a jeweled parasol to Pepin the Short as part of a peace settlement.

==== 16th century ====

A 1530 depiction is in Girolamo dai Libri&#x27;s painting &quot;Madonna dell Ombrello&quot; (&quot;Madonna of the Umbrella&quot;), in which the Virgin Mary is sheltered by a cherub carrying a large, red umbrella (see image). Umbrellas were regarded as marks of distinction for the pope and clergy.

==== 17th century ====
Thomas Wright, in his &quot;Domestic Manners of the English&quot;, gives a drawing from the Harleian MS., No. 604, which represents an Anglo-Saxon gentleman walking out attended by his servant, the servant carrying an umbrella with a handle that slopes backwards, so as to bring the umbrella over the head of the person in front. It probably could not be closed, but otherwise it looks like an ordinary umbrella, and the ribs are represented distinctly.

The use of the parasol and umbrella in France and England was adopted, probably from China, about the middle of the seventeenth century. At that period, pictorial representations of it are frequently found, some of which exhibit the peculiar broad and deep canopy belonging to the large parasol of the Chinese Government officials, borne by native attendants.

John Evelyn, in his &quot;Diary&quot; for 22 June 1664, mentions a collection of rarities shown to him by &quot;Thompson&quot;, a Roman Catholic priest, sent by the Jesuits of Japan and China to France. Among the curiosities were &quot;fans like those our ladies use, but much larger, and with long handles, strangely carved and filled with Chinese characters&quot;, which is evidently a description of the parasol.

In Thomas Coryat&#x27;s &quot;Crudities&quot;, published in 1611, about a century and a half prior to the general introduction of the umbrella into England, is a reference to a custom of riders in Italy using umbrellas:

And many of them doe carry other fine things of a far greater price, that will cost at the least a duckat, which they commonly call in the Italian tongue umbrellas, that is, things which minister shadowve to them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne. These are made of leather, something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy, &amp; hooped in the inside with divers little wooden hoopes that extend the umbrella in a pretty large compasse. They are used especially by horsemen, who carry them in their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the handle upon one of their thighs, and they impart so large a shadow unto them, that it keepeth the heate of the sunne from the upper parts of their bodies.

In John Florio&#x27;s &quot;A WORLD of Words&quot; (1598), the Italian word Ombrella is translated

a fan, a canopie. also a testern or cloth of state for a prince. also a kind of round fan or shadowing that they vse to ride with in sommer in Italy, a little shade. Also a bonegrace for a woman. Also the husk or cod of any seede or corne. also a broad spreding bunch, as of fenell, nill, or elder bloomes.

In Randle Cotgrave&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the French and English Tongues&quot; (1614), the French Ombrelle is translated

An umbrello; a (fashion of) round and broad fanne, wherewith the Indians (and from them our great ones) preserve themselves from the heat of a scorching sunne; and hence any little shadow, fanne, or thing, wherewith women hide their faces from the sunne.

In Fynes Moryson&#x27;s &quot;Itinerary&quot; (1617) is a similar allusion to the habit of carrying umbrellas in hot countries &quot;to auoide the beames of the Sunne&quot;. Their employment, says the author, is dangerous, &quot;because they gather the heate into a pyramidall point, and thence cast it down perpendicularly upon the head, except they know how to carry them for auoyding that danger&quot;.

During Streynsham Master&#x27;s 1676 visit to the East India Company&#x27;s factory in Masulipatnam he noted that only the governor of the town and the next three officials in seniority were allowed to have &quot;a roundell [i.e. umbrella] carried over them.&quot;

In France, the umbrella (&quot;parapluie&quot;) began to appear in the 1660s, when the fabric of parasols carried for protection against the sun was coated with wax. The inventory of the French royal court in 1763 mentioned &quot;eleven parasols of taffeta in different colours&quot; as well as &quot;three parasols of waxed &quot;toile&quot;, decorated around the edges with lace of gold and silver&quot;. They were rare, and the word &quot;parapluie&quot; (&quot;against the rain&quot;) did not enter the dictionary of the Académie française until 1718. 

==== 18th and 19th centuries ====

Kersey&#x27;s Dictionary (1708) describes an umbrella as a &quot;screen commonly used by women to keep off rain&quot;.

The first lightweight folding umbrella in Europe was introduced in 1710 by a Paris merchant named Jean Marius, whose shop was located near the barrier of Saint-Honoré. It could be opened and closed in the same way as modern umbrellas and weighed less than one kilogram. Marius received from the King the exclusive right to produce folding umbrellas for five years. A model was purchased by the Princess Palatine in 1712, and she enthused about it to her aristocratic friends, making it an essential fashion item for Parisiennes. In 1759, a French scientist named Navarre presented a new design to the French Academy of Sciences for an umbrella combined with a cane. Pressing a small button on the side of the cane opened the umbrella.

Their use became widespread in Paris. In 1768, a Paris magazine reported: &quot;The common usage for quite some time now is not to go out without an umbrella, and to have the inconvenience of carrying it under your arm for six months in order to use it perhaps six times. Those who do not want to be mistaken for vulgar people much prefer to take the risk of being soaked, rather than to be regarded as someone who goes on foot; an umbrella is a sure sign of someone who doesn&#x27;t have his own carriage.&quot; 

In 1769, the Maison Antoine, a store at the Magasin d&#x27;Italie on rue Saint-Denis, was the first to offer umbrellas for rent to those caught in downpours, and it became a common practice. The Lieutenant General of Police of Paris issued regulations for the rental umbrellas; they were made of oiled green silk, and carried a number so they could be found and reclaimed if someone walked off with one.

By 1808 there were seven shops making and selling umbrellas in Paris; one shop, Sagnier on rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, received the first patent given for an invention in France for a new model of umbrella. By 1813 there were 42 shops; by 1848 there were three hundred seventy-seven small shops making umbrellas in Paris, employing 1400 workers. One of the well-known makers was Boutique Bétaille, which was located at rue Royale 20 from 1880 to 1939. Another was Revel, based in Lyon. By the end of the century, however, cheaper manufacturers in the Auvergne replaced Paris as the centre of umbrella manufacturing, and the town of Aurillac became the umbrella capital of France. The town still produces about half the umbrellas made in France; the umbrella factories there employ about one hundred workers. 
In Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Crusoe constructs his own umbrella in imitation of those that he had seen used in Brazil, covered with skins &quot;so that it cast off the rains like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest&quot;. From this description the original heavy umbrella came to be called &quot;Robinson&quot; for many years in England.

Captain James Cook, in one of his voyages in the late 18th century, reported seeing some of the natives of the South Pacific Islands with umbrellas made of palm leaves. In the highlands of Mindanao in the Philippines, the large fronds of &quot;Dipteris conjugata&quot; are used as an umbrella.

The use of the umbrella or parasol (though not unknown) was uncommon in England during the earlier half of the eighteenth century, as is evident from the comment made by General (then Lieut.-Colonel) James Wolfe, when writing from Paris in 1752; he speaks of the use of umbrellas for protection from the sun and rain and wonders why a similar practice did not occur in England. About the same time, umbrellas came into general use as people found their value and got over the shyness natural to its introduction. Jonas Hanway, the founder of the Magdalen Hospital, has the credit of being the first man who ventured to dare public reproach and ridicule by carrying one habitually in London. As he died in 1786, and he is said to have carried an umbrella for thirty years, the date of its first use by him may be set down at about 1750. John Macdonald relates that in 1770, he used to be addressed as, &quot;Frenchman, Frenchman! why don&#x27;t you call a coach?&quot; whenever he went out with his umbrella. By 1788 however they seem to have been accepted: a London newspaper advertises the sale of &quot;improved and pocket Umbrellas, on steel frames, with every other kind of common Umbrella.&quot;

Since then, the umbrella has come into general use, in consequence of numerous improvements. In China people learned how to waterproof their paper umbrellas with wax and lacquer. The transition to the present portable form is due, partly, to the substitution of silk and gingham for the heavy and troublesome oiled silk, which admitted of the ribs and frames being made much lighter, and also to many ingenious mechanical improvements in the framework. Victorian era umbrellas had frames of wood or baleen, but these devices were expensive and hard to fold when wet. Samuel Fox invented the steel-ribbed umbrella in 1852; however, the &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique&quot; mentions metal ribs at the end of the eighteenth century, and they were also on sale in London during the 1780s. Modern designs usually employ a telescoping steel trunk; new materials such as cotton, plastic film and nylon often replace the original silk.

National Umbrella Day is held on 10 February each year around the world.

The pocket (foldable) umbrella was invented in Uraiújfalu (Hungary) by the Balogh brothers, whose patent request was admitted in 1923 by the Royal Notary Public of Szombathely. Later on their patent was also approved in Austria, Germany, Belgium, France, Poland, Great Britain and the United States.

In 1928, Hans Haupt&#x27;s pocket umbrellas appeared. In Vienna in 1928, Slawa Horowitz, a student studying sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste Wien (Academy of Fine Arts), developed a prototype for an improved compact foldable umbrella for which she received a patent on 19 September 1929. The umbrella was called &quot;Flirt&quot; and manufactured by the Austrian company &quot;Brüder Wüster&quot; and their German associates &quot;Kortenbach &amp; Rauh&quot;. In Germany, the small foldable umbrellas were produced by the company &quot;Knirps&quot;, which became a synonym in the German language for small foldable umbrellas in general.
In 1969, Bradford E Phillips, the owner of Totes Incorporated of Loveland, Ohio, obtained a patent for his &quot;working folding umbrella&quot;.

Umbrellas have also been fashioned into hats as early as 1880 and at least as recently as 1987.

Golf umbrellas, one of the largest sizes in common use, are typically around across but can range anywhere from .

Transparent umbrellas, often made with plastic or composite materials, were invented in 1958 by Mitsuo Sudou. The transparent umbrellas were popularized as fashion items during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The production had since been relocated to China and other Asian countries and has become ubiquitous on Japanese streets due to its affordability, aesthetics, and ease of access.

Umbrellas are now a consumer product with a large global market. As of 2008, most umbrellas worldwide are made in China, mostly in the Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. The city of Shangyu alone had more than a thousand umbrella factories. In the US alone, about 33 million umbrellas, worth $348 million, are sold each year.

Umbrellas continue to be actively developed. In the US, so many umbrella-related patents are being filed that the U.S. Patent Office employs four full-time examiners to assess them. As of 2008, the office registered 3000 active patents on umbrella-related inventions. Nonetheless, Totes, the largest American umbrella producer, has stopped accepting unsolicited proposals. Its director of umbrella development was reported as saying that while umbrellas are so ordinary that everyone thinks about them, &quot;it&#x27;s difficult to come up with an umbrella idea that hasn’t already been done.&quot;

While the predominant canopy shape of an umbrella is round, canopy shapes have been streamlined to improve aerodynamic response to wind. Examples include the stealth-shaped canopy of Rizotti (1996), scoop-shaped canopy of Lisciandro (2004), and teardrop-shaped canopies of Hollinger (2004).

In 2005 Gerwin Hoogendoorn, a Dutch industrial design student of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, invented an aerodynamically streamlined storm umbrella (similar in shape to a stealth aircraft) which can withstand wind force 10 (winds of up to 100 km/h or 70 mph) and will not turn inside-out like a normal umbrella as well as being equipped with so-called &quot;eye savers&quot; which protect others from being accidentally wounded by the tips. Hoogendoorn&#x27;s storm umbrella was nominated for and won several design awards, and was featured on Good Morning America. The umbrella is sold in Europe as the Senz umbrella and is sold under license by Totes in the United States.

Alan Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Nubrella&quot; and Greg Brebner&#x27;s &quot;Blunt&quot; are other contemporary designs.

== Other uses ==

The umbrella is used in weather forecasting as an icon for rain. Two variations, a plain umbrella (☂, U+2602) and an umbrella with raindrops overhead (☔, U+2614), are encoded in the Miscellaneous Symbols block of Unicode.

=== In religious ceremony ===

As a canopy of state, umbrellas were generally used in southern and eastern Europe, and then passed from the imperial court into church ceremony. They are found in the ceremonies of the Byzantine Rite, were borne over the Host in procession, and form part of the Pontifical regalia.

==== Catholic Church ====

An umbrella, the &quot;ombrellino&quot; (Italian) or &quot;umbraculum&quot; (Latin) is an historic piece of the papal regalia. Although the popes no longer use it personally, it is displayed on the coat of arms of a &quot;sede vacante&quot; (the papal arms used between the death of a pope and the election of his successor). This umbraculum is normally made of alternating red and gold fabric, and is usually displayed in a partially unfolded manner. The popes have traditionally bestowed the use of the umbraculum as a mark of honor upon specific persons and places. The use of an umbraculum is one of the honorary symbols of a basilica and may be used in the basilica&#x27;s coat of arms and carried in processions by the basilica&#x27;s canons.

A large umbrella is displayed in each of the Basilicas of Rome, and a cardinal bishop who receives his title from one of those churches has the privilege of having an umbrella carried over his head in solemn processions. It is possible that the galero (wide-brimmed cardinal&#x27;s hat) may derive from this umbrella. Beatiano, an Italian herald, says that &quot;a vermilion umbrella in a field argent symbolizes dominion&quot;.
Roman Catholic liturgy also uses an umbrella, known as the &quot;umbraculum&quot; or &quot;ombrellino&quot;. It is held over the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist and its carrier by a server in short processions taking place indoors, or until the priest is met at the sanctuary entrance by the bearers of the processional canopy or &quot;baldacchino&quot;. It is regularly white or golden (the colours reserved for the Holy Sacrament) and made of silk.

==== Oriental Orthodox Churches ====

In several Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, umbrellas are used liturgically to show honor to a person (such as a bishop) or a holy object. In the ceremonies of Timkat (Epiphany), priests will carry a model of the Tablets of Stone, called a Tabot, on their heads in procession to a body of water, which will then be blessed. Brightly colored embroidered and fringed liturgical parasols are carried above the Tabota during this procession. Such processions also take place on other major feast days.

=== In Buddhism ===

A decorated parasol is ushered over relics and statues of Buddha, scriptures of the Buddhist doctrine and Bhikkhus, as a sign of respect.

=== In photography ===

Umbrellas with a reflective inside are used by photographers as a diffusion device when employing artificial lighting, and as a glare shield and shade, most often in portrait situations. Some umbrellas are shoot-through umbrellas, meaning the light goes through the umbrella and is diffused, rather than reflecting off the inside of the umbrella.

=== As a weapon of attack ===
In 1835, the Baron Charles Random de Berenger instructed readers of his book &quot;How to Protect Life and Property&quot; in several methods of using an umbrella as an improvised weapon against highwaymen.

In 1897, journalist J. F. Sullivan proposed the umbrella as a misunderstood weapon in a tongue-in-cheek article for the &quot;Ludgate Monthly&quot;.

Between 1899 and 1902, both umbrellas and walking sticks as self defence weapons were incorporated into the repertoire of Bartitsu.

In January 1902, an article in &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; instructed women on how they could defend themselves from ruffians with an umbrella or parasol.

During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Umbrella Revolution&quot;, protesters used umbrellas as shields against the pepper spray and tear gas used by riot police.

==== Examples of incidents ====

* In 1978, Bulgarian dissident writer Georgi Markov was killed in London by a dose of ricin injected via a modified umbrella. The KGB is widely believed to have developed a modified umbrella that could deliver a deadly pellet.
* In 2005, in a well-known case in South Africa, Brian Hahn, associate professor of mathematics and applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town, was beaten to death with an umbrella by ex-doctoral student Maleafisha Steve Tladi.
* In 2007, a 23-year-old woman in Rome was killed by another woman in the subway by stabbing through the eye using an umbrella.
* In 2019, a priest in Berlin was killed by having an umbrella rammed upward through his open mouth, piercing into his brain.

==== In arts and entertainment ====

* The magical nanny Mary Poppins leaves the Banks home in Cherry Tree Lane, London, with the wind carrying her, by blowing into her opened umbrella.
* John Steed, in the 1960s television series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, used an umbrella which was also a swordstick.
* In the DC Comics, the Penguin, an enemy of Batman, sports umbrellas as weapons with machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, swords, switchblades, acid guns, ray guns, and gas guns.
* A high-tech bullet-resistant umbrella is used extensively as a weapon in the film &quot;&quot; (2015), by characters Harry Hart (Colin Firth) and Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton).
* In the &quot;Kirby&quot; video game series, one of Kirby&#x27;s Copy Abilities, called &quot;Parasol&quot;, has Kirby using a parasol as a weapon. It is also used to slow Kirby&#x27;s descent when in the air.
* Players use victory reward umbrellas to glide into the battle arena in the video game Fortnite: Battle Royale.

== In architecture ==

In the 1950s Frei Otto transformed the universally used individual umbrella into an item of lightweight architecture. He developed a new umbrella form, based on the minimum surface principle. The tension loaded membrane of the funnel-shaped umbrella is now stretched under the compression-loaded bars. This construction type made it technically and structurally possible to build very large convertible umbrellas. The first umbrellas of this kind (Federal Garden Exhibition, Kassel, 1955) were fixed, Frei Otto constructed the first convertible large umbrellas for the Federal Garden Exhibition in Cologne 1971. In 1978 he built a group of ten convertible umbrellas for British rock group Pink Floyd&#x27;s American tour. The great beauty of these lightweight structures inspired many subsequent projects built all over the world. The largest convertible umbrellas built until now were designed by Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his team at SL-Rasch to provide shelter from sun and rain for the great mosques in Saudi Arabia.

Later works by the architect Le Corbusier such as Centre Le Corbusier and Villa Shodhan involve a parasol, which served as a roof structure and provided cover from the sun and wind.

<text>In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, reflect, and distribute solar energy, in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices. 

The key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate performing an accurate site analysis. Elements to be considered include window placement and size, and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be adapted or &quot;retrofitted&quot;.
==Passive energy gain==
&quot;Passive solar&quot; technologies use sunlight without active mechanical systems (as contrasted to &quot;active solar&quot;, which uses thermal collectors). Such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat (in water, air, and thermal mass), cause air-movement for ventilating, or future use, with little use of other energy sources. A common example is a solarium on the equator-side of a building. Passive cooling is the use of similar design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements.

Some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers, shutters, night insulation, and other devices that enhance solar energy collection, storage, and use, and reduce undesirable heat transfer.

Passive solar technologies include direct and indirect solar gain for space heating, solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon, use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings, solar cookers, the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation, and earth sheltering.

More widely, solar technologies include the solar furnace, but this typically requires some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers, and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use. &#x27;Low-grade&#x27; energy needs, such as space and water heating, have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy.

==As a science==
The scientific basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of climatology, thermodynamics (particularly heat transfer: conduction (heat), convection, and electromagnetic radiation), fluid mechanics/natural convection (passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity, fans or pumps), and human thermal comfort based on heat index, psychrometrics and enthalpy control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals, sunrooms, solariums, and greenhouses for raising plants.

Specific attention is divided into: the site, location and solar orientation of the building, local sun path, the prevailing level of insolation (latitude/sunshine/clouds/precipitation), design and construction quality/materials, placement/size/type of windows and walls, and incorporation of solar-energy-storing thermal mass with heat capacity.While these considerations may be directed toward any building, achieving an ideal optimized cost/performance solution requires careful, holistic, system integration engineering of these scientific principles. Modern refinements through computer modeling (such as the comprehensive U.S. Department of Energy &quot;Energy Plus&quot; building energy simulation software), and application of decades of lessons learned (since the 1970s energy crisis) can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage, without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics. In fact, passive-solar design features such as a greenhouse/sunroom/solarium can greatly enhance the livability, daylight, views, and value of a home, at a low cost per unit of space.

Much has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis. Many unscientific, intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve zero energy – the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills.

Passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive (using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology), but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned, and time to enter, evaluate, and iteratively refine the simulation input and output.

One of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of thermography using digital thermal imaging cameras for a formal quantitative scientific energy audit. Thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day.

The scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive building energy simulation computer software systems (like U.S. DOE Energy Plus).

Scientific passive solar building design with quantitative cost benefit product optimization is not easy for a novice. The level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture, and many intuition-based, unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas.

The economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant. If it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980 (based on 1970s lessons learned), The United States could be saving over $250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution today.

Since 1979, Passive Solar Building Design has been a critical element of achieving zero energy by educational institution experiments, and governments around the world, including the U.S. Department of Energy, and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades. The cost effective proof of concept was established decades ago, but cultural change in architecture, the construction trades, and building-owner decision making has been very slow and difficult.

The new subjects such as &quot;architectural science&quot; and &quot;architectural technology&quot; are being added to some schools of architecture, with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principles.

==The solar path in passive design==

The ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the sun&#x27;s path throughout the day.

This occurs as a result of the inclination of the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation in relation to its orbit. The sun path is unique for any given latitude.

In Northern Hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator:

* The sun will reach its highest point toward the south (in the direction of the equator)
* As winter solstice approaches, the angle at which the sun rises and sets progressively moves further toward the south and the daylight hours will become shorter
* The opposite is noted in summer where the sun will rise and set further toward the north and the daylight hours will lengthen

The converse is observed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in.

In equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees, the position of the sun at solar noon will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year.

In regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either north-or-south pole, during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later, during the height of winter.

The 47-degree difference in the altitude of the sun at solar noon between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design. This information is combined with local climatic data (degree day) heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for thermal comfort, and when it should be blocked with shading. By strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices, the percentage of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year.

One passive solar sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before, and six weeks after, the solstice, due to &quot;thermal lag&quot; from the thermal mass of the Earth, the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice. Movable shutters, shades, shade screens, or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements.

Careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design. A common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side. A heliodon is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects. In modern times, 3D computer graphics can visually simulate this data, and calculate performance predictions.

==Passive solar heat transfer principles==

Personal thermal comfort is a function of personal health factors (medical, psychological, sociological and situational), ambient air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air movement (wind chill, turbulence) and relative humidity (affecting human evaporative cooling). Heat transfer in buildings occurs through convection, conduction, and thermal radiation through roof, walls, floor and windows.

===Convective heat transfer===
Convective heat transfer can be beneficial or detrimental. Uncontrolled air infiltration from poor weatherization / weatherstripping / draft-proofing can contribute up to 40% of heat loss during winter; however, strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection, cross-ventilation, and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and relative humidity. Filtered energy recovery ventilation systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity, dust, pollen, and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air.

Natural convection causing rising warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat. This may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space, serve as a method of venting hot air, or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for passive solar heat distribution and temperature equalization. Natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans, but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room, and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic, or through nearby windows. In addition, high relative humidity inhibits evaporative cooling by humans.

===Radiative heat transfer===
The main source of heat transfer is radiant energy, and the primary source is the sun. Solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows (but also through walls). Thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one. Roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house. A cool roof, or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature (see albedo, absorptivity, emissivity, and reflectivity).

Windows are a ready and predictable site for thermal radiation.
Energy from radiation can move into a window in the day time, and out of the same window at night. Radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum, or translucent medium. Solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days. Solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing, shading, and orientation. Windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls. Convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties. When shading windows, external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal window coverings.

Western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting, but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded. In contrast, the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter, but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall. The amount of radiant heat received is related to the location latitude, altitude, cloud cover, and seasonal / hourly angle of incidence (see Sun path and Lambert&#x27;s cosine law).

Another passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be stored in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize diurnal (day/night) temperature variations. The complex interaction of thermodynamic principles can be counterintuitive for first-time designers. Precise computer modeling can help avoid costly construction experiments.

==Site specific considerations during design==

* Latitude, sun path, and insolation (sunshine)
* Seasonal variations in solar gain e.g. cooling or heating degree days, solar insolation, humidity
* Diurnal variations in temperature
* Micro-climate details related to breezes, humidity, vegetation and land contour
* Obstructions / Over-shadowing – to solar gain or local cross-winds

==Design elements for residential buildings in temperate climates==
* Placement of room-types, internal doors and walls, and equipment in the house.
* Orienting the building to face the equator (or a few degrees to the East to capture the morning sun)
* Extending the building dimension along the east–west axis
* Adequately sizing windows to face the midday sun in the winter, and be shaded in the summer.
* Minimising windows on other sides, especially western windows
* Erecting correctly sized, latitude-specific roof overhangs, or shading elements (shrubbery, trees, trellises, fences, shutters, etc.)
* Using the appropriate amount and type of insulation including radiant barriers and bulk insulation to minimise seasonal excessive heat gain or loss
* Using thermal mass to store excess solar energy during the winter day (which is then re-radiated during the night)

The precise amount of equator-facing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude, altitude, climatic conditions, and heating/cooling degree day requirements.

Factors that can degrade thermal performance:

* Deviation from ideal orientation and north–south/east/west aspect ratio
* Excessive glass area (&quot;over-glazing&quot;) resulting in overheating (also resulting in glare and fading of soft furnishings) and heat loss when ambient air temperatures fall
* Installing glazing where solar gain during the day and thermal losses during the night cannot be controlled easily e.g. West-facing, angled glazing, skylights
* Thermal losses through non-insulated or unprotected glazing
* Lack of adequate shading during seasonal periods of high solar gain (especially on the West wall)
* Incorrect application of thermal mass to modulate daily temperature variations
* Open staircases leading to unequal distribution of warm air between upper and lower floors as warm air rises
* High building surface area to volume, e.g., too many corners
* Inadequate weatherization leading to high air infiltration
* Lack of, or incorrectly installed, radiant barriers during the hot season. (See also cool roof and green roof)
* Insulation materials that are not matched to the main mode of heat transfer (e.g. undesirable convective/conductive/radiant heat transfer)

==Efficiency and economics of passive solar heating==

Technically, PSH is highly efficient. Direct-gain systems can utilize (i.e. convert into &quot;useful&quot; heat) 65–70% of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector.

Passive solar fraction (PSF) is the percentage of the required heat load met by PSH and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs. RETScreen International has reported a PSF of 20–50%. Within the field of sustainability, energy conservation even of the order of 15% is considered substantial.

Other sources report the following PSFs:

*5–25% for modest systems
*40% for &quot;highly optimized&quot; systems
*Up to 75% for &quot;very intense&quot; systems

In favorable climates such as the southwest United States, highly optimized systems can exceed 75% PSF.

For more information see Solar Air Heat

==Key passive solar building configurations==
There are three distinct passive solar energy configurations, and at least one noteworthy hybrid of these basic configurations:

*direct solar systems
*indirect solar systems
*hybrid direct/indirect solar systems
*isolated solar systems

===Direct solar system===
In a direct-gain passive solar system, the indoor space acts as a solar collector, heat absorber, and distribution system. South-facing glass in the northern hemisphere(north-facing in the southern hemisphere) admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats (radiant energy absorption) or indirectly heats (through convection) thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls. The floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts of the building and temper the intensity of heating during the day. At night, the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space.

In cold climates, a sun-tempered building is the most basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing (slightly) the south-facing glazing area, without adding additional thermal mass. It is a type of direct-gain system in which the building envelope is well insulated, is elongated in an east–west direction, and has a large fraction (~80% or more) of the windows on the south side. It has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building (i.e., just framing, wall board, and so forth). In a sun-tempered building, the south-facing window area should be limited to about 5 to 7% of the total floor area, less in a sunny climate, to prevent overheating. Additional south-facing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added. Energy savings are modest with this system, and sun tempering is very low cost.

In genuine direct gain passive solar systems, sufficient thermal mass is required to prevent large temperature fluctuations in indoor air; more thermal mass is required than in a sun tempered building. Overheating of the building interior can result with insufficient or poorly designed thermal mass. About one-half to two-thirds of the interior surface area of the floors, walls and ceilings must be constructed of thermal storage materials. Thermal storage materials can be concrete, adobe, brick, and water. Thermal mass in floors and walls should be kept as bare as is functionally and aesthetically possible; thermal mass needs to be exposed to direct sunlight. Wall-to-wall carpeting, large throw rugs, expansive furniture, and large wall hangings should be avoided.

Typically, for about every 1 ft2 of south-facing glass, about 5 to 10 ft3 of thermal mass is required for thermal mass (1 m3 per 5 to 10 m2). When accounting for minimal-to-average wall and floor coverings and furniture, this typically equates to about 5 to 10 ft2 per ft2 (5 to 10 m2 per m2) of south-facing glass, depending upon whether the sunlight strikes the surface directly. The simplest rule of thumb is that thermal mass area should have an area of 5 to 10 times the surface area of the direct-gain collector (glass) area.

Solid thermal mass (e.g., concrete, masonry, stone, etc.) should be relatively thin, no more than about 4 in (100 mm) thick. Thermal masses with large exposed areas and those in direct sunlight for at least part of the day (2 hour minimum) perform best. Medium-to-dark, colors with high absorptivity, should be used on surfaces of thermal mass elements that will be in direct sunlight. Thermal mass that is not in contact with sunlight can be any color. Lightweight elements (e.g., drywall walls and ceilings) can be any color. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during dark, cloudy periods and nighttime hours will greatly enhance performance of a direct-gain system. Water contained within plastic or metal containment and placed in direct sunlight heats more rapidly and more evenly than solid mass due to natural convection heat transfer. The convection process also prevents surface temperatures from becoming too extreme as they sometimes do when dark colored solid mass surfaces receive direct sunlight.

Depending on climate and with adequate thermal mass, south-facing glass area in a direct gain system should be limited to about 10 to 20% of the floor area (e.g., 10 to 20 ft2 of glass for a 100 ft2 floor area). This should be based on the net glass or glazing area. Note that most windows have a net glass/glazing area that is 75 to 85% of the overall window unit area. Above this level, problems with overheating, glare and fading of fabrics are likely.

===Indirect solar system===
In an indirect-gain passive solar system, the thermal mass (concrete, masonry, or water) is located directly behind the south-facing glass and in front of the heated indoor space and so there is no direct heating. The position of the mass prevents sunlight from entering the indoor space and can also obstruct the view through the glass. There are two types of indirect gain systems: thermal storage wall systems and roof pond systems.

====Thermal Storage (Trombe) Walls====

In a thermal storage wall system, often called a Trombe wall, a massive wall is located directly behind south-facing glass, which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the building interior at night. The wall can be constructed of cast-in-place concrete, brick, adobe, stone, or solid (or filled) concrete masonry units. Sunlight enters through the glass and is immediately absorbed at the surface of the mass wall and either stored or conducted through the material mass to the inside space. The thermal mass cannot absorb solar energy as fast as it enters the space between the mass and the window area. Temperatures of the air in this space can easily exceed 120 °F (49 °C). This hot air can be introduced into interior spaces behind the wall by incorporating heat-distributing vents at the top of the wall. This wall system was first envisioned and patented in 1881 by its inventor, Edward Morse. Felix Trombe, for whom this system is sometimes named, was a French engineer who built several homes using this design in the French Pyrenees in the 1960s.

A thermal storage wall typically consists of a 4 to 16 in (100 to 400 mm) thick masonry wall coated with a dark, heat-absorbing finish (or a selective surface) and covered with a single or double layer of high transmissivity glass. The glass is typically placed from in to 2 in from the wall to create a small airspace. In some designs, the mass is located 1 to 2 ft (0.6 m) away from the glass, but the space is still not usable. The surface of the thermal mass absorbs the solar radiation that strikes it and stores it for nighttime use. Unlike a direct gain system, the thermal storage wall system provides passive solar heating without excessive window area and glare in interior spaces. However, the ability to take advantage of views and daylighting are eliminated. The performance of Trombe walls is diminished if the wall interior is not open to the interior spaces. Furniture, bookshelves and wall cabinets installed on the interior surface of the wall will reduce its performance.

A classical Trombe wall, also generically called a vented thermal storage wall, has operable vents near the ceiling and floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection. As solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise. Air is drawn into the lower vent, then into the space between the glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation, increasing its temperature and causing it to rise, and then exit through the top (ceiling) vent back into the indoor space. This allows the wall to directly introduce heated air into the space; usually at a temperature of about 90 °F (32 °C).

If vents are left open at night (or on cloudy days), a reversal of convective airflow will occur, wasting heat by dissipating it outdoors. Vents must be closed at night so radiant heat from the interior surface of the storage wall heats the indoor space. Generally, vents are also closed during summer months when heat gain is not needed. During the summer, an exterior exhaust vent installed at the top of the wall can be opened to vent to the outside. Such venting makes the system act as a solar chimney driving air through the building during the day.

Vented thermal storage walls vented to the interior have proven somewhat ineffective, mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months; they simply overheat and create comfort issues. Most solar experts recommended that thermal storage walls should not be vented to the interior.

There are many variations of the Trombe wall system. An unvented thermal storage wall (technically not a Trombe wall) captures solar energy on the exterior surface, heats up, and conducts heat to the interior surface, where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day. A water wall uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass.

A typical unvented thermal storage wall consists of a south facing masonry or concrete wall with a dark, heat-absorbing material on the exterior surface and faced with a single or double layer of glass. High transmission glass maximizes solar gains to the mass wall. The glass is placed from to 6 in. (20 to 150 mm) from the wall to create a small airspace. Glass framing is typically metal (e.g., aluminum) because vinyl will soften and wood will become super dried at the 180 °F (82 °C) temperature that can exist behind the glass in the wall. Heat from sunlight passing through the glass is absorbed by the dark surface, stored in the wall, and conducted slowly inward through the masonry. As an architectural detail, patterned glass can limit the exterior visibility of the wall without sacrificing solar transmissivity.

A water wall uses containers of water for thermal mass instead of a solid mass wall. Water walls are typically slightly more efficient than solid mass walls because they absorb heat more efficiently due to the development of convective currents in the liquid water as it is heated. These currents cause rapid mixing and quicker transfer of heat into the building than can be provided by the solid mass walls.

Temperature variations between the exterior and interior wall surfaces drive heat through the mass wall. Inside the building, however, daytime heat gain is delayed, only becoming available at the interior surface of the thermal mass during the evening when it is needed because the sun has set. The time lag is the time difference between when sunlight first strikes the wall and when the heat enters the building interior. Time lag is contingent upon the type of material used in the wall and the wall thickness; a greater thickness yields a greater time lag. The time lag characteristic of thermal mass, combined with dampening of temperature fluctuations, allows the use of varying daytime solar energy as a more uniform night-time heat source. Windows can be placed in the wall for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons, but this tends to lower the efficiency somewhat.

The thickness of a thermal storage wall should be approximately 10 to 14 in (250 to 350 mm) for brick, 12 to 18 in (300 to 450 mm) for concrete, 8 to 12 in (200 to 300 mm) for earth/adobe, and at least 6 in (150 mm) for water. These thicknesses delay movement of heat such that indoor surface temperatures peak during late evening hours. Heat will take about 8 to 10 hours to reach the interior of the building (heat travels through a concrete wall at rate of about one inch per hour). A good thermal connection between the inside wall finishes (e.g., drywall) and the thermal mass wall is necessary to maximize heat transfer to the interior space.

Although the position of a thermal storage wall minimizes daytime overheating of the indoor space, a well-insulated building should be limited to approximately 0.2 to 0.3 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 to 0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area), depending upon climate. A water wall should have about 0.15 to 0.2 ft2 of water wall surface per ft2 (0.15 to 0.2 m2 per m2) of floor area.

Thermal mass walls are best-suited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal (day-night) temperature swings (e.g., southwest, mountain-west). They do not perform as well in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where there is not a large diurnal temperature swing. Nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates; the wall loses stored heat in less than a day, and then leak heat, which dramatically raises backup heating requirements. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system.

The main drawback of thermal storage walls is their heat loss to the outside. Double glass (glass or any of the plastics) is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates. In mild climates, single glass is acceptable. A selective surface (high-absorbing/low-emitting surface) applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass; typically, it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels. A selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall. It absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range. High absorbency turns the light into heat at the wall&#x27;s surface, and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass.

====Roof Pond System====

A roof pond&quot; &quot;passive solar system, sometimes called a solar roof, uses water stored on the roof to temper hot and cold internal temperatures, usually in desert environments. It typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in (150 to 300 mm) of water on a flat roof. Water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation. It can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing. Solar radiation heats the water, which acts as a thermal storage medium. At night or during cloudy weather, the containers can be covered with insulating panels. The indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above. These systems require good drainage systems, movable insulation, and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70 lb/ft2 (1.7 to 3.3 kN/m2) dead load.

With the angles of incidence of sunlight during the day, roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and mid-latitudes, in hot to temperate climates. Roof pond systems perform better for cooling in hot, low humidity climates. Not many solar roofs have been built, and there is limited information on the design, cost, performance, and construction details of thermal storage roofs.

===Hybrid direct/indirect solar system===
Kachadorian demonstrated that the drawbacks of thermal storage walls can be overcome by orienting the Trombe wall horizontally instead of vertically. If the thermal storage mass is constructed as a ventilated concrete slab floor instead of as a wall, it does not block sunlight from entering the home (the Trombe wall&#x27;s most obvious disadvantage) but it can still be exposed to direct sunlight through double-glazed equator-facing windows, which can be further insulated by thermal shutters or shades at night. The Trombe wall&#x27;s problematic delay in daytime heat capture is eliminated, because heat does not have to be driven through the wall to reach the interior air space: some of it reflects or re-radiates immediately from the floor. Provided the slab has air channels like the Trombe wall, which run through it in the north-south direction and are vented to the interior air space through the concrete slab floor just inside the north and south walls, vigorous air thermosiphoning through the slab still occurs as in the vertical Trombe wall, distributing the impounded heat throughout the house (and cooling the house in summer by the reverse process).

The ventilated horizontal slab is less expensive to construct than vertical Trombe walls, as it forms the foundation of the house which is a necessary expense in any building. Slab-on-grade foundations are a common, well-understood and cost-effective building component (modified only slightly by the inclusion of a layer of concrete-brick air channels), rather than an exotic Trombe wall construct. The only remaining drawback to this kind of thermal mass solar architecture is the absence of a basement, as in any slab-on grade design.

The Kachadorian floor design is a &quot;direct-gain&quot; passive solar system, but its thermal mass also acts as an &quot;indirect&quot; heating (or cooling) element, giving up its heat at night. It is an alternating cycle hybrid energy system, like a hybrid electric vehicle.

===Isolated solar system===
In an &quot;isolated gain passive solar system,&quot; the components (e.g., collector and thermal storage) are isolated from the indoor area of the building.

An attached sunspace, also sometimes called a solar room or solarium, is a type of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas. It functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of direct-gain and indirect-gain system characteristics. A sunspace may be called and appear like a greenhouse, but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a sunspace is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building. Sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation. In moderate and cold climates, however, supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather.

An attached sunspace&#x27;s south-facing glass collects solar energy as in a direct-gain system. The simplest sunspace design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing. Sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing. Although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter, it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months. Although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing, an insulated roof provides better thermal performance. Skylights can be used to provide some daylighting potential. Vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter, when the angle of the sun is low, and yield less heat gain during the summer. Vertical glass is less expensive, easier to install and insulate, and not as prone to leaking, fogging, breaking, and other glass failures. A combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided. A well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer.

The temperature variations caused by the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and low-emissivity windows. Thermal mass can include a masonry floor, a masonry wall bordering the house, or water containers. Distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents, windows, doors, or fans. In a common design, thermal mass wall situated on the back of the sunspace adjacent to the living space will function like an indirect-gain thermal mass wall. Solar energy entering the sunspace is retained in the thermal mass. Solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the sunspace and by vents (like an unvented thermal storage wall) or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the sunspace to the indoor space by convection (like a vented thermal storage wall).

In cold climates, double glazing should be used to reduce conductive losses through the glass to the outside. Night-time heat loss, although significant during winter months, is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed off from the rest of the building. In temperate and cold climates, thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important. Large glass panels, French doors, or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with an open space.

A sunspace with a masonry thermal wall will need approximately 0.3 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area), depending on climate. Wall thicknesses should be similar to a thermal storage wall. If a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space, about 0.20 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 m2 per m2 of floor area) is appropriate. In most climates, a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating. Generally, vast overhead (horizontal) and east- and west-facing glass areas should not be used in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas.

The internal surfaces of the thermal mass should be dark in color. Movable insulation (e.g., window coverings, shades, shutters) can be used help trap the warm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather. When closed during extremely hot days, window coverings can help keep the sunspace from overheating.

To maximize comfort and efficiency, the non-glass sunspace walls, ceiling and foundation should be well insulated. The perimeter of the foundation wall or slab should be insulated to the frost line or around the slab perimeter. In a temperate or cold climate, the east and west walls of the sunspace should be insulated (no glass).

==Additional measures==
Measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night e.g. window coverings or movable window insulation.

===Heat storage===
The sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time. Heat storage, or thermal mass, keeps the building warm when the sun can&#x27;t heat it.

In diurnal solar houses, the storage is designed for one or a few days. The usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass. This includes a Trombe wall, a ventilated concrete floor, a cistern, water wall or roof pond. It is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself, either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium.

In subarctic areas, or areas that have long terms without solar gain (e.g. weeks of freezing fog), purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive. Don Stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage. His designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3 m under a house, and insulate the ground with a 6 m waterproof skirt.

===Insulation===

Thermal insulation or superinsulation (type, placement and amount) reduces unwanted leakage of heat. Some passive buildings are actually constructed of insulation.

===Special glazing systems and window coverings===

The effectiveness of direct solar gain systems is significantly enhanced by insulative (e.g. double glazing), spectrally selective glazing (low-e), or movable window insulation (window quilts, bifold interior insulation shutters, shades, etc.).

Generally, Equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain.

There is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the German Passive House standard. Selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling degree days for the design location.

===Glazing selection===

====Equator-facing glass====
The requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building. Reflective window coatings and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain. However, direct-gain systems are more dependent on double or triple glazing or even quadruple glazing in higher geographic latitudes to reduce heat loss. Indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing. Nevertheless, the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent.

====Roof-angle glass and skylights====

Skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare either horizontally (a flat roof) or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope. In some cases, horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation (and harsh glare), depending on the roof angle of incidence. When the winter sun is low on the horizon, most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass ( the angle of incidence is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon ). When the summer sun is high, it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass, which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year, and acts like a solar furnace. Skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce natural convection ( warm air rising ) heat loss on cold winter nights, and intense solar heat gain during hot spring/summer/fall days.

The equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere, and north in the southern hemisphere. Skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination, except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building (at some latitudes). Skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning. West-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day.

Some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain, while still allowing some visible light transmission. However, if visible light can pass through it, so can some radiant heat gain (they are both electromagnetic radiation waves).

You can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of deciduous (leaf-shedding) trees, or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight. This would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer. If tree limbs hang over a roof, they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters, possibly cause roof-damaging ice dams, shorten roof life, and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic. Leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing, difficult to clean, and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms.

&quot;Sawtooth roof glazing&quot; with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building, without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights.

Skylights provide daylight. The only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications. Well-insulated light tubes can bring daylight into northern rooms, without using a skylight. A passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building.

Infrared thermography color thermal imaging cameras ( used in formal energy audits ) can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day.

The U.S. Department of Energy states: &quot;vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces.&quot; Roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces.

The U.S. DOE explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing: Glass and plastic have little structural strength. When installed vertically, glass (or plastic) bears its own weight because only a small area (the top edge of the glazing) is subject to gravity. As the glass tilts off the vertical axis, however, an increased area (now the sloped cross-section) of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity. Glass is also brittle; it does not flex much before breaking. To counteract this, you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing. Both increase overall cost, and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace.

Another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather. It is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight. Hail, sleet, snow, and wind may cause material failure. For occupant safety, regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass, laminated, or a combination thereof, which reduce solar gain potential. Most of the roof-angled glass on the Crowne Plaza Hotel Orlando Airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm. Roof-angled glass increases construction cost, and can increase insurance premiums. Vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass.

It is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day. Skylights are the antithesis of zero energy building Passive Solar Cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement.

====Angle of incident radiation====

The amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident solar radiation. Sunlight striking a single sheet of glass within 45 degrees of perpendicular is mostly transmitted (less than 10% is reflected), whereas for sunlight striking at 70 degrees from perpendicular over 20% of light is reflected, and above 70 degrees this percentage reflected rises sharply.

All of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic light meter and a heliodon or optical bench, which can quantify the ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity, based on angle of incidence.

Alternatively, passive solar computer software can determine the impact of sun path, and cooling-and-heating degree days on energy performance.

===Operable shading and insulation devices===
A design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter, spring, or fall day heating, uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year, and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days.

Although the sun is at the same altitude 6-weeks before and after the solstice, the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different. Heat storage on the Earth&#x27;s surface causes &quot;thermal lag.&quot; Variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential. This means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs, while important, are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution.

Control mechanisms (such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes, shutters, exterior roll-down shade screens, or retractable awnings) can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover, and help control daily / hourly solar gain requirement variations.

Home automation systems that monitor temperature, sunlight, time of day, and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices.

===Exterior colors reflecting – absorbing===
Materials and colors can be chosen to reflect or absorb solar thermal energy. Using information on a color for electromagnetic radiation to determine its thermal radiation properties of reflection or absorption can assist the choices.

In cold climates with short winter days direct-gain systems utilizing equator-facing windows may actually perform better when snow covers the ground, since reflected as well as direct sunlight will enter the house and be captured as heat.

==Landscaping and gardens==

Energy-efficient landscaping materials for careful passive solar choices include hardscape building material and &quot;softscape&quot; plants. The use of landscape design principles for selection of trees, hedges, and trellis-pergola features with vines; all can be used to create summer shading. For winter solar gain it is desirable to use deciduous plants that drop their leaves in the autumn gives year round passive solar benefits. Non-deciduous evergreen shrubs and trees can be windbreaks, at variable heights and distances, to create protection and shelter from winter wind chill. Xeriscaping with &#x27;mature size appropriate&#x27; native species of-and drought tolerant plants, drip irrigation, mulching, and organic gardening practices reduce or eliminate the need for energy-and-water-intensive irrigation, gas powered garden equipment, and reduces the landfill waste footprint. Solar powered landscape lighting and fountain pumps, and covered swimming pools and plunge pools with solar water heaters can reduce the impact of such amenities.

==Other passive solar principles==

===Passive solar lighting===

Passive solar lighting techniques enhance taking advantage of natural illumination for interiors, and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems.

This can be achieved by careful building design, orientation, and placement of window sections to collect light. Other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building. Window sections should be adequately sized, and to avoid over-illumination can be shielded with a Brise soleil, awnings, well placed trees, glass coatings, and other passive and active devices.

Another major issue for many window systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss. Whilst high mounted clerestory window and traditional skylights can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building, unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control. Thus, energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating HVAC systems to maintain thermal comfort.

Various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to window coverings, insulated glazing and novel materials such as aerogel semi-transparent insulation, optical fiber embedded in walls or roof, or hybrid solar lighting at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Reflecting elements, from active and passive daylighting collectors, such as light shelves, lighter wall and floor colors, mirrored wall sections, interior walls with upper glass panels, and clear or translucent glassed hinged doors and sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside. The light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources. In traditional Japanese architecture the Shōji sliding panel doors, with translucent Washi screens, are an original precedent. International style, Modernist and Mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial, commercial, and residential applications.

===Passive solar water heating===
There are many ways to use solar thermal energy to heat water for domestic use. Different active-and-passive solar hot water technologies have different location-specific economic cost benefit analysis implications.

Fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical. It is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing, or very-cloudy, weather conditions. Other active solar water heating technologies, etc. may be more appropriate for some locations.

It is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being &quot;off grid&quot; and qualifies as sustainable. This is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps.

==Comparison to the Passive House standard in Europe==
There is growing momentum in Europe for the approach espoused by the Passive House (&quot;Passivhaus&quot; in German) Institute in Germany. Rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques, this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat, minimises energy usage, and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration. Most of the buildings built to the Passive House standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small (typically 1 kW) incorporated heating component.

The energy design of Passive House buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) which is updated periodically. The current version is PHPP 9.6 (2018). A building may be certified as a &quot;Passive House&quot; when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria, the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kWh/m2a.

==Comparison to the Zero heating building ==
With advances in ultra low U-value glazing a Passive House-based (nearly) zero heating building is proposed to supersede the nearly-zero energy buildings in EU. The zero heating building reduces on the passive solar design and makes the building more opened to conventional architectural design.
The annual specific heat demand for the zero-heating house should not exceed 3 kWh/m2a. Zero heating building is simpler to design and to operate. For example: there is no need for modulated sun shading in zero-heating houses.

==Design tools==
Traditionally a heliodon was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year. In modern times, computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data (including site impacts such as overshadowing and physical obstructions) to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year. GPS-based smartphone applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device. These design tools provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions, design elements and orientation prior to construction. Energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process. There is no such thing as a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations.

==Levels of application==

Many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance, comfort or usability. This is done using good siting and window positioning, small amounts of thermal mass, with good-but-conventional insulation, weatherization, and an occasional supplementary heat source, such as a central radiator connected to a (solar) water heater. Sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its thermal mass. This will then radiate heat into the building in the evening. External shading, or a radiant barrier plus air gap, may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain.

An extension of the &quot;passive solar&quot; approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling. These designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat, and convey it to a seasonal thermal store for use months later during the cold season (&quot;annualised passive solar.&quot;) Increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or earth coupling. Anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority. The approach also can move cooling into the warm season. Examples:

* Passive Annual Heat Storage (PAHS) – by John Hait
* Annualized Geothermal Solar (AGS) heating – by Don Stephen
* Earthed-roof

A &quot;purely passive&quot; solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit, relying instead on energy captured from sunshine, only supplemented by &quot;incidental&quot; heat energy given off by lights, computers, and other task-specific appliances (such as those for cooking, entertainment, etc.), showering, people and pets. The use of natural convection air currents (rather than mechanical devices such as fans) to circulate air is related, though not strictly solar design. Passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers, insulating shutters, shades, awnings, or reflectors. Some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow. A reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance. A heat pump might use 1 J for every 4 J it delivers giving a COP of 4. A system that only uses a 30 W fan to more-evenly distribute 10 kW of solar heat through an entire house would have a COP of 300.

Passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective zero energy building. Although a ZEB uses multiple passive solar building design concepts, a ZEB is usually not purely passive, having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as: wind turbine, photovoltaics, micro hydro, geothermal, and other emerging alternative energy sources. Passive solar is also a core building design strategy for passive survivability, along with other passive strategies.

===Passive solar design on skyscrapers===
There has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency. Because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments, yet require large amounts of energy to operate, there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques. One study, which analyzed the proposed 22 Bishopsgate tower in London, found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains, by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration, usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building, and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain. Indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness (from 20 to 30 cm), using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss, dedicating 15–20% of floor area for thermal storage, and implementing a Trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space. Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer, and allow it in the winter, and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months.

Another study analyzed double-green skin facade (DGSF) on the outside of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. Such a green facade, or vegetation covering the outer walls, can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as 80%, as discovered by the researchers.

In more temperate climates, strategies such as glazing, adjustment of window-to-wall ratio, sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings, in the 30% to 60% range.
