<text>The California League is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in California. Having been classified at various levels throughout its existence, it operated at Class A-Advanced from 1990 until its demotion to Single-A following Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the Low-A West before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, league attendance continued to increase each season, with over one million fans attending games per year, part of a general nationwide growth and expansion to smaller towns, cities, and regions below those in the National League or American League with Minor League Baseball at various levels of play in growing popularity in the last few decades.

==History==
There were various attempts in the late 1800s and early 1900s to form a &quot;California League&quot; on the West Coast, considering the distance of the two current major leagues which generally had teams only in the Northeast and were restricted at first until World War I by long-distance train travel. The first organized California League lasted from 1887 to 1889, then another followed in 1891, and 1893, and finally in 1899–1902. After the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, an organization of minor leagues was formed in 1902, (following the &quot;truce&quot; and agreements between the older National League of 1876 and the newly &quot;upstart&quot; American League of 1901), the California League operated outside the NAPBL system as an independent league in 1902 and again from 1907 to 1909. This led to huge differences in the quality of teams competing with each other. In 1907, the San Francisco team was 3–34, while later in 1908 San Francisco was 9–67 and Oakland was 4–71. Oakland and San Francisco competed in every year of these various state leagues, with San Francisco having two teams during 1887–88.

The latest version of the California League was founded in 1941, and included teams in Anaheim, Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, and Stockton. The following year, as a result of World War II, the league dropped to four teams, then ceased and suspended operations altogether, although major league baseball and some minor leagues continued as much as possible with limited availability of players during the war years. It reorganized and came back in 1946, adding teams in Visalia, San Jose, and Ventura by 1947. Further east, Reno, Nevada joined the league in 1955 with the movement of the old Channel Cities Oilers in Santa Barbara and continued as a member for 37 years.

Though nicknames and affiliations shifted, the California League&#x27;s postwar configuration was largely stable by the late 1950s; four of the six cities in the league in 1960 would still be part of the league 50 years later. The league reached eight clubs in 1966 and would hold that for ten years, briefly dipped to six before wavering between eight and nine clubs in the early eighties, then reached ten in 1986 and held that configuration for thirty-one seasons. From 1996 to 2016, the league had a remarkably stable alignment for Class A baseball, with no teams moving or folding for twenty-one years. After the 2016 season, the Bakersfield Blaze, long dogged by inadequate facilities and unable to negotiate significant repairs, and the High Desert Mavericks, suffering from falling attendance and a lease dispute with the city of Adelanto, were folded; the High-A level replaced them by expanding the Carolina League to ten teams.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the California League was demoted to Low-A and temporarily renamed the &quot;Low-A West&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Low-A West was renamed the California League, and the Low-A classification was renamed Single-A effective with the 2022 season.

<doc id="70295" wikidata="Q1135481" url="?curid=70295" title="Carolina League">
<text>The Carolina League is a Minor League Baseball league which has operated along the Atlantic Coast of the United States since 1945. Having been classified at various levels throughout its existence, it operated at Class A-Advanced from 1990 until its demotion to Single-A following Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the Low-A East before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.

The organization that later became the Carolina League formed in 1945, just as World War II was ending, and consisted of eight teams, six from North Carolina and two from southern Virginia. This later grew to as many as 12 teams at times.

==History==
The Carolina League was announced on October 29, 1944, after an organizational meeting at Durham, North Carolina. It was a successor to the Class D Bi-State League that existed before World War II. The league began play in 1945 with eight teams based in Burlington, Durham, Greensboro, Leaksville, Raleigh, Winston-Salem (all from North Carolina), along with Danville and Martinsville from Virginia.

A few of the many Carolina League players who have gone on to star in the Major Leagues are: Johnny Bench (Peninsula, 1966), Wade Boggs (Winston-Salem, 1977), Barry Bonds (Prince William, 1985), Rod Carew (Wilson, 1966), Dock Ellis (Kinston, 1965), Dwight Evans (Winston-Salem, 1971), Dwight Gooden (Lynchburg, 1983), Zack Greinke (Wilmington, 2003), Andruw Jones (Durham, 1996), Chipper Jones (Durham, 1992), Willie McCovey (Danville, 1956), Joe Morgan (Durham, 1963), Dave Parker (Salem, 1972), Tony Pérez (Rocky Mount, 1962), Andy Pettitte (Prince William, 1993), Jorge Posada (Prince William, 1993), Darryl Strawberry (Lynchburg, 1981), Bernie Williams (Prince William, 1988), and Carl Yastrzemski (Raleigh, 1959).

Director and screenwriter Ron Shelton&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, starring Kevin Costner, Tim Robbins, and Susan Sarandon, depicted a fictionalized account of the Durham Bulls, at that time a Carolina League team (they have since become a Class AAA team in the International League). Before he began making films, Shelton had a five-year minor league career in the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; organization, which included a stint in the International League.

The Carolina League added two expansion teams for the 2017 season to fill two vacant spots at the Class A-Advanced level previously occupied by the California League&#x27;s Bakersfield Blaze and High Desert Mavericks, which ceased operations at the end of the 2016 season. These additional teams were the Down East Wood Ducks in Kinston, North Carolina, and the Buies Creek Astros in Buies Creek, North Carolina. After the 2018 season, the Buies Creek Astros relocated to Fayetteville, North Carolina as the Fayetteville Woodpeckers. After the 2019 season, the Potomac Nationals relocated within Northern Virginia to Fredericksburg, rebranding themselves as the Fredericksburg Nationals.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Carolina League was demoted to Single-A and temporarily renamed the &quot;Low-A East&quot; for the 2021 season. In the realignment process, the Frederick Keys were demoted out of professional baseball, the Wilmington Blue Rocks and Winston-Salem Dash were shifted to the South Atlantic League (retaining their High-A status), and five teams were moved from the old SAL to bring the CL to twelve member teams. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Carolina League name was restored effective with the 2022 season.

In July 2024, MiLB announced that the Hickory Crawdads will join the Carolina League in 2025, replacing the Down East Wood Ducks.

<text>The Tucson Padres were a Minor League Baseball team based in Tucson, Arizona, that competed in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). They were the Triple-A affiliate for the San Diego Padres. The team moved to Tucson from Portland, Oregon, for the 2011 season. In April 2014, the team moved to El Paso, Texas, and changed their name to the El Paso Chihuahuas.

==Franchise history==
Following the 2010 season, the Portland Beavers were put up for sale after PGE Park (now  Providence Park) was remodeled into a soccer-only configuration for the MLS&#x27;s 2011 expansion Portland Timbers. In 2010, the Beavers were sold to Jeff Moorad, principal owner of the San Diego Padres.

===The Move to Tucson===
On October 19, 2010, it was announced a site in Escondido, California had been selected for the new home of the Portland Beavers. The new ballpark was scheduled to open in April 2013. Until the move to Escondido could be completed the Padres would play their home games at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. In May 2011, citing reasons of proposed redevelopment revenue confiscation by the State, the ballpark plans in Escondido were placed on indefinite hold.

===Franchise sale===
Following the California Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to uphold the 2011 decision by the State to abolish redevelopment agencies it was decided by the Mayor of Escondido, Sam Abed, the city would not be able to build the proposed stadium. In reaction Jeff Moorad announced he would sell the team if a location within the San Diego area could not be found. No sites materialized and in December 2011, Moorad decided to place the Tucson Padres up for sale. By December 2011, Moorad had received offers from buyers in three cities outside California. No offers surfaced to keep the team in Tucson. As a result, the Padres played in Tucson for the 2012 season and, in July 2012, announced they would remain in Tucson for the 2013 season as well.

===Relocation to El Paso===
On July 30, 2012, the Pacific Coast League gave preliminary approval to MountainStar Sports Group, an ownership group based out of El Paso, Texas, for the purchase of the Tucson Padres. The final sale of the Padres to MountainStar Sports was approved on September 26, 2012. On October 22, 2013 in front of a capacity crowd inside the historic Plaza Theater in Downtown El Paso, the MountainStar Sports Group announced that the team would officially be renamed as the El Paso Chihuahuas.

<text>The Florida State League (FSL) is a Minor League Baseball league based in the state of Florida. Having been classified at various levels throughout its existence, it operated at Class A-Advanced from 1990 until its demotion to Single-A following Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the Low-A Southeast before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.

Each league member is affiliated with a Major League Baseball (MLB) team, and most play in their affiliate&#x27;s spring training facility.

==History==
The league originated in 1919 with teams in Bartow, Bradenton, Lakeland, Orlando, Sanford, and Tampa, Florida. The league closed down in 1928 and resumed play in 1936. It has continued uninterrupted, except for a four-year (1942–1945) suspension during World War II.

Initially, the FSL was classified as a Class D circuit, roughly equivalent to a Rookie-level league today. It was elevated to Class C from 1921 to 1924, roughly equivalent to an Advanced Rookie league in the pre-2021 classification system and a Rookie-level league today. It reverted to Class D from 1925 to 1928. The league went dormant from 1929 to 1935 but was revived as a Class D circuit from 1936 to 1941. After another period of inactivity from 1942 to 1945, it continued at Class D from 1946 to 1962. 

When the minor leagues were reconfigured in 1963, the FSL was reclassified as a Class A league, placing it three steps below the majors. There it continued until the next reorganization in 1990 when it was elevated to Class A-Advanced, remaining at the third rung on the minor league ladder. 

The championship series&#x27; first cancellation was in 2001, when playoffs were canceled after the September 11 attacks. Afterwards, the 2004 playoffs were canceled due to the threat of Hurricane Ivan. Years later, the 2017 FSL Championship finals were canceled on September 5, due to the threat of Hurricane Irma. The winners of the division series playoff games were named co-champions. This marked the third time since 2000 that the championship series game was canceled. In 2019, the end of the season and playoffs were cancelled due to the threat of Hurricane Dorian.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Florida State League was demoted to Single-A, four rungs below the majors, and temporarily renamed the &quot;Low-A Southeast&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Low-A Southeast was renamed the Florida State League effective with the 2022 season.

<doc id="70298" wikidata="Q1135495" url="?curid=70298" title="Midwest League">
<text>The Midwest League is a Minor League Baseball league established in 1947 and based in the Midwestern United States. A Class A league for most of its history, the league was promoted to High-A as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues.

The Midwest League began as the Illinois State League (1947–1948) and then became the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League (1949–1955). In 1956, the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League was renamed the Midwest League. The circuit temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the High-A Central before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.

The Lansing Lugnuts and Wisconsin Timber Rattlers franchises jointly have won the most Midwest League championships, with nine each.

==History==
The Midwest League directly evolved from two earlier leagues in the region. In 1947, the Class D Illinois State League (ISL) began operation with six Illinois teams: the Belleville Stags, Centralia Cubs, Marion Indians, Mattoon Indians, Mount Vernon Braves, and West Frankfort Cardinals. In 1949, the ISL changed its name to the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League after Marion moved their franchise to Kentucky and became the Paducah Chiefs. In 1954, the Mississippi-Ohio Valley League expanded, adding teams in Clinton and Dubuque, Iowa. The Mississippi-Ohio Valley League was then renamed Midwest League in 1956.

The original teams in 1956, the first year of Midwest League play, were: Clinton Pirates, Decatur Commodores, Dubuque Packers, Kokomo Dodgers, Lafayette Red Sox, Mattoon Phillies, Michigan City White Caps and the Paris Lakers. Mattoon is the oldest franchise in the MWL, evolving into today&#x27;s Fort Wayne TinCaps, while Clinton is the oldest MWL locale.

In 1960, the Davenport, Iowa based Quad City Braves joined the league as an expansion team. In 1962, Appleton, Burlington, and Cedar Rapids joined the Midwest League from the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League which folded operations when those franchises switched leagues. All those franchised remain in the league today. In 1963, the Midwest League was designated as a Class A league, after the minor league classification structure was reorganized.

The 1975 Waterloo Royals, led by future MLB All-Stars Willie Wilson and Dan Quisenberry, are ranked #60 on MiLB.com&#x27;s Top 100 Teams. The Royals finished the season 93–35.

In 1976, the Midwest League contracted from ten teams to eight, as franchises in Danville and Dubuque were eliminated. In 1982, the league expanded from 8 to 12 teams, adding the Beloit Brewers, the Danville Suns, the Madison Muskies, and the Springfield Cardinals. The Peoria Suns relocated from Danville in 1983, and acquired their current name, Peoria Chiefs, the following year. In 1988, the league began splitting its season into two halves and expanded from 12 to 14 teams, with the addition of franchises in South Bend, Indiana, and Rockford, Illinois. During the 1990s several teams changed cities as Major League Baseball placed higher standards on minor league baseball facilities; franchises in smaller cities were sold to new owners who moved those teams to new ballparks in larger cities. Kenosha, Madison, Rockford, Springfield, Waterloo, and Wausau lost teams during this decade while Battle Creek, Dayton, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids (West Michigan), Kane County, and Lansing gained teams.

The 1978 Appleton Foxes are ranked #93 on the Top-100 All Time teams by MiLB.com. Led by future Cy Young Award winner LaMarr Hoyt, the team finished 97–40. Harry Chappas, Ross Baumgarten and Britt Burns were all called up to the parent Chicago White Sox at the conclusion of the MWL season. The 97 wins by the Foxes remains a Midwest League record.

The Fort Wayne TinCaps are the oldest franchise in the league, having begun as the Mattoon Indians in 1947 and playing in Keokuk, Iowa; Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin; and Kenosha, Wisconsin, before moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1993. The Clinton LumberKings have been in one city longer than any Midwest League team, having called Clinton, Iowa, home since 1954.

The Southwest Michigan Devil Rays moved to Midland, Michigan, and became the Great Lakes Loons prior to the 2007 season.

On September 2, 2008, Minor League Baseball announced that two teams would transfer from the fellow Class A South Atlantic League to the Midwest League: the Lake County Captains (an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians playing in Eastlake, Ohio) and the Bowling Green Hot Rods (an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays playing in Bowling Green, Kentucky).

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.

As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Midwest League was promoted to High-A, reduced to 12 teams, and temporarily renamed the &quot;High-A Central&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the High-A Central was renamed the Midwest League effective with the 2022 season.

<text>The South Atlantic League, often informally called the Sally League, is a Minor League Baseball league with teams predominantly in states along the Atlantic coast of the United States from New York to Georgia. A Class A league for most of its history, the league was promoted to High-A as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the High-A East before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.

A number of different leagues known as the South Atlantic League (SAL) have existed since 1904. The most recent SAL adopted the moniker in 1980, having previously been the Western Carolinas League, founded in 1963. All of these have been nicknamed &quot;Sally League&quot;.

==History==

There have been several South Atlantic Leagues in the history of minor league baseball, spanning from 1904 to the present with a few breaks. The league ran from 1904 to 1917 as a class C league, then started up again in 1919, also class C. This time it ran from 1919 to 1930, moving up to class B beginning in 1921. William G. Bramham became league president in mid-1924 and served until 1930. The league was restarted again as a class B from 1936 to 1942, shut down as a result of World War II, and returned in 1946 as a class A league. The AA Southern Association (which never integrated) died after the 1961 season and so the SAL was promoted to AA in 1963 to take its place; a year later the name was changed to the Southern League. Out of the 51 seasons of operation, Augusta, Georgia competed in 46, Macon, Georgia was around for 46, and Columbia, South Carolina was in 45. Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; and Columbus, Georgia; each competed for at least 29 years also, making for a relatively stable lineup.

The South Atlantic League name went unused for 16 years, but in 1980 the Western Carolinas League brought back the name when it sought to change its identity. For nearly 60 years, 1948 through 2007, the dominant figure in the WCL/SAL was league founder and president John Henry Moss, who started the WCL as a young man in 1948, refounded it in 1960 and then led it into the new century. Moss retired at the close of the 2007 South Atlantic League season. He died at age 90 on July 1, 2009, at Kings Mountain, North Carolina—a town where he had also been mayor for 23 years.

In 2005, the SAL had the highest attendance in 101 years with over 3,541,992 fans (while minor league baseball set a second straight record with 41,333,279 attendees). When the league last played a season, in 2019, it had 14 teams, divided into two divisions of seven clubs.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. 

As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the South Atlantic League was promoted to High-A and temporarily renamed the &quot;High-A East&quot; for the 2021 season. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the High-A East was renamed the South Atlantic League effective with the 2022 season.

In July 2024, MiLB announced that the Hub City Spartanburgers will join the South Atlantic League in 2025, replacing the Hickory Crawdads.

<doc id="70300" wikidata="Q1135467" url="?curid=70300" title="New York–Penn League">
<text>The New York–Penn League (NYPL) was a Minor League Baseball league that operated in the northeastern United States from 1939 to 2020. Classified as a Class A Short Season league, its season started in June, after major-league teams signed their amateur draft picks to professional contracts, and ended in early September.

In 2019, its last season of operation, the NYPL had 14 teams from eight different states. In addition to New York and Pennsylvania, from which the league drew its name, the NYPL also had clubs in Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont, West Virginia, and Connecticut.

The Brooklyn Cyclones were the last NYPL champions, defeating the Lowell Spinners, two games to one, in 2019. The Oneonta Yankees/Tigers won 12 championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Auburn Mets/Twins/Phillies/Doubledays (8) and Jamestown Falcons/Expos (7).

==History==
The New York–Penn League was founded in 1939 as the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League, generally shortened to PONY League, in a hotel in Batavia, New York. The original teams included the Batavia Clippers, Bradford Bees, Hamilton Red Wings, Jamestown Jaguars, Niagara Falls Rainbows, and Olean Oilers; all were based in or near Western New York. The Oilers, a Brooklyn Dodgers affiliate, won both the regular season and playoff championships. Batavia was the last remaining charter city in the league when it ceased operations after the 2020 season.

The Hamilton Red Wings folded early in the 1956 season, and with no more teams in Ontario, the circuit became the New York–Penn League in 1957. The league crossed back into Canada with the formation of the St. Catharines Blue Jays in 1986. They were joined by the Hamilton Redbirds in 1987 and the Welland Pirates in 1989, but all three clubs had moved back to the United States by 2000.

The New York–Penn circuit was originally a Class D league (the minors&#x27; lowest classification through 1962). It was a full-season Class A league from 1963 through 1966, and became a short-season Class A league in 1967.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30.

=== In popular media ===
&quot;Good Enough to Dream&quot; is a memoir by renowned baseball writer Roger Kahn, published in 1985. The book chronicles Kahn&#x27;s experience as the owner of the Utica Blue Sox during the 1983 season. &quot;Good Enough to Dream&quot; was the recipient of the Casey Award in 1985.

&quot;Clubbie&quot; is a 2021 memoir by Greg Larson that recounts his experiences as a clubhouse attendant (or &quot;clubbie&quot;) for the Aberdeen IronBirds during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. The book&#x27;s depiction of players&#x27; financial struggles is widely credited with inspiring changes to long-standing minor league compensation structures.

===Disbanding===
On December 9, 2020, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced its list of 120 teams invited to be a part of the minors after restructuring for the 2021 season. As first reported in 2019, the NYPL ceased operations. The Aberdeen IronBirds, Brooklyn Cyclones, and Hudson Valley Renegades joined the new High-A East, becoming the new High-A affiliates of the Baltimore Orioles, New York Mets, and New York Yankees respectively. The Mahoning Valley Scrappers, State College Spikes, West Virginia Black Bears, and Williamsport Crosscutters moved to the new MLB Draft League for players wishing to showcase themselves to MLB teams in advance of the annual draft. The Tri-City ValleyCats moved to the independent Frontier League, while the Batavia Muckdogs and Auburn Doubledays joined the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League. On February 25, 2021, the Vermont Lake Monsters announced that they would join the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) under new ownership, and the Norwich Sea Unicorns joined the FCBL in late April. The Staten Island Yankees folded, while the Lowell Spinners were left without future plans and eventually folded.

===Final franchises===

==Champions==
League champions were determined by different means during the New York–Penn League&#x27;s 82-year run from 1939 to 2020. For a few seasons in the 1960s and 1970s, no playoffs were held and the league champions were simply the regular season pennant winners. Most seasons, however, ended with playoffs to determine a league champion.

The Oneonta Tigers won 12 championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Auburn Mets/Twins/Phillies/Doubledays (8) and Jamestown Falcons/Expos (7).

<text>The Northwest League is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the Northwestern United States and Western Canada. A Class A Short Season league for most of its history, the league was promoted to High-A as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league operated as the High-A West in 2021, then resumed its original moniker in 2022.

==History==
The Northwest League (or the &quot;Northwestern League&quot;) has existed in various forms since 1890, and has been in its current incarnation since 1955. The current NWL is the descendant of the Western International League (WIL), a Class B league from 1937 to 1951 (with a stoppage during World War II) and Class A from 1952 to 1954. The league reformed as the Northwest League and dropped to Class B for the 1955 season. The WIL had ten teams in its final season, with four in Canada. 

In 1955, the Northwest League was formed, with seven charter teams: Salem Senators, Eugene Emeralds, Yakima Bears, Spokane Indians, Tri-City Braves, Wenatchee Chiefs, and Lewiston Broncs. The league switched to the short season schedule in 1966;
between then and 1982, the NWL fluctuated between four, six, and eight clubs. In 1983, the league returned to an eight-team circuit, which it maintained through 2019.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Northwest League was promoted to High-A, reduced to six teams, and renamed the &quot;High-A West&quot; for the 2021 season. The two dropped teams were the Boise Hawks and Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. Following MLB&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the High-A West was renamed the Northwest League in 2022.

==Current teams==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;


==Champions==
League champions have been determined by different means since the Northwest League&#x27;s formation in 1955. Except for 1956, 1960, and from 1966 to 1973, all seasons have ended with playoffs to determine a league champion.

The Spokane Indians have won 9 championships, the most in the league.

<text>The Appalachian League is a collegiate summer baseball league that operates in the Appalachian regions of Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. Designed for rising freshmen and sophomores using wooden bats, its season runs from June through August. The league is part of Major League Baseball and USA Baseball&#x27;s Prospect Development Pipeline. 

Between 1911 and 2020, the Appalachian League operated as part of Minor League Baseball and various of its teams were low-level affiliates of Major League Baseball franchises. It operated as a Class D league during four stints through 1962, then was classified as an Rookie Advanced league from 1963 to 2020.

==History==
The original Appalachian League existed for four seasons from 1911 to 1914 and was classified as a Class D circuit. All teams were independent with no Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliation in the era. The charter Appalachian League teams were the Asheville Moonshiners, Bristol Boosters, Cleveland Counts, Johnson City Soldiers, Knoxville Appalachians, and Morristown Jobbers, playing in the inaugural season. After a six-year absence, the league reorganized for five seasons from 1921 to 1925, and, as before, it consisted entirely of independent teams at the Class D level. Following an 11-year period of inactivity, the third iteration of the Class D Appalachian League played from 1937 to 1955. The league went dormant in 1956, but was revived in 1957.

Along with a reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 1963, the Appalachian League reformed and was classified as a Rookie-level league. In its final years as an MLB-affiliated league, the Appalachian League was one of two &quot;Rookie Advanced&quot; minor leagues along with the Pioneer League. As such, it occupied the second-lowest rung in the minor league ladder. 
Although classified as a Rookie league, the level of play was slightly higher than that of the two &quot;complex&quot; Rookie leagues, the Gulf Coast League and Arizona League. Unlike the complex leagues, Appalachian League teams charged admission and sold concessions. It was almost exclusively the first fully professional league in which many players competed; most of the players had just been signed out of high school and were further along in their development than players in the &quot;complex&quot; leagues. It was a short-season league that competed from late June (when major league teams signed players whom they selected in the amateur draft) to early September.

It continued to operate as a Rookie Advanced league through 2020, with the start of the 2020 season postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled. Thus, 2019 was the Appalachian League&#x27;s last season of operation within Minor League Baseball, with the Johnson City Cardinals winning the league championship. Entering the 2021 Major League Baseball season, MLB stated that 29 of its 30 teams had players who had played in the Appalachian League when it was part of Minor League Baseball, with a total of 139 such players on Opening Day rosters.

In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Appalachian League was converted to an amateur collegiate summer baseball league designed for rising freshmen and sophomores. The reconfigured league become a part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Prospect Development Pipeline, a collaboration between MLB and USA Baseball. It is scheduled to play a 48-game regular season and continue to host an annual All-Star Game. Each of the league&#x27;s 10 cities will continue to host teams in the new configuration of the Appalachian League.

==Champions==

League champions have been determined by different means since the Appalachian League&#x27;s formation in 1911. Before 1984, the champions were usually the league pennant winners. With only a few early exceptions, champions since 1984 have been the winner of postseason playoffs.

==Hall of Fame==
The league established a hall of fame in 2019; through 2022 elections, 46 people have been inducted. Members of the 2021 Hall of Fame induction class included Orlando Cepeda, Dotty Cox, Mahlon Luttrell, Joe Mauer, Ron Necciai, and Jimmy Rollins.

<text>The Pioneer Baseball League (also known as simply the Pioneer League) is a professional baseball league based in the Western United States. It operates as one of four Major League Baseball (MLB) Partner Leagues in the American independent baseball league system without MLB team affiliations. The league is contested by twelve teams from the Northern California and Rocky Mountains regions, who play a regular season split into two halves. The top two teams at the end of each half qualify for a postseason tournament that determines the overall champion. 

The Pioneer League was established in 1939 as a Class C minor league consisting of six teams from Idaho and Utah. It later expanded to Montana as part of a failed effort in the 1950s to become a third major league rivalling the American and National leagues, complicated by competition with the Pacific Coast League. By the time it was reclassified as a Rookie league in 1964, only four teams in Idaho remained. Gradually, it returned to Montana and Utah, and expanded into Colorado and the Canadian province of Alberta by 1974, and since then has consistently had eight or more teams competing. In 2021, the league became independent, and ceased all MLB team affiliations, reorganizing as an MLB Partner League representing the Western United States market. An expansion into California followed in 2024.

As of the 2024 season, four teams from Montana, three from Colorado, two from California and Idaho each, and one from Utah compete in the Pioneer League. Nineteen franchises have competed in the league across its -year history, with the Missoula PaddleHeads, a current team that joined as the Pocatello Cardinals in the inaugural season, being the longest-tenured. The Ogden Raptors are the current champions, while the Billings Mustangs, also a current team, have won the most championships (15).

== History ==

The Pioneer League began in 1939 with six teams in Idaho and Utah, operating at the Class C level. The original six teams were the Boise Pilots, Lewiston Indians, Ogden Reds, Pocatello Cardinals, Salt Lake City Bees, and Twin Falls Cowboys. With players in short supply due to World War II, the league suspended operations for the 1943 through 1945 seasons.

In 1948, the league expanded by adding two teams in Montana; the Billings Mustangs and Great Falls Electrics. In these early years, teams in the league either operated independently or were affiliated with Major League Baseball (MLB) or Pacific Coast League (PCL) parent clubs, as the PCL was attempting to grow into a third major league (a bid that ultimately failed). When MLB&#x27;s Los Angeles Dodgers displaced the PCL&#x27;s Hollywood Stars in 1958, the Stars relocated and became the &quot;new&quot; Salt Lake City Bees, remaining in the PCL and taking away the Pioneer League&#x27;s largest market.

By 1959, the Pioneer League was down to six teams; Billings and Great Falls along with the Boise Braves, Idaho Falls Russets, Missoula Timberjacks, and Pocatello Athletics. The league operated at the Class A level for one year (1963), before changing to Rookie league in 1964, when there were only four teams in the league; the Idaho Falls Angels, Magic Valley Cowboys, Pocatello Chiefs, and Treasure Valley Cubs. By 1978, the league had again grown to eight teams — Billings and Idaho Falls along with the Butte Copper Kings, Calgary Cardinals, Great Falls Giants, Helena Phillies, Lethbridge Dodgers, and Medicine Hat Blue Jays. With the exception of 1986 (when there were six teams), there have been at least eight teams in the league since then.

In 2016, total league attendance was 616,686, down slightly from the 2015 total of 633,622.

In its final years as an MLB-affiliated league, the Pioneer League was one of two &quot;Rookie Advanced&quot; minor leagues along with the Appalachian League. As such, it occupied the second-lowest rung in the minor league ladder. 
Although classified as a Rookie league, the level of play was slightly higher than that of the two &quot;complex&quot; Rookie leagues, the Gulf Coast League and Arizona League. Unlike the complex leagues, Pioneer League teams charged admission and sold concessions. It was almost exclusively the first fully professional league in which many players competed; most of the players had just been signed out of high school. It was a short-season league that competed from late June (when Major League teams signed players whom they selected in the amateur draft) to early September.

After the 2018 season, the Helena Brewers relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where they now play as the Rocky Mountain Vibes.

As the start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30, making the 2019 season the league&#x27;s last as an MLB-affiliated league of Minor League Baseball.

In conjunction with the reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Pioneer League was converted to an independent baseball league and was granted status as an MLB Partner League. The reconfigured league continued with the same franchises using the same identities, with the exception of the Orem Owlz who relocated to Windsor, Colorado, as the Northern Colorado Owlz. The Boise Hawks also joined the Pioneer League in 2021 after moving from the Northwest League.

The Pioneer League announced a five-year naming rights deal between the league and ticket vendor TicketSmarter that would have the league go as The Pioneer Baseball League presented by TicketSmarter starting in time for the 2022 season.

On April 10, 2024, Kelsie Whitmore signed with the Oakland Ballers of the Pioneer League. She became the first woman to play for that league later that year. On June 6, 2024, she became the first female player to start a Pioneer League game. In that game she struck out one batter.

== Organization ==

Mike Shapiro is the current president of the Pioneer Baseball League, having been a senior executive in a wide range of professional sports including baseball, golf, basketball and hockey.

Jim McCurdy is the commissioner and a past president of the Pioneer Baseball League. McCurdy received his BBA from the University of Houston in 1970 and his JD from the University of Texas School of Law in 1974. He mediated the restructure of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s governing structure in 1992 and was an inaugural member of the MiLB board of trustees from 1992 to 1994. In 1993, he was appointed by the president of MiLB to serve on the Professional Baseball Executive Council. McCurdy was elevated to the position of league president in 1994, replacing Ralph Nelles who was the president from 1975 to 1993. McCurdy also teaches sports law courses at Gonzaga University School of Law and the University of San Diego School of Law. His publications include: Sports Law: Cases &amp; Materials (with Ray Yasser, C. Peter Goplerud, and Maureen Weston) (7th ed. LexisNexis 2011), &quot;Thunder on the Road from Seattle to Oklahoma City: Going from NOPA to ZOPA in the NBA, in&quot; Legal Issues in American Basketball ch. IV (Lewis Kurlantzick ed., Academica Press 2011), and, &quot;The Fundamental Nature of Professional Sports Leagues, Constituent Clubs, &amp; Mutual Duties to Protect Market Opportunities: Organized Baseball Case Study, in&quot; Legal Issues in Professional Baseball ch. IV (Lewis Kurlantzick ed., Academica Press 2005).

== Champions ==
League champions have been determined by different means since the Pioneer League&#x27;s formation in 1939. There were postseason playoffs when the league operated as Class C (1939–1962), except for 1939 and 1956, and for the three years during World War II when the league did not operate. In the league&#x27;s one year as Class A (1963), there were also postseason playoffs. After becoming a Rookie league in 1964, the league champions were simply the regular season pennant winners through 1977. Since 1978, postseason playoffs have again been held to determine a league champion.

<text>USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; (CVN-76) is a , nuclear-powered supercarrier in the service of the United States Navy. The ninth ship of her class, she is named in honor of Ronald Reagan, President of the United States from 1981 to 1989. She was built at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, and was commissioned on 12 July 2003.

&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; made five deployments to the Pacific and Middle East between 2006 and 2011 while based at Naval Air Station North Island. In October 2015, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; replaced as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 5, the only forward-based carrier strike group homeported at Yokosuka, Japan, as part of the United States Seventh Fleet. Since 2016, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; has embarked on short annual summer patrols of the Western Pacific in the United States Seventh Fleet area of operation.

==Design and construction==

The contract to build &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was awarded to Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 8 December 1994 and her keel was laid down on 12 February 1998. The budget for the ship was increased several times and ultimately $4.5 billion was spent on her construction, including a redesigned ship island. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was christened by Reagan&#x27;s wife Nancy on 4 March 2001 at Newport News Shipbuilding; the crew moved aboard on 30 October 2002 and the ship was commissioned on 12 July 2003 at Naval Station Norfolk, with Captain J. W. Goodwin in command.

Vice President Dick Cheney and Second Lady Lynne Cheney were both present at the ceremony, along with Nancy Reagan, who gave the ship&#x27;s crew the traditional first order as an active unit of the Navy: &quot;Man the ship and bring her to life.&quot; &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; made her maiden voyage on 21 July 2003. President Reagan, who did not attend either the launch or the commissioning due to his Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, died 11 months later. At the end of the graveside services, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer at that time, Captain James Symonds, at Mrs. Reagan&#x27;s request presented her the flag that draped the former president&#x27;s casket. This particular flag had flown over Capitol Hill on 20 January 1981 for Reagan&#x27;s first inauguration. At a later date, Captain Symonds also presented Mrs. Reagan the flag that had been flying over &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; when the former president died.

===Naming===
&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; is the first aircraft carrier and first nuclear-powered warship of any type to be named in honor of a living former president. Unlike most of the men honored by inclusion in this group, Reagan was not associated with the United States Navy, apart from his term as Commander-in-Chief, although one of his key initiatives in office was the 600-ship Navy program.

===Ship&#x27;s seal===
The &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s seal was designed entirely by her plankowner crew with historical assistance from staff members at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. The seal&#x27;s red border is similar to the distinctive red rim on the White House china designed for the Reagans during their White House years. Four gold stars represent Reagan as 40th US President and his four pillars of freedom: individual liberty, economic opportunity, global democracy, and national pride. &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; was a recurring theme of Reagan&#x27;s life in public service. The aircraft carrier is positioned on the West Coast, representing Reagan&#x27;s two terms as governor of California and the ship&#x27;s Pacific Fleet homeport. The three aircraft&#x27;s patriotic contrails symbolize the three major military operations during Reagan&#x27;s presidency: Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada/1983), Operation El Dorado Canyon (Libya/1986), and Operation Praying Mantis (Iran/1988). The view of the globe signifies Reagan&#x27;s vision of global democracy, and the center is the United States, representing the country&#x27;s national pride. Red, white, and blue dominate the seal, reflecting the American flag.

==Service history==
On 8 May 2004, following a five-month post-shakedown availability, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; received her second flight deck certification covering all flight operations, including aircraft launch and recovery, safety, crash and salvage, fuel certifications, and training. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; then transited from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, through the Strait of Magellan to her new homeport, Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, with Captain James A. Symonds in command.

Carrier Air Wing Eleven, normally assigned to , embarked 25% of its total strength for the transit. The squadrons making the transit were VFA-14 and VFA-41 flying the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, VAW-117 flying the E-2C Hawkeye 2000, HS-6 flying the SH-60F Seahawk, and VRC-30 flying the C-2A Greyhound. The ship visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 5 June 2004. During the first evening after arrival, the ship&#x27;s namesake, former President Reagan, died. A ceremony in his honor was held onboard later that evening, after the US national anthem was publicly played. Upon leaving Rio, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; transited the Strait of Magellan on 20–21 June and subsequently visited Valparaíso, Chile, and Callao, Peru, before arriving in San Diego on 23 July 2004. From 1 October 2004, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Fifteen.

During an anti-submarine warfare exercise in 2005, HSwMS &quot;Gotland&quot;, on loan from the Swedish Navy, managed to score multiple simulated attacks on &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; while undetected, showcasing that the submarine was in a position to sink the carrier. This prompted the U.S. Navy to extend their lease of the submarine following the exercise, for further study.

===2006 maiden deployment===
&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;, with Terry B. Kraft in command, departed San Diego on 4 January 2006 on her maiden deployment conducting naval operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf. On 28 January 2006, an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter attempting landing aboard &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; crashed into the ship&#x27;s flight deck while the ship was about southeast of Brisbane, Queensland. The aircraft struck the ramp, missed the third cable, and skidded overboard. The pilot ejected safely, but the aircraft was lost. While in Brisbane, the carrier&#x27;s main condensers became clogged with of jellyfish, causing problems in the main machinery rooms and hindering cooling of the main reactors. The ship entered the Persian Gulf on 22 February 2006, and returned from deployment on 6 July 2006.

===2007 surge deployment===
&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and her Carrier Strike Group (CSG) departed North Island, Coronado in San Diego on 27 January 2007 on an unscheduled surge deployment to the Western Pacific, in place of the forward deployed carrier while she underwent maintenance in Japan. On 20 April 2007, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and her CSG returned to Coronado. The &quot;surge deployment&quot; was part of the Navy&#x27;s Fleet Response Plan, which provides the US with the ability to respond to any global commitment with flexible and sustainable forces and the ability to rapidly respond to a range of situations on short notice.

In January 2007, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; earned the 2006 Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific Carrier Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; award for the West Coast, the first Battle &quot;E&quot; ever for the carrier.

&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; returned to Naval Air Station North Island on 20 April 2007, following a three-month deployment in support of operations in the Western Pacific.

On 15 December 2007, the carrier answered a distress call from a cruise ship off the coast of Baja California. An SH-60 helicopter airlifted an Illinois teenager whose appendix had ruptured while on a Mexican cruise to &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;, where the ship&#x27;s surgeon performed an emergency appendectomy.

===2008 deployment===
&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;, with CVW-14 embarked, departed San Diego on 19 May 2008, for a scheduled 7th Fleet and 5th Fleet deployment.

The &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; CSG performed humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the Philippines on 24 June 2008 after that country was devastated by Typhoon Fengshen, that killed hundreds from the central island regions and the main island of Luzon. The typhoon also capsized the passenger ferry MV &quot;Princess of the Stars&quot;. Working in support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and her escorts of CSG 7 focused their efforts on the island of Panay in the Central Visayas. For eight days, SH-60 Seahawk helicopters and C-2A Greyhound aircraft of the &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; CSG helped deliver more than of rice, fresh water, and other supplies to areas of Panay, which were not reachable by truck due to flooded roads. The mission in Panay earned the entire strike group the Navy&#x27;s Humanitarian Service Medal.

The CSG arrived in the U.S. Fifth Fleet area on 28 August 2008, where she launched more than 1,150 sorties into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; returned to San Diego on 25 November 2008.

On 25 September 2008, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;, while underway in the Gulf of Oman, played host to the rock band Creed. Over 1500 members of the ship&#x27;s crew crowded the flight deck to watch the band perform.

&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; received word in February 2009 that the ship had won her second Battle Efficiency Award.

===2009 deployment===
On 28 May 2009, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; deployed with Carrier Air Wing 14 to the 7th and 5th Fleet Areas of Responsibility. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; relieved the CSG and launched her first sorties in support of OEF on 6 July. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; returned to homeport on 21 October after a five-month deployment.

===2010===
In early 2010, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was awarded the 2009 Chief of Naval Operations Afloat Safety &quot;S&quot; Award, and the 2009 Pacific Fleet Battle &quot;E&quot; for combat efficiency. The Battle &quot;E&quot; award was &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s second consecutive and third Battle E in four years.

On 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard completed the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) maintenance cycle on &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;. This PIA project was under budget, and marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard&#x27;s largest off-site availability, as well as the largest public-sector work package ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island, Coronado, California. During the maintenance period, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; received technological upgrades for her next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment, improved ship&#x27;s laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the &#x27;One Shipyard&#x27; concept wherein the US Navy mobilizes its work force across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the US defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB). During peak manning, about 1,400 worked the project on a daily basis. This included rough 625 NNSY personnel, 165 PSNS employees, and 600 from SWRMC/NGSB.

On 18 May 2010, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; departed Naval Air Station North Island for sea trials. This was the final phase of the PIA, and was conducted to assess the carrier″s material readiness to return to the operational fleet. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; pulled into Naval Air Station North Island on 19 May 2010 after completing her two-day sea trial, marking the official end to the ship&#x27;s six-month PIA maintenance period.

On 2 June 2010, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;, with Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW-14) embarked, departed Naval Air Station North Island to conduct flight deck certifications. Embarked squadrons included: Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron 4 (HS-4), Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323 (VMFA-323), Strike Fighter Squadron 154 (VFA-154), Strike Fighter Squadron 147 (VFA-147), Strike Fighter Squadron 146 (VFA-146), Airborne Early Warning Squadron 113 (VAW-113) and Fleet Logistics Squadron 30 (VRC-30). The certification included a full evaluation of the arresting gear, steam catapults, and flight-deck personnel. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s air department was assessed on the ability to maintain a fully operational flight deck and respond to simulated mishaps.

During the summer of 2010, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; participated in Exercise RIMPAC, departed from Naval Air Station North Island, California, for a Board of Inspection and Survey assessment on 25 August 2010, and departed her homeport to conduct routine operations off the coast of southern California in preparation for her 2011 Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment. In November 2010, the ship provided emergency supplies and assistance to passengers stranded in the Pacific Ocean aboard the cruise ship , which had lost power due to an engine fire.

===2011 deployment===

The ship departed for an Asian deployment on 2 February 2011. On 11 March 2011, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was in the Korean peninsula region for a long-planned exercise off Korea, but was redirected towards Japan to provide support after the massive 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The ship, stationed off Sendai, served as a refueling station for Japanese coast guard and military helicopters on relief missions in the area. US Navy helicopters also flew relief missions from the carrier. On 13 March 2011, the ship measured 0.6 millirem/hr direct gamma shine from clouds 130 miles (≈210 km) from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Members of the crew later blamed their cancers on the event. On 14 March 2011, the ship was forced to relocate to avoid a radioactive plume from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents which had contaminated 17 crew members of three helicopter crews. On 23 March, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s crew performed radiation decontamination by scrubbing down any surface that could have been contaminated, including the island superstructure and flight deck, to remove any potential radiation hazards. On 4 April 2011, Japan&#x27;s minister of defense, Toshimi Kitazawa, accompanied by US ambassador to Japan John Roos, visited the ship to thank the crew for their assistance as part of Operation Tomodachi. Said Kitazawa, &quot;I have never been more encouraged by and proud of the fact that the United States is our ally.&quot; The ship returned to San Diego on 8 September 2011. In January 2011, the Navy announced that the aircraft carrier would be transferred to the Puget Sound Naval Ship Yard in Bremerton, Washington, for scheduled repair and maintenance beginning January 2012.

===2012 and 2013===

On 10 January 2012, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s official homeport was changed to Bremerton, Washington for a little over a year until returning to her homeport of San Diego on 21 March 2013. For the sailors being relocated, the Navy transported many privately-owned vehicles on the deck of the ship as a cost-saving measure.

===2014===
On 14 January 2014, the Navy announced that &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; would replace her sister ship as the Seventh Fleet forward deployed carrier at Yokosuka, Japan in 2015.

===2015 homeport change and patrol===
In 2015 &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; replaced &quot;George Washington&quot; as the US Navy&#x27;s only forward deployed aircraft carrier. In August, after a short patrol in the Pacific, &quot;George Washington&quot; docked in Naval Base San Diego alongside &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;. A hull swap occurred over ten days, in which the crews assigned to each carrier switched ships. This was done to minimize the number of sailors who would need to move between San Diego to Japan due to the change in homeports of the two carriers. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; effectively took her new place as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 5 and Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5). On 1 October 2015, she arrived in her newest homeport, Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture. CVW-5 was based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, which is also located in Kanagawa Prefecture. The ship was open for the public to tour on 12 October.

&quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; departed for her annual patrol of the Western Pacific on 15 October. On 29 October two Russian Tupolev Tu-142 bombers flew within one mile of the ship at low altitude. Four F/A-18 Super Hornets were scrambled in response. The ship conducted fleet exercises with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and Republic of Korea Navy. During a fleet review with the JMSDF, the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe visited the ship. The ship returned to Yokosuka on 3 December.

===2016 patrol===
On 4 June 2016, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; departed Yokosuka and was deployed with CSG 5 to the South China Sea before an international tribunal released its decision regarding a China and Philippines conflict. The ship returned after a 53-day cruise for a mid-cruise break and conducted Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) inspections designed to ensure the ship would last her full 50-year lifespan.

<doc id="70311" wikidata="Q1078150" url="?curid=70311" title="Maraschino cherry">
<text>A maraschino cherry ( ) is a preserved, sweetened cherry, typically made from light-colored sweet cherries such as the Royal Ann, Rainier, or Gold varieties. In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a brine solution usually containing sulfur dioxide and calcium chloride to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a suspension of food coloring (common red food dye is FD&amp;C Red 40), sugar syrup, and other components.

== Uses ==
Maraschino cherries are used in many alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, tequila sunrise, the Queen Mary and the Shirley Temple, giving them the nickname cocktail cherries. (This term is also used to refer to other varieties, including Amarena, Balaton, and Bing, when used for the same purpose, typically soaked in alcohol or sugar.) Sometimes the cherries, along with some of the maraschino syrup, are put into a glass of cola to make an old-fashioned or homemade cherry cola with a few brand name examples such as Coca-Cola&#x27;s &quot;Coca-Cola Cherry&quot;, Caruso&#x27;s Maraschino Cola and Goose Island&#x27;s Cherry Cola Stout.

As a garnish, they can be used to decorate frozen yogurt, baked ham, cakes, pastry, parfaits, milkshakes and ice cream sodas. They are an integral part of an American ice cream sundae, giving rise to the term &quot;cherry on top&quot; in more general usage. They are frequently included in canned fruit cocktail.

==Europe==
The name &quot;maraschino&quot; originates from the marasca cherry of Dalmatian origin and the maraschino liqueur made from it, in which marasca cherries were crushed and preserved after being pickled. Whole cherries preserved in this liqueur were known as &quot;maraschino cherries&quot;. This had been a local means of preserving the fruit in Dalmatia.

In the 19th century, these became popular in the rest of Europe, but the supply in Dalmatia was quite limited, so they became known as a delicacy for royalty and the wealthy. Because of the relative scarcity of the marasca, other cherries came to be preserved in various ways and sold as &quot;maraschino&quot;.

==United States==
The cherries were first introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, where they were served in fine bars and restaurants. Because they were scarce and expensive, by the turn of the century American producers were experimenting with other processes for preserving cherries, with flavors such as almond extract and substitute fruit like Queen Anne cherries. Among these, alcohol was already becoming less common.

In response, the USDA in 1912 defined &quot;maraschino cherries&quot; as &quot;marasca cherries preserved in maraschino&quot; under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The artificially-colored and sweetened Royal Anne variety were required to be called &quot;Imitation Maraschino Cherries&quot; instead. Food Inspection Decision 141 defined marasca cherries and maraschino themselves. It was signed on 17 Feb. 1912.

During Prohibition in the United States as of 1920, the decreasingly popular alcoholic variety was illegal as well. Ernest H. Wiegand, a professor of horticulture at Oregon State University (OSU), developed the modern method of manufacturing maraschino cherries using a brine solution rather than alcohol. Accordingly, most modern maraschino cherries have only a historical connection with maraschino liqueur.

According to Bob Cain, Cliff Samuels, and Hoya Yang, who worked with Wiegand at OSU, Prohibition had nothing to do with Wiegand&#x27;s research: his intention was to develop a better brining process for cherries that would not soften them. When Wiegand began his research, there were several ways to preserve maraschino cherries without alcohol, long before Prohibition went into effect. Wiegand took a process that people had their own recipes for—&quot;and who knows what they were putting in there&quot; (frequently not alcohol)—and turned it into a science, something replicable.

When Wiegand began his research, sodium metabisulfite was being used to preserve maraschino cherries. Some accounts indicate that this preservation method was being used long before Prohibition. Some manufacturers used maraschino or imitation liqueurs to flavor the cherries, but newspaper stories from the early part of the century suggest that many manufacturers stopped using alcohol and artificial dyes before Prohibition.

After Prohibition was repealed, lobbying by the non-alcoholic preserved cherry industry encouraged the Food and Drug Administration to revise federal policy toward canned cherries. It held a hearing in April 1939 to establish a new standard of identity. Since 1940, &quot;maraschino cherries&quot; have been defined as &quot;cherries which have been dyed red, infused with sugar, and packed in a sugar syrup flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor.&quot;

FD&amp;C Red Number 1 and 4, and FD&amp;C Yellow Number 1 through 4 were removed from the approved list in 1960. The ban on Red Number 4 was lifted in 1965 to allow the coloring of maraschino cherries, which by then were considered mainly decorative and not a foodstuff. In 1975, William F. Randolph of the FDA ruled that if an &quot;artificial bitter almond flavor or any synthetic flavor is used, the product must be labeled artificial or artificially flavored.&quot; The following year, the ban on Red No. 4 was reinstated.

, modern American maraschino cherries typically use FD&amp;C Red 40 as a colorant.

<text>Mary Frances &quot;Debbie&quot; Reynolds (April 1, 1932 – December 28, 2016) was an American actress, singer and entrepreneur. Her acting career spanned almost 70 years. Reynolds performed on stage and television and in films into her 80s.

She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer with her portrayal of Helen Kane in the 1950 film &quot;Three Little Words&quot;. Her breakout role was her first leading role, as Kathy Selden in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952). Her other successes include &quot;The Affairs of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1953), &quot;Susan Slept Here&quot; (1954), &quot;Bundle of Joy&quot; (1956 Golden Globe nomination), &quot;The Catered Affair&quot; (1956 National Board of Review Best Supporting Actress Winner), and &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot; (1957), in which her performance of the song &quot;Tammy&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts. In 1959, she starred in &quot;The Mating Game&quot; with Tony Randall, and released &quot;Debbie&quot;, her first pop music album. She starred in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) with Gene Kelly, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), and &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1964), where her performance as the famously boisterous &quot;Titanic&quot; passenger Margaret &quot;Molly&quot; Brown earned Reynolds an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Her other films include: &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; (1966), &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; (1967), &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Helen?&quot; (1971), &quot;Mother&quot; (1996; Golden Globe nomination) and &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997). She was known for voicing &quot;Charlotte A. Cavatica&quot; in &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973). Reynolds was also known as a cabaret performer; in 1979, she opened the Debbie Reynolds Dance Studio in North Hollywood.

Her television series &quot;The Debbie Reynolds Show&quot; earned her a Golden Globe nomination in 1969. She starred in the 1973 Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Irene&quot;, which earned her a Tony Award nomination for &quot;Best Leading Actress in a Musical.&quot; She was also nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for her performance in &quot;A Gift of Love&quot; (1999). After appearing in the popular early-2000s sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, Reynolds was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series&quot; for her role as Bobbi, the mother of Grace Adler. Reynolds would reach a new, younger audience with her role as Aggie Cromwell in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Halloweentown&quot; series. 

Reynolds also had several business ventures besides her dance studio, including a Las Vegas hotel and casino; she was also an avid collector of film memorabilia, beginning with items purchased at the landmark 1970 MGM auction. She served as president of The Thalians, an organization dedicated to mental health causes. After receiving the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2015 and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2016, she made her final film performance in the biographical retrospective &quot;Bright Lights&quot;. Reynolds died following a hemorrhagic stroke on December 28, 2016, one day after the death of her daughter, actress Carrie Fisher.

Mary Frances Reynolds was born on April 1, 1932, in El Paso, Texas, to Maxene N. &quot;Minnie&quot; Harman and Raymond Francis &quot;Ray&quot; Reynolds, a carpenter who worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad. She was of Scottish-Irish and English ancestry and was raised in a strict Nazarene church of her domineering mother. She had an older brother, William, who was two years her senior. Reynolds was a Girl Scout, once saying that she wanted to die as the world&#x27;s oldest living Girl Scout. Reynolds was also a member of The International Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters.

Her mother took in laundry for income, while they lived in a shack on Magnolia Street in El Paso. &quot;We may have been poor,&quot; she said in a 1963 interview, &quot;but we always had something to eat, even if Dad had to go out in the desert and shoot jackrabbits.&quot;

Her family moved to Burbank, California, in 1939. When Reynolds was a 16-year-old student at Burbank High School in 1948, she won the Miss Burbank beauty contest. Soon after, she was offered a contract with Warner Brothers and was given the stage name &quot;Debbie&quot; by studio head Jack L. Warner.

One of her closest high school friends said that she rarely dated during her teenaged years in Burbank. 

Reynolds agreed, saying, &quot;when I started, I didn&#x27;t even know how to dress. I wore dungarees and a shirt. I had no money, no taste, and no training.&quot; Her friend adds:

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===
Reynolds was discovered by talent scouts from Warner Bros. and MGM, who were at the 1948 Miss Burbank contest. Both companies wanted her to sign up with their studio, and had to flip a coin to see which one got her. Warner Bros. won the coin toss, and she was with the studio for two years. When Warner Bros. stopped producing musicals, she moved to MGM.

With MGM, Reynolds regularly appeared in movie musicals during the 1950s, and had several hit records during the period. Her song &quot;Aba Daba Honeymoon&quot; (featured in the film &quot;Two Weeks with Love&quot; (1950) and sung as a duet with co-star Carleton Carpenter) was the first soundtrack recording to become a top-of-the-chart gold record, reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.
Her performance in the film greatly impressed the studio, which then gave her a co-starring role in what became her highest-profile film, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), a satire on movie-making in Hollywood during the transition from silent to sound pictures. It co-starred Gene Kelly, whom she called a &quot;great dancer and cinematic genius,&quot; adding, &quot;He made me a star. I was 18 and he taught me how to dance and how to work hard and be dedicated.&quot; In 1956, she appeared in the musical &quot;Bundle of Joy&quot; with her then-husband, Eddie Fisher.

Reynolds was one of 14 top-billed names in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962) but she was the only one who appeared throughout, the story largely following the life and times of her character Lilith Prescott. In the film, she sang three songs: &quot;What Was Your Name in the States?&quot;, as her pioneering family begin their westward journey; &quot;Raise a Ruckus Tonight&quot;, starting a party around a wagon train camp fire; and, three times, &quot;Home in the Meadow&quot; – to the tune of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.

Her starring role in &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1964) led to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Reynolds noted that she initially had issues with its director, Charles Walters. &quot;He didn&#x27;t want me,&quot; she said. &quot;He wanted Shirley MacLaine,&quot; who at the time was unable to take the role. &quot;He said, &#x27;You are totally wrong for the part.&#x27;&quot; But six weeks into production, he reversed his opinion. &quot;He came to me and said, &#x27;I have to admit that I was wrong. You are playing the role really well. I&#x27;m pleased.&#x27;&quot; Reynolds also played in &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot;, a 1964 comedy film about a callous womanizer who gets his just reward. It was adapted from George Axelrod&#x27;s play &quot;Goodbye, Charlie&quot; and also starred Tony Curtis and Pat Boone.

She next portrayed Jeanine Deckers in &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; (1966). In what Reynolds once called the &quot;stupidest mistake of my entire career,&quot; she made headlines in 1970 after instigating a fight with the NBC television network over cigarette advertising on her weekly television show. Although she was television&#x27;s highest-paid female performer at the time, she quit the show for breaking its contract:

When NBC explained to Reynolds that banning cigarette commercials from her show would be impossible, she kept her resolve. The show drew mixed reviews, but according to NBC, it captured about 42% of the nation&#x27;s viewing audience. She said later she was especially concerned about the commercials because of the number of children watching the show. She did quit doing the show after about a year, which she said had cost her about $2 million of lost income: &quot;Maybe I was a fool to quit the show, but at least I was an honest fool. I&#x27;m not a phony or pretender. With me, it wasn&#x27;t a question of money, but integrity. I&#x27;m the one who has to live with myself.&quot; The dispute would have been rendered moot and in Reynolds&#x27; favor anyway had she not resigned; by 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act (which had been passed into law before she left the show) would ban all radio and television advertising for tobacco products.

Reynolds voiced Charlotte in the Hanna-Barbera animated musical &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973), where she originated the song &quot;Mother Earth and Father Time.&quot; Reynolds continued to make other appearances in film and television. She played Helen Chappel Hackett&#x27;s mother, Deedee Chappel, on the &quot;Wings&quot; episode &quot;If It&#x27;s Not One Thing, It&#x27;s Your Mother,&quot; which first aired November 22, 1994.

From 1999 to 2006, she played Grace Adler&#x27;s theatrical mother, Bobbi Adler, on the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, which earned Reynolds her only Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2000. She played a recurring role in the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Halloweentown&quot; film series as Aggie Cromwell. Reynolds made a guest appearance as a presenter at the 69th Academy Awards in 1997.

In 2000, Reynolds took up a recurring voice role on the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Rugrats,&quot; playing the grandmother of two of the characters. In 2001, she co-starred with Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley MacLaine, and Joan Collins in the comedy &quot;These Old Broads,&quot; a television movie written for her by her daughter, Carrie Fisher. She had a cameo role as herself in the 2004 film &quot;Connie and Carla.&quot; In 2013, she appeared in &quot;Behind the Candelabra,&quot; as the mother of Liberace.

Reynolds appears with her daughter in &quot;Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,&quot; a 2016 documentary about the very close relationship between the two. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The television premiere was January 7, 2017, on HBO. According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, the film is &quot;an intimate portrait of Hollywood royalty ... [it] loosely chronicles their lives through interviews, photos, footage, and vintage home movies... It culminates in a moving scene, just as Reynolds is preparing to receive the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, which Fisher presented to her mom.&quot;

=== Music career and cabaret ===
Her recording of the song &quot;Tammy&quot; (1957; from &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot;) earned her a gold record. It was a number one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts in 1957. In the movie (the first of the &quot;Tammy&quot; film series), she co-starred with Leslie Nielsen.

Reynolds also scored two other top-25 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits with &quot;A Very Special Love&quot; (number 20 in January 1958) and &quot;Am I That Easy to Forget&quot; (number 25 in March 1960)—a pop-music version of a country-music hit made famous by Carl Belew (in 1959), Skeeter Davis (in 1960), and several years later by singer Engelbert Humperdinck.

She released &quot;The Best of Debbie Reynolds&quot; album in 1991.
For 10 years, she headlined for about three months a year in Las Vegas&#x27;s Riviera Hotel. She enjoyed live shows, though that type of performing &quot;was extremely strenuous,&quot; she said in 1966:

With a performing schedule of two shows a night, seven nights a week, it&#x27;s probably the toughest kind of show business, but in my opinion, the most rewarding. I like the feeling of being able to change stage bits and business when I want. You can&#x27;t do that in motion pictures or TV.

As part of her nightclub act, Reynolds was noted for doing impressions of celebrities such as Eva and Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mae West, Barbra Streisand, Phyllis Diller, and Bette Davis. Her impersonation of Davis was inspired following their co-starring roles in the 1956 film, &quot;The Catered Affair&quot;. Reynolds had started doing stage impersonations as a teenager; her impersonation of Betty Hutton was performed as a singing number during the Miss Burbank contest in 1948.

Her 1992 holiday collaboration with Donald O&#x27;Connor, &quot;Christmas with Donald and Debbie&quot;, arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo, would be her final album release.

Reynolds was also a French horn player. Gene Kelly, reflecting on Reynolds&#x27;s sudden fame, recalled, &quot;There were times when Debbie was more interested in playing the French horn somewhere in the San Fernando Valley or attending a Girl Scout meeting...She didn&#x27;t realize she was a movie star all of a sudden.&quot;

=== Stage work ===

With limited film and television opportunities coming her way, Reynolds accepted an opportunity to make her Broadway debut. She starred in the 1973 revival of &quot;Irene&quot;, a musical first produced 60 years before. When asked why she waited so long to appear in a Broadway play, she explained:

Reynolds and her daughter Carrie both made their Broadway debuts in the play. Per reports, the production broke records for the highest weekly gross of any musical. For that production, she received a Tony nomination. Reynolds also starred in the Broadway revue &quot;Debbie&quot; in 1976. She toured with Harve Presnell in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, then wrapped up the Broadway run of &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; in 1983, while Fisher was appearing in &quot;Agnes of God&quot;. In the late 1980s, Reynolds repeated her role as Molly Brown in the stage version of &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, first opposite Presnell (repeating his original Broadway and movie role) and later with Ron Raines.

In 2010, she appeared in her own West End show &quot;Debbie Reynolds: Alive and Fabulous&quot;.

=== Film history preservation ===
Reynolds amassed a large collection of movie memorabilia, beginning with items from the landmark 1970 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer auction, and she displayed them, first in a museum at her Las Vegas hotel and casino during the 1990s and later in a museum close to the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.

The museum was to relocate to be the centerpiece of the Belle Island Village tourist attraction in the resort city of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, but the developer went bankrupt. The museum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. The most valuable asset of the museum was Reynolds&#x27; collection. Todd Fisher, Reynolds&#x27; son, announced that his mother was &quot;heartbroken&quot; to have to auction off the collection. It was valued at $10.79 million in the bankruptcy filing. Los Angeles auction firm Profiles in History was given the responsibility of conducting a series of auctions. Among the &quot;more than 3500 costumes, 20,000 photographs, and thousands of movie posters, costume sketches, and props&quot; included in the sales were Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s bowler hat and Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s white &quot;subway dress,&quot; whose skirt is lifted up by the breeze from a passing subway train in the film &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1955). The dress sold for $4.6 million in 2011; the final auction was held in May 2014.

=== Business ventures ===
In 1979, Reynolds opened her own dance studio in North Hollywood. In 1983, she released an exercise video, &quot;Do It Debbie&#x27;s Way!&quot; She purchased the Clarion Hotel and Casino, a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, in 1992. She renamed it the Debbie Reynolds Hollywood Hotel but it was not a success and Reynolds was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997. In June 2010, she replaced Ivana Trump on the &quot;Globe&quot; weekly&#x27;s advice column but many of the published letters were plagiarized from &quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; and possibly others.

=== Advocacy ===
Reynolds was a longtime ally of the LGBT community and an early advocate for AIDS. In 1983, Reynolds performed at an AIDS fundraiser with her friend Shirley MacLaine. In a 2014 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Reynolds revealed that she had helped several closeted actors conceal their homosexuality by dating them. When asked when she realized she was a gay icon, Reynolds replied, &quot;Over the years many of the boys that have worked for me as dancers have been gay. The creative people were all gay people, from producers to writers. To me, they were just family.&quot;

== Marriages and later life ==

Reynolds was married three times. Her first marriage was to singer and actor Eddie Fisher in 1955. They became the parents of Carrie Fisher and Todd Fisher. The couple divorced in 1959 when it was revealed shortly after the death of Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s husband Mike Todd that Fisher had been having an affair with her; Taylor and Reynolds were good friends at the time. The Eddie FisherElizabeth Taylor affair was a great public scandal, which led to the cancellation of Eddie Fisher&#x27;s television show.

In 2011, Reynolds was on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; just weeks before Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s death. She explained that Taylor and she happened to be traveling at the same time on the ocean liner (&quot;RMS Queen Elizabeth&quot;) some time in the 1960s when they reconciled. Reynolds sent a note to Taylor&#x27;s room, and Taylor sent a note in reply asking to have dinner with Reynolds and end their feud. As Reynolds described it, &quot;we had a wonderful evening with a lot of laughs.&quot; In 1972, she noted the bright side of the divorce and her remarriage:


Reynolds&#x27; second marriage, to millionaire businessman Harry Karl, lasted from 1960 to 1973. For a period during the 1960s, she stopped working at the studio on Friday afternoons to attend Girl Scout meetings, since she was the leader of the Girl Scout Troop of which her 13-year-old daughter Carrie and her stepdaughter Tina Karl, also 13, were members. Reynolds later found herself in financial difficulty because of Karl&#x27;s gambling and bad investments.

Reynolds&#x27; third marriage was to real estate developer Richard Hamlett from 1984 to 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypost/third-time&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Reynolds stepped down after 56 years of involvement in The Thalians, a charitable organization devoted to children and adults with mental-health issues.

Reynolds was hospitalized in October 2012 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles due to an adverse reaction to medication. She canceled appearances and concert engagements for the next three months.

She published the autobiographies &quot;Debbie: My Life&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Unsinkable: A Memoir&quot; in 2013.

== Death and legacy ==
On December 23, 2016, Reynolds&#x27;s daughter, actress and writer Carrie Fisher, suffered a medical emergency on a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles, and died on December 27, at the age of 60 at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The following day, December 28, Reynolds was taken by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, after suffering a &quot;severe stroke,&quot; according to her son. Later that afternoon, Reynolds was pronounced dead in the hospital; she was 84 years old. On January 9, 2017, her cause of death was determined to be an intracerebral hemorrhage, with hypertension a contributing factor.

Todd Fisher later said that Reynolds had been seriously affected by her daughter&#x27;s death, and that her grief partially contributed to her stroke, noting that his mother had stated, &quot;I want to be with Carrie,&quot; shortly before she died. During an interview for the December 30, 2016, airing of the ABC-TV program &quot;20/20&quot;, Todd Fisher elaborated on this, saying that his mother had joined his sister in death because Reynolds &quot;didn&#x27;t want to leave Carrie and did not want her to be alone.&quot; He added, &quot;she didn&#x27;t die of a broken heart&quot; as some news reports had implied, but rather &quot;just left to be with Carrie.&quot;

Reynolds was entombed with a portion of her daughter&#x27;s ashes at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills during a memorial service held on January 6, while the remainder of Carrie Fisher&#x27;s ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.

== Awards and honors ==
Reynolds was the 1955 Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year. Her footprints and handprints are preserved at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California. She also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6654 Hollywood Boulevard, for live performance and a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars dedicated to her. In keeping with the celebrity tradition of the Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival of Winchester, Virginia, Reynolds was honored as the Grand Marshal of the 2011 ABF that took place from April 26 to May 1, 2011.

On November 4, 2006, Reynolds received the Lifetime Achievement in the Arts Award from Chapman University (Orange, California). On May 17, 2007, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Nevada, Reno, where she had contributed for many years to the film studies program.

<text>Kiss Me, Kate is a musical with music and lyrics by Cole Porter and a book by Bella and Samuel Spewack. The story involves the production of a musical version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and the conflict on and off-stage between Fred Graham, the show&#x27;s director, producer, and star, and his leading lady, his ex-wife Lilli Vanessi. A secondary romance concerns Lois Lane, the actress playing Bianca, and her gambler boyfriend, Bill, who runs afoul of some gangsters. The original production starred Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk and Harold Lang.

&quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; was Porter&#x27;s response to Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and other integrated musicals; it was the first show he wrote in which the music and lyrics were firmly connected to the script. The musical premiered in 1948 and proved to be Porter&#x27;s only show to run for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway. In 1949, it won the first Tony Award for Best Musical.

==Conception==
Producer Arnold Saint-Subber conceived the idea for &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; after witnessing the on-stage/off-stage battling of husband-and-wife actors Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne during their 1935 production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. In 1947, he asked the Spewacks (undergoing their own marital woes at the time) to write the script; Bella Spewack in turn enlisted Cole Porter to write the music and lyrics.

Porter&#x27;s score drew from musical styles of the Italian Renaissance, Verdi&#x27;s operas, blues, the Viennese waltz, and, in &quot;Brush Up Your Shakespeare&quot;, the 1897 hybrid &quot;Bowery waltz&quot;. In writing the lyrics for &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, Porter drew from Shakespearean themes and language, without creating something esoteric, and the song &quot;Always True to You in My Fashion&quot; was inspired by the Ernest Dowson poem &quot;&quot;Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae&quot;”, with its refrain &quot;I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion&quot;.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===
After a 3½-week pre-Broadway tryout at the Shubert Theatre in Philadelphia starting December 2, 1948, the original Broadway production opened on December 30, 1948, at the New Century Theatre, where it ran for nineteen months before transferring to the Shubert, for a total run of 1,077 performances. Directed by John C. Wilson with choreography by Hanya Holm, the original cast included Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk, Harold Lang, Charles Wood and Harry Clark. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;authentic book which is funny without the interpolation of gags. Cole Porter has written his best score in years, together with witty lyrics. Under Hanya Holm&#x27;s direction, the dancing is joyous. And Lemuel Ayers has provided carnival costumes and some interesting scenery.&quot; The production won 5 Tony awards including Best Musical. The 1949 original cast recording has been inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry for the album&#x27;s &quot;cultural, artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation&#x27;s audio legacy&quot;.

===Original London and Australian productions===
The original West End production opened on March 8, 1951, at the Coliseum Theatre, and ran for 400 performances. Directed by Sam Spewack with choreography again by Holm, this production starred Patricia Morison, Bill Johnson, Adelaide Hall and Julie Wilson.

The original Australian production played from February 1952 at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, before seasons in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide until 1954. The production featured Hayes Gordon and Joy Turpin (later replaced by Evie Hayes).

The cast featured Emile Belcourt (Petruchio), Judith Bruce, Eric Shilling, Ann Howard (Kate), Francis Egerton and Robert Lloyd, with direction by Peter Coe and choreography by Sheila O&#x27;Neill. Coe did a translation for British audiences, including having &quot;a tea wagon&quot;, and included &quot;traditional English music hall jokes&quot;. This revival had a &quot;brief run&quot;, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre&quot;.

The Royal Shakespeare Company staged a production which opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, on February 10, 1987, toured the UK from March to May, and then played at London&#x27;s Old Vic Theatre from May 19, 1987. Directed by Adrian Noble and staged by Ron Field, the production starred Nichola McAuliffe and Paul Jones as Lilli/Kate and Fred/Petruchio, with Tim Flavin and Fiona Hendley as Bill/Lucentio and Lois/Bianca. The gangsters were played by Emil Wolk and John Bardon, who shared the 1987 Olivier Award for Outstanding Performance of the Year by an Actor in a Musical, while McAuliffe won the Olivier for Outstanding Performance of the Year by an Actress in a Musical. The production moved to the Savoy Theatre on January 15, 1988, with a new cast.

A short-lived Broadway revival ran at the Broadway Theatre in January 1952. It was directed by John C. Wilson and choreographed by Hanya Holm. Holly Harris and Robert Wright starred as Lilli and Fred.

A Broadway revival opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on November 18, 1999, and closed on December 30, 2001, after 881 performances and 28 previews. Directed by Michael Blakemore, Produced by Richard Godwin, and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall and Rob Ashford, the opening night cast included Marin Mazzie, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Amy Spanger, Michael Berresse, Ron Holgate, Lee Wilkof and Michael Mulheren. This production won the Tony Awards for Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Mitchell; Marin Mazzie received a Tony nomination for Best Actress in a Musical, and Michael Berresse, Lee Wilkof and Michael Mulheren received Tony nominations for Best Featured Actor in a Musical.

===2001 and 2012 London revivals===

Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s 2012 revival of the show transferred to the Old Vic Theatre on London&#x27;s South Bank in November 2012, with an official opening in December. It starred Hannah Waddingham as Lili/Kate and Alex Bourne as Fred Graham. The production was directed by Trevor Nunn. The show received positive reviews from critics and audiences. Hannah Waddingham and Alex Bourne were both nominated for the 2013 Olivier Awards as Best Actress/Actor in a Musical for their performances.

=== 2015 Opera North production ===
In September 2015 Opera North presented a revival directed by Jo Davies, choreographed by Will Tuckett.

The production is directed by Scott Ellis and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, with minor &quot;feminist&quot; updates by Amanda Green to make the musical &quot;more accessible for today’s audiences&quot;. Roundabout produced a benefit concert of the show with O&#x27;Hara, Ellis, and Carlyle in 2016. The revival had a limited run at Studio 54. Previews began on February 14, 2019, with the opening on March 14. The production closed on June 30, 2019.

Egotistical Fred Graham is the director and producer and is starring as Petruchio, and his movie-star ex-wife, Lilli Vanessi, is playing Katherine. The two seem to be constantly arguing, and Lilli is particularly angry that Fred is pursuing the sexy young actress Lois Lane, who is playing Bianca. After the rehearsal, Lois&#x27;s boyfriend Bill appears; he is playing Lucentio, but he missed the rehearsal because he was gambling. He tells her that he signed a $10,000 IOU in Fred&#x27;s name, and Lois reprimands him (&quot;Why Can&#x27;t You Behave?&quot;).

Before the opening, Fred and Lilli meet backstage, and Lilli shows off her engagement ring from Washington insider Harrison Howell, reminding Fred that it&#x27;s the anniversary of their divorce. They recall the operetta in which they met, which included &quot;Wunderbar&quot;, a Viennese waltz; they end up fondly reminiscing and singing and dancing. Two gangsters show up to collect the $10,000 IOU, and Fred replies that he never signed it. The gangsters obligingly say they will give him time to remember it and will return later. In her dressing room, Lilli receives flowers from Fred, and she declares that she is still &quot;So In Love&quot; with him. Fred tries to keep Lilli from reading the card that came with the flowers, which reveals that he really intended them for Lois. However, Lilli takes the card with her onstage, saying she will read it later.

The show begins (&quot;We Open in Venice&quot;). Baptista, Katherine and Bianca&#x27;s father, will not allow his younger daughter Bianca to marry until his older daughter Katherine is married. However, she is shrewish and ill-tempered, and no man desires to marry her. Three suitors – Lucentio, Hortensio, and Gremio – try to woo Bianca, and she says that she would marry any of them (&quot;Tom, Dick, or Harry&quot;). Petruchio, a friend of Lucentio, expresses a desire to marry into wealth (&quot;I&#x27;ve Come to Wive it Wealthily in Padua&quot;). The suitors hatch a plan for him to marry Kate, as Baptista is rich. Kate, however, has no intentions of getting married (&quot;I Hate Men&quot;). Petruchio attempts to woo her (&quot;Were Thine That Special Face&quot;). Offstage, Lilli has an opportunity to read the card. She walks on stage off-cue and begins hitting Fred, who, along with the other actors, tries to remain in character as Baptista gives Petruchio permission to marry Kate. Lilli continues to strike Fred, and he ends up spanking her. Offstage, Lilli furiously declares she is leaving the show. However, the gangsters have reappeared, and Fred tells them that if Lilli quits, he&#x27;ll have to close the show and won&#x27;t be able to pay them the $10,000. The gangsters force her to stay at gunpoint. Back onstage, Bianca and Lucentio dance while the chorus performs &quot;We Sing of Love&quot;, covering a scene change. The curtain opens, revealing the exterior of a church; Petruchio and Kate have just been married, and they exit the church; the gangsters, dressed in Shakespearean costume, are onstage to make sure that Lilli stays. Petruchio implores for Kate to kiss him, and she refuses. He lifts her over his shoulder and carries her offstage while she pummels his shoulder with her fists (&quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;).

Act II

During the show&#x27;s intermission, the cast and crew relax in the alley behind the theater. Paul (Fred&#x27;s assistant) and other crew members lament that it&#x27;s &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot; to meet their lovers that night. The play continues, and Petruchio tries to &#x27;tame&#x27; Katherine and mourns for his now-lost bachelor life (&quot;Where Is the Life That Late I Led?&quot;). Off-stage, Lilli&#x27;s fiancé Harrison Howell is looking for Lilli. He runs into Lois, and she recognizes him as a former lover but promises not to tell Lilli. Bill is shocked to overhear this, but Lois tells him that even if she is involved with other men, she is faithful to him in her own way (&quot;Always True to You in My Fashion&quot;). Lilli tries to explain to Howell that she is being forced to stay at the theatre by the gangsters, but Howell doesn&#x27;t believe her and wants to discuss wedding plans. Fred insidiously points out how boring Lilli&#x27;s life with Howell will be compared with the theatre. Bill sings a love song he has written for Lois (&quot;Bianca&quot;).

The gangsters discover that their boss has been killed, so the IOU is no longer valid. Lilli leaves—without Howell—as Fred unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay (&quot;So in Love&quot; (Reprise)). The gangsters get caught on stage and improvise a tribute to Shakespeare in which they explain that knowing Shakespeare is the key to romance (&quot;Brush Up Your Shakespeare&quot;). The company prepares for the conclusion of the play, the wedding of Bianca and Lucentio, even though they are now missing one of the main characters. However, just in time for Katherine&#x27;s final speech, Lilli arrives onstage (&quot;I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple&quot;). Fred and Lilli wordlessly reconcile on stage, and the play ends (&quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; (Finale)) with them, as well as Bill and Lois, kissing passionately.

<text>A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, as opposed to a silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures became commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923. Before sound-on-film technology became viable, soundtracks for films were commonly played live with organs or pianos.

The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid-to-late 1920s. At first, the sound films which included synchronized dialogue, known as &quot;talking pictures&quot;, or &quot;talkies&quot;, were exclusively shorts. The earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects. The first feature film originally presented as a talkie (although it had only limited sound sequences) was &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, which premiered on October 6, 1927. A major hit, it was made with Vitaphone, which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology. Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures.

By the early 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood&#x27;s position as one of the world&#x27;s most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of silent cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance (&quot;benshi&quot;), talking pictures were slow to take root. Conversely, in India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation&#x27;s film industry.

== Early history ==

The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, a couple of days after photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, the two inventors met privately. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting zoopraxiscope with Edison&#x27;s recorded-sound technology. No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope, essentially a &quot;peep-show&quot; system, as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph. The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection.

In 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor François Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones. An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, was developed by Clément-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system—Théâtroscope—were also presented at the Exposition.

Three major problems persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which were difficult to start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed directly in front of the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.
Cinematic innovators attempted to cope with the fundamental synchronization problem in a variety of ways. An increasing number of motion picture systems relied on gramophone records—known as sound-on-disc technology. The records themselves were often referred to as &quot;Berliner discs&quot;, after one of the primary inventors in the field, German-American Emile Berliner. In 1902, Léon Gaumont demonstrated his sound-on-disc Chronophone, involving an electrical connection he had recently patented, to the French Photographic Society. Four years later, Gaumont introduced the Elgéphone, a compressed-air amplification system based on the Auxetophone, developed by British inventors Horace Short and Charles Parsons. Despite high expectations, Gaumont&#x27;s sound innovations had only limited commercial success. Despite some improvements, they still did not satisfactorily address the three basic issues with sound film and were expensive as well. For some years, American inventor E. E. Norton&#x27;s Cameraphone was the primary competitor to the Gaumont system (sources differ on whether the Cameraphone was disc- or cylinder-based); it ultimately failed for many of the same reasons that held back the Chronophone.

In 1913, Edison introduced a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone. Instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after little more than a year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, &quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation&quot;, promoting Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; conception of humankind&#x27;s genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action, synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.

Meanwhile, innovations continued on another significant front. In 1900, as part of the research he was conducting on the photophone, the German physicist Ernst Ruhmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll of photographic film. He then determined that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip by shining a bright light through the running filmstrip, with the resulting varying light illuminating a selenium cell. The changes in brightness caused a corresponding change to the selenium&#x27;s resistance to electrical currents, which was used to modulate the sound produced in a telephone receiver. He called this invention the photographophone, which he summarized as: &quot;It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound.&quot;

Ruhmer began a correspondence with the French-born, London-based Eugene Lauste, who had worked at Edison&#x27;s lab between 1886 and 1892. In 1907, Lauste was awarded the first patent for sound-on-film technology, involving the transformation of sound into light waves that are photographically recorded direct onto celluloid. As described by historian Scott Eyman,

It was a double system, that is, the sound was on a different piece of film from the picture... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, where it would be photographed on the side of the film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.

In 1908, Lauste purchased a photographophone from Ruhmer, with the intention of perfecting the device into a commercial product. Though sound-on-film would eventually become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, which came to an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process to an audience of scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, and for many years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.

== Crucial innovations ==
A number of technological developments contributed to making sound cinema commercially viable by the late 1920s. Two involved contrasting approaches to synchronized sound reproduction, or playback:

=== Advanced sound-on-film ===
In 1919, American inventor Lee De Forest was awarded several patents that would lead to the first optical sound-on-film technology with commercial application. In De Forest&#x27;s system, the sound track was photographically recorded onto the side of the strip of motion picture film to create a composite, or &quot;married&quot;, print. If proper synchronization of sound and picture was achieved in recording, it could be absolutely counted on in playback. Over the next four years, he improved his system with the help of equipment and patents licensed from another American inventor in the field, Theodore Case.

At the University of Illinois, Polish-born research engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner was working independently on a similar process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture to members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner&#x27;s system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest&#x27;s soon would.
On April 15, 1923, at the New York City&#x27;s Rivoli Theater, the first commercial screening of motion pictures with sound-on-film took place. This would become the future standard. It consisted of a set of short films varying in length and featuring some of the most popular stars of the 1920s (including Eddie Cantor, Harry Richman, Sophie Tucker, and George Jessel among others) doing stage performances such as vaudevilles, musical acts, and speeches which accompanied the screening of the silent feature film &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. All of them were presented under the banner of De Forest Phonofilms. The set included the 11-minute short film &quot;From far Seville&quot; starring Concha Piquer. In 2010, a copy of the tape was found in the U.S. Library of Congress, where it is currently preserved. Critics attending the event praised the novelty but not the sound quality which received negative reviews in general. That June, De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee, Freeman Harrison Owens, for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents. Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts, Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field. The following year, De Forest&#x27;s studio released the first commercial dramatic film shot as a talking picture—the two-reeler &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot;, directed by J. Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel. However, phonofilm&#x27;s stock in trade was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries, popular music acts, and comedy performances. President Calvin Coolidge, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker, Ben Bernie, Eddie Cantor and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm&#x27;s pictures. Hollywood remained suspicious, even fearful, of the new technology. As &quot;Photoplay&quot; editor James Quirk put it in March 1924, &quot;Talking pictures are perfected, says Dr. Lee De Forest. &quot;So&quot; is castor oil.&quot; De Forest&#x27;s process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions, a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures, which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets. By the end of 1930, the Phonofilm business would be liquidated.

In Europe, others were also working on the development of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, &quot;Der Brandstifter&quot; (&quot;The Arsonist&quot;) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.

US competition eclipsed Phonofilm. By September 1925, De Forest and Case&#x27;s working arrangement had fallen through. The following July, Case joined Fox Film, Hollywood&#x27;s third largest studio, to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed by Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name Movietone, thus became the first viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage. In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film.

=== Advanced sound-on-disc ===

Parallel with improvements in sound-on-film technology, a number of companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith&#x27;s failed silent film &quot;Dream Street&quot;. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, &quot;Dream Street&quot; was re-released, with love song added, at New York City&#x27;s Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. However, the sound quality was very poor and no other theaters could show the sound version of the film as no one had the Photokinema sound system installed. On Sunday, May 29, &quot;Dream Street&quot; opened at the Shubert Crescent Theater in Brooklyn with a program of short films made in Phonokinema. However, business was poor, and the program soon closed.

In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood studio with big ambitions, saw a demonstration of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York City&#x27;s Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president. Vitaphone, as this system was now called, was publicly introduced on August 6, 1926, with the premiere of &quot;Don Juan&quot;; the first feature-length movie to employ a synchronized sound system of any type throughout, its soundtrack contained a musical score and added sound effects, but no recorded dialogue—in other words, it had been staged and shot as a silent film. Accompanying &quot;Don Juan&quot;, however, were eight shorts of musical performances, mostly classical, as well as a four-minute filmed introduction by Will H. Hays, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, all with live-recorded sound. These were the first true sound films exhibited by a Hollywood studio. Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;The Better &#x27;Ole&quot;, technically similar to &quot;Don Juan&quot;, followed in October.

Sound-on-film would ultimately win out over sound-on-disc because of a number of fundamental technical advantages:
* Synchronization: no interlock system was completely reliable, and a projectionist&#x27;s error, or an inexactly repaired film break, or a defect in the soundtrack disc could result in the sound becoming seriously and irrecoverably out of sync with the picture
* Editing: discs could not be directly edited, severely limiting the ability to make alterations in their accompanying films after the original release cut
* Distribution: phonograph discs added expense and complication to film distribution
* Wear and tear: the physical process of playing the discs degraded them, requiring their replacement after approximately twenty screenings

Nonetheless, in the early years, sound-on-disc had the edge over sound-on-film in two substantial ways:
* Production and capital cost: it was generally less expensive to record sound onto disc than onto film and the exhibition systems—turntable/interlock/projector—were cheaper to manufacture than the complex image-and-audio-pattern-reading projectors required by sound-on-film
* Audio quality: phonograph discs, Vitaphone&#x27;s in particular, had superior dynamic range to most sound-on-film processes of the day, at least during the first few playings; while sound-on-film tended to have better frequency response, this was outweighed by greater distortion and noise

As sound-on-film technology improved, both of these disadvantages were overcome.

The third crucial set of innovations marked a major step forward in both the live recording of sound and its effective playback:
=== Fidelity electronic recording and amplification ===
In 1913, Western Electric, the manufacturing division of AT&amp;T, acquired the rights to the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the triode vacuum tube. Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film synchronised sound systems for motion-pictures.

The engineers working on the sound-on-disc system were able to draw on expertise that Western Electric already had in electrical disc recording and were thus able to make faster initial progress. The main change required was to increase the playing time of the disc so that it could match that of a standard reel of 35 mm film. The chosen design used a disc nearly 16 inches (about 40 cm) in diameter rotating at 33 1/3 rpm. This could play for 11 minutes, the running time of 1000 ft of film at 90 ft/min (24 frames/s). Because of the larger diameter the minimum groove velocity of 70 ft/min (14 inches or 356 mm/s) was only slightly less than that of a standard 10-inch 78 rpm commercial disc.
In 1925, the company publicly introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after the use of a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT&amp;T for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of &quot;Don Juan&quot; and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company&#x27;s sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs—the new name for the AT&amp;T research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York&#x27;s Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of &quot;Don Juan&quot;.

Late in the year, AT&amp;T/Western Electric created a licensing division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle rights to the company&#x27;s film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI&#x27;s hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox&#x27;s related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.

=== Travel ===
In 1929 a &quot;new RCA Photophone portable sound and picture reproducing system&quot; was described in the industry journal Projection Engineering. In Australia, Hoyts and Gilby Talkies Pty., Ltd were touring talking pictures to country towns. The same year the White Star Line installed talking picture equipment on the s.s. Majestic. The features shown on the first voyage were &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;Broadway.&quot; 

== Triumph of the &quot;talkies&quot; ==

In February 1927, an agreement was signed by five leading Hollywood movie companies: Famous Players–Lasky (soon to be part of Paramount), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, First National, and Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion, and then waited to see what sort of results the front-runners came up with. In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox&#x27;s for use of Western Electric technology. Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema, moving in different directions both technologically and commercially: Fox moved into newsreels and then scored dramas, while Warners concentrated on talking features. Meanwhile, ERPI sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios.
The big sound film sensations of the year all took advantage of preexisting celebrity. On May 20, 1927, at New York City&#x27;s Roxy Theater, Fox Movietone presented a sound film of the takeoff of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s celebrated flight to Paris, recorded earlier that day. In June, a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York City and Washington, D.C., was shown. These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date. In May, as well, Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue: the short &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Get Me&quot;, starring comedian Chic Sale. After rereleasing a few silent feature hits, such as &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, with recorded music, Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23: &quot;&quot;, by acclaimed German director F. W. Murnau. As with &quot;Don Juan&quot;, the film&#x27;s soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects (including, in a couple of crowd scenes, &quot;wild&quot;, nonspecific vocals).

Then, on October 6, 1927, Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; premiered. It was a smash box office success for the mid-level studio, earning a total of $2.625 million in the United States and abroad, almost a million dollars more than the previous record for a Warner Bros. film. Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying, like &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Don Juan&quot;, on a score and effects. When the movie&#x27;s star, Al Jolson, sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech—one of Jolson&#x27;s character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between him and his mother. The &quot;natural&quot; sounds of the settings were also audible. Though the success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was due largely to Jolson, already established as one of U.S. biggest music stars, and its limited use of synchronized sound hardly qualified it as an innovative sound film (let alone the &quot;first&quot;), the movie&#x27;s profits were proof enough to the industry that the technology was worth investing in.

The development of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in fits and starts before &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, and the film&#x27;s success did not change things overnight. Influential gossip columnist Louella Parsons&#x27; reaction to &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was badly off the mark: &quot;I have no fear that the screeching sound film will ever disturb our theaters,&quot; while MGM head of production Irving Thalberg called the film &quot;a good gimmick, but that&#x27;s all it was.&quot; Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. It was a daunting commitment; revamping a single theater cost as much as $15,000 (the equivalent of $220,000 in 2019), and there were more than 20,000 movie theaters in the United States. By 1930, only half of the theaters had been wired for sound.

Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; on June 17, 1928, eight months after &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric&#x27;s RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, Photophone. Unlike Fox-Case&#x27;s Movietone and De Forest&#x27;s Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially-designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, the lines are of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, the lines are of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood&#x27;s newest major studio, RKO Pictures.

Meanwhile, Warner Bros. had released three more talkies, all profitable, if not at the level of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;: In March, &quot;Tenderloin&quot; appeared; it was billed by Warners as the first feature in which characters spoke their parts, though only 15 of its 88 minutes had dialogue. &quot;Glorious Betsy&quot; followed in April, and &quot;The Lion and the Mouse&quot; (31 minutes of dialogue) in May. On July 6, 1928, the first all-talking feature, &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, premiered. The film cost Warner Bros. only $23,000 to produce, but grossed $1,252,000, a record rate of return surpassing 5,000%. In September, the studio released another Al Jolson part-talking picture, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;, which more than doubled &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;&#x27;s earnings record for a Warner Bros. movie. This second Jolson screen smash demonstrated the movie musical&#x27;s ability to turn a song into a national hit: inside of nine months, the Jolson number &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; had racked up 2 million record and 1.25 million sheet music sales. September 1928 also saw the release of Paul Terry&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Time&quot;, among the first animated cartoons produced with synchronized sound. Soon after he saw it, Walt Disney released his first sound picture, the Mickey Mouse short &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;.

Over the course of 1928, as Warner Bros. began to rake in huge profits due to the popularity of its sound films, the other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology. Paramount, the industry leader, put out its first talkie in late September, &quot;Beggars of Life&quot;; though it had just a few lines of dialogue, it demonstrated the studio&#x27;s recognition of the new medium&#x27;s power. &quot;Interference&quot;, Paramount&#x27;s first all-talker, debuted in November. The process known as &quot;goat glanding&quot; briefly became widespread: soundtracks, sometimes including a smatter of post-dubbed dialogue or song, were added to movies that had been shot, and in some cases released, as silents. A few minutes of singing could qualify such a newly endowed film as a &quot;musical.&quot; (Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Dream Street&quot; had essentially been a &quot;goat gland.&quot;) Expectations swiftly changed, and the sound &quot;fad&quot; of 1927 became standard procedure by 1929. In February 1929, sixteen months after &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;&#x27;s debut, Columbia Pictures became the last of the eight studios that would be known as &quot;majors&quot; during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age to release its first part-talking feature, &quot;The Lone Wolf&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In late May, the first all-color, all-talking feature, Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;On with the Show!&quot;, premiered.

Yet most American movie theaters, especially outside of urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: while the number of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies&#x27; universal appeal—until mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. &quot;Points West&quot;, a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio.

=== Transition: Europe ===

&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. According to film historian Rachael Low, &quot;Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable.&quot; On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production &quot;Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame&quot; (&quot;I Kiss Your Hand, Madame&quot;). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany&#x27;s two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system&#x27;s value, Tobis also established its own production operations.

During 1929, most of the major European filmmaking countries began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe&#x27;s first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: &quot;The Crimson Circle&quot; was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik&#x27;s Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent &quot;Der Rote Kreis&quot; in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP&#x27;s corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: &quot;The Clue of the New Pin&quot;, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, &quot;Black Waters&quot;, which British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.

The first successful European dramatic talkie was the all-British &quot;Blackmail&quot;. Directed by twenty-nine-year-old Alfred Hitchcock, the movie had its London debut June 21, 1929. Originally shot as a silent, &quot;Blackmail&quot; was restaged to include dialogue sequences, along with a score and sound effects, before its premiere. A British International Pictures (BIP) production, it was recorded on RCA Photophone, General Electric having bought a share of AEG so they could access the Tobis-Klangfilm markets. &quot;Blackmail&quot; was a substantial hit; critical response was also positive—notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle, for example, called it &quot;perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen.&quot;

On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film industry came out with a talkie: &quot;G&#x27;schichten aus der Steiermark&quot; (&quot;Stories from Styria&quot;), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, &quot;Das Land ohne Frauen&quot; (&quot;Land Without Women&quot;), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden&#x27;s first talkie, &quot;Konstgjorda Svensson&quot; (&quot;Artificial Svensson&quot;), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with &quot;Le Collier de la reine&quot; (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Necklace&quot;), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, &quot;Les Trois masques&quot; (&quot;The Three Masks&quot;) debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like &quot;Blackmail&quot;, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie &quot;La Route est belle&quot; (&quot;The Road Is Fine&quot;), also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.

Before the Paris studios were fully sound-equipped—a process that stretched well into 1930—a number of other early French talkies were shot in Germany. The first all-talking German feature, &quot;Atlantik&quot;, had premiered in Berlin on October 28. Yet another Elstree-made movie, it was rather less German at heart than &quot;Les Trois masques&quot; and &quot;La Route est belle&quot; were French; a BIP production with a British scenarist and German director, it was also shot in English as &quot;Atlantic&quot;. The entirely German Aafa-Film production &quot;It&#x27;s You I Have Loved&quot; (&quot;Dich hab ich geliebt&quot;) opened three and a half weeks later. It was not &quot;Germany&#x27;s First Talking Film&quot;, as the marketing had it, but it was the first to be released in the United States.

In 1930, the first Polish talkies premiered, using sound-on-disc systems: &quot;Moralność pani Dulskiej&quot; (&quot;The Morality of Mrs. Dulska&quot;) in March and the all-talking &quot;Niebezpieczny romans&quot; (&quot;Dangerous Love Affair&quot;) in October. In Italy, whose once vibrant film industry had become moribund by the late 1920s, the first talkie, &quot;La Canzone dell&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;The Song of Love&quot;), also came out in October; within two years, Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival. The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well, &quot;Tonka Šibenice&quot; (&quot;Tonka of the Gallows&quot;). Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures—Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania. The Soviet Union&#x27;s robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930: Dziga Vertov&#x27;s nonfiction &quot;Enthusiasm&quot; had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; Abram Room&#x27;s documentary &quot;Plan velikikh rabot&quot; (&quot;The Plan of the Great Works&quot;) had music and spoken voiceovers. Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world. In June 1931, the Nikolai Ekk drama &quot;Putevka v zhizn&quot; (&quot;The Road to Life&quot; or &quot;A Start in Life&quot;), premiered as the Soviet Union&#x27;s first true talking picture.

Throughout much of Europe, conversion of exhibition venues lagged well behind production capacity, requiring talkies to be produced in parallel silent versions or simply shown without sound in many places. While the pace of conversion was relatively swift in Britain—with over 60 percent of theaters equipped for sound by the end of 1930, similar to the U.S. figure—in France, by contrast, more than half of theaters nationwide were still projecting in silence by late 1932. According to scholar Colin G. Crisp, &quot;Anxiety about resuscitating the flow of silent films was frequently expressed in the [French] industrial press, and a large section of the industry still saw the silent as a viable artistic and commercial prospect till about 1935.&quot; The situation was particularly acute in the Soviet Union; as of May 1933, fewer than one out of every hundred film projectors in the country was as yet equipped for sound.

=== Transition: Asia ===

During the 1920s and 1930s, Japan was one of the world&#x27;s two largest producers of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country&#x27;s film industry was among the first to produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, &quot;Reimai&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: &quot;Taii no musume&quot; (&quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) and &quot;Furusato&quot; (&quot;Hometown&quot;), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country&#x27;s leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujirō Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.

The enduring popularity of the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to the tradition of the &quot;benshi&quot;, a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening. As director Akira Kurosawa later described, the benshi &quot;not only recounted the plot of the films, they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen... The most popular narrators were stars in their own right, solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre.&quot; Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues,

The end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn&#x27;t lack anything, least in Japan, where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn&#x27;t have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.

By the same token, the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound—allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology.

The Mandarin-language &quot;Gēnǚ hóng mǔdān&quot; (, &quot;Singsong Girl Red Peony&quot;), starring Butterfly Wu, premiered as China&#x27;s first feature talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot;, arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner &quot;Fellers&quot; is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie. In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star Sulochana, excerpted from the silent feature &quot;Madhuri&quot; (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country&#x27;s first. The following year, Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu &quot;Alam Ara&quot;, and produced &quot;Kalidas&quot;, primarily in Tamil with some Telugu. Nineteen-thirty-one also saw the first Bengali-language film, &quot;Jamai Sasthi&quot;, and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu, &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot;. In 1932, &quot;Ayodhyecha Raja&quot; became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released (though &quot;Sant Tukaram&quot; was the first to go through the official censorship process); the first Gujarati-language film, &quot;Narsimha Mehta&quot;, and all-Tamil talkie, &quot;Kalava&quot;, debuted as well. The next year, Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian-language talkie, &quot;Dukhtar-e-loor&quot;. Also in 1933, the first Cantonese-language films were produced in Hong Kong—&quot;Sha zai dongfang&quot; (&quot;The Idiot&#x27;s Wedding Night&quot;) and &quot;Liang xing&quot; (&quot;Conscience&quot;); within two years, the local film industry had fully converted to sound. Korea, where &quot;pyonsa&quot; (or &quot;byun-sa&quot;) held a role and status similar to that of the Japanese benshi, in 1935 became the last country with a significant film industry to produce its first talking picture: &quot;Chunhyangjeon&quot; () is based on the seventeenth-century pansori folktale &quot;Chunhyangga&quot;, of which as many as fifteen film versions have been made through 2009.

== Consequences ==

=== Technology ===

In the short term, the introduction of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production. Cameras were noisy, so a soundproofed cabinet was used in many of the earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors, at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera. For a time, multiple-camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots. The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally. &quot;Show Girl in Hollywood&quot; (1930), from First National Pictures (which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound), gives a behind-the-scenes look at some of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies. Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings, known as &quot;blimps&quot;, designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors. In 1931, a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced: three-way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low, medium, and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass &quot;woofer&quot;, a midrange driver, and a treble &quot;tweeter.&quot;

There were consequences, as well, for other technological aspects of the cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.

As David Bordwell describes, technological improvements continued at a swift pace: &quot;Between 1932 and 1935, [Western Electric and RCA] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of film recording, reduced ground noise ... and extended the volume range.&quot; These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: &quot;Increasing the fidelity of recording ... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness.&quot; Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;—was that some silent-era actors simply did not have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, a process known as &quot;looping&quot;, had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.

With Hollywood&#x27;s wholesale adoption of the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved. Over the course of 1930–1931, the only major players using sound-on-disc, Warner Bros. and First National, changed over to sound-on-film recording. Vitaphone&#x27;s dominating presence in sound-equipped theaters, however, meant that for years to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound-on-disc versions of their films alongside the sound-on-film prints. Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method, leaving two major American systems: the variable-area RCA Photophone and Western Electric&#x27;s own variable-density process, a substantial improvement on the cross-licensed Movietone. Under RCA&#x27;s instigation, the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible, meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other. This left one big issue—the Tobis-Klangfilm challenge. In May 1930, Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri-Ergon patents, helping bring Tobis-Klangfilm to the negotiating table. The following month an accord was reached on patent cross-licensing, full playback compatibility, and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment. As a contemporary report describes:

Tobis-Klangfilm has the exclusive rights to provide equipment for: Germany, Danzig, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, the Dutch Indies, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Finland. The Americans have the exclusive rights for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Russia. All other countries, among them Italy, France, and England, are open to both parties.

The agreement did not resolve all the patent disputes, and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed over the course of the 1930s. During these years, as well, the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA Photophone&#x27;s variable-area approach—by the end of 1936, only Paramount, MGM, and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI.
=== Labor ===

While the introduction of sound led to a boom in the motion picture industry, it had an adverse effect on the employability of a host of Hollywood actors of the time. Suddenly those without stage experience were regarded as suspect by the studios; as suggested above, those whose heavy accents or otherwise discordant voices had previously been concealed were particularly at risk. The career of major silent star Norma Talmadge effectively came to an end in this way. The celebrated German actor Emil Jannings returned to Europe. Moviegoers found John Gilbert&#x27;s voice an awkward match with his swashbuckling persona, and his star also faded. Audiences now seemed to perceive certain silent-era stars as old-fashioned, even those who had the talent to succeed in the sound era. The career of Harold Lloyd, one of the top screen comedians of the 1920s, declined precipitously. Lillian Gish departed, back to the stage, and other leading figures soon left acting entirely: Colleen Moore, Gloria Swanson, and Hollywood&#x27;s most famous performing couple, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. After his acting career collapsed due to his Danish accent, Karl Dane committed suicide. However, the impact of sound on the careers of film actors should not be exaggerated. One statistical analysis of silent actress career length showed that the five-year ‘survival-rate’ of actresses active in 1922 was only 10% greater than those active after 1927. As actress Louise Brooks suggested, there were other issues as well:
Studio heads, now forced into unprecedented decisions, decided to begin with the actors, the least palatable, the most vulnerable part of movie production. It was such a splendid opportunity, anyhow, for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars... Me, they gave the salary treatment. I could stay on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [Paramount studio chief B. P.] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I&#x27;d be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit.
Buster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium, but when his studio, MGM, made the changeover to sound, he was quickly stripped of creative control. Though a number of Keaton&#x27;s early talkies made impressive profits, they were artistically dismal.

Several of the new medium&#x27;s biggest attractions came from vaudeville and the musical theater, where performers such as Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Jeanette MacDonald, and the Marx Brothers were accustomed to the demands of both dialogue and song. James Cagney and Joan Blondell, who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930. A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Myrna Loy, William Powell, Norma Shearer, the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and Charlie Chaplin, whose &quot;City Lights&quot; (1931) and &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects. Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;, as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar &quot;Our Dancing Daughters&quot; (1928). Greta Garbo was the one non–native English speaker to retain Hollywood stardom on both sides of the great sound divide. Silent film extra Clark Gable, who had received extensive voice training during his earlier stage career, went on to dominate the new medium for decades; similarly, English actor Boris Karloff, having appeared in dozens of silent films since 1919, found his star ascend in the sound era (though, ironically, it was a non-speaking role in 1931&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; that made this happen, but despite having a lisp, he found himself much in demand after). The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists, journalists, and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue. Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were Nathanael West, William Faulkner, Robert Sherwood, Aldous Huxley, and Dorothy Parker.

As talking pictures emerged, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work. More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped; according to historian Preston J. Hubbard, &quot;During the 1920s live musical performances at first-run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema.&quot; With the coming of the talkies, those featured performances—usually staged as preludes—were largely eliminated as well. The American Federation of Musicians took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; features an image of a can labeled &quot;Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever&quot; and reads in part:

Canned Music on Trial
This is the case of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres. The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education. Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music. If the theatre-going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable. Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanization. It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist, upon the human contact, without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost.

By the following year, a reported 22,000 U.S. moviehouse musicians had lost their jobs.

=== Commerce ===

In September 1926, Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Bros., was quoted to the effect that talking pictures would never be viable: &quot;They fail to take into account the international language of the silent pictures, and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play, the action, the plot, and the imagined dialogue for himself.&quot; Much to his company&#x27;s benefit, he would be proven very wrong—between the 1927–1928 and 1928–1929 fiscal years, Warners&#x27; profits surged from $2 million to $14 million. Sound film, in fact, was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry. During that same twelve-month span, Paramount&#x27;s profits rose by $7 million, Fox&#x27;s by $3.5 million, and Loew&#x27;s/MGM&#x27;s by $3 million. RKO, which did not even exist in September 1928 and whose parent production company, FBO, was in the Hollywood minor leagues, by the end of 1929 was established as one of America&#x27;s leading entertainment businesses. Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound: the musical. Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929, and more than eighty the following year.

Even as the Wall Street crash of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into depression, the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune. The 1929–1930 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous, with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs. Reality finally struck later in 1930, but sound had clearly secured Hollywood&#x27;s position as one of the most important industrial fields, both commercially and culturally, in the United States. In 1929, film box-office receipts comprised 16.6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation; by 1931, the figure had reached 21.8 percent. The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half. Hollywood ruled on the larger stage, as well. The American movie industry—already the world&#x27;s most powerful—set an export record in 1929 that, by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film, was 27 percent higher than the year before. Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded. In fact, the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers, relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards. The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages (known as &quot;Foreign Language Version&quot;), as well as the production of the cheaper &quot;International Sound Version&quot;, a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-dubbing and subtitling. Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets, by 1937, American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe.

Just as the leading Hollywood studios gained from sound in relation to their foreign competitors, they did the same at home. As historian Richard B. Jewell describes, &quot;The sound revolution crushed many small film companies and producers who were unable to meet the financial demands of sound conversion.&quot; The combination of sound and the Great Depression led to a wholesale shakeout in the business, resulting in the hierarchy of the Big Five integrated companies (MGM, Paramount, Fox, Warner Bros., RKO) and the three smaller studios also called &quot;majors&quot; (Columbia, Universal, United Artists) that would predominate through the 1950s. Historian Thomas Schatz describes the ancillary effects:

Because the studios were forced to streamline operations and rely on their own resources, their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus. Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the studio system finally coalesce, with the individual studios coming to terms with their own identities and their respective positions within the industry.
The other country in which sound cinema had an immediate major commercial impact was India. As one distributor of the period said, &quot;With the coming of the talkies, the Indian motion picture came into its own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation. This was achieved by music.&quot; From its earliest days, Indian sound cinema has been defined by the musical—&quot;Alam Ara&quot; featured seven songs; a year later, &quot;Indrasabha&quot; would feature seventy. While the European film industries fought an endless battle against the popularity and economic muscle of Hollywood, ten years after the debut of &quot;Alam Ara&quot;, over 90 percent of the films showing on Indian screens were made within the country.

Most of India&#x27;s early talkies were shot in Bombay, which remains the leading production center, but sound filmmaking soon spread across the multilingual nation. Within just a few weeks of &quot;Alam Ara&quot;&#x27;s March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi &quot;Shirin Farhad&quot; and the Bengali &quot;Jamai Sasthi&quot;. The Hindustani &quot;Heer Ranjha&quot; was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, &quot;Sati Sulochana&quot;, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; &quot;Srinivasa Kalyanam&quot; became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India as it did in the United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures. Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India has been among the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year.

=== Aesthetic quality ===
In the first, 1930 edition of his global survey &quot;The Film Till Now&quot;, British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared, &quot;A film in which the speech and sound effects are perfectly synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema. It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema.&quot; Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form; Alfred Hitchcock, though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe, held that &quot;the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema&quot; and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside &quot;photographs of people talking&quot;. In Germany, Max Reinhardt, stage producer and movie director, expressed the belief that the talkies, &quot;bringing to the screen stage plays ... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself ... like reproductions of paintings.&quot;

In the opinion of many film historians and aficionados, both at the time and subsequently, silent film had reached an aesthetic peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents. For instance, despite fading into relative obscurity once its era had passed, silent cinema is represented by eleven films in &quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll, held in 1995. The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film—not only in the United States, but also in the West as a whole—was 1929; yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929), &quot;Zemlya&quot; (1930), &quot;City Lights&quot; (1931)) and zero talkies in the &quot;Time Out&quot; poll. (&quot;City Lights&quot;, like &quot;Sunrise&quot;, was released with a recorded score and sound effects, but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a &quot;silent&quot;—spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema.) The earliest sound film to place is the French &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; (1934), directed by Jean Vigo; the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), directed by Howard Hawks.

The first sound feature film to receive near-universal critical approbation was &quot;Der Blaue Engel&quot; (&quot;The Blue Angel&quot;); premiering on April 1, 1930, it was directed by Josef von Sternberg in both German and English versions for Berlin&#x27;s UFA studio. The first American talkie to be widely honored was &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, directed by Lewis Milestone, which premiered April 21. The other internationally acclaimed sound drama of the year was &quot;Westfront 1918&quot;, directed by G. W. Pabst for Nero-Film of Berlin. Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of &quot;the new verisimilitude [that] rendered silent cinema&#x27;s former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow, as well as its preference for allegorical characters, anachronistic.&quot; Cultural historians consider the French &quot;L&#x27;Âge d&#x27;Or&quot;, directed by Luis Buñuel, which appeared late in 1930, to be of great aesthetic import; at the time, its erotic, blasphemous, anti-bourgeois content caused a scandal. Swiftly banned by Paris police chief Jean Chiappe, it was unavailable for fifty years. The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero-Film&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;, directed by Fritz Lang, which premiered May 11, 1931. As described by Roger Ebert, &quot;Many early talkies felt they had to talk all the time, but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives, providing a rat&#x27;s-eye view.&quot;

=== Cinematic form ===
&quot;Talking film is as little needed as a singing book.&quot; Such was the blunt proclamation of critic Viktor Shklovsky, one of the leaders of the Russian formalist movement, in 1927. While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art, others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity. The following year, a group of Soviet filmmakers, including Sergei Eisenstein, proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition, the so-called contrapuntal method, would raise the cinema to &quot;...unprecedented power and cultural height. Such a method for constructing the sound-film will not confine it to a national market, as must happen with the photographing of plays, but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea.&quot; So far as one segment of the audience was concerned, however, the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation: Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes, &quot;Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse, cinema, on equal terms with hearing people. The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again.&quot;

On March 12, 1929, the first feature-length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere. The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, it was not a drama, but a documentary sponsored by a shipping line: &quot;Melodie der Welt&quot; (&quot;Melody of the World&quot;), directed by Walter Ruttmann. This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is &quot;intricate, dynamic, fast-paced ... juxtapos[ing] similar cultural habits from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score ... and many synchronized sound effects.&quot; Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: &quot;&quot;Melodie der Welt&quot; became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse.&quot; &quot;Melodie der Welt&quot; was a direct influence on the industrial film &quot;Philips Radio&quot; (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims:

To render the half-musical impressions of factory sounds in a complex audio world that moved from absolute music to the purely documentary noises of nature. In this film every intermediate stage can be found: such as the movement of the machine interpreted by the music, the noises of the machine dominating the musical background, the music itself is the documentary, and those scenes where the pure sound of the machine goes solo.

Many similar experiments were pursued by Dziga Vertov in his 1931 &quot;Entuziazm&quot; and by Chaplin in &quot;Modern Times&quot;, a half-decade later.

A few innovative commercial directors immediately saw the ways in which sound could be employed as an integral part of cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In &quot;Blackmail&quot;, Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character&#x27;s monologue so the word &quot;knife&quot; would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount &quot;Applause&quot; (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, &quot;They said we couldn&#x27;t record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. So I said to the sound man, &#x27;Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?&#x27;&quot; Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.

One of the first commercial films to take full advantage of the new opportunities provided by recorded sound was &quot;Le Million&quot;, directed by René Clair and produced by Tobis&#x27;s French division. Premiering in Paris in April 1931 and New York a month later, the picture was both a critical and popular success. A musical comedy with a barebones plot, it is memorable for its formal accomplishments, in particular, its emphatically artificial treatment of sound. As described by scholar Donald Crafton,

&quot;Le Million&quot; never lets us forget that the acoustic component is as much a construction as the whitewashed sets. [It] replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets. Clair created teasing confusions between on- and off-screen sound. He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks, as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football (or rugby) crowd.

These and similar techniques became part of the vocabulary of the sound comedy film, though as special effects and &quot;color&quot;, not as the basis for the kind of comprehensive, non-naturalistic design achieved by Clair. Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by &quot;Melodie der Welt&quot; and &quot;Le Million&quot; would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre-based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling. As accurately predicted in 1928 by Frank Woods, secretary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, &quot;The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama... The talking scenes will require different handling, but the general construction of the story will be much the same.&quot;

<doc id="70322" wikidata="Q185387" url="?curid=70322" title="Suffrage">
<text>Suffrage, political franchise, or simply franchise is the right to vote in public, political elections and referendums (although the term is sometimes used for any right to vote). In some languages, and occasionally in English, the right to vote is called active suffrage, as distinct from passive suffrage, which is the right to stand for election. The combination of active and passive suffrage is sometimes called &quot;full suffrage&quot;.

In most democracies, eligible voters can vote in elections for representatives. Voting on issues by referendum (direct democracy) may also be available. For example, in Switzerland, this is permitted at all levels of government. In the United States, some states allow citizens the opportunity to write, propose, and vote on referendums (popular initiatives); other states and the federal government do not. Referendums in the United Kingdom are rare.

Suffrage continues to be especially restricted on the basis of age, residency and citizenship status in many places. In some countries additional restrictions exist. In Great Britain and the United States a felon might lose the right to vote. In some countries being under guardianship may restrict the right to vote. Non-resident citizen voting allows emigrants and expats of some countries to vote in their home country. Resident non-citizens can vote in some countries, which may be restricted to citizens of closely linked countries (e.g., Commonwealth citizens and European Union citizens) or to certain offices or questions. Multiple citizenship typically allows to vote in multiple countries. Historically the right to vote was more restricted, for example by gender, race, or wealth.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;suffrage&quot; comes from Latin , which initially meant &quot;a voting-tablet&quot;, &quot;a ballot&quot;, &quot;a vote&quot;, or &quot;the right to vote&quot;. in the second century and later came to mean &quot;political patronage, influence, interest, or support&quot;, and sometimes &quot;popular acclaim&quot; or &quot;applause&quot;. By the fourth century the word was used for &quot;an intercession&quot;, asking a patron for their influence with the Almighty. was used in the fifth and sixth centuries with connection to buying influence or profiteering from appointing to office, and eventually the word referred to the bribe itself. William Smith rejects the connection of to &quot;sub&quot; &quot;under&quot; + &quot;fragor&quot; &quot;crash, din, shouts (as of approval)&quot;, related to &quot;frangere&quot; &quot;to break&quot;; Eduard Wunder writes that the word may be related to &quot;suffrago&quot;, signifying an ankle bone or knuckle bone. In the 17th century the English &quot;suffrage&quot; regained the earlier meaning of the Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;a vote&quot; or &quot;the right to vote&quot;.

==Types==

===Universal suffrage===
Universal suffrage would be achieved when all have the right to vote without restriction. It could, for example, look like a system where everyone was presumed to have the right to vote unless a government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the need to revoke voting rights. The trend towards universal suffrage has progressed in some democracies by eliminating some or all of the voting restrictions due to gender, race, religion, social status, education level, wealth, citizenship, ability and age. However, throughout history the term &#x27;universal suffrage&#x27; has meant different things with the different assumptions about the groups that were or were not deemed desirable voters.

==== Early history ====
The short-lived Corsican Republic (1755–1769) was the first country to grant limited universal suffrage to all citizens over the age of 25.

In 1819, 60–80,000 women and men from 30 miles around Manchester assembled in the city&#x27;s St. Peter&#x27;s Square to protest their lack of any representation in the Houses of Parliament. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. (The eponymous &quot;Peterloo&quot; film featured a scene of women suffragists planning their contribution to the protest.) At that time Manchester had a population of around 140,000 and the population totals of Greater Manchester were around 490,000.

This was followed by other experiments in the Paris Commune of 1871 and the island republic of Franceville (1889). From 1840 to 1852, the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i granted universal suffrage without mention of sex. In 1893, when the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i was overthrown in a coup, New Zealand was the only independent country to practice universal (active) suffrage, and the Freedom in the World index lists New Zealand as the only free country in the world in 1893.

====Women&#x27;s suffrage====

Women&#x27;s suffrage is the right of women to vote. This was the goal of the suffragists, who believed in using legal means, as well as the suffragettes, who used extremist measures. Short-lived suffrage equity was drafted into provisions of the State of New Jersey&#x27;s first, 1776 Constitution, which extended the Right to Vote to unwed female landholders and black land owners.
However, the document did not specify an Amendment procedure, and the provision was subsequently replaced in 1844 by the adoption of the succeeding constitution, which reverted to &quot;all white male&quot; suffrage restrictions.

Although the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i granted female suffrage in 1840, the right was rescinded in 1852. Limited voting rights were gained by some women in Sweden, Britain, and some western U.S. states in the 1860s. In 1893, the British colony of New Zealand became the first self-governing nation to extend the right to vote to all adult women. In 1894, the women of South Australia achieved the right to both vote and stand for Parliament. The autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire was the first nation to allow all women to both vote and run for parliament.

==== Anti-women&#x27;s suffrage propaganda ====
Those against the women&#x27;s suffrage movement made public organizations to put down the political movement, with the main argument being that a woman&#x27;s place was in the home, not polls. Political cartoons and public outrage over women&#x27;s rights increased as the opposition to suffrage worked to organize legitimate groups campaigning against women&#x27;s voting rights. The Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women was one organization that came out of the 1880s to put down the voting efforts.

Much anti-suffrage propaganda poked fun at the idea of women in politics. Political cartoons displayed the most sentiment by portraying the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage to be swapped with men&#x27;s lives. Some mocked the popular suffrage hairstyle of full-upward combed hair. Others depicted young girls turning into suffragettes after a failure in life, such as not being married.

===Equal suffrage===

Equal suffrage is sometimes confused with &quot;Universal suffrage&quot;, although the meaning of the former is the removal of graded votes, wherein a voter could possess a number of votes in accordance with income, wealth or social status.

===Passive suffrage===
===Census suffrage===
Also known as &quot;censitary suffrage&quot;, it is the opposite of &quot;equal suffrage,&quot; meaning that the votes cast by those eligible to vote are not equal, but weighed differently according to the person&#x27;s income or rank in society (e.g., people who do not own property or whose income is lower than a given amount are barred from voting; or people with higher education have more votes than those with lower education; stockholders who have more shares in a given company have more votes than those with fewer shares). In many countries, census suffrage restricted who could vote and be elected: in the United States, until the Jacksonian reforms of the 1830s, only men who owned land of a specified acreage or monetary value could vote or participate in elections. Similarly, in Brazil, the Constitution of 1824 established that, in order to vote, citizens would need to have an annual income of 200,000 milréis and, to be voted, their minimum annual income would need to be 400,000 milréis.

===Compulsory suffrage===

Where compulsory suffrage exists, those who are eligible to vote are required by law to do so. Thirty-two countries currently practise this form of suffrage.

===Business vote===
In local government in England and some of its ex-colonies, businesses formerly had, and in some places still have, a vote in the urban area in which they paid rates. This is an extension of the historical property-based franchise from natural persons to other legal persons.

In the United Kingdom, the Corporation of the City of London has retained and even expanded business vote, following the passing of the City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002. This has given business interests within the City of London, which is a major financial centre with few residents, the opportunity to apply the accumulated wealth of the corporation to the development of an effective lobby for UK policies. This includes having the City Remembrancer, financed by the City&#x27;s Cash, as a parliamentary agent, provided with a special seat in the House of Commons located in the under-gallery facing the Speaker&#x27;s chair. In a leaked document from 2012, an official report concerning the City&#x27;s Cash revealed that the aim of major occasions such as set-piece sumptuous banquets featuring national politicians was &quot;to increase the emphasis on complementing hospitality with business meetings consistent with the City corporation&#x27;s role in supporting the City as a financial centre&quot;.

The first issue taken up by the Northern Ireland civil rights movement was the business vote, abolished in 1968 (a year before it was abolished in Great Britain outside the City of London).

In the Republic of Ireland, commercial ratepayers can vote in local plebiscites, for changing the name of the locality or street, or delimiting a business improvement district. From 1930 to 1935, 5 of 35 members of Dublin City Council were &quot;commercial members&quot;.

In cities in most Australian states, voting is optional for businesses but compulsory for individuals.

Some municipalities in Delaware allow corporations to vote on local matters.

==Basis of exclusion==
===Gender===
In ancient Athens, often cited as the birthplace of democracy, only adult, male citizens who owned land were permitted to vote. Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times. The high rank ascribed to abbesses within the Catholic Church permitted some women the right to sit and vote at national assemblies – as with various high-ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire. Their Protestant successors enjoyed the same privilege almost into modern times.

Marie Guyart, a French nun who worked with the First Nations peoples of Canada during the seventeenth century, wrote in 1654 regarding the suffrage practices of Iroquois women, &quot;These female chieftains are women of standing amongst the savages, and they have a deciding vote in the councils. They make decisions there like the men, and it is they who even delegated the first ambassadors to discuss peace.&quot; The Iroquois, like many First Nations peoples in North America, had a matrilineal kinship system. Property and descent were passed through the female line. Women elders voted on hereditary male chiefs and could depose them.

The emergence of many modern democracies began with male citizens obtaining the right to vote in advance of female citizens, except in the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i, where universal suffrage without mention of age or sex was introduced in 1840; however, a constitutional amendment in 1852 rescinded female voting and put property qualifications on male voting.

Voting rights for women were introduced into international law by the United Nations&#x27; Human Rights Commission, whose elected chair was Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1948 the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 21 states: &quot;(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.&quot;

The United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Political Rights of Women, which went into force in 1954, enshrining the equal rights of women to vote, hold office, and access public services as set out by national laws. One of the most recent jurisdictions to acknowledge women&#x27;s full right to vote was Bhutan in 2008 (its first national elections). Most recently, in 2011 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia let women vote in the 2015 local elections (and from then on) and be appointed to the Consultative Assembly.

===Religion===
In the aftermath of the Reformation it was common in European countries for people of disfavored religious denominations to be denied civil and political rights, often including the right to vote, to stand for election or to sit in parliament. In Great Britain and Ireland, Roman Catholics were denied the right to vote from 1728 to 1793, and the right to sit in parliament until 1829. The anti-Catholic policy was justified on the grounds that the loyalty of Catholics supposedly lay with the Pope rather than the national monarch.

In England and Ireland, several Acts practically disenfranchised non-Anglicans or non-Protestants by imposing an oath before admission to vote or to stand for office. The 1672 and 1678 Test Acts forbade non-Anglicans to hold public offices, and the 1727 Disenfranchising Act took away Catholics&#x27; voting rights in Ireland, which were restored only in 1788. Jews could not even be naturalized. An attempt was made to change this situation, but the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753 provoked such reactions that it was repealed the following year. Nonconformists (Methodists and Presbyterians) were only allowed to run for election to the British House of Commons starting in 1828, Catholics in 1829 (following the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which extended the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791), and Jews in 1858 (with the Emancipation of the Jews in England). Benjamin Disraeli could only begin his political career in 1837 because he had been converted to Anglicanism at the age of 12.

In several states in the U.S. after the Declaration of Independence, Jews, Quakers or Catholics were denied voting rights and/or forbidden to run for office. The Delaware Constitution of 1776 stated that:Every person who shall be chosen a member of either house, or appointed to any office or place of trust, before taking his seat, or entering upon the execution of his office, shall (...) also make and subscribe the following declaration, to wit: &quot;I, A B. do profess faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ His only Son, and in the Holy Ghost, one God, blessed for evermore; and I do acknowledge the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by divine inspiration.&quot;This was repealed by article I, section 2 of the 1792 Constitution: &quot;No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust, under this State&quot;. The 1778 Constitution of the State of South Carolina stated that &quot;No person shall be eligible to sit in the house of representatives unless he be of the Protestant religion&quot;, the 1777 Constitution of the State of Georgia (art. VI) that &quot;The representatives shall be chosen out of the residents in each county (...) and they shall be of the Protestent &quot;(sic)&quot; religion&quot;. In Maryland, voting rights and eligibility were extended to Jews in 1828.

In Canada, several religious groups (Mennonites, Hutterites, Doukhobors) were disenfranchised by the wartime Elections Act of 1917, mainly because they opposed military service. This disenfranchisement ended with the closure of the First World War, but was renewed for Doukhobors from 1934 (via the &quot;Dominion Elections Act&quot;) to 1955.

The first Constitution of modern Romania in 1866 provided in article 7 that only Christians could become Romanian citizens. Jews native to Romania were declared stateless persons. In 1879, under pressure from the Berlin Peace Conference, this article was amended, granting non-Christians the right to become Romanian citizens, but naturalization was granted on a case-by-case basis and was subject to Parliamentary approval. An application took over ten years to process. Only in 1923 was a new constitution adopted, whose article 133 extended Romanian citizenship to all Jewish residents and equality of rights to all Romanian citizens.

===Wealth, tax class, social class===

Until the nineteenth century, many Western proto-democracies had property qualifications in their electoral laws; e.g. only landowners could vote (because the only tax for such countries was the property tax), or the voting rights were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid (as in the Prussian three-class franchise). Most countries abolished the property qualification for national elections in the late nineteenth century, but retained it for local government elections for several decades. Today these laws have largely been abolished, although the homeless may not be able to register because they lack regular addresses.

In the United Kingdom, until the House of Lords Act 1999, peers who were members of the House of Lords were excluded from voting for the House of Commons as they were not commoners. Although there is nothing to prevent the monarch from voting, it is considered improper for the monarch to do so.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, many nations made voters pay to elect officials, keeping impoverished people from being fully enfranchised. These laws were in effect in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

===Knowledge===
Sometimes the right to vote has been limited to people who had achieved a certain level of education or passed a certain test. In some US states, &quot;literacy tests&quot; were previously implemented to exclude those who were illiterate. Black voters in the South were often deemed by election officials to have failed the test even when they did not. Under the 1961 constitution of Rhodesia, voting on the &quot;A&quot; roll, which elected up to 50 of the 65 members of parliament, was restricted based on education requirements, which in practice led to an overwhelming white vote. Voting on the &quot;B&quot; roll had universal suffrage, but only appointed 15 members of parliament.

In the 20th century, many countries other than the US placed voting restrictions on illiterate people, including: Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.

===Race===
Various countries, usually countries with a dominant race within a wider population, have historically denied the vote to people of particular races, or to all but the dominant race. This has been achieved in a number of ways:
* Official – laws and regulations passed specifically disenfranchising people of particular races (for example, the Antebellum United States, Boer republics, pre-apartheid and apartheid South Africa, or many colonial political systems, who provided suffrage only for white settlers and some privileged non-white groups). Canada and Australia denied suffrage for their indigenous populations until the 1960s.
* Indirect – nothing in law specifically prevents anyone from voting on account of their race, but other laws or regulations are used to exclude people of a particular race. In southern states of the United States of America before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, poll taxes, literacy and other tests were used to disenfranchise African-Americans. Property qualifications have tended to disenfranchise a minority race, particularly if tribally owned land is not allowed to be taken into consideration. In some cases this was an unintended (but usually welcome) consequence. Many African colonies after World War II until decolonization had tough education and property qualifications which practically gave meaningful representation only for rich European minorities.
* Unofficial – nothing in law prevents anyone from voting on account of their race, but people of particular races are intimidated or otherwise prevented from exercising this right. This was a common tactic employed by white Southerners against Freedmen during the Reconstruction Era and the following period before more formal methods of disenfranchisement became entrenched. Unofficial discrimination could even manifest in ways which, while allowing the act of voting itself, effectively deprive it of any value – for example, in Israel, the country&#x27;s Arab minority has maintained a party-system separate from that of the Jewish majority. In the run-up for the country&#x27;s 2015 elections, the electoral threshold was raised from 2% to 3.25%, thus forcing the dominant Arab parties – Hadash, the United Arab List, Balad and Ta&#x27;al – either to run under one list or risk losing their parliamentary representation.

===Age===

All modern democracies require voters to meet age qualifications to vote. Worldwide voting ages are not consistent, differing between countries and even within countries, though the range usually varies between 16 and 21 years. The United Kingdom was the first major democratic nation to extend suffrage to those 18 and older in 1969.

The movement to lower the voting age is one aspect of the Youth rights movement. Demeny voting has been proposed as a form of proxy voting by parents on behalf of their children who are below the age of suffrage.

===Criminality===
Some countries restrict the voting rights of convicted criminals. Some countries, and some U.S. states, also deny the right to vote to those convicted of serious crimes even after they are released from prison. In some cases (e.g. in many U.S. states) the denial of the right to vote is automatic upon a felony conviction; in other cases (e.g. France and Germany) deprivation of the vote is meted out separately, and often limited to perpetrators of specific crimes such as those against the electoral system or corruption of public officials. In the Republic of Ireland, prisoners are allowed the right to vote, following the &quot;Hirst v UK (No2)&quot; ruling, which was granted in 2006. Canada allowed only prisoners serving a term of less than 2 years the right to vote, but this was found to be unconstitutional in 2002 by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)&quot;, and all prisoners have been allowed to vote as of the 2004 Canadian federal election.

===Residency===
Under certain electoral systems elections are held within subnational jurisdictions, thus preventing persons from voting who would otherwise be eligible on the basis that they do not reside within such a jurisdiction, or because they live in an area that cannot participate. In the United States, license plates in Washington, D.C. read &quot;TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION,&quot; in reference to the district not holding a seat in either the House of Representatives or Senate, however residents can vote in presidential elections based on the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted in 1961. Residents of Puerto Rico enjoy neither.

Sometimes citizens become ineligible to vote because they are no longer resident in their country of citizenship. For example, Australian citizens who have been outside Australia for more than one and fewer than six years may excuse themselves from the requirement to vote in Australian elections while they remain outside Australia (voting in Australia is compulsory for resident citizens).
Danish citizens that reside permanently outside Denmark lose their right to vote.

In some cases, a certain period of residence in a locality may required for the right to vote in that location. For example, in the United Kingdom up to 2001, each 15 February a new electoral register came into effect, based on registration as of the previous 10 October, with the effect of limiting voting to those resident five to seventeen months earlier depending on the timing of the election.

===Nationality===

In most countries, suffrage is limited to citizens and, in many cases, permanent residents of that country. However, some members of supra-national organisations such as the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Union have granted voting rights to citizens of all countries within that organisation. Until the mid-twentieth century, many Commonwealth countries gave the vote to all British citizens within the country, regardless of whether they were normally resident there. In most cases this was because there was no distinction between British and local citizenship. Several countries qualified this with restrictions preventing non-white British citizens such as Indians and British Africans from voting. Under European Union law, citizens of European Union countries can vote in each other&#x27;s local and European Parliament elections on the same basis as citizens of the country in question, but usually not in national elections.

===Naturalization===
In some countries, naturalized citizens do not have the right to vote or to be a candidate, either permanently or for a determined period.

Article 5 of the 1831 Belgian Constitution made a difference between ordinary naturalization, and &quot;grande naturalisation&quot;. Only (former) foreigners who had been granted &quot;grande naturalisation&quot; were entitled to vote, be a candidate for parliamentary elections, or be appointed minister. However, ordinary naturalized citizens could vote for municipal elections. Ordinary naturalized citizens and citizens who had acquired Belgian nationality through marriage could vote, but not run as candidates for parliamentary elections in 1976. The concepts of ordinary and grande naturalization were suppressed from the Constitution in 1991.

In France, the 1889 Nationality Law barred those who had acquired the French nationality by naturalization or marriage from voting, and from eligibility and access to several public jobs. In 1938 the delay was reduced to five years. These instances of discrimination, as well as others against naturalized citizens, were gradually abolished in 1973 (9 January 1973 law) and 1983.

In Morocco, a former French protectorate, and in Guinea, a former French colony, naturalized citizens are prohibited from voting for five years following their naturalization.

In the Federated States of Micronesia, one must be a Micronesian citizen for at least 15 years to run for parliament.

In Nicaragua, Peru and the Philippines, only citizens by birth are eligible for being elected to the national legislature; naturalized citizens enjoy only voting rights.

In Uruguay, naturalized citizens have the right of eligibility to the parliament after five years.

In the United States, the President and Vice President must be natural-born citizens. All other governmental offices may be held by any citizen, although citizens may only run for Congress after an extended period of citizenship (seven years for the House of Representatives and nine for the Senate).

===Function===
In France, an 1872 law, rescinded by a 1945 decree, prohibited all army personnel from voting.

In Ireland, police (the Garda Síochána and, before 1925, the Dublin Metropolitan Police) were barred from voting in national elections, though not local elections, from 1923 to 1960.

The 1876 Constitution of Texas (article VI, section 1) stated that &quot;The following classes of persons shall not be allowed to vote in this State, to wit: (...) Fifth—All soldiers, marines and seamen, employed in the service of the army or navy of the United States.&quot;

In many countries with a presidential system of government a person is forbidden to be a legislator and an official of the executive branch at the same time. Such provisions are found, for example, in Article I of the U.S. Constitution.

The vote was limited to male British subjects aged 21 or over who owned or rented sufficient property and were not imprisoned for a serious offence. Communally owned land was excluded from the property qualification, thus disenfranchising most Māori (indigenous) men.
* 1860 – Franchise extended to holders of miner&#x27;s licenses who met all voting qualifications except that of property.
* 1867 – Māori seats established, giving Māori four reserved seats in the lower house. There was no property qualification; thus Māori men gained universal suffrage before other New Zealanders. The number of seats did not reflect the size of the Māori population, but Māori men who met the property requirement for general electorates were able to vote in them or in the Māori electorates but not both.
* 1879 – Property requirement abolished.
* 1893 – Women won equal voting rights with men, making New Zealand the first nation in the world to allow women to vote.
* 1969 – Voting age lowered to 20.
* 1974 – Voting age lowered to 18.
* 1975 – Franchise extended to permanent residents of New Zealand, regardless of whether they have citizenship.
* 1996 – Number of Māori seats increased to reflect Māori population.
* 2010 – Prisoners imprisoned for one year or more denied voting rights while serving the sentence.

===Singapore===
===South Africa===
* 1910 – The Union of South Africa is established by the South Africa Act 1909. The House of Assembly is elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies. The franchise qualifications are the same as those previously existing for elections of the legislatures of the colonies that comprised the Union. In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State the franchise is limited to white men. In Natal the franchise is limited to men meeting property and literacy qualifications; it was theoretically colour-blind but in practise nearly all non-white men were excluded. The traditional &quot;Cape Qualified Franchise&quot; of the Cape Province is limited to men meeting property and literacy qualifications and is colour-blind; nonetheless 85% of voters are white. The rights of non-white voters in the Cape Province are protected by an entrenched clause in the South Africa Act requiring a two-thirds vote in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.
* 1930 – The Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Act, 1930 extends the right to vote to all white women over the age of 21.
* 1931 – The Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931 removes the property and literacy qualifications for all white men over the age of 21, but they are retained for non-white voters.
* 1936 – The Representation of Natives Act, 1936 removes black voters in the Cape Province from the common voters&#x27; roll and instead allows them to elect three &quot;Native Representative Members&quot; to the House of Assembly. Four Senators are to be indirectly elected by chiefs and local authorities to represent black South Africans throughout the country. The act is passed with the necessary two-thirds majority in a joint sitting.
* 1951 – The Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951 is passed by Parliament by an ordinary majority in separate sittings. It purports to remove coloured voters in the Cape Province from the common voters&#x27; roll and instead allow them to elect four &quot;Coloured Representative Members&quot; to the House of Assembly.
* 1952 – In &quot;Harris v Minister of the Interior&quot; the Separate Representation of Voters Act is annulled by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court because it was not passed with the necessary two-thirds majority in a joint sitting. Parliament passes the High Court of Parliament Act, 1952, purporting to allow it to reverse this decision, but the Appellate Division annuls it as well.
* 1956 – By packing the Senate and the Appellate Division, the government passes the South Africa Act Amendment Act, 1956, reversing the annulment of the Separate Representation of Voters Act and giving it the force of law.
* 1958 – The Electoral Law Amendment Act, 1958 reduces the voting age for white voters from 21 to 18.

* 1968 – The Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968 repeals the Separate Representation of Voters Act, removing all representation of coloured people in Parliament.
* 1969 – The first election of the Coloured Persons Representative Council (CPRC), which has limited legislative powers, is held. Every Coloured citizen over the age of 21 can vote for its members, in first-past-the-post elections in single-member constituencies.
* 1978 – The voting age for the CPRC is reduced from 21 to 18.
* 1981 – The first election of the South African Indian Council (SAIC), which has limited legislative powers, is held. Every Indian South African citizen over the age of 18 can vote for its members, in first-past-the-post elections in single-member constituencies.
* 1984 – The Constitution of 1983 establishes the Tricameral Parliament. Two new Houses of Parliament are created, the House of Representatives to represent coloured citizens and the House of Delegates to represent Indian citizens. Every coloured and Indian citizen over the age of 18 can vote in elections for the relevant house. As with the House of Assembly, the members are elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies. The CPRC and SAIC are abolished.
* 1994 – With the end of apartheid, the Interim Constitution of 1993 abolishes the Tricameral Parliament and all racial discrimination in voting rights. A new National Assembly is created, and every South African citizen over the age of 18 has the right to vote for the assembly. The right to vote is also extended to long term residents. It is estimated the 500 000 foreign nationals voted in the 1994 national and provincial elections. Elections of the assembly are based on party-list proportional representation. The right to vote is enshrined in the Bill of Rights.
* 1999 – In &quot;August and Another v Electoral Commission and Others&quot; the Constitutional Court rules that prisoners cannot be denied the right to vote without a law that explicitly does so.

===United Kingdom===
From 1265, a few percent of the adult male population in the Kingdom of England (of which Wales was a full and equal member from 1542) were able to vote in parliamentary elections that occurred at irregular intervals to the Parliament of England. The franchise for the Parliament of Scotland developed separately. King Henry VI of England established in 1432 that only owners of property worth at least forty shillings, a significant sum, were entitled to vote in an English county constituency. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute. Changes were made to the details of the system, but there was no major reform until the Reform Act 1832. A series of Reform Acts and Representation of the People Acts followed. In 1918, all men over 21 and some women over 30 won the right to vote, and in 1928 all women over 21 won the right to vote resulting in universal suffrage.
*Reform Act 1832 – extended voting rights to adult males who rented propertied land of a certain value, so allowing 1 in 7 adult males in the UK voting rights.
*Chartism – The People&#x27;s Charter was drawn up in 1838 by the London Working Men&#x27;s Association. The following year, the first Chartist petition was presented to House of Commons. Further Chartist petitions were presented in 1842 and 1848.
* Reform Act 1867 – extended the franchise to men in urban areas who met a property qualification, so increasing male suffrage.
* Reform Act 1884 – addressed imbalances between the boroughs and the countryside; this brought the voting population to 5,500,000, although 40% of males were still disenfranchised because of the property qualification.
* Between 1885 and 1918 moves were made by the women&#x27;s suffrage movement to ensure votes for women. However, the duration of the First World War stopped this reform movement.
* Representation of the People Act 1918 – the consequences of World War I persuaded the government to expand the right to vote, not only for the many men who fought in the war who were disenfranchised, but also for the women who worked in factories, agriculture and elsewhere as part of the war effort, often substituting for enlisted men and including dangerous work such as in munitions factories. All men aged 21 and over were given the right to vote. Property restrictions for voting were lifted for men. The local government franchise was extended to include all women over 21, on the same terms as men. Parliamentary Votes were given to 40% of women, with property restrictions and limited to those over 30 years old. This increased the electorate from 7.7 million to 21.4 million with women making up 8.5 million of the electorate. Seven percent of the electorate had more than one vote, either because they owned business property or because they were university graduates. The first election with this system was the 1918 general election.
* Representation of the People Act 1928 – equal suffrage for women and men, with voting possible at 21 with no property restrictions.
* Representation of the People Act 1948 – removed plural voting in parliamentary elections for university graduates and business owners.
* Representation of the People Act 1969 – extension of suffrage to those 18 and older, the first major democratic country to do so, and abolition of plural voting in local government elections.

===United States===

The Constitution of the United States did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to decide this status. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population). By 1856 property ownership requirements were eliminated in all states, giving suffrage to most white men. However, tax-paying requirements remained in five states until 1860 and in two states until the 20th century.

Since the Civil War, five amendments to the Constitution have limited the ways in which the right to vote may be restricted in American elections, though none have added a general right to vote.
* 15th Amendment (1870): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot;
* 19th Amendment (1920): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.&quot;
* 23rd Amendment (1961): provides that residents of the District of Columbia can vote for the President and Vice President.
* 24th Amendment (1964): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.&quot; This did not change the rules for state elections.
* 26th Amendment (1971): &quot;The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.&quot;

The use of grandfather clauses to allow European-Americans to vote while excluding African-Americans from voting was ruled unconstitutional in the 1915 decision &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot;. States continued to use literacy tests and poll taxes, which also disenfranchised poor white citizens. Racial equality in voting was substantially secured after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a major victory in the Civil Rights Movement. State elections, it was not until the 1966 decision &quot;Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections&quot; that the U.S. Supreme Court declared state poll taxes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

<doc id="70328" wikidata="Q5160979" url="?curid=70328" title="Congressional power of enforcement">
<text>A Congressional power of enforcement is included in a number of amendments to the United States Constitution. The language &quot;The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation&quot; is used, with slight variations, in Amendments XIII, XIV, XV, XIX, XXIII, XXIV, and XXVI. 

The variations in the pertinent language are as follows: 

* The Fourteenth Amendment states &quot;The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.&quot; 
* The Eighteenth Amendment states &quot;The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.&quot;

==Initial creation and use==
These provisions made their first appearance in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which were adopted during the Reconstruction period primarily to abolish slavery and protect the rights of the newly emancipated African-Americans. The enforcement provisions contained in these amendments extend the powers of Congress originally enumerated in Article One, Section 8 of the Constitution, and have the effect of increasing the power of Congress and diminishing that of the individual states. They led to the &quot;Enforcement Acts&quot; of 1870 and 1871. Congress had only that power delegated (granted, given) to it by the Constitution.

==Use in the courts==
Interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s enforcement provision has been the subject of several important Supreme Court cases, which reflect the tension between the Courts&#x27; role of interpreting the Constitution and Congress&#x27;s power of adopting legislation to enforce specific Constitutional amendments.

Early on, in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; decided in 1883, the Supreme Court concluded that the Congressional enforcement power in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment did not authorize Congress to use the Privileges or Immunities Clause of that amendment to ban racial discrimination in public accommodations operated by private persons, such as inns and theaters. The Court stated that since the Fourteenth Amendment only restricted state action, Congress lacked power under this amendment to forbid discrimination that was not sponsored by the state. This ruling has not been overturned, although in modern times, similar civil rights legislation has been upheld under Congress&#x27;s power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One, Section 8 of the Constitution. See Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In the &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot; case, decided in 1966, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress can forbid practices that are not themselves unconstitutional, if the law is aimed at preventing or remedying constitutional violations. On that basis, the Court upheld a provision of the Voting Rights Act that prevented states from using English language literacy tests as qualifications for voting. The Court decided that the law was a valid exercise of Congress&#x27;s enforcement power under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it was aimed at remedying state-sponsored discrimination, despite an earlier court finding that a literacy test was not in and of itself a violation of the 14th Amendment.

In 1970, however, in &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot;, the Court held that Congress had exceeded its power by attempting to require the states to reduce the voting age to 18. This led to adoption of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the Constitution in 1971, which provided that the states could not set a minimum voting age higher than 18.

In the 1997 case of &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot;, the Court again took a narrow view of the Congressional power of enforcement, striking down a provision of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) that sought to forbid the states from placing burdens on religious practice in the absence of a compelling state interest in doing so. In enacting RFRA, Congress had sought to overturn the 1988 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot;, which had held that the Constitution does not require states to recognize religious exemptions to laws of general applicability. In the &quot;Boerne&quot; case, the Supreme Court decided that RFRA overstepped Congress&#x27;s authority, because the statute was not sufficiently connected to the goal of remedying a constitutional violation, but instead created new rights that are not guaranteed by the Constitution. Some observers have suggested that the Supreme Court saw RFRA as a threat to the Court&#x27;s institutional power and an incursion on its role as final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution, because that statute was aimed specifically at overturning the &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; decision. However, the effect of &quot;Boerne&quot; lasted beyond &quot;Boerne&quot; itself. The standard announced in that case—that all legislation enacted under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment must be &quot;congruent and proportional&quot; to the unconstitutional harm it seeks to remedy—has been followed by every post-&quot;Boerne&quot; decision on legislation that sought to abrogate the states&#x27; sovereign immunity. 

&quot;United States v. Morrison&quot;, decided in 2000, is one controversial successor case. In that case, the Supreme Court, applying the congruent-and-proportional &quot;Boerne&quot; test, overturned provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which created federal civil jurisdiction over gender-based violence. The Court held that Congress did not have the power to enact a remedy targeting private action rather than state action, and that it could not enact a Section 5 remedy without findings of national, or near-national, harm.

<doc id="70342" wikidata="Q629271" url="?curid=70342" title="Direct Connect (protocol)">
<text>Direct Connect (DC) is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Direct Connect clients connect to a central hub and can download files directly from one another. Advanced Direct Connect can be considered a successor protocol.

Hubs feature a list of clients or users connected to them. Users can search for files and download them from other clients, as well as chat with other users.

==History==
NeoModus was started as a company funded by the adware &quot;Direct Connect&quot; by Jon Hess in November, 1999 while he was in high school.

The first third-party client was called &quot;DClite&quot;, which never fully supported the file sharing aspects of the protocol. Hess released a new version of Direct Connect, requiring a simple encryption key to initiate a connection, locking out third-party clients. The encryption key was cracked, and the author of DClite released a new version of DClite compatible with the new software from NeoModus. Some time after, DClite was rewritten as Open Direct Connect with the purpose of having an MDI user interface and using plug-ins for file sharing protocols (similar to MLDonkey). Open Direct Connect also did not have complete support for the full file sharing aspects of the protocol, but a port to Java, however, did. Later on, other clients such as DCTC (Direct Connect Text Client) and DC++ became popular.

The DCDev archive contains discussions of protocol changes for development of DC in the years 2003–2005.

==Protocol==
The Direct Connect protocol is a text-based computer protocol, in which commands and their information are sent in clear text, without encryption in original NeoModus software (encryption is available as a protocol extension). Clients connect to a central server acting as a &quot;hub&quot;. This hub provides content discovery and allows clients to negotiate direct connections with each other for transferring content. Since this central hub only deals with metadata, it does not have anywhere near the same bandwidth requirements as if it also had been serving the content itself; an estimate shows that handling 1000 users would require about 2.5 mbit/s of bandwidth.

There is no official specification of the protocol, meaning that every client and hub (besides the original NeoModus client and hub) has been forced to reverse engineer the information. As such, any protocol specification this article may reference is likely inaccurate and/or incomplete.

The client-server (as well as client-client, where one client acts as &quot;server&quot;) aspect of the protocol stipulates that the server respond first when a connection is being made. For example, when a client connects to a hub&#x27;s socket, the hub is first to respond to the client.

The protocol lacks a specified default character encoding for clients or hubs. The original client and hub use ASCII encoding instead of that of the Operating system. This allows migration to UTF-8 encoding in newer software.

Port 411 is the default port for hubs, and 412 for client-to-client connections. If either of these ports is already in use, the port number is incremented until the number of a free port is found for use. For example, if 411, 412 and 413 are in use, then port 414 will be used.

Hub addresses are in the following form: dchub://example.com[:411], where 411 is an optional port.

There is no global identification scheme; instead, users are identified with their nickname on a hub-to-hub basis.

An incoming request for a client-client connection cannot be linked with an actual connection.

A search result cannot be linked with a particular search.

The ability to kick or move (redirect) a user to another hub is supported by the protocol. If a user is kicked, the hub is not required to give that user a specific reason, and there is no restriction on where a user can be redirected to. However, if another client in power instructs the hub to kick, that client may send out a notification message before doing so. Redirecting a user must be accompanied by a reason. There is no HTTP referer equivalent.

Hubs may send out user commands to clients. These commands are only raw protocol commands and are used mostly for making a particular task simpler. For example, the hub cannot send a user command that will trigger the default browser to visit a website. It can, however, add the command &quot;+rules&quot; (where &#x27;+&#x27; indicates to the hub that it&#x27;s a command - this may vary) to display the hub&#x27;s rules.

The peer-to-peer part of the protocol is based on a concept of &quot;slots&quot; (similar to number of open positions for a job). These slots denote the number of people that are allowed to download from a user at any given time and are controlled by the client.

In client-to-client connections, the parties generate a random number to see who should be allowed to download first, and the client with the greater number wins.

Transporting downloads and connecting to the hub requires TCP, while active searches use UDP.

There are two kinds of modes a user can be in: either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot; mode. Clients using active mode can download from anyone else on the network, while clients using passive mode users can only download from active users. In NeoModus Direct Connect, passive mode users receive other passive mode users&#x27; search results, but the user will not be able to download anything. In DC++, users will not receive those search results. In NeoModus Direct Connect, all users will be sent at most five search results per query. If a user has searched, DC++ will respond with ten search results when the user is in active mode and five when the user is in passive mode. Passive clients will be sent search results through the hub, while active clients will receive the results directly.

Protocol delimiters are &quot;$&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, and . Protocol have for them (and few others) escape sequence and most software use them correctly in login 
(Lock to Key) sequence. For some reason that escape sequence was ignored by DC++ developers and they use HTML equivalent if these characters are to be viewed by the user.

Continued interest exists in features such as ratings and language packs. The authors of DC++ also proposed a complete replacement of the Direct Connect protocol called ADC, or unofficially, Advanced Direct Connect. ADC uses the same network topology, concepts, and terminology as the original protocol.

One example of an added feature to the protocol, in comparison with the original protocol, is the broadcasting of Tiger-Tree Hashing of shared files (TTH). The advantages of this include verifying that a file is downloaded correctly, and the ability to find files independently of their names.

== Direct Connect used for DDoS attacks ==
As the protocol allows hubs to redirect users to other hubs, malicious hubs have redirected users to places other than real Direct Connect hubs, effectively causing a Distributed Denial of Service attack. The hubs may alter the IP in client to client connections, pointing to a potential victim.

The CTM Exploit surfaced in 2006–2007, during which period the whole Direct Connect network suffered from DDoS attacks. The situation prompted developers to take security issues more seriously.

As of February 2009, an extension for clients was proposed in order for the attacked party to find out the hub sending the connecting users.

== Direct Connect Network Foundation ==
The Direct Connect Network Foundation (DCNF) is a non-profit organization registered in Sweden that aims to improve the DC network by improving software, protocols and other services in the network.

== Articles and papers ==
The DCNF maintains a list of articles, papers and more documentation that relate to DC.

<doc id="70345" wikidata="Q847220" url="?curid=70345" title="Shareaza">
<text>Shareaza is a peer-to-peer file sharing client running under Microsoft Windows which supports the Gnutella, Gnutella2 (G2), eDonkey, BitTorrent, FTP, HTTP and HTTPS network protocols and handles magnet links, ed2k links, and the now deprecated gnutella and Piolet links. It is available in 30 languages.

Shareaza was developed by Michael Stokes until June 1, 2004, and has since been maintained by a group of volunteers. On June 1, 2004, Shareaza 2.0 was released, along with the source code, under the GNU General Public License (GPL-2.0-or-later), making it free software.

== Features ==

=== Multi-network ===
Shareaza can connect to Gnutella, G2, eDonkey and BitTorrent. Shareaza hashes its files for all networks, and then distributes those hash values on G2. This allows Shareaza to download one file from several networks at once. When another client connected to G2 finds such a file, it is given the hash values for all networks and can search on the other networks with their respective hash values, which increases the number of sources and the download speed of the file. Shareaza also uses its G2 network to find more sources for torrents.

=== Security filter ===
The Shareaza client has some basic content filters including a forced child and optional adult pornography filter, and some other optional filters such as a filter for files encumbered with Digital rights management (DRM). Shareaza&#x27;s security filters can also be extended with user-defined keywords and/or IP addresses. Later versions of Shareaza allow for the use of regular expressions and filtering by hash. These filters increase the chances of getting the files the user wants and decrease the chance of getting malicious or fake files. The file format used for the filters is an extendable XML schema. The filters are editable inside Shareaza, and can be exported from the application to be shared with others.

=== Plugins ===
Shareaza implements a framework for additional plugins. The Shareaza installer ships several plugins. Most of them are used to read and strip off built in metadata from the files being hashed and convert it to an external XML based format, or to decode multimedia files for making a preview for other G2 clients. Some others serve the need of a media player inside Shareaza, and enhancements of that media player. Third party plugins can also be used, for example, &quot;Sharemonkey&quot;, which will add a link inside Shareaza when downloading or searching copyrighted material from where it can be legally downloaded.

=== Skins ===
The client can have almost all parts of the GUI skinned. This includes bars, icons, as well as backgrounds and buttons. In that way, Shareaza can be completely changed with colors, images, new buttons, etc. A basic list of skins is contained in the Shareaza installer package. Other skins can be downloaded in the community forums or found via a search for .sks (Shareaza skin files) in the G2 network. The skins are zip archives, renamed with the extension .sks, containing icons and images, as well as an XML file which binds the images and colors with the GUI.

This feature is also used for localization. The language files are XML files, like the normal skins, but not zipped. The XML file contains the translations for a certain part of the program. This enables languages to be easily changed, updated and tested without compiling an entire binary.

=== Modes ===
Shareaza has three user modes. The first one is for normal users. This mode is the default mode and provides a clean, trimmed GUI. Users will not be able to make major changes to settings in this mode but will be able to make use of the most essential functions, like searching and downloading. The second mode is for power users. It provides more access to network and advanced settings but can also break your connection to the networks. The third mode is the windowed mode. In this mode, users can see different tabs (windows) simultaneously, providing a lot of control about the things happening. This mode also makes it possible to personalize the look of the client to perfectly fit the needs of the respective user.

=== IRC ===
Shareaza contains a built-in IRC (chat) client which allows users to communicate with each other. There are channels in several languages for support and help. These channels are located on the P2PChat servers and can also be joined by any normal IRC client or via a Java addon on the Shareaza homepage.

== History ==

In mid-2002 Stokes released the first version of a gnutella client he had written and dubbed &quot;Shareaza&quot;. It was from the beginning a client with the aim of having features other gnutella clients did not have. Over the next two years Stokes coded in support for the eDonkey 2000 network, BitTorrent and a rewritten gnutella-based protocol which he named Gnutella2.

On June 1, 2004 Stokes released the Shareaza source code under the GPL-2.0-or-later license (which coincided with the release of Shareaza version 2.0). Shareaza joined LimeWire, Gnucleus, and others as an open-source client on the Gnutella network.

Since the beginning Shareaza was advertised as &quot;completely free. No ads, no spyware, no guilting you to upgrade to a commercial version&quot;, stating that the developers &quot;[couldn&#x27;t] stand that kind of crap.&quot; It has remained as such in each subsequent release.

From the first version Shareaza has supported swarming, metadata, library management, and automatic file hashing.

=== Domain takeover ===
On 19 December 2007 the project&#x27;s domain name, shareaza.com, was redirected to a site claiming to be &quot;The Official Home of Shareaza&quot;, promoting the download of a client known as Shareaza V4 (which had become V6 in October 2009, V7 in August 2010, and V8 ) unrelated to releases by the Shareaza development team, an iMesh clone with only small graphical modifications, and using Shareaza v1 logo. The domain owner Jon Nilson was forced to sell it as a part of a settlement with &quot;La Societe Des Producteurs De Phonogrammes En France&quot;. This client is a network interface for a centralised music shop by Discordia Ltd. and does not connect to any open P2P network such as Gnutella, G2, eDonkey or BitTorrent. Content is limited to the DRM-protected music that can be bought in Discordia&#x27;s online music store; Discordia is a company based in Cyprus, closely related to the RIAA and unrelated to the Shareaza development team. In response the Shareaza development team moved their website to SourceForge.

Versions prior to 2.3.1.0 of the original Shareaza connected to www.shareaza.com to check for software updates. From 1 January 2008 the new owner of the domain shareaza.com, Discordia Ltd. used this update check mechanism to suggest to users that ShareazaV4 (and later ShareazaV5, V6, and V7) was an update to the original Shareaza client. Since version 2.3.1.0, released on 3 January 2008, the original Shareaza has linked to the Shareaza pages at sourceforge.net.

=== Trademark registration by iMesh===
On January 10, 2008, the new owners of Shareaza.com, Discordia Ltd (iMesh Inc.), filed for trademark registration of the Shareaza name in an attempt to stop the original developers from using the name, claiming that the first-ever use was on December 17, 2007. The Shareaza Development Team obtained legal representation to challenge the registration and a legal defense fund was set up. The development team appointed William Erwin to handle the donations; it was stated that he had been paid by iMesh to sabotage the defense, and that he had stolen the money donated. The trademark was awarded to iMesh after the development team had given up defending the trademark.

=== Version history ===
Release notes for all versions from 2.0.0.0 are linked from the Sharaza ChangeLog page.

v2.3.1.0
Version 2.3.1.0 is the last stable version of Shareaza that supports Windows 9x. It followed 2 days after the new owners of the project domain exploited the updating mechanism to emit a false update message to trick users into installing their fake Shareaza V4 client and contained a fix for this issue.

v2.4.0.0
Version 2.4.0.0 of Shareaza was released on October 1, 2008, with many bug fixes and major changes to provide better stability of the client. It was the first stable release to include IRC support. Furthermore, major changes to the torrent handling mechanism were made and Windows 98/Me support was discontinued (the last version working on Windows 9x is 2.3.1.0).

When v2.4 was released the roadmap for the next version (2.4.1.0, a v2.5 release candidate) was set for release around October 1, 2009, to be followed by 2.5.0.0 a month later.

v2.5.x.0
Version 2.5.0.0 of Shareaza was released on October 31, 2009. It was significantly more stable and less resource-consuming than earlier versions, and further improved BitTorrent support, such as by selective downloading of files contained in batch torrents and download prioritization. There were also updates to the Gnutella and eD2k implementation, such as extended support for GGEP, large files and chat. The IRC implementation of v2.4.0.0 was reworked to free it of the bugs that made it partially unusable in the previous version. Download manager capabilities were extended, Internet Explorer integration added, and &quot;BugTrap&quot; included to speed up and simplify reporting crashes.

Version 2.5.1.0 of Shareaza was released on December 1, 2009. It was significantly more stable and more functional than its predecessor due to fixed bugs. It improved usability and compatibility of BitTorrent according to most popular service suggestions. It made use of and required the SSE instruction set, and thus required at least a Pentium-III or an Athlon-XP processor.

Version 2.5.2.0 of Shareaza was released on February 6, 2010. It brought further improvements on stability. This and later versions were available optionally either as an SSE or non-SSE build to allow the use of older processors, unlike the SSE-only version 2.5.1.0. For this and later releases the SSE-optimized build uses SSE2 and requires at least a Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64.

Shareaza v2.5.3.0, released on June 13, 2010, focused on internal changes and optimizations; the only significant addition was a scheduler that allows full control over what the application does at a given time while running unattended.

Shareaza v2.5.4.0, released on February 12, 2011, improved UPnP support and added limited DC++ support. μTorrent-compatible peer exchange and tracker exchange for BitTorrent were also added. It fixed remaining IRC chat bugs and a lot of rather uncommon/rarely seen crashes.

Shareaza v2.5.5.0, released on May 29, 2011, further improved UPnP support and included DC++ and Gnutella updates, enhanced anti-spam protection during searches, and multi-file download merging.

;V2.6.0.0
V2.6.0.0 was released on 3 June 2012, adding support for BitTorrent (Mainline) DHT and UDP trackers as well as containing interface optimizations for Windows 7.

;V2.7.x.x
Shareaza 2.7.0.0 was made available on 31 August 2013, with a great many bugfixes. It contained major improvements to the BitTorrent support, eDonkey uploading and the built-in media player. It was followed by further V2.7.x.x releases.

== Awards and reviews ==
* In November 2008, Shareaza was SourceForge &quot;Project of the Month&quot;.
* In December 2009 Shareaza was ranked number 5 in SourceForge.Net&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Hot for Windows?&quot; file sharing software ranking with 78% &quot;recommended&quot; (while number 1 was 81% &quot;recommended&quot;). it was in the same position. The ranking is based on user recommendations and opinions and downloads of software from project site.

<text>Newcastle upon Tyne, or simply Newcastle ( , ), is a cathedral city and metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear, England. It is England&#x27;s northernmost metropolitan borough, located on the River Tyne&#x27;s northern bank opposite Gateshead to the south. It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.

Newcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as &quot;Monkchester&quot; before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror&#x27;s eldest son, Robert Curthose. It was one of the world&#x27;s largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, but governed as a county corporate after 1400. In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. The local authority is Newcastle City Council, which is a constituent member of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority.

==History==
===Roman===
The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius (&quot;Hadrian&#x27;s bridge&quot;), a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the &quot;Roman Wall&quot; can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend – the &quot;wall&#x27;s end&quot; – and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

The extent of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was , spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. However, it seems that the Vallum stopped just west of Newcastle, where its role as a secondary line of defence was performed by the River Tyne.
===Anglo-Saxon and Norman===
After the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as &quot;Munucceaster&quot; (sometimes modernised as &quot;Monkchester&quot;).

Conflicts with the Danes in 876 left the settlements along the River Tyne in ruins. After the conflicts with the Danes, and following the 1088 rebellion against the Normans, Monkchester was all but destroyed by Odo of Bayeux.

Because of its strategic position, Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, erected a wooden castle there in the year 1080. The town was henceforth known as &quot;Novum Castellum&quot; or &quot;New Castle&quot;. The wooden structure was replaced by a stone castle in 1087. The castle was rebuilt again in 1172 during the reign of Henry II. Much of the keep which can be seen in the city today dates from this period.

===Middle Ages===
Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England&#x27;s northern fortress. In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes and made a county of itself by Henry IV. Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. A stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century.

===16th to 19th centuries===

From 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen. This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town. The phrase &quot;taking coals to Newcastle&quot; was first recorded contextually in 1538. The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit.
In the 18th century, the American entrepreneur Timothy Dexter, regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom. He was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him; however, his shipment arrived on the Tyne during a strike that had crippled local production, allowing him to turn a considerable profit.
In the Sandgate area, to the east of the city, and beside the river, resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families. They were so called because they worked on the keels, boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for export to London and elsewhere. In the 1630s, about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, more than one-third of the population. Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the epidemic; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British city in this period.

During the English Civil War, the North declared for the King. In a bid to gain Newcastle and the Tyne, Cromwell&#x27;s allies, the Scots, captured the town of Newburn. In 1644, the Scots then captured the reinforced fortification on the Lawe in South Shields following a siege and the city was besieged for many months. It was eventually stormed (&quot;with roaring drummes&quot;) and sacked by Cromwell&#x27;s allies. The grateful King bestowed the motto &quot;Fortiter Defendit Triumphans&quot; (&quot;Triumphing by a brave defence&quot;) upon the town. Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646–7.

Newcastle opened its first lunatic asylum in 1767. The asylum catered for people from the counties of Newcastle, Durham and Northumberland.

The Newcastle Eccentrics of the 19th century were a group of unrelated people who lived in and around the centre of Newcastle and its Quayside between the end of the 18th and early/mid 19th century. They are depicted in a painting by Henry Perlee Parker.

Newcastle was the country&#x27;s fourth largest print centre after London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the Literary and Philosophical Society of 1793, with its erudite debates and large stock of books in several languages, predated the London Library by half a century. Some founder members of the Literary and Philosophical Society were abolitionists. Newcastle also became a glass producer with a reputation for brilliant flint glass.

A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Fenham Barracks in 1806.

The great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead was a tragic and spectacular series of events starting on Friday 6 October 1854, in which a substantial amount of property in the two North East of England towns was destroyed in a series of fires and an explosion which killed 53 and injured hundreds.

The status of city was granted to Newcastle on 3 June 1882. In the 19th century, shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city&#x27;s prosperity; and the city was a powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution. This revolution resulted in the urbanisation of the city. In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. The Victorian industrial revolution brought industrial structures that included the Victoria Tunnel, built in 1842, which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes. On 3 February 1879, Mosley Street in the city, was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb. Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting. Innovations in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps, Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket, Lord Armstrong&#x27;s artillery, Be-Ro flour, Lucozade, Joseph Swan&#x27;s electric light bulbs, and Charles Parsons&#x27; invention of the steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity. In 1882, Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese, with St. Nicholas&#x27; Church becoming its cathedral.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Newcastle&#x27;s public transport system was modernised in 1901 when Newcastle Corporation Tramways electric trams were introduced to the city&#x27;s streets, though these were replaced gradually by trolley buses from 1935, with the tram service finally coming to an end in 1950.

The city acquired its first art gallery, the Laing Art Gallery in 1904, so named after its founder Alexander Laing, a Scottish wine and spirit merchant who wanted to give something back to the city in which he had made his fortune. Another art gallery, the Hatton Gallery (now part of Newcastle University), opened in 1925.

With the advent of the motor car, Newcastle&#x27;s road network was improved in the early part of the 20th century, beginning with the opening of the Redheugh road bridge in 1901 and the Tyne Bridge in 1928.

Efforts to preserve the city&#x27;s historic past were evident as long ago as 1934, when the Museum of Science and Industry opened, as did the John G Joicey Museum in the same year.

Council housing began to replace inner-city slums in the 1920s, and the process continued into the 1970s, along with substantial private house building and acquisitions.

Unemployment hit record heights in Newcastle during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The city&#x27;s last coal pit closed in 1956, though a temporary open cast mine was opened in 2013. The temporary open cast mine shifted 40,000 tonnes of coal, using modern techniques to reduce noise, on a part of the City undergoing redevelopment. The slow demise of the shipyards on the banks of the River Tyne happened in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

During the Second World War, the city and surrounding area were a target for air raids as heavy industry was involved in the production of ships and armaments. The raids caused 141 deaths and 587 injuries. A former French consul in Newcastle called Jacques Serre assisted the German war effort by describing important targets in the region to Admiral Raeder who was the head of the German Navy.

The public sector in Newcastle began to expand in the 1960s. The federal structure of the University of Durham was dissolved. That university&#x27;s college in Newcastle, which had been known as King&#x27;s College, became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (now known as Newcastle University), which was founded in 1963, followed by Newcastle Polytechnic in 1969; the latter received university status in 1992 and became the University of Northumbria at Newcastle (now known as Northumbria University).

Further efforts to preserve the city&#x27;s historic past continued in the later 20th century, with the opening of Newcastle Military Vehicle Museum in 1983 and Stephenson Railway Museum in 1986. The Military Vehicle museum closed in 2006. New developments at the turn of the 21st century included the Life Science Centre in 2000 and Millennium Bridge in 2001.

Based at St James&#x27; Park since 1886, Newcastle United F.C. became Football League members in 1893. They have won four top division titles (the first in 1905 and the most recent in 1927), six FA Cups (the first in 1910 and the most recent in 1955) and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969. They broke the world transfer record in 1996 by paying £15 million for Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer, one of the most prolific goalscorers of that era.

In 2017, Newcastle was the venue for the 2017 Freedom City festival. The 2017 Freedom City festival commemorated the 50 years since Martin Luther King&#x27;s visit to Newcastle, where King received his honorary degree from Newcastle University. In 2018 Newcastle hosted the Great Exhibition of the North, the largest event in England in 2018. The exhibition began on 22 June with an opening ceremony on the River Tyne, and ended on 9 September with the Great North Run weekend. The exhibition describes the story of the north of England through its innovators, artists, designers and businesses.

In 2019, various travel sites named Newcastle to be the friendliest city in the UK.

==Geography==

Since 1974, Newcastle has been a part of the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear in North East England. The city is located on the north-western bank of the River Tyne, approximately south of the border with Scotland.
The ground beneath the city is formed from Carboniferous strata of the Middle Pennine Coal Measures Group — a suite of sandstones, mudstones and coal seams which generally dip moderately eastwards. To the west of the city are the Upper Pennine Coal Measures and further west again the sandstones and mudstones of the Stainmore Formation, the local equivalent of the Millstone Grit.

In large parts, Newcastle still retains a medieval street layout. Narrow alleys or &#x27;chares&#x27;, most of which can only be traversed by foot, still exist in abundance, particularly around the riverside. Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant Castle Keep, originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places. Close, Sandhill and Quayside contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries, including Bessie Surtees House, the Cooperage and Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House and House of Tides, a restaurant situated at a Grade I-listed 16th century merchant&#x27;s house at 28–30 Close.

The city has an extensive neoclassical centre referred to as Tyneside Classical, largely developed in the 1830s by Richard Grainger and John Dobson. More recently, Newcastle architecture considered to be Tyneside classical has been extensively restored. Broadcaster and writer Stuart Maconie described Newcastle as England&#x27;s best-looking city and the German-born British scholar of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner, describes Grey Street as one of the finest streets in England. In 1948 the poet John Betjeman said of Grey Street, &quot;As for the curve of Grey Street, I shall never forget seeing it to perfection, traffic-less on a misty Sunday morning.&quot; The street curves down from Grey&#x27;s Monument towards the valley of the River Tyne and was voted England&#x27;s finest street in 2005 in a survey of BBC Radio 4 listeners. In the Google Street View awards of 2010, Grey Street came 3rd in the British picturesque category. A portion of Grainger Town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, including all but one side of the original Eldon Square itself.

Immediately to the north-west of the city centre is Leazes Park, first opened to the public in 1873 after a petition by 3,000 working men of the city for &quot;ready access to some open ground for the purpose of health and recreation&quot;. Just outside one corner of this is St James&#x27; Park, the stadium home of Newcastle United FC which dominates the view of the city from all directions.

Another major green space in the city is the Town Moor, lying immediately north of the city centre. It is larger than London&#x27;s Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath put together and the freemen of the city have the right to graze cattle on it. The right extends to the pitch of St. James&#x27; Park, Newcastle United Football Club&#x27;s ground; this is not exercised, although the Freemen do collect rent for the loss of privilege. Honorary freemen include Bob Geldof, King Harald V of Norway, Bobby Robson, Alan Shearer, the late Nelson Mandela and the Royal Shakespeare Company. The Hoppings funfair, said to be the largest travelling funfair in Europe, is held here annually in June.

In the south-eastern corner of the Town Moor is Exhibition Park, which contains the only remaining pavilion from the North East Coast Exhibition of 1929. From the 1970s until 2006 this housed the Newcastle Military Vehicle Museum; which closed in 2006. The pavilion is now being used as a microbrewery and concert venue for Wylam Brewery.

=== Ouseburn ===
The wooded gorge of the Ouseburn in the east of the city is known as Jesmond Dene and forms another recreation area, linked by Armstrong Park and Heaton Park to the Ouseburn Valley, where the river finally reaches the River Tyne.

The springtime dawn chorus at 55 degrees latitude has been described as one of the best in the world. The dawn chorus of the Jesmond Dene green space has been professionally recorded and has been used in various workplace and hospital rehabilitation facilities.

===Quayside===

The area around the Tyne Gorge, between Newcastle on the north bank and Gateshead on the south bank, is the famous Newcastle-Gateshead Quayside. It is famed for its series of dramatic bridges, including the Tyne Bridge of 1928 which was built by Dorman Long of Middlesbrough, Robert Stephenson&#x27;s High Level Bridge of 1849, the first road/rail bridge in the world, and the Swing Bridge of 1876.

Large-scale regeneration efforts have led to the replacement of former shipping premises with modern new office developments; an innovative tilting bridge - the Gateshead Millennium Bridge - integrated the Quayside more closely with the Gateshead Quayside, home to the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art (the venue for the Turner Prize 2011) and the Norman Foster-designed Sage Gateshead music centre. The Newcastle and Gateshead Quaysides are now a thriving, cosmopolitan area with bars, restaurants, hotels and public spaces.

===Grainger Town===
The historic heart of Newcastle is the Grainger Town area. Established on classical streets built by Richard Grainger, a builder and developer, between 1835 and 1842, some of Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre including Grainger Market, Theatre Royal, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street. These buildings are predominantly four stories high, with vertical dormers, domes, turrets and spikes. Richard Grainger was said to &#x27;have found Newcastle of bricks and timber and left it in stone&#x27;. Of Grainger Town&#x27;s 450 buildings, 244 are listed, of which 29 are grade I and 49 are grade II*.
Grey&#x27;s Monument, which commemorates Prime Minister Earl Grey and his Reform Act 1832, stands above Monument Metro Station and was designed and built by Edward Hodges Baily and Benjamin Green. Hodges, who also built Nelson&#x27;s Column, designed and built the statue, and the monument plinth was designed and built by Benjamin Green.

The Grainger Market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the Butcher Market. The Grainger Market itself, was opened in 1835 and was Newcastle&#x27;s first indoor market. At the time of its opening in 1835 it was said to be one of the largest and most beautiful markets in Europe. The opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests, and the Laing Art Gallery has a painting of this event. With the exception of the timber roof which was destroyed by a fire in 1901 and replaced by latticed-steel arches the Market is largely in its original condition. The Grainger Market architecture, like most in Grainger Town, which are either grade I or II listed, was listed grade I in 1954 by English Heritage.

The development of the city in the 1960s saw the demolition of part of Grainger Town as a prelude to the modernist rebuilding initiatives of T. Dan Smith, the leader of Newcastle City Council. A corruption scandal was uncovered involving Smith and John Poulson, a property developer from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and both were imprisoned. Echoes of the scandal were revisited in the late 1990s in the BBC TV mini-series, &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;.

====Chinatown====

Newcastle&#x27;s thriving Chinatown lies in the north-west of Grainger Town, centred on Stowell Street. A new Chinese arch, or &quot;paifang&quot;, providing a landmark entrance, was handed over to the city with a ceremony in 2005.

===Housing===
The Tyneside flat was the dominant housing form constructed at the time when the industrial centres on Tyneside were growing most rapidly. They can still be found in areas such as South Heaton in Newcastle but once dominated the streetscape on both sides of the Tyne. Tyneside flats were built as terraces, one of each pair of doors led to an upstairs flat while the other led into the ground-floor flat, each of two or three rooms. A new development in the Ouseburn valley has recreated them; Architects Cany Ash and Robert Sakula were attracted by the possibilities of high density without building high and getting rid of common areas.

In terms of housing stock, the authority is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached homes rise in the 2010 Census (to 7.8%), in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments to 25.6%, and the proportion of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five colour-coded brackets at 5.9%, and on a par with Oxford and Reading, greater than Manchester and Liverpool and below a handful of historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities: Harrogate, Cheltenham, Bath, inner London, Hastings, Brighton and Royal Tunbridge Wells.

Significant Newcastle housing developments include Ralph Erskine&#x27;s the Byker Wall designed in the 1960s, and now Grade II* listed. It is on UNESCO&#x27;s list of outstanding 20th-century buildings. The Byker Redevelopment has won the first Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design in 1988.

===Climate===
Newcastle has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Data in Newcastle was first collected in 1802 by the solicitor James Losh. Situated in the rain shadow of the North Pennines, Newcastle is amongst the driest cities in the UK. Temperature extremes recorded at Newcastle Weather Centre include set in July 2022 down to on 29 December 1995. Newcastle can have cool to cold winters, though usually warmer than the rural areas around it, and the winters are often compensated for by warm summers, with very long daylight hours in the summer months, longer than all other major English cities. Newcastle upon Tyne shares the same latitude as Copenhagen and southern Sweden.

The nearest weather station to provide sunshine statistics is at Durham, about south of Newcastle City Centre. Durham&#x27;s inland, less urbanised setting results in night-time temperature data about 1 degree cooler than Newcastle proper throughout the year.

===Environment===

The city is located within the centre of the North East Green Belt, also known as the Tyne and Wear Green Belt.

The green belts stated aims are to:

* &quot;Prevent the merging of settlements&quot;
* &quot;Safeguard the countryside from encroachment&quot;
* &quot;Check unrestricted urban sprawl&quot;
* &quot;Assist in urban regeneration in the city-region by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land&quot;

The green belt surrounds Brunswick Village, Dinnington, Callerton, Hazlerigg, Throckley, Walbottle, and Woolsington. Popular locations such as Ryton Island, Tyne Riverside Country Park, the city&#x27;s golf courses, Newcastle Racecourse, and Newcastle International Airport fall inside the green belt.

The city has been recognised for its commitment to environmental issues, with a programme planned for Newcastle to become &quot;the first carbon neutral city&quot; however, those plans have been revised and they now hope to be carbon neutral by 2050.

==Culture==

===Nightlife===

&quot;The Rough Guide to Britain&quot; placed Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s nightlife as Great Britain&#x27;s number one tourist attraction. In the Tripadvisor Travellers&#x27; Choice Destination Awards for Nightlife destinations, Newcastle was awarded third place in Europe (behind London and Berlin) and seventh place in the world. In July 2023 Newcastle was voted the best city in the UK for food, fashion and nightlife.

There are many bars on the Bigg Market and its adjoining streets. Other areas popular for nightlife include Collingwood Street (commonly referred to as the &#x27;Diamond Strip&#x27; due to its concentration of high-end bars). Neville Street, the Central Station area, Osborne Road in Jesmond and the wider Ouseburn area are home to a variety of younger metropolitan bars. &quot;The Gate&quot;, located on Newgate Street, has become a popular venue for late-night entertainment in the past decade and a half. Newcastle&#x27;s &#x27;pink triangle&#x27; is concentrated on Times Square, surrounded by the Centre for Life.

Bakery chain Greggs was founded, and is headquartered, in Newcastle and has the greatest number of Greggs stores per capita in the world. Local delicacies include pease pudding and stottie cake.

In 1967, London based Smith&#x27;s Crisps created Salt &amp; Vinegar flavour crisps which were first produced by their Newcastle based subsidiary Tudor Crisps and tested in Tudor&#x27;s home market of north-east England before being launched nationally.

In 2010, Osborne Road in Jesmond was awarded fourth place in the UK Google Street View awards for the &quot;foodie&quot; category. Newcastle has its own Chinatown.

Additionally, the city has a wide variety of cuisines available including Greek, Mexican, Spanish, Indian, Italian, Persian, Japanese, Malaysian, French, American, Mongolian, Moroccan, Thai, Polish, Vietnamese and Lebanese. There has also been a noticeable growth in Newcastle&#x27;s gourmet restaurant industry in recent years.

===Theatre===
The city has a proud history of theatre. Stephen Kemble of the well-known Kemble family managed the original Theatre Royal, Newcastle for fifteen years (1791–1806). He brought members of his famous acting family such as Sarah Siddons and John Kemble out of London to Newcastle. Stephen Kemble guided the theatre through many celebrated seasons. The original Theatre Royal in Newcastle was opened on 21 January 1788 and was located on Mosley Street. It was demolished to make way for Grey Street, where its replacement was built. 

The city still contains many theatres. The largest, the Theatre Royal on Grey Street, first opened in 1837, designed by John and Benjamin Green. It has hosted a season of performances from the Royal Shakespeare Company for over 25 years, as well as touring productions of West End musicals. The Mill Volvo Tyne Theatre hosts smaller touring productions, whilst other venues feature local talent. Northern Stage, formally known as the Newcastle Playhouse and Gulbenkian Studio, hosts various local, national and international productions in addition to those produced by the Northern Stage company. Other theatres in the city include the Live Theatre, the People&#x27;s Theatre, Alphabetti Theatre, Gosforth Civic Theatre, and the Jubilee Theatre. NewcastleGateshead was voted in 2006 as the arts capital of the UK in a survey conducted by the Artsworld TV channel.

===Literature and libraries===

Newcastle has a strong reputation as a poetry centre. The Morden Tower, run by poet Tom Pickard, is a major venue for poetry readings in the North East, being the place where Basil Bunting gave the first reading of &quot;Briggflatts&quot; in 1965.

The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne (popularly known as the &#x27;Lit &amp; Phil&#x27;) is the largest independent library outside London, housing more than 150,000 books. Its music library contains 8,000 CDs and 10,000 LPs. The current Lit and Phil premises were built in 1825 and the building was designed by John and Benjamin Green. Operating since 1793 and founded as a &#x27;conversation club,&#x27; its lecture theatre was the first public building to be lit by electric light, during a lecture by Joseph Swan on 20 October 1880.

The old City library designed by Basil Spence, was demolished in 2006 and replaced. The new building opened on 21 June 2009 and was named after the 18th-century local composer Charles Avison; the building was first opened by Dr Herbert Loebl. Later that year it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children&#x27;s Books, opened in 2005 in the Ouseburn Valley.

===Music===
Newcastle&#x27;s vernacular music was a mixture of Northumbrian folk music and nineteenth-century songs with dialect lyrics, by writers such as George &quot;Geordie&quot; Ridley, whose songs include one which became an unofficial Tyneside national anthem, &quot;Blaydon Races&quot;.

The 1960s saw the internationally successful rock group The Animals emerge from Newcastle night spots such as Club A-Go-Go on Percy Street. Other well-known acts with connections to the city include Sting, Bryan Ferry, Dire Straits and more recently Maxïmo Park. There is also a thriving underground music scene that encompasses a variety of styles, including drum and bass, doom metal and post-rock.

Lindisfarne are a folk-rock group with a strong Tyneside connection. Their most famous song, &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot; (1971), was covered by Geordie ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne in 1990. Venom, reckoned by many to be the originators of black metal and extremely influential to the extreme metal scene as a whole, formed in Newcastle in 1979. Folk metal band Skyclad, often regarded as the first folk metal band, also formed in Newcastle after the break-up of Martin Walkyier thrash metal band, Sabbat. Andy Taylor, former lead guitarist of Duran Duran was born here in 1961. Brian Johnson was a member of local rock band Geordie before becoming the lead vocalist for Australian band AC/DC.
Newcastle is the home of Kitchenware Records (c. 1982), previously home to acclaimed bands such as Prefab Sprout, Martin Stephenson and the Daintees and The Fatima Mansions. The members of Lighthouse Family met at Newcastle University; the music video for their hit single &quot;High&quot; features the city&#x27;s Tyne Bridge.

The 1990s boom in progressive house music saw the city&#x27;s Global Underground record label publish mix CDs by the likes of Sasha, Paul Oakenfold, James Lavelle, and Danny Howells recording mix compilations. The label is still going strong today with offices in London and New York, and new releases from Deep Dish and Adam Freeland.

Newcastle&#x27;s leading classical music ensemble is the Royal Northern Sinfonia, which was founded in 1958 and performed regularly at Newcastle City Hall until 2004. Nowadays it is based at The Sage, Gateshead.

ICMuS, Newcastle University&#x27;s music department, has been a driving force for music in the region, producing innovative work, organising concerts and festivals, instigating the first degree programme in folk music in the British Isles, and engaging creatively with communities in the region.

===Concert venues===

The largest venue used for music concerts is St James Park, home of Newcastle United, which has also previously been used for Rugby League games and the Olympic Games. The second largest music venue in Newcastle is the 11,000-seat Utilita Arena Newcastle, which opened in 1995 and hosts major pop and rock concerts. Newcastle City Hall is one of the oldest venues in the region and &quot;attracts big names who are often legends of the past&quot;. Both of the city&#x27;s universities have venues that mainly host indie and alternative bands.

On 14 October 2005, the 2,000 capacity NX Newcastle opened. It had previously been a music venue in the 1960s, hosting concerts by The Beatles and The Who. The new venue was headlined by The Futureheads on the opening night and known as the Carling Academy for a number of years, then as the O2 Academy. Since opening the venue has hosted performances by major bands and solo musicians including Adele, Arctic Monkeys, Katy Perry, The Libertines, Blondie and Amy Winehouse.

The Riverside music venue on Melbourne Street, open from 1985 until 1999, notably hosted Nirvana&#x27;s first European show in 1989. The venue also welcomed Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers, David Bowie and The Stone Roses and was named Best Regional Venue by NME in 1993. Riverside has also been the subject of a book, &quot;Riverside: Newcastle&#x27;s Legendary Alternative Music Venue&quot;.

In 2016 open-air concerts took place at Times Square for the first time, including performances from Maxïmo Park, Ocean Colour Scene and Catfish and the Bottlemen.

The small music venue Think Tank? was a nominee for Best Small Venue in NME in 2015. The Cluny in Ouseburn Valley is &quot;one of the most important venues for breaking bands in the region&quot;. Trillians Rock Bar is well-noted for its rock and metal shows, and The Head of Steam is a 90-capacity basement venue described as &quot;one of Newcastle&#x27;s staple venues&quot;.

===Independent cinema===

Newcastle has multiple independent cinemas, including the famous Tyneside Cinema, located on Pilgrim Street. It originally opened as the &#x27;Bijou News-Reel Cinema&#x27; in 1937, and was designed and built by Dixon Scott, great-uncle of film directors Ridley Scott and Tony Scott. The Pilgrim Street building was refurbished between November 2006 and May 2008; during the refurbishment works, the cinema relocated to the Old Town Hall, Gateshead. In May 2008 the Tyneside Cinema reopened in the restored and refurbished original building. The site currently houses three cinemas, including the restored Classic —the United Kingdom&#x27;s last surviving news cinema still in full-time operation—alongside two new screens, and dedicated education and teaching suites.

As well as this, the city is home to The Side Cinema and Star and Shadow Cinema which are both small venues which have built up cult audiences of film fans.

==Media==

===TV and film===

The earliest known film featuring some exterior scenes filmed in the city is &quot;On the Night of the Fire&quot; (1939), though by and large the action is studio-bound. Later came &quot;The Clouded Yellow&quot; (1951) and &quot;Payroll&quot; (1961), both of which feature more extensive scenes filmed in the city. The gangster thriller &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971) was shot on location in and around Newcastle and offers an opportunity to see what Newcastle looked like in the early 1970s. The city was also backdrop to another gangster film, the film noir &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (1988), directed by Mike Figgis and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting and Sean Bean. As well as this, Newcastle was used as the location for &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; (2016) which won the Palme d&#x27;Or award at Cannes Film Festival as well as the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film.

The city has been the setting for films based around football; films such as &quot;Purely Belter&quot; (2000), &quot;The One and Only&quot; (2002) and &quot;Goal!&quot; have all been focused around Tyneside. The comedy &quot;School for Seduction&quot; (2004), starring Kelly Brook was also filmed in Newcastle.

The Bollywood film &quot;Hum Tum Aur Ghost&quot; (2010) was shot on location in Newcastle&#x27;s city centre and features key scenes in and around Grainger Town. The film &quot;Public Sex&quot; (2009) was shot in and around Newcastle, and features several scenes under and around the Tyne Bridge.

Crime drama &quot;Harrigan&quot; (2013) was filmed in the city as well as Gateshead and Teesside.

===Print media===
Local newspapers that are printed in Newcastle include Trinity Mirror&#x27;s &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; as well as the &quot;Metro&quot; freesheet. &quot;The Crack&quot; is a monthly style and listings magazine similar to London&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot;. The adult comic &quot;Viz&quot; originated in Jesmond and includes many references to Newcastle, and &quot;The Mag&quot; is a fanzine for Newcastle United supporters.

===Television===
BBC North East and Cumbria is based to the north of the city on Barrack Road, Spital Tongues, in a building known as the Pink Palace. It is from here that the Corporation broadcasts the &quot;Look North&quot; television regional news programme and local radio station BBC Radio Newcastle.
ITV Tyne Tees was based at City Road for over 40 years after its launch in January 1959. In 2005 it moved to a new facility on The Watermark business park next to the MetroCentre in Gateshead. The entrance to studio 5 at the City Road complex gave its name to the 1980s music television programme, &quot;The Tube&quot;.

===Radio===
Independent Local Radio stations include Hits Radio North East and sister station Greatest Hits Radio North East. Capital North East broadcasts across Newcastle and the North East England region. Heart North East and Smooth North East also broadcast from the city.

NE1fm launched in June 2007, the first full-time community radio station in the area.

Newcastle Student Radio is run by students from both of the city&#x27;s universities during term time. Radio Tyneside has been the voluntary hospital radio service for most hospitals across Newcastle and Gateshead since 1951. 

The city also has a Radio Lollipop station based at the Great North Children&#x27;s Hospital in the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary.

===City-centre Wi-Fi===

Newcastle was one of the first cities in the UK to have its city centre covered by free wireless internet access. It was developed and installed at the end of 2006 and went active in March 2007.

==Economy==

The city&#x27;s economy is diverse with major economic output in science, finance, retail, education, tourism, and nightlife. Newcastle is one of the UK Core Cities, as well as part of the Eurocities network.

Newcastle played a major role during the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, and was a leading centre for coal mining, shipbuilding, engineering, munitions and manufacturing. Heavy industries in Newcastle declined in the second half of the 20th century; with office, service and retail employment now becoming the city&#x27;s staples.

Today, Newcastle&#x27;s economy contributes around £13 billion to the UK GVA. This figure is mostly produced by corporate activity in the city centre.

The city&#x27;s thriving nightlife is estimated to be worth £340 million per year, and consequently is seen as a major contributor to Newcastle&#x27;s economy.

The UK&#x27;s first biotechnology village, the Centre for Life, is located by Central Station. The village is the first step in the City Council&#x27;s plans to transform Newcastle into a science city.

===Retail===

In 2010, Newcastle was positioned ninth in the retail centre expenditure league of the UK. There are several major shopping areas in Newcastle City Centre. The largest of these is the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the UK. It has one of the largest John Lewis &amp; Partners stores in the UK. This John Lewis branch was formerly known as Bainbridge, established in 1838, often cited as the world&#x27;s first department store. Emerson Bainbridge (1817–1892), a pioneer and the founder of Bainbridge, sold goods via department, a new arrangement of trade for that time. The Bainbridge official ledgers reported revenue by department, giving birth to the name department store. Eldon Square is currently undergoing a full redevelopment. A new bus station, replacing the old underground bus station, was officially opened in March 2007. The wing of the centre, including the undercover Green Market, near Grainger Street was demolished in 2007 so that the area could be redeveloped. This was completed in February 2010 with the opening of a Debenhams department store as well as other major stores including Apple, Hollister and Guess.

The main shopping street in the city is Northumberland Street. In a 2004 report, it was ranked as the most expensive shopping street in the UK for rent, outside London. It is home to two major department stores including the first and largest Fenwick department store, which houses some of the most luxurious designer labels, and one of the largest Marks and Spencer stores outside London. Both stores have entrances into Eldon Square Shopping Centre.

Other shopping destinations in Newcastle include Grainger Street and the area around Grey&#x27;s Monument, the relatively modern Eldon Garden and Monument Mall complexes, Central Arcade and the traditional Grainger Market. On Blackett Street can be found the silversmith Reid &amp; Sons which was established in the city in 1788. Outside the city centre, the largest suburban shopping areas are Gosforth and Byker. From 2007, inside Kingston Park, on the edge of Newcastle, the Tesco store was the largest Tesco hypermarket in the UK — for a period of time.
Close to Newcastle, the largest indoor shopping centre in Europe, the MetroCentre, is located in Gateshead.

==Population==


According to the ONS, Newcastle had a population of 293,000 in 2015. Tyneside (made up of Newcastle and the surrounding metropolitan boroughs of Gateshead, North Tyneside and South Tyneside) has a population of approximately 880,000, making it the eighth most populous urban area in the UK. The wider metropolitan area of Tyneside-Wearside has a population of approximately 1,122,000.

Additionally, Newcastle is home to a large temporary population of students from Newcastle and Northumbria universities. Areas of suburban Newcastle with significant student populations include Jesmond, Shieldfield, Gosforth, Sandyford, Spital Tongues and Heaton.

===Demographics===
====Age====
According to the same statistics, the average age of people living in Newcastle is 37.8 years, compared to the national average being of 38.6 years.

====Religion====
From the 2011 Census, two significant religions could be identified in the city: Christian and Muslim. 56.6% of Newcastle identified as Christian and 6.3% as Muslim. Over 28% stated they have no religious affiliation.

====Ethnicity and nationality====
According to the 2011 census, the metropolitan borough of Newcastle upon Tyne was predominately white, representing 85.3% of the population (including non-British white). Asians made up 9.8% of the population (2.3% Pakistani, 1.7% &#x27;Bangladeshi&#x27;, 1.8% &#x27;Indian&#x27;, 2.2% &#x27;Chinese&#x27;, 1.8% &#x27;Asian other&#x27;). Black people make up a small proportion of the population (1.7% &#x27;Black African&#x27;, 0.1% &#x27;Black Caribbean&#x27; and 0.1% &#x27;Black other&#x27;), as do mixed race groups at 1.6% (0.6% &#x27;Asian and White&#x27;, 0.3% &#x27;White and Caribbean&#x27;, 0.3% &#x27;White and African&#x27;, 0.4% &#x27;White and Other&#x27;). The last significantly sized ethnic community in Newcastle is &#x27;Arab&#x27; at 0.9%. The remainder of the population, 0.5%, represent other ethnicities.

Large populations of ethnic minorities can be found in areas such as Elswick, Wingrove and Arthurs Hill.

According to the 2011 UK Census, those born outside the UK were mainly from India (3,315), China (3,272), Pakistan (2,644), Bangladesh (2,276), Poland (1,473), Germany (1,357), Nigeria (1,226), Iran (1,164), Hong Kong (1,038) and Ireland (942).
In the North East, Newcastle was the most ethnically diverse district followed by Middlesbrough.

There are also small but significant Chinese, Jewish and Eastern European populations. The International Organization for Migration states there are estimated to be between 500 and 2,000 Bolivians in Newcastle, one of the largest populations in any city in the UK.

===Geordies===
The regional nickname for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie. The Latin term &quot;Novocastrian&quot; can equally be applied to residents of any place called Newcastle, although it is most commonly used for ex-pupils of the city&#x27;s Royal Grammar School.

====Dialect====

The dialect of Newcastle is also referred to as Geordie. It contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive words and pronunciations not used in other parts of the United Kingdom. The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This language was the forerunner of Modern English; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages—particularly Latin and Norman French—the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language. An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;cow&quot;, &quot;house&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; are pronounced &quot;deed&quot;, &quot;coo&quot;, &quot;hoos&quot; and &quot;strang&quot;—which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: &quot;larn&quot; (from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;laeran&quot;, meaning &quot;teach&quot;), &quot;burn&quot; (&quot;stream&quot;) and &quot;gan&quot; (&quot;go&quot;).

According to the British Library, &quot;Locals insist there are significant differences between Geordie and several other local dialects, such as Pitmatic and Mackem. Pitmatic is the dialect of the former mining areas in County Durham and around Ashington to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, while Mackem is used locally to refer to the dialect of the city of Sunderland and the surrounding urban area of Wearside&quot;.

&quot;Bairn&quot; and &quot;hyem&quot;, meaning &quot;child&quot; and &quot;home&quot;, respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia; &quot;barn&quot; and &quot;hjem&quot; are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words. Some words used in the Geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom. The words &quot;bonny&quot; (meaning &quot;pretty&quot;) and &quot;stot&quot; (&quot;bounce&quot;) are used in Scots; &quot;aye&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;) and &quot;nowt&quot; (IPA:/naʊt/, rhymes with &quot;out&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot;) are used elsewhere in Northern England. Many words, however, appear to be used exclusively in Newcastle and the surrounding area, such as &quot;canny&quot; (a versatile word meaning &quot;good&quot;, &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;very&quot;), &quot;hacky&quot; (&quot;dirty&quot;), &quot;netty&quot; (&quot;toilet&quot;), &quot;hockle&quot; (&quot;spit&quot;).

===Health===

According to research from 2011, public health and levels of deprivation in Newcastle upon Tyne was generally worse than average in England. As levels of deprivation is considerably higher than the nationwide average, sociologists argue that as a result, the life expectancy for both men and women is lower than the nationwide average. There is significant discrepancy between life expectancies in wealthy areas and deprived areas, with life expectancy up to 14.3 years lower for men and 11.1 years lower for women in deprived areas than in wealthy areas. From 2015 to 2019 Newcastle became relatively more deprived according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation.

From 2001 to 2011, as with all UK cities all-cause mortality rates have fallen, life expectancy has increased. Early death rates from cancer and from heart disease and stroke have fallen but remain worse than the England average.

Almost 21.9% of Year 6 children are clinically obese. In 2014/5, 35.9% of 10 to 11-year-olds were classified as overweight or obese, in comparison to a national average of 33.2%. 54.9% of pupils meet the recommendation of at least three hours each week on school sport. Levels of teenage pregnancy are higher than the nationwide average. In 2011, GCSE attainment amongst school children was worse than the England average. Estimated numbers of adults &#x27;healthy eating&#x27; are lower than the England average. Rates of smoking-related deaths and hospital stays for alcohol-related harm are higher than average.

Newcastle remains one of the few major cities in England to supply fluoridated water; this scheme is directed by Northumbria Water plc.

Newcastle has two large teaching hospitals: the Royal Victoria Infirmary and the Freeman Hospital, which is also a pioneering centre for transplant surgery.

In a report, published in early February 2007 by the Ear Institute at the University College London and Widex, Newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the UK with an average noise level of 80.4 decibels. The report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city&#x27;s residents. The report was criticised, however, for attaching too much weight to readings at arbitrarily selected locations, which in Newcastle&#x27;s case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access. As well as numerous parks, open spaces, and extensive riverside areas, puzzlingly the report also overlooked the 1000-acre Town Moor at the heart of the city. Larger than London&#x27;s Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath combined, and even larger than New York&#x27;s Central Park, the town moor dates back to the 12th century, with the land tenure and its use being regulated by an Act of Parliament.

==Sport==

The city has a strong sporting tradition.

=== Football ===
The Premier League&#x27;s only football club in North East England, Newcastle United, has been based at St James&#x27; Park since the club was established in 1892, although any traces of the original structure are now long gone as the stadium now holds more than 52,000 seated spectators, being England&#x27;s seventh largest football stadium. The city also has non-League football clubs, Newcastle Benfield, West Allotment Celtic, Team Northumbria and Heaton Stannington.

There is a women&#x27;s football team, Newcastle United Women&#x27;s Football Club, founded in 1989. Newcastle United W.F.C. currently has 40 ladies aged between 16 and 29 years signed or associated with the club, and plays in the FA Women&#x27;s Championship.

The 2012 London Olympic committee selected Newcastle as one of the UK host venue cities, with the stadium St James&#x27; Park hosting 9 matches in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s football.

==Transport==
===Air===


Newcastle International Airport is situated on the northern outskirts of the city at Woolsington, near to Ponteland. It is the largest and busiest airport in North East England and the second largest and busiest in Northern England (behind Manchester), handling over five million passengers per year. , Newcastle Airport operated flights to 90 destinations worldwide.
The airport is serviced by numerous airlines including British Airways, Jet2, easyJet, Emirates, Ryanair, Air France, TUI Airways, Loganair, KLM and Eurowings.

The airport is connected to Central Newcastle by the Tyne and Wear Metro, with an average journey between Central Station Metro station and Newcastle Airport Metro station taking approximately 20 minutes.

===Rail===

Newcastle Central Station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line and Cross Country Route. 

Train operator London North Eastern Railway provides a half-hourly frequency of trains to London King&#x27;s Cross, with a variable journey time of between two and three hours, and north to Scotland with all trains calling at Edinburgh Waverley and a small number of trains extended to Glasgow Central, Aberdeen and Inverness. CrossCountry links Newcastle with destinations in Yorkshire, the Midlands and the South West. TransPennine Express operates services to the North West. Northern Trains provide local and regional services. Additionally, ScotRail offer an infrequent service to Glasgow Central.

In 2014, work was completed on refurbishing the station&#x27;s historic entrance. 
Glazing was placed over the historic arches and the Victorian architecture was enhanced; transforming the 19th century public portico. The station is one of only six Grade One listed railway stations in the UK. Opened in 1850 by Queen Victoria, it was the first covered railway station in the world and was much copied across the UK. It has a neoclassical façade, originally designed by the architect John Dobson, and was constructed in collaboration with Robert Stephenson. The station sightlines towards the Castle Keep, whilst showcasing the curvature of the station&#x27;s arched roof. The first services were operated by the North Eastern Railway company.

The other mainline station in Newcastle is Manors, exclusively served by Northern Trains.

===Metro===

The city is served by the Tyne and Wear Metro, a system of suburban and underground railways covering much of Newcastle and the surrounding metropolitan boroughs. It was opened in five phases between 1980 and 1984, and was Britain&#x27;s first urban light rail transit system. The network was developed from a combination of existing and newly built tracks and stations, with deep-level tunnels constructed through Central Newcastle. A bridge was built across the Tyne, between Newcastle and Gateshead, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. Extensions to the network were opened in 1991 and 2002. It is operated directly by Nexus, carrying over 37 million passengers a year. In 2004, the company Marconi designed and constructed the mobile radio system to the underground Metro system. The Metro system was the first in the UK to have mobile phone antennae installed in the tunnels.

The Metro consists of two lines. The Green line begins at Newcastle Airport, goes through Central Newcastle and into the City of Sunderland, terminating at South Hylton. The yellow line starts at St James, runs north of the river alongside Byker towards Whitley Bay, before returning to Central Newcastle, then connecting to Gateshead Interchange before finally terminating at South Shields.

The system is currently undergoing a period of refurbishment and modernisation, entitled &#x27;Metro: All Change.&#x27; The programme has replaced all ticket machines and introduced ticket gates at the busiest stations – part of the transition to smart ticketing. All Metro trains are being completely refurbished and most stations are undergoing improvement works (or in some cases complete reconstruction, for example North Shields). In addition; tracks, signalling and overhead wires are also being overhauled. Longer-term plans include the procurement of an entirely new fleet of trains and further extensions to the system. Proposed routes include to Newcastle&#x27;s west end, to the Cobalt Business Park in North Tyneside, to the Metrocentre in Gateshead and to additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Several of the proposed routes would require trams as opposed to the current light rail trains.

===Road===

Major roads in the area include the A1 (Newcastle Gateshead Western Bypass), stretching north to Edinburgh and south to London; the A19 heading south past Sunderland and Middlesbrough to York and Doncaster; the A69 heading west to Carlisle; the A696, which becomes the A68 heads past Newcastle Airport and up through central Northumberland and central Scottish Borders, the A167, the old &quot;Great North Road&quot;, heading south to Gateshead, Chester-le-Street, Durham and Darlington; and the A1058 &quot;Coast Road&quot;, which runs from Jesmond to the east coast between Tynemouth and Cullercoats. Many of these designations are recent—upon completion of the Western Bypass, and its designation as the new line of the A1, the roads between this and the A1&#x27;s former alignment through the Tyne Tunnel were renumbered, with many city centre roads changing from a 6-prefix to their present 1-prefix numbers. In November 2011 the capacity of the Tyne Tunnel was increased when a project to build a second road tunnel and refurbish the first tunnel was completed.

Bus

Bus services in Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding boroughs part are coordinated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive. Stagecoach North East is the primary bus operator in the city, running city services between both the West and East ends, with some services extending out to the MetroCentre, Killingworth, Wallsend and Ponteland. Go North East provides the majority of services to and from the south of the Tyne, linking Newcastle with Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland, and County Durham. Arriva North East runs numerous services to the north of city, North Tyneside and Northumberland. Additionally, QuayLink connects Newcastle and Gateshead to the Quayside. Newcastle Central coach station is the city&#x27;s main hub for long-distance services, such as those operated by National Express.

Other major bus departure points are Pilgrim Street (for buses running south of the Tyne via Gateshead), and Blackett Street/Monument for services to the East and West of the city. Many bus services also pass Newcastle Central Station, a major interchange for rail and metro services.

===Cycling===
Newcastle is accessible by several mostly traffic-free cycle routes that lead to the edges of the city centre, where cyclists can continue into the city by road, using no car lanes. The traffic-free C2C cycle route runs along the north bank of the River Tyne, enabling cyclists to travel off-road to North Shields and Tynemouth in the east, and westwards towards Hexham.

Suburban cycle routes exist, which use converted trackbeds of former industrial wagonways and industrial railways. A network on Tyneside&#x27;s suburban Victorian waggonways is being developed. A network of signed on-road cycle routes is being established, including some designated on-road cycle lanes that will lead from the city centre to the suburbs of Gosforth, Heaton and Wallsend.

Newcastle has a growing culture of bicycle usage. Newcastle is also home to a cycling campaign, called the &#x27;Newcastle Cycling Campaign.&#x27; The ideal of the organisation is to model other European cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. The aims of the organisation, within the constitution are: To raise the profile of cycling, especially utility cycling around the city; to educate decision makers over the benefits of cycling; to promote equality.

Following guidelines set in the National Cycling strategy, Newcastle first developed its cycling strategy in 1998. , the city council&#x27;s social aims and objectives for cycling include: highlighting the usage of cycling to cut city congestion and educating that cycling promotes healthy living The authority also has infrastructure aims and objectives which include: developing on road cycle networks on quieter streets; making safer routes on busier streets; innovating and implementing contraflows on one way streets; developing the existing off-road cycle route networks and improve signage; joining up routes that are partially or completely isolated; Increase the number of cycle parking facilities; working with employers to integrate cycling into workplace travel plans; link the local networks to national networks.

===Water===
DFDS Seaways runs a ferry service to IJmuiden, near Amsterdam in The Netherlands, from Newcastle International Ferry Terminal (located in North Shields). The DFDS ferry service to Gothenburg, Sweden, ceased at the end of October 2006 and their service to Bergen and Stavanger, Norway was terminated in late 2008. The company cited high fuel prices and new competition from low-cost air services as the cause. However, since summer 2007, Thomson cruise lines have included Newcastle as a departure port on its Norwegian and Fjords cruise.

==Government and politics==

Newcastle is a metropolitan borough with city status, governed by Newcastle City Council. Since 2024 the council has been a member of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority. There are six civil parishes within the city boundaries, at Blakelaw and North Fenham, Brunswick, Dinnington, Hazlerigg, North Gosforth, and Woolsington, which form an additional tier of local government for their areas. The rest of the city is an unparished area.

===Administrative history===
Newcastle was an ancient borough. It is said to have been made a borough by William II (reigned 1087–1100), although the earliest known charter was granted by Henry II (reigned 1154–1189). In 1400, a new charter from Henry IV gave the borough the right to hold its own courts and appoint its own sheriffs, making it a county corporate, independent from the Sheriff of Northumberland. Whilst administratively independent, Newcastle was still deemed part of the geographical county of Northumberland for the purposes of lieutenancy until 1974.

The Northumberland assizes were held at the Castle in Newcastle, and subsequently at the Moot Hall, built within the castle site in 1811. The Moot Hall also served as the meeting place of Northumberland County Council from its creation in 1889 until 1981 when the county council moved to Morpeth. Newcastle was therefore sometimes described as the county town of Northumberland, although that title was also claimed by Alnwick, where knights of the shire were elected until the Reform Act 1832.
Until the 1830s the borough just covered the four parishes of All Saints, St Andrew, St John, and St Nicholas. The parliamentary borough (constituency) was enlarged in 1832 to also take in Byker, Elswick, Heaton, Jesmond and Westgate. The municipal boundaries were enlarged to match the constituency in 1836, when Newcastle was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.

Newcastle was awarded city status in 1882. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Newcastle was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough. The city boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1904 when it absorbed Benwell, Fenham and Walker, and in 1935 when it absorbed Kenton and parts of neighbouring parishes. In 1906 the city was given the right to appoint a Lord Mayor.

In 1974, the county borough was replaced by a larger metropolitan borough within the new county of Tyne and Wear. The borough gained the area of the former urban districts of Gosforth and Newburn, and the parishes of Brunswick, Dinnington, Hazlerigg, North Gosforth and Woolsington. It also gained the Moot Hall, which until 1974 had been an exclave of the administrative county of Northumberland surrounded by the city. Newcastle&#x27;s city status was transferred to the enlarged borough at the same time.

From 1974 until 1986, the city council was a lower-tier district authority, with Tyne and Wear County Council providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986, since when the city council has again provided both district-level and county-level services, as it had done when it was a county borough prior to 1974. Some functions are provided across Tyne and Wear by joint committees with the other districts. The county of Tyne and Wear continues to exist as a ceremonial county for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has had no administrative functions since 1986.

===UK Parliament===
Newcastle is represented by three elected Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons, the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. All three current MPs are from the Labour Party.
===EU referendum===
In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Newcastle voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, with a ratio of 51:49 in favour of remain, compared to a national ratio of 48:52 in favour of leave.

==Education==
===Schools and colleges===
Newcastle has 74 primary schools and 20 secondary schools, of which 13 are LEA-funded and 7 are fee-paying independent schools.

There are a number of critically acclaimed state secondary schools, including Walker Riverside Academy, Gosforth Academy, Jesmond Park Academy, St Cuthbert&#x27;s High School, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic School, Kenton School, Sacred Heart, Excelsior Academy, Walbottle Academy and Benfield School.

The largest co-educational independent school is the Royal Grammar School. The largest girls&#x27; independent school is Newcastle High School for Girls. Both schools are located on the same street in Jesmond. Newcastle School for Boys is the only independent boys&#x27; only school in the city and is situated in Gosforth. Other independent schools include Dame Allan&#x27;s School.

Newcastle College is the largest general further education (FE) college in North East England and is a Beacon Status college. There are also two smaller FE colleges in Newcastle.

===Universities===
The city has two major universities – Newcastle University and Northumbria University.

Newcastle University has its origins in the Durham University School of Medicine and Surgery, established in 1834.
It became fully independent on 1 August 1963, forming the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (now simply Newcastle University). It is a red brick university and is a member of the Russell Group, an association of research-intensive UK universities, often considered to represent the best UK universities. It won the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; University of the Year award in 2000. It was awarded the Gold Award in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), one of only ten Russell Group universities to achieve the Gold TEF rating.

Northumbria University has its origins in Newcastle Polytechnic, established in 1969 and becoming the University of Northumbria at Newcastle in 1992 as part of the UK-wide process in which polytechnics became new universities. Northumbria University was voted &#x27;Best New University&#x27; by &quot;The Times&quot; Good University Guide 2005. It holds the Silver TEF Award.

===Museums and galleries===
There are several museums and galleries in Newcastle, including the Centre for Life with its Science Village; the Discovery Museum a museum highlighting life on Tyneside, including Tyneside&#x27;s shipbuilding heritage, and inventions which changed the world; the Great North Museum; in 2009 the Newcastle on Tyne Museum of Antiquities merged with the Great North Museum (Hancock Museum); Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children&#x27;s Books; the Side Gallery with historical and contemporary photography from around the world and Northern England; and the Newburn Motor Museum.

The Laing Art Gallery, similarly to other art galleries and museums around the world, has collections digitised on the Google Cultural Institute, an initiative that makes important cultural material accessible online.

==Religious sites==
Newcastle has three cathedrals, the Anglican St Nicholas&#x27;, with its elegant lantern tower of 1474, the Roman Catholic St Mary&#x27;s designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and the Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Fenham. All three cathedrals began their lives as parish churches. St Mary&#x27;s became a cathedral in 1850 and St Nicholas&#x27; in 1882. Another prominent church in the city centre is the Church of St Thomas the Martyr which is unique as the only Church of England church without a parish and which is not a peculiar.

One of the largest evangelical Anglican churches in the UK is Jesmond Parish Church, situated a little to the north of the city centre.

Newcastle is home to the only Baháʼí Centre in North East England; the centre has served the local Baháʼí community for over 25 years and is located close to the Civic Centre in Jesmond.

Newcastle was a prominent centre of the Plymouth Brethren movement up to the 1950s, and some small congregations still function. Among these are at the Hall, Denmark Street and Gospel Hall, St Lawrence.

The Parish Church of St Andrew is traditionally recognised as &#x27;the oldest church in this town&#x27;. The present building was begun in the 12th Century and the last addition to it, apart from the vestries, was the main porch in 1726. It is quite possible that there was an earlier church here dating from Saxon times. This older church would have been one of several churches along the River Tyne dedicated to St Andrew, including the Priory church at Hexham. The building contains more old stonework than any other church in Newcastle. It is surrounded by the last of the ancient churchyards to retain its original character. Many key names associated with Newcastle&#x27;s history worshipped and were buried here. The church tower received a battering during the Siege of Newcastle by the Scots who finally breached the Town Wall and forced surrender. Three of the cannonballs remain on site as testament to the siege.

<text>Dame Marie Roslyn Bashir (born 1 December 1930) is the former and second longest-serving Governor of New South Wales. Born in Narrandera, New South Wales, Bashir graduated from the University of Sydney in 1956 and held various medical positions, with a particular emphasis in psychiatry. In 1993 Bashir was appointed the Clinical Director of Mental Health Services for the Central Sydney Area Health Service, a position she held until appointed governor on 1 March 2001. She has also served as the Chancellor of the University of Sydney (2007–2012). Bashir retired on 1 October 2014 and was succeeded as governor by General David Hurley.

==Early life and education==
Marie Roslyn Bashir was born in 1930 in Narrandera, New South Wales, to Lebanese parents Michael Bashir and Victoria Melick. Her father and her paternal uncle were both medical graduates from the American University of Beirut. Her maternal family had come to Australia in the 19th century.

Bashir attended Narrandera Public School and in 1943 enrolled at Sydney Girls High School, which her mother had also attended. Bashir then moved to Sydney to live with her grandmother in order to attend. Upon graduating in 1947, Bashir studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, becoming a proficient violinist.

She completed the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1956 at the University of Sydney Medical School, residing at The Women&#x27;s College from 1950 to 1955. In 1959, she was elected to the College Council, became Honorary Secretary in 1960 and was Chair from 1982 to 1990. She took up life membership of the College Union in 1969. While at university, she met rising rugby player, Nicholas Shehadie, to whom she was married on 23 February 1957, in St Philip&#x27;s Church, Sydney, by Felix Arnott, then the Warden of St Paul&#x27;s College, University of Sydney. They had their first child, Michael, in 1959, followed by two daughters, Susan and Alexandra.

==Medical career==

Upon her graduation in medicine, Bashir took up a posting as a junior resident medical officer at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and then to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children. After first living in Elizabeth Bay, Bashir and Shehadie moved their family to Pendle Hill in Western Sydney, where Bashir worked as a General Practitioner. However, wanting to assist people suffering from mental illnesses, Bashir eventually decided to take up postgraduate studies in Psychiatry. To make this easier, in 1968 Bashir and her family moved back into central Sydney to Mosman on the North Shore, purchasing a Middle Harbour-waterfront house at 7 Shellbank Avenue for $57,000 from yachtsman Gordon Reynolds. This would be their primary residence until its sale in May 2020.

When Shehadie was made Lord Mayor of Sydney, Bashir became the Lady Mayoress of Sydney from 1973 to 1975. In 1974 Bashir was named as &quot;Mother of the Year&quot; by the NSW Child Care Committee and the National Council of Women (NSW), with Bashir noting &quot;the fact that I, as a professional woman, was chosen as Mother of the Year points to the growing social acceptance of a working mother&quot;. When Shehadie was knighted in 1976, Bashir acquired the title Lady Shehadie, a title she did not use, remaining &quot;Marie Bashir&quot; in professional life. After completion of postgraduate studies in psychiatry, she was made a Member of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1971, becoming a Fellow in 1980. From 1972, Bashir was a teacher, lecturer and mentor to medical students at The University of Sydney.

In 1972 Bashir was appointed Director of the Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Service, which provides consultative services for young people with emotional and psychiatric issues, and oversaw the unit&#x27;s moving to the former Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital in Concord West in 1977 following its acquisition by the NSW Health Commission in 1976. In 1987 she was appointed director of the Community Health Services in the Central Sydney Area Health Service, which put emphasis on early childhood services, migrant and Indigenous health as well as the elderly. On 13 June 1988 she was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) &quot;In recognition of service to medicine, particularly in the field of adolescent mental health&quot;.

From 1990 to 1992, she served on the New South Wales Women&#x27;s Advisory Council. In 1993, she was appointed as Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Sydney, and in 1994 as the Clinical Director of Mental Health Services for the Central Sydney Area. This was a time of major reform in mental health service delivery, which contributed to substantial change in the provision of public sector mental health services. She served until 2001. In her university role, Bashir is instrumental in developing collaborative teaching programs between colleagues in Vietnam and Thailand with Australian psychiatrists, chairing the University of New South Wales Third World Health Group (1995–2000) and supporting various financial and social support programmes for International students.

In 1995, in a partnership with the Aboriginal Medical Service, Redfern, she established the Aboriginal Mental Health Unit, which provides regular clinics and counselling at both the Aboriginal Medical Service in Sydney and mainstream centres. From 1996, Bashir also took up the consultative role of senior psychiatrist to the Aboriginal Medical Service. As well as championing the health of indigenous Australians, Bashir also continued her focus on youth and juvenile issues, particularly through her terms chairing the NSW Juvenile Justice Advisory Council (1991–1999) and as consultative psychiatrist to Juvenile Justice Facilities (1993–2000). On 1 January 2001, Bashir was awarded the Centenary Medal.

==Governor of NSW, other roles and honours==

In early 2001, on the recommendation of Premier Bob Carr, Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, appointed Bashir Governor of New South Wales, making her the state&#x27;s first female governor, and the first governor of any Australian state of Lebanese descent. She was sworn in on 1 March 2001, and on 30 March she was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). Upon her appointment, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; journalist David Marr noted, &quot;what could be more valuable behind the scenes in Macquarie St than this woman&#x27;s unique expertise with troubled adolescents?&quot; Bashir&#x27;s appointment was welcomed by both sides of politics and commended in a &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; editorial as &quot;an inspired choice&quot; as well as noting that Bashir would be &quot;a powerful advocate for the powerless&quot;.

In that role, Bashir departed from past practice. For Indigenous Australians, Bashir launched a health initiative to support Indigenous medicine and nursing students as well as supporting the progress of reconciliation. On the very day of her inauguration, Bashir agreed to become Patron of the Gay and Lesbian Counselling Service, which addresses mental and social issues in the LGBT community. This was the first time a NSW governor had supported a gay organisation. In 2005 Bashir opened the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival in a concert in Hyde Park and credited the event with fostering &quot;that sense of freedom which springs from the considerable diversity within our society – diversity of race, religion, culture and also sexual orientation [...] We must never take these things for granted because most of you would agree that across the world today an extraordinary winding back to many previously discarded attitudes is taking place, not only affecting gay and lesbian groups, but women&#x27;s health and many aspects of social justice&quot;.

In 2002, Bashir became Patron of the Australia-Vietnam Medical Trust and became intimately involved in collaborative health programs in Vietnam, particularly in rural areas. On 17 May 2001, the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, invested Bashir as a Dame of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem (DStJ). Having previously studied violin at the Conservatorium of Music, Sydney, in 2002 Bashir was asked to become the Patron of the Sydney University Graduate Choir. She is also a Patron of Opera Australia, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Philharmonia Choirs, Pinchgut Opera and the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens.

In 2003 Bashir received the Mental Health Princess Award, awarded by Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand, for contribution to collaborative mental health programs between Australia and Thailand, and in 2004 she was recognised as an Australian Living Treasure. In 2004 she was made an honorary Member of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). In March 2004, during a visit to Lebanon, Bashir was appointed a Grand Officer of the National Order of the Cedar by General Emile Lahoud, President of the Republic of Lebanon. On 14 September, Premier Carr announced that he would recommend to the Queen that Bashir&#x27;s term be extended for another three years. Buckingham Palace confirmed his recommendation on 1 October saying that: &quot;The Queen is content for Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir AC, to remain in her current position until February 2008 as recommended.&quot;

On 31 March 2006, the Queen appointed her a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). Bashir was involved in the high-profile legal case against a psychiatrist called Dr Brendan O&#x27; Sullivan and the NSW health service, in which she was falsely cited in his dismissal; using the opportunity to claim sovereign immunity, usually only used by the Crown.

In April 2007 Bashir was elected by the University Senate to take up a four-year appointment as Chancellor of the University of Sydney on 1 June 2007. It was announced on 15 October 2007 that the Queen, on the recommendation of Premier Morris Iemma, had extended Bashir&#x27;s appointment as governor for a further four years to February 2012. On 4 November 2009, she was invested as a Chevalier of the Ordre National de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the then President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, and presented by the Ambassador of France to Australia, Michel Filhol.

As the longest-serving incumbent state governor, Bashir held a dormant commission to act as the Administrator of the Commonwealth when the Governor-General of Australia was absent from Australia. She held the position of Administrator many times: from 10 to 17 July 2007, 30 September to 12 October 2007, and 20 April to 4 May 2008 in the absence of Michael Jeffery, and from 30 July to 6 August 2008, 5 to 19 November 2008, 17 March to 2 April 2009, and 7 to 12 June 2010, in the absence of Quentin Bryce.

In May–June 2010, the New South Wales Government experienced a series of resignations: Karyn Paluzzano over expenses abuse, David Campbell over a personal scandal, Ian Macdonald over expenses abuse and Graham West&#x27;s retirement. These were widely seen as highlighting the NSW Government&#x27;s inability to govern effectively and in response to this there were various calls for Bashir to take action as governor and dismiss the government. She played down these calls in a radio interview on 10 June, saying that:
In late 2010, Mosman Municipal Council decided to name the new sports centre in Rawson Park for Bashir in recognition of her service to both New South Wales and the Mosman community. She officially opened the &quot;Marie Bashir Mosman Sports Centre&quot; on 10 December 2010 with the Mayor, Anne Connon. On 14 September 2011, Liberal Premier Barry O&#x27;Farrell announced that he had recommended to the Queen that Bashir&#x27;s term be extended for another two years to 2014, which had been accepted: &quot;Over the past 10 years the Governor&#x27;s caring nature, her genuine interest in local communities and her extraordinary work rate have endeared her to people everywhere...Because of her diverse background, career and interests, Professor Bashir has given a historic and important post a contemporary relevance and resonance.&quot;
From the time of her commencement as governor, Bashir, like her immediate predecessor, did not reside in Government House, Sydney, retaining it for reception and official purposes. However, in October 2011, the new Premier Barry O&#x27;Farrell announced that Bashir had agreed with O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s offer to move back into Government House: &quot;A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House. That&#x27;s what it was built for ... [A]t some stage a rural or regional governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas&quot;. However, because Government House has not been a residence for fifteen years, O&#x27;Farrell also announced that the Bashir would initially move into a smaller adjacent building, called the chalet, while refurbishments of the main wing occur, with a proposed move into the main house &quot;before Christmas&quot;.

On 19 April 2012, Bashir was presented with the insignia of a Grand Cordon of the National Order of the Cedar by the President of Lebanon, General Michel Suleiman, at Government House, Sydney, during his state visit to Australia. At a meeting of the University of Sydney Senate in May 2012, Bashir announced her intention to retire as Chancellor. At a ceremony marking her retirement as Chancellor, her portrait depicting Bashir as Chancellor by Shen Jiawei was unveiled, to hang in the Great Hall. Also in April, it was announced that Bashir&#x27;s term as governor, which had been expected to expire in February 2014, had been extended another six months to September 2014, at which Bashir expressed her intention to retire.

On 26 May 2013, Bashir was promoted to the rank of Officer within the Ordre National de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the then President of France, François Hollande, and invested with the insignia at a ceremony at Government House Sydney by Général Regis Outtier, Secretary General of the Society of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

On 21 October 2013 Premier O&#x27;Farrell and the Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli announced that the new state primary school in Strathfield on the old site of the Sydney Adventist College would be named the &quot;Marie Bashir Public School&quot; in her honour. At the announcement O&#x27;Farrell noted that: &quot;Naming this school after Professor Bashir honours her outstanding contribution to NSW and is a reminder that she achieved all her distinctions after being educated at public schools – from Narrandera Public School to Sydney Girls High School&quot;. On 28 November 2013 the Premier of NSW announced that the Queen had given approval for the title of &quot;The Honourable&quot; to be accorded to the governors and former governors of New South Wales.

On 5 December 2013, the University of Sydney decided to rename the Sydney Emerging Infections and Biosecurity Institute in her honour to become the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity (MBI). Also in December 2013, Bashir became patron of the NAISDA Foundation.

In the 2014 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Bashir was made a Dame of the Order of Australia &quot;For extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit in service to the administration, public life, and people of New South Wales, to medicine, particularly as an advocate for improved mental health outcomes for the young, marginalised and disadvantaged, to international relations, through the promotion of collaborative health programs, and as a leader in tertiary education&quot;.

In September 2014, her official portrait as governor by Archibald Prize finalist Mathew Lynn was unveiled at Government House by Premier Mike Baird.

==Retirement==
Ahead of her impending retirement from office on 1 October, Bashir noted that the time was right for her to go just short of the record in office set by Sir Roden Cutler: &quot;a war hero who lost a leg serving this country, I would like to think of him as the longest serving governor&quot; and that &quot;The time is right, It was myself who said I would conclude my term around the anniversary of World War One. That would mean that I would not exceed the longest term of Sir Roden Cutler for whom I had the greatest admiration and respect&quot;.

===Continuing roles===
She made clear at the time of her retirement her interest in continuing her community work, particularly through the area of post-traumatic stress disorder in Australian Defence Force veterans. Bashir is one of three patrons of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. Her role as patron of the NAISDA Foundation continues .

==Titles, styles and honours==

===Titles===

Bashir&#x27;s style and title as governor in full was: &quot;Her Excellency Professor The Honourable Dame Marie Bashir, Dame of the Order of Australia, Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Governor of the State of New South Wales in the Commonwealth of Australia.&quot;

<doc id="70352" wikidata="Q845547" url="?curid=70352" title="List of governors of New York">
<text>The governor of New York is the head of government of the U.S. state of New York, the head of the executive branch of New York&#x27;s state government, and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The officeholder has a duty to enforce state laws, to convene the New York State Legislature, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the legislature, as well as to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.

Fifty-seven people have served as state governor, four of whom served non-consecutive terms (George Clinton, DeWitt Clinton, Horatio Seymour, and Al Smith); the official numbering lists each governor only once. There has only been one female governor so far: Kathy Hochul. This numbering includes one acting governor: the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after the resignation of the governor, under the 1777 Constitution. The list does not include the prior colonial governors nor those who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state, such as Lieutenant Governor Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s vice presidential campaign in 1900, or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein, who acted as governor for 10 days in 1968 while the governor, the lieutenant governor and the senate majority leader were out of the state, attending the Republican National Convention in Miami.

Four men have become president of the United States after serving as governor of New York: Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and six were vice president. Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt held both offices. Numerous Governors have also sought the Presidency, and won their party&#x27;s respective nomination, but lost the general election, such as Al Smith, Samuel J. Tilden, Horatio Seymour, Thomas E. Dewey, and Charles Evans Hughes. Two governors have been chief justice: John Jay held that position when he was elected governor in 1795, and Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice in 1930, two decades after leaving the governorship.

The longest-serving governor was the first, George Clinton, who first took office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms in two different periods, totaling just under 21 years in office. As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor. Charles Poletti had the shortest term, serving 29 days following the resignation of the previous governor, Herbert H. Lehman in 1942. Lehman was the state&#x27;s first Jewish governor; David Paterson was the first African American governor of New York, and the first legally blind governor as well. Paterson is only the fourth African American to hold the office of governor in the United States. The current governor is Democrat Kathy Hochul, the state&#x27;s first female governor, who assumed the office on August 24, 2021, upon the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul went on to be elected as governor for a full term, after beating Republican Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election.

==Governors==

New York was one of the original Thirteen Colonies on the east coast of North America, and was admitted as a state on July 26, 1788. Prior to declaring its independence, New York was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, which it in turn obtained from the Dutch as the colony of New Netherland; see the list of colonial governors and the list of directors-general of New Netherland for the pre-statehood period.

The office of the governor was established by the first New York Constitution in 1777. The governor originally served for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set the start of the term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving the beginning and the end of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent New York Constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.

The Constitution has provided since 1777 for the election of a lieutenant governor of New York, who is &quot;ex officio&quot; President of the Senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor until the end of the yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 Constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the State Senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency &quot;pro tempore&quot; be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the Speaker of the State Assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since the 1954 election with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.

<doc id="70358" wikidata="Q7346846" url="?curid=70358" title="Robert Lenkiewicz">
<text>Robert Oscar Lenkiewicz (31 December 1941 – 5 August 2002) was one of South West England&#x27;s most celebrated artists of modern times. Perennially unfashionable in high art circles, his work was nevertheless popular with the public. Lenkiewicz is regarded by some as a great painter who is &#x27;finally being recognised as such after all these years of neglect by the art establishment, particularly by London, who would never have him. He didn&#x27;t play the game as far as London commercial galleries were concerned. He did his own thing out in the provinces, which was looked down upon.&#x27;

He produced as many as 10,000 works (though this figure includes his prolific output as a pencil portrait artist), often on a large scale, and in themed &#x27;projects&#x27; investigating hidden communities (Vagrancy 1973, Mental Handicap 1976) or difficult social issues (Suicide 1980, Death 1982).

In 1981, he faked his death, announcing his demise to the local newspapers. When Lenkiewicz died in 2002, he left behind a particularly macabre legacy as the embalmed body of one of his friends, a tramp named Diogenes, was found in the cupboard section at the bottom of a bookcase. Lenkiewicz had promised his friend that he would preserve his body when he died rather than allow him to be buried. Another corpse, that of a 16th century midwife who was hanged for witchcraft, was found in the same room, which Lenkiewicz termed his &quot;death room&quot;.

The Lenkiewicz Foundation (educational charity) was established in 1997, received the bequest of the painter&#x27;s remaining collection of works. The artist&#x27;s voluminous diaries, illustrated notebooks and relationship journals are in the Foundation&#x27;s collection, which was shown at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in 2009. The Foundation has curated a number of posthumous exhibitions: &quot;Self-Portraits 1956-2002&quot; at the Ben Uri Gallery, Jewish Museum of Art in London in 2008; &quot;Lenkiewicz: The Legacy – Works from The Lenkiewicz Foundation Collection&quot; at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in 2009; &quot;Still Lives&quot; at the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol in 2011; &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; at Torre Abbey, in Torquay later that year; and &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; at the Royal William Yard in the artist&#x27;s adopted city of Plymouth in 2012. This exhibition, in expanded form, travelled to Germany (Spinnerei in Leipzig and AufAEG in Nuremberg) in 2013, where it became the first overseas exhibition of the artist&#x27;s work to date.

==Early life==
Robert Lenkiewicz was born in London in 1941, the son of refugees who ran a Jewish hotel in Fordwych Road. Robert Lenkiewicz spent his boyhood in the Hotel Shemtov in Cricklewood, which was run by his parents. His mother was a German baroness and his father a Polish horse breeder who both fled Nazi Germany in 1939 and arrived in London as penniless refugees. Lenkiewicz frequently stated in interview that the hotel&#x27;s elderly residents included Holocaust survivors but this is contradicted by the artist&#x27;s brother John, who recollects that the residents tended to be the parents or grandparents of 2nd or 3rd generation English Jews (for instance, the mother of popular entertainer Dickie Valentine), though the hotel&#x27;s Czechoslovakian cook, Mrs Bobek, was a survivor of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Nevertheless, the loneliness and suffering the young painter witnessed at the hotel was &quot;salutary and thought-provoking&quot; according to Lenkiewicz. Lenkiewicz was inspired to paint after seeing Charles Laughton in Alexander Korda&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Rembrandt&quot;. He attended Sir Christopher Wren junior technical school of art architecture and building from 1955 to 1958 graduating in art with distinction. At 16, Lenkiewicz was accepted at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art and later attended the Royal Academy. However, he was virtually impervious to contemporary art fashions, being more interested in his favourite paintings in the National Gallery.

Inspired by the example of Albert Schweitzer, Lenkiewicz threw open the doors of his studios to anyone in need of a roof – down and outs, addicts, criminals and the mentally ill congregated there. These individuals were the subjects of his paintings as a young man. However, such colourful characters were not welcomed by his neighbours and he was obliged to leave London in 1964.

==Move to Plymouth==
He spent a year living in a remote cottage near Lanreath in Cornwall, supporting his young family by teaching, before being offered studio space on the Barbican in Plymouth by local artist and businessman John Nash. The artist&#x27;s home and studios once more became a magnet for vagrants and street alcoholics, who then sat for paintings. Their numbers swelled and Lenkiewicz was forced to commandeer derelict warehouses in the city to house the &#x27;dossers&#x27;. One of these warehouses also served as a studio and in 1973 became the exhibition space for the Vagrancy Project.

He first came to public attention when the media highlighted his giant mural on Plymouth&#x27;s Barbican in the 1970s. Another furore occurred in 1981 when he faked his own death in preparation for the forthcoming project on the theme of Death (1982): &quot;I could not know what it was like to be dead,&quot; said the artist, &quot;but I could discover what it was like to be &quot;thought&quot; dead.&quot;

==Later life and death==
After his first exhibition with an established art dealer in the 1990s, Lenkiewicz&#x27;s work enjoyed growing commercial success and some recognition by the establishment. He received a major retrospective in 1997 at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery, attended by 42,000 visitors. In his obituary of Lenkiewicz, art critic David Lee observed: &quot;Robert&#x27;s greatest gift was to show us that an artist could be genuinely concerned about social and domestic issues and attempt the difficult task of expressing this conscience through the deeply unfashionable medium of figurative painting. In that sense, he was one of few serious painters of contemporary history.&quot; Lenkiewicz, aged 60, died of a heart attack in 2002. Despite his prolific output, he had only £12 cash in his possession (allegedly having never opened a bank account), and owed £2 million to various creditors. Since his death, examples of his best paintings have fetched six figure sums in London auction rooms.

The rise in Lenkiewicz&#x27;s popularity was shown in the estate auctions of his personal collection of his own works. At Sotheby&#x27;s in 2003, Bearnes 2004 and 2008, his paintings and private library raised £2.1 million.

A number of myths have arisen surrounding the artist&#x27;s unusual barter economics, such as that Lenkiewicz &quot;never&quot; paid tax or kept any records of sales of his works; indeed, it is sometimes claimed that he never sold his work at all despite all his exhibition lists now in the public domain bearing prices. It is the case, however, that Lenkiewicz operated a system of patronage whereby a long-term collector or interested buyer would be handed a bill or two to be settled on behalf of the painter. This system operated until the mid-1990s, when the artist began to regularize his financial affairs in negotiation with the HMRC. Subsequent to the painter&#x27;s death in 2002, media reports put the value of the artist&#x27;s estate as £6.5 million. This figure included a cursory valuation of the artist&#x27;s antiquarian library of rare books on witchcraft, the occult, metaphysics and medieval philosophy. However, the sale of this entire collection by Sotheby&#x27;s in 2003 raised less than £1 million.

==Personal life==
Lenkiewicz was the father of 12 children, some of whom have become artists in their own right. One of Robert&#x27;s sons, Reuben Lenkiewicz, runs a gallery in Ashburton dedicated to his father&#x27;s work. The artist provided free lessons in techniques for figurative painting to anyone with aptitude and dedication. Lenkiewicz&#x27;s pupils include Piran Bishop, Yana Travail, Dan Wheatley, Louise Courtnell, Lisa Stokes, Nahem Shoa, James Guy Eccleston and Joe Stoneman.

His step-daughter, with Celia Mills, is playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz.

==Vagrancy Project==
The Vagrancy Project consisted of several dozen paintings and drawings of vagrants and a large book of notes written by the dossers themselves and those involved in their &#x27;care&#x27; and control. Lenkiewicz hoped that the exhibition, and the down and outs&#x27; own stories, would illuminate the plight of these &#x27;invisible people&#x27; and galvanise the community into humane action on their behalf. The format of the &#x27;Project&#x27; – combining thematically linked paintings with the publication of research notes and the collected observations of the sitters – was to be used consistently throughout Lenkiewicz&#x27;s career. Projects such as Mental Handicap (1976), Old Age (1979) and Death (1982) followed the one on vagrancy as Lenkiewicz continued to examine the lives of ostracised, hidden sections of the community and bring them to the attention of the general public.

The Paul Downes song &quot;Robert and the Cowboys&quot; was inspired by the project and describes a number of the vagrants.

==Other projects==
In a parallel line of inquiry, Lenkiewicz also investigated some of society&#x27;s most persistent taboos in projects such as &quot;Jealousy&quot; (1977), &quot;Orgasm&quot; (1978), &quot;Suicide&quot; (1980) and &quot;Sexual Behaviour&quot; (1983). Here, Lenkiewicz often adopted an allegorical pictorial style to portray human physiology &quot;in extremis&quot;. Lenkiewicz came to the conclusion that the kinds of sensations people felt when a lover abandoned them or when their cherished beliefs were threatened were identical in kind to the &#x27;withdrawal symptoms&#x27; and anxieties experienced by addicts or alcoholics over their preferred narcotic. These projects thus became an extended study in &#x27;addictive behaviour&#x27; (the title of his 20th, unfinished, project).

The conclusions drawn from his own observations were supported by his private library, which he viewed as a history of &#x27;fanatical belief systems&#x27;. Lenkiewicz contended that in the absence of any good reasons for our beliefs or emotions we must always look to human physiology for an explanation of fanatical or obsessive behaviour and that it is there that we shall discover the roots of fascism – the tendency to treat another person as property.

On and off, for nearly 30 years, he worked on his masterpiece, the Riddle Mural in the Round Room at Port Eliot house, home of the Earl of St. Germans, but died before its completion. Half of the mural, in the room, shows death, destruction, insanity, unrequited love, and the apocalyptic end of the world. The other half reflects love and affection, friendships, harmony, proportion and consensus. Hidden in the work are various references to family skeletons, art history and cabalistic mysteries, hence the name – the Riddle Mural.

==Library==
Over forty years Lenkiewicz built up a library of some 25,000 volumes devoted to art, the occult sciences, demonolatry, magic, philosophy, especially metaphysics, alchemy, death, psychology and sexuality, preoccupations which surface in some of his paintings. His collection of books on magic and witchcraft was one of the finest in private hands and was largely sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2003, and a substantial part of the remainder of his library was sold at auction in May 2007 by Lyon &amp; Turnbull.

<doc id="70364" wikidata="Q2514663" url="?curid=70364" title="Worship">
<text>Worship is an act of religious usually directed towards a deity or God. For many, worship is not about an emotion, it is more about a recognition of a God. An act of worship may be performed individually, in an informal or formal group, or by a designated leader. Such acts may involve honoring.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Old English , meaning &quot;to venerate &quot;worship, honour shown to an object or deity&quot;, which has been etymologised as &quot;&quot;worthiness&quot; or &quot;worth-ship&quot;&quot;—to give, at its simplest, worth to something.

==Worship in various religions==

===Buddhism===

Worship in Buddhism may take innumerable forms given the doctrine of skillful means. Worship is evident in Buddhism in such forms as: guru yoga, mandala, thanka, yantra yoga, the discipline of the fighting monks of Shaolin, panchamrita, mantra recitation, tea ceremony, ganacakra, amongst others. Buddhist Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. According to a spokesman of the Sasana Council of Burma, devotion to Buddhist spiritual practices inspires devotion to the Triple Gem. Most Buddhists use ritual in pursuit of their spiritual aspirations. In Buddhism, puja (Sanskrit &amp; Pali: pūjā) are expressions of &quot;honour, worship and devotional attention.&quot; Acts of puja include bowing, making offerings and chanting. These devotional acts are generally performed daily at home (either in the morning or evening or both) as well as during communal festivals and Uposatha days at a temple.

Meditation (samādhi) is a central form of worship in Buddhism. This practice is focused on the third step of the Eightfold Path that ultimately leads to self awakening, also known as enlightenment. Meditation promotes self-awareness and exploration of the mind and spirit. Traditionally, Buddhist meditation had combined samatha (the act of stopping and calming oneself) and vipasyana (seeing clearly within) to create a complete mind and body experience. By stopping one&#x27;s everyday activities and focusing on something simple, the mind can open and expand enough to reach a spiritual level. By practicing the step of vipasyana, one does not achieve the final stage of awareness, but rather approaches one step closer. Mindful meditation teaches one to stop reacting quickly to thoughts and external objects that present themselves, but rather to peacefully hold the thought without immediately responding to it. Although in traditional Buddhist faith, enlightenment is the desired end goal of meditation, it is more of a cycle in a literal sense that helps individuals better understand their minds. For example, meditation leads to understanding, leading to kindness, leading to peace, etc.

===Christianity===

In Christianity, a church service is a formalized period of communal worship, often but not exclusively occurring on Sunday (or on Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism). The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the &quot;Word of God&quot; (the Holy Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the &quot;church&quot; in &quot;church service&quot; refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which the event takes place. In Christianity, worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God. The New Testament uses various words to express the concept of worship. The word &quot;proskuneo&quot; - &quot;to worship&quot; - means to bow down (to Gods or to kings).

Mass is the central act of divine worship in the Catholic Church. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a &quot;Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy&quot;. Roman Catholic devotions are &quot;external practices of piety&quot; which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics. They do not become part of liturgical worship, even if conducted in a Catholic church, in a group, in presence of a priest.

Anglican devotions is private prayers and practices used by Anglican Christians to promote spiritual growth and communion with God. Among members of the Anglican Communion, private devotional habits vary widely, depending on personal preference and on affiliation with low-church or high-church parishes.

====Adoration versus veneration====

The New Testament uses various words translatable as &quot;worship&quot;. The word &quot;proskuneo&quot; - &quot;to worship&quot; - means to bow down to Gods or kings.
Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Eastern Orthodoxy make a technical distinction between two different concepts:

* &quot;adoration&quot; or &quot;latria&quot; (Latin &quot;adoratio&quot;, Greek &quot;latreia&quot;, &quot;[λατρεία]&quot;), which is due to God alone
* &quot;veneration&quot; or &quot;dulia&quot; (Latin &quot;veneratio&quot;, Greek &quot;douleia&quot; &quot;[δουλεία]&quot;), which may be lawfully offered to the saints

The external acts of veneration resemble those of worship, but differ in their object and intent. Protestant Christians, who reject the veneration of saints, question whether Catholics always maintain such a distinction in actual devotional practice, especially at the level of folk religion.

According to Mark Miravalle the English word &quot;worship&quot; is equivocal, in that it has been used (in Catholic writing, at any rate) to denote both adoration/&quot;latria&quot; and veneration/&quot;dulia&quot;, and in some cases even as a synonym for veneration as distinct from adoration:
As St. Thomas Aquinas explains, adoration, which is known as latria in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves. Although we see in English a broader usage of the word &quot;adoration&quot; which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to God—for example, when a husband says that he &quot;adores his wife&quot;—in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best English denotation for the worship of latria.

Veneration, known as dulia in classical theology, the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based achievement in excellence.

We must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term &quot;worship&quot; in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Historically, schools of theology have used the term &quot;worship&quot; as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between &quot;worship of adoration&quot; and &quot;worship of veneration.&quot; The word &quot;worship&quot; (in a similar way to how the liturgical term &quot;cult&quot; is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term &quot;worship&quot; not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.

Orthodox Judaism and orthodox Sunni Islam hold that for all practical purposes veneration should be considered the same as prayer; Orthodox Judaism (arguably with the exception of some Chasidic practices), orthodox Sunni Islam, and most kinds of Protestantism forbid veneration of saints or of angels, classifying these actions as akin to idolatry.

Similarly, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses assert that many actions classified as patriotic by Protestant groups, such as saluting a flag, count as equivalent to worship and are therefore considered idolatrous as well.

====Quaker Meeting for Worship====

&quot;Quakers&quot; (the Religious Society of Friends) have both unprogrammed and programmed Meetings for Worship. Unprogrammed worship is based on silence and inward listening to the Spirit, from which any participant may share a message. In unprogrammed meetings for worship, someone speaks when that person feels that God/Spirit/the universe has given them a message for others. Programmed worship includes many elements similar to Protestant services. Many programmed meetings also include a time during the service for silent, expectant waiting and messages from the participants. During the silence, people may stand up and Minister, this is where people start talking about what they have been thinking about. It is Quaker practice to only minister once.

===Hinduism===
Worship in Hinduism involves invoking higher forces to assist in spiritual and material progress and is simultaneously both a science and an art. A sense of &quot;bhakti&quot; or devotional love is generally invoked. This term is probably a central one in Hinduism. A direct translation from the Sanskrit to English is problematic. Worship takes a multitude of forms depending on community groups, geography and language. There is a flavour of loving and being in love with whatever object or focus of devotion. Worship is not confined to any place of worship, it also incorporates personal reflection, art forms and group. People usually perform worship to achieve some specific end or to integrate the body, the mind and the spirit in order to help the performer evolve into a higher being.

===Islam===
In Islam, worship refers to ritualistic devotion as well as actions done in accordance to Islamic law which is ordained by and pleasing to God. Worship included in the Five Pillars of Islam, primarily that of &quot;salat&quot;, which is the practice of ritual prayer five times daily.

According to Muhammad Asad, on his notes in The Message of the Qur&#x27;an translation on Q51:56,
Thus, the innermost purpose of the creation of all rational beings is their cognition of the existence of Allah and, hence, their conscious willingness to conform their own existence to whatever they may perceive of His will and plan: and it is this twofold concept of cognition and willingness that gives the deepest meaning to what the Quran describes as &quot;worship&quot;. As the next verse shows, this spiritual call does not arise from any supposed &quot;need&quot; on the part of the Creator, who is self-sufficient and infinite in His power, but is designed as an instrument for the inner development of the worshipper, who, by the act of his conscious self-surrender to the all-pervading Creative Will, may hope to come closer to an understanding of that Will and, thus closer to Allah Himself.
In the Muslim world, the word &quot;worship&quot; (in the literal context of &quot;worshipping&quot;) is forbidden to be used if it refers to an object or action and not exclusively to Allah.

===Judaism===

Worship of God in Judaism is called &quot;Avodat Hashem&quot;. During the period when the Temple stood, the rites conducted there were considered the most important act of Jewish worship. However, the most common form of worship was and remains that of prayer. Other forms of worship include the conduct of prescribed rituals, such as the Passover Seder and waving the Four Species, with proper intent, as well as various types of Jewish meditation.

====Worship through mundane activities====
Jewish sources also express the notion that one can perform any appropriate mundane activity as the worship of God. Examples would include returning a lost article and working to support oneself and one&#x27;s family.

The Code of Jewish Law (Orach Chayim, Chapter 231) cites Proverbs (3:6), &quot;in all your ways, know him&quot; (Hebrew: בכל דרכיך דעהו (&quot;b&#x27;chol d&#x27;rachecha dei&#x27;eihu&quot;)), as a biblical source for this idea.

===Sikhism===
In Sikhism, worship takes place after the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the work of the 10 Sikh Gurus all in one. Sikhs worship God and only one God, known as &quot;One Creator&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Teacher&quot; (Waheguru), or &quot;Destroyer of Darkness&quot;.

===Wicca===
Wiccan worship commonly takes place during a full moon or a new moon. Such rituals are called an Esbat and may involve a magic circle which practitioners believe will contain energy and form a sacred space, or will provide them a form of magical protection.

===Zoroastrianism===
Prayer is one of the duties and worships of Mazdayasna, which is performed in order to always pay attention to the religious commandments and to give thanks to Ahura Mazda (God).
===Vaudou===
Worship of voodoo is a cult of the spirit of the invisible world. This type of worship is inherited from ancestors of Ewe people like Adja-ewe, fon, Kotafon, Guin and Mina. Voodoo or vaudou is a spiritual entity embodied in an objects made of clay,h ood, bronze and gold. Every january 10, Benin celebrate the Voodoo festival.

==Modern worship==
In modern society and sociology, some writers have commented on the ways that people no longer simply worship recognised deities, but also (or instead) worship consumer brands, sports teams, and other people (celebrities). Sociology therefore extends this argument to suggest outside of a religion worship is a process whereby society worships itself, as a form of self-valorization and self-preservation.

<text>Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac ( , ; 6 March 1619 – 28 July 1655) was a French novelist, playwright, epistolarian, and duelist.

A bold and innovative author, his work was part of the libertine literature of the first half of the 17th century. Today, he is best known as the inspiration for Edmond Rostand&#x27;s most noted drama, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1897), which, although it includes elements of his life, also contains invention and myth.

Since the 1970s, there has been a resurgence in the study of Cyrano, demonstrated in the abundance of theses, essays, articles and biographies published in France and elsewhere.

== Life ==

=== Sources ===

Cyrano&#x27;s short life is poorly documented. Certain significant chapters of his life are known only from the Preface to the &quot;Histoire Comique par Monsieur de Cyrano Bergerac, Contenant les Estats &amp; Empires de la Lune&quot; (&quot;Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon&quot;) published in 1657, nearly two years after his death. Without Henri Le Bret, who wrote the biographical information, his country childhood, his military engagement, the injuries it caused, his prowess as a swordsman, the circumstances of his death and his supposed final conversion would remain unknown.

Since 1862, when Auguste Jal revealed that the &quot;Lord of Bergerac&quot; was Parisian and not Gascon, research in parish registries and notarial records by a small number of researchers, in particular Madeleine Alcover of Rice University, has allowed the public to know more about his genealogy, his family, his home in Paris and those of some of his friends, but has revealed no new documents that support or refute the essentials of Le Bret&#x27;s account or fill the gaps in his narrative.

=== Family ===
Savinien II de Cyrano was the son of Abel I de Cyrano, lord of Mauvières, (156?-1648), counsel (&quot;avocat&quot;) of the Parliament of Paris, and of Espérance Bellanger (1586-164?), &quot;daughter of deceased nobleman Estienne Bellanger, Counsellor of the King and Treasurer of his Finances&quot;.

==== Ancestors ====

His paternal grandfather, Savinien I de Cyrano (15??-1590), was probably born into a notable family from Sens in Burgundy. Documents describe him in turn as a &quot;merchant and burgher of Paris&quot; (&quot;« marchand et bourgeois de Paris »&quot; 20 May 1555), &quot;(sea-)fish merchant to the King&quot; (&quot;« vendeur de poisson de mer pour le Roy »&quot;) in several other documents in following years, and finally &quot;Royal counsellor&quot; (&quot;« conseiller du Roi, maison et couronne de France »&quot; 7 April 1573). In Paris, on 9April 1551, he married Anne Le Maire, daughter of Estienne Le Maire and Perrette Cardon, who died in 1616. They are known to have had four children: Abel (the writer&#x27;s father), Samuel (15??-1646), Pierre (15??-1626) and Anne (15??-1652).

Of his maternal grandfather, Estienne Bellanger, &quot;Financial Controller of the Parisian general revenue&quot; (&quot;« contrôleur des finances en la recette générale de Paris »&quot;), and of his background, we know almost nothing. We know more about his wife, Catherine Millet, whose father, Guillaume II Millet, Lord of Caves, was secretary of the King&#x27;s finances, and whose grandfather, Guillaume I Millet (149?-1563), qualified in medicine in 1518, was doctor to three kings in succession (Francis I, Henry II and Francis II). He married Catherine Valeton, daughter of a property tax collector from Nantes, Audebert Valeton, who, accused of involvement in the Affair of the Placards, was &quot;burned alive on wood taken from his house&quot; on 21 January 1535 at the crossroads of &quot;la Croix du Trahoir&quot; (the intersection of the Rue de l&#x27;Arbre-Sec and the Rue Saint-Honoré), in front of the &quot;Pavillon des singes&quot;, where Molière lived almost a century later.

==== Parents ====

Espérance Bellanger and Abel I de Cyrano were married on 3September 1612 at the church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais. She was at least twenty-six years old; he was about forty-five. Their marriage contract, signed the previous 12July at the office of Master Denis Feydeau, counsellor, secretary and king&#x27;s notary, second cousin of the bride, was only published in the year 2000 by Madeleine Alcover, who minutely traced the fate of the witnesses (and more particularly their links with pious milieus) and noted that many of them &quot;had entered the worlds of high finance, the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;, of the aristocracy (including the Court) and even the &quot;noblesse d&#x27;épée&quot;&quot;.

==== His father&#x27;s library ====

In 1911 Jean Lemoine made known the inventory of Abel de Cyrano&#x27;s worldly goods. His library, relatively poorly stocked (126 volumes), testifies to his schooling as a jurist and to an open curiosity: a taste for languages and ancient literature, the great humanists of the Renaissance (Erasmus, Rabelais, Juan Luis Vives), knowledge of Italian, interest in the sciences. On the religious side, one notices the presence of two Bibles, of an Italian New Testament and the Prayers of St. Basil in Greek, but no pious works. There is no object of that kind (engraving, painting, statue, crucifix) amongst the other inventoried items, but in contrast &quot;twelve small paintings of portraits of gods and goddesses&quot; and &quot;four wax figures: one of Venus and Cupid, another of a woman pulling a thorn, one of a flageolet player and one of an ashamed nude woman&quot;. Finally, one notes the presence of several books by well-known Protestants: the &quot;Discours politiques et militaires&quot; (&quot;Political and Military Discourse&quot;) of François de la Noue, two volumes of George Buchanan, the &quot;Dialectique&quot; of Pierre de La Ramée, the &quot;Alphabet de plusieurs sortes de lettres&quot; (&quot;Alphabet of different kinds of letters&quot;) by master calligrapher Pierre Hamon and &quot;La Vérité de la religion chrétienne&quot; (&quot;The Truth of the Christian Religion&quot;) by Philippe Duplessis-Mornay, whose presence confirms that Abel spent his younger years in Huguenot surroundings.

==== Siblings ====

Espérance and Abel I had at least six children:
* Denis, baptised at the church of Saint-Eustache on 31 March 1614 by Anne Le Maire, his grandmother, and Denis Feydeau, financier. He studied Theology at the Sorbonne and died in the 1640s;
* Antoine, baptized at Saint-Eustache on 11 February 1616 by his paternal aunt, Anne Cyrano, and a godfather who is not named in the baptismal register discovered by Auguste Jal, but who might have been the financier Antoine Feydeau (1573–1628), younger brother of Denis. Died at a young age;
* Honoré, baptized at Saint-Eustache on 3July 1617 by Honoré Barentin, &quot;trésorier des parties casuelles&quot;, and an unnamed godmother. Died at a young age;
* Savinien II (1619–1655),
* Abel II, born around 1624, who took the title &quot;Lord of Mauvières&quot; after the death of his father in 1648;
* Catherine, whose date of birth is not known and who died in the early years of the following century, having become a nun at the convent of the &quot;Filles de la Croix (de Paris)&quot; (&quot;Daughters of the Cross (Paris)&quot;) in the Rue de Charonne in 1641, under the name Sister Catherine de Sainte-Hyacinthe.

=== Childhood and adolescence ===

==== Baptism and godparents ====

The historian Auguste Jal discovered the baptism of the (then) supposed Gascon in the 1860s:

Finally, after long exertion, I knew that Abel Cyrano had left the neighbourhood of Saint-Eustache for that of Saint-Sauveur, and that Espérance Bellanger had given birth in this new dwelling to a boy whose baptismal record is as follows: &quot;The sixth of March one thousand six hundred and nineteen, Savinien, son of Abel de Cyrano, squire, Lord of Mauvières, and of the lady Espérance Bellenger (&quot;sic&quot;), the godfather, nobleman Antoine Fanny, King&#x27;s Counsellor and Auditor in his Court of Finances, of this parish, the godmother the lady Marie Fédeau (&quot;sic&quot;), wife of nobleman Master Louis Perrot, Counsellor and Secretary to the King, Household and Crown of France, of the parish of Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois&quot;. This son of Abel de Cyrano who was not given the name of his godfather, Antoine, because he had a brother of that name, born in 1616, but was named Savinien in memory of his grandfather, who could doubt that this was the Savinien Cyrano who was born, according to the biographers, at the chateau of Bergerac in or around 1620?
Thus Espérance Bellanger was thirty-three years old, Abel de Cyrano around fifty-two.

The surname &quot;Fanny&quot; appears nowhere in the very complete study of &quot;La Chambre des comptes de Paris&quot; (&quot;Court of Finances of Paris&quot;) published by Count H. Coustant d&#x27;Yanville in 1875 (or for that matter in any other French document of the 17th century). In 1898, Viscount Oscar de Poli suggested that it must have been a transcription error and proposed reading it as &quot;Lamy&quot;. An Antoine Lamy had actually been accepted as an auditor of finances on 2September 1602, a year before Pierre de Maupeou, Espérance Bellanger&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law of Denis Feydeau who was a witness to the marriage of Savinien&#x27;s parents in 1612. His wife, Catherine Vigor, associate of Vincent de Paul, would become President of the &quot;Confrérie de la Charité de Gentilly&quot; (&quot;Charitable Fellowship of Gentilly&quot;) where the couple set up a mission in 1634. She could well be the godmother of Catherine de Cyrano.

Marie Feydeau, cosponsor with Antoine Lamy, was the sister of Denis and Antoine Feydeau and the wife of Louis (or Loys) Perrot (15??-1625), who, apart from his titles of &quot;King&#x27;s Counsellor and Secretary&quot;, also had that of &quot;King&#x27;s Interpreter of Foreign Languages&quot;.

==== Mauvières and Bergerac ====

In 1622, Abel de Cyrano left Paris with his family and went to settle on his lands at Mauvières and Bergerac in the &quot;Vallée de Chevreuse&quot;, which had come to him in part after the death of his mother in 1616.

His possessions, situated on the banks of the Yvette River in the parish of Saint-Forget, had been purchased by Savinien I de Cyrano forty years earlier from Thomas de Fortboys, who had bought them himself in 1576 from Lord Dauphin de Bergerac (or Bergerat), whose ancestors had possessed them for more than a century.

When Savinien I de Cyrano acquired it, the domain of Mauvières consisted of &quot;a habitable mansion…with a lower room, a cellar beneath, kitchen, pantry, an upper chamber, granaries, stables, barn, portal, all roofed with tiles, with courtyard, walled dovecote; mill, enclosed plot, garden and fishpond, the right of middle and low justice…&quot;.

The estate of Bergerac, which adjoined Mauvières, &quot;comprised a house with portal, courtyard, barn, hovel and garden, being an acre or thereabouts, plus forty-six and a half acres, of which thirty-six and a half were farmland and ten woodland, with the rights of middle and low justice&quot;.

==== Country schooling ====
It was in this rustic setting that the child grew up and in the neighbouring parish he learnt to read and write. His friend Le Bret recalls:
The education that we had together with a good country priest who took in boarders, made us friends from our most tender youth, and I remember the aversion he had from that time for one who seemed to him a shadow of Sidias, because, in the thoughts which that man could somewhat grasp, he believed him incapable of teaching him anything; so that he paid so little attention to his lessons and his corrections that his father, who was a fine old gentleman, fairly unconcerned for his children&#x27;s education and overly credulous of this one&#x27;s complaints, removed him [from the school] a little too suddenly and, without considering if his son would be better off elsewhere, he sent him to that city [Paris] where he left him, until the age of nineteen years, to his own devices.
==== Parisian adolescence ====

It is unknown at what age Savinien arrived in Paris. He may have been accommodated by his uncle Samuel de Cyrano in a large family residence in the Rue des Prouvaires, where his parents had lived up until 1618. In this theory, it was there that he was introduced to his cousin Pierre, with whom, according to Le Bret, he would build a lasting friendship.
He continued his secondary studies at an academy which remains unknown. It has long been maintained that he attended the Collège de Beauvais where the action of the comedy &quot;Le pédant joué&quot; takes place and whose principal, Jean Grangier would inspire the character of Granger, the pedant of &quot;Le pédant joué&quot;, but his presence in June 1641 as a student of rhetoric at the &quot;Collège de Lisieux&quot; (see below), has encouraged more recent historians to revise that opinion.

In 1636, his father sold Mauvières and Bergerac to Antoine Balestrier, Lord of Arbalestre, and returned to Paris to live with his family in &quot;a modest dwelling at the top of the great Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques close to the Crossing&quot; (parish of Saint-Jacques and Saint-Philippe), a short distance from the &quot;Collège de Lisieux&quot;. But there is no certainty that Savinien went to live with them.

==== A slippery slope ====

Le Bret continues his story:
That age when nature is most easily corrupted, and that great liberty he had to only do that which seemed good to him, brought him to a dangerous weakness (&quot;penchant&quot;), which I dare say I stopped…
Historians and biographers do not agree on this &quot;penchant&quot; which threatened to corrupt Cyrano&#x27;s nature. As an example of the romantic imagination of some biographers, Frédéric Lachèvre wrote:

Against an embittered and discontented father, Cyrano promptly forgot the way to his father&#x27;s house. Soon he was counted among the gluttons and hearty drinkers of the best inns, with them he gave himself up to jokes of questionable taste, usually following prolonged libations…He also picked up the deplorable habit of gambling. This kind of life could not continue indefinitely, especially since Abel de Cyrano had become completely deaf to his son&#x27;s repeated requests for funds.
Forty years later, two editors added to the realism and local colour:
Since nothing binds Cyrano to the humble lodgings of the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques to which the uncertainties of fate condemned his family, he gives himself over entirely to Paris, to its streets and, according to the words of one of his close friends, &quot;to its excrescences&quot; (&quot;à ses verrues&quot;). He drinks, diligently frequents the Rue Glatigny, called Val d&#x27;amour, because of the women who sell pleasure there, gambles, roams the sleeping city to frighten the bourgeois or forge signs, provokes the watch, gets into debt and links himself with that literary Bohemia which centered around Tristan L&#x27;Hermite and Saint-Amant and cultivated the memory of Théophile and his impious lyricism.


== Life and works ==

He was the son of Abel de Cyrano, lord of Mauvières and Bergerac, and Espérance Bellanger. He received his first education from a country priest and had for a fellow pupil his friend and future biographer Henri Lebret. He then proceeded to Paris and the heart of the Latin Quarter, to the college de Dormans-Beauvais, where he had as master Jean Grangier, whom he afterwards ridiculed in his comedy &quot;Le Pédant joué&quot; (&quot;The Pedant Tricked&quot;) of 1654. At the age of nineteen, he entered a corps of the guards, serving in the campaigns of 1639 and 1640. As a minor nobleman and officer he was notorious for his dueling and boasting. His unique past allowed him to make unique contributions to French art.

One author, Ishbel Addyman, varies from other biographers and claims that he was not a Gascon aristocrat, but a descendant of a Sardinian fishmonger, and that the appellation Bergerac stemmed from a small estate near Paris where he was born, not in Gascony, and that he may have suffered tertiary syphilis. She also claims that he may have been homosexual and around 1640 became the lover of Charles Coypeau d&#x27;Assoucy, a writer and musician, until around 1653, when they became engaged in a bitter rivalry. This led to Bergerac sending d&#x27;Assoucy death threats that compelled him to leave Paris. The quarrel extended to a series of satirical texts by both men. Bergerac wrote &quot;Contre Soucidas&quot; (an anagram of his enemy&#x27;s name) and &quot;Contre un ingrat&quot; (Against an ingrate), while D&#x27;Assoucy counterattacked with &quot;Le Combat de Cyrano de Bergerac avec le singe de Brioché, au bout du Pont-Neuf&quot; (The battle of Cyrano de Bergerac with the monkey of Brioché, at the end of the Pont-Neuf). He also associated with Théophile de Viau, the French poet and libertine.

He is said to have left the military and returned to Paris to pursue literature, producing tragedies cast in the orthodox classical mode.

The model for the character Roxane in Rostand&#x27;s play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; was Bergerac&#x27;s cousin, who lived with his sister, Catherine de Bergerac, at the Convent of the Daughter of the Cross. As in the play, Bergerac did fight at the Siege of Arras in 1640, a battle of the Thirty Years&#x27; War between French and Spanish forces in France (though this was not the Battle of Arras, fought fourteen years later). During the siege he suffered a neck wound from a sword during a sortie by the Spanish defenders, a day before the surrender of the Spanish troops and the end of the siege. One of his confrères in the battle was the Baron Christian of Neuvillette, who married Cyrano&#x27;s cousin. However, the plotline of Rostand&#x27;s play involving Roxane and Christian is entirely fictional.

Cyrano was a pupil of the French polymath Pierre Gassendi, a canon of the Catholic Church who tried to reconcile Epicurean atomism with Christianity.
Cyrano de Bergerac&#x27;s works &quot;L&#x27;Autre Monde: ou les États et Empires de la Lune&quot; (&quot;Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon&quot;, published posthumously, 1657) and &quot;Les États et Empires du Soleil&quot; (&quot;The States and Empires of the Sun&quot;, 1662) are classics of early modern science fiction. In the former, Cyrano travels to the Moon using rockets powered by firecrackers (it may be the earliest description of a space flight by use of a vessel that has rockets attached) and meets the inhabitants. The Moon-men have four legs, firearms that shoot game and cook it, and talking earrings used to educate children.

His mixture of science and romance in the last two works furnished a model for many subsequent writers, among them Jonathan Swift, Edgar Allan Poe and probably Voltaire. Corneille and Molière freely borrowed ideas from &quot;Le Pédant joué&quot;.

Accused of plagirizing &quot;Le Pédant joué&quot;, Molière supposedly replied, &quot;Il m&#x27;est permis de reprendre mon bien où je le trouve&quot; (&quot;I am allowed to take back my property where I find it.&quot;).

=== Death ===
The play suggests that he was injured by a falling wooden beam in 1654 while entering the house of his patron, the Duc D&#x27;Arpajon. However the academic and editor of Cyrano&#x27;s works Madeleine Alcover uncovered a contemporary text which suggests an attack on the Duke&#x27;s carriage in which a member of his household was injured. It is as yet inconclusive whether or not Cyrano&#x27;s death was a result of the injury, or an unspecified disease. He died over a year later on July 28, 1655, aged 36, at the house of his cousin, Pierre De Cyrano, in Sannois. He was buried in a church in Sannois. However, there is strong evidence to support the theory that his death was a result of a botched assassination attempt as well as further damage to his health caused by a period of confinement in a private asylum, orchestrated by his enemies, who succeeded in enlisting the help of his own brother Abel de Cyrano.

== In fiction and media ==
=== Rostand ===

In 1897, the French poet Edmond Rostand published a play, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, telling of the life of a fictionalized Cyrano with an abnormally large nose. This play, which became Rostand&#x27;s most successful work, revolves around Cyrano&#x27;s love for the beautiful Roxane, whom he is obliged to woo on behalf of a more conventionally handsome but less articulate friend, Christian de Neuvillette.

The play has been made into operas and adapted for cinema several times and reworked in other literary forms and as a ballet.

=== Other authors ===

&quot;The Adventures of Cyrano De Bergerac&quot;, by Louis Gallet, was published in English by Jarrolds Publishers (London) in 1900. It bears no resemblance to Rostand&#x27;s play apart from the characteristics of the de Bergerac character.

Cyrano de Bergerac served as an inspiration for the creation of Saint-Savin, one of the main characters of Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot;.

In A. L. Kennedy&#x27;s novel &quot;So I Am Glad&quot;, the narrator finds de Bergerac has appeared in her modern-day house share.

In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;Glory Road&quot;, Oscar Gordon fights a character who is not named, but is obviously Cyrano.

John Shirley published a story about Cyrano called &quot;Cyrano and the Two Plumes&quot; in a French anthology; it was reprinted at &quot;The Freezine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;.

The novel by Adam Browne, &quot;Pyrotechnicon: Being a TRUE ACCOUNT of Cyrano de Bergerac&#x27;s FURTHER ADVENTURES among the STATES and EMPIRES of the STARS, by HIMSELF (Dec&#x27;d)&quot;, was a sequel to Cyrano&#x27;s science fiction, published by Coeur de Leon in 2012.

&quot;The Lost Sonnets of Cyrano de Bergerac: A Poetic Fiction&quot; by James L. Carcioppolo. Published in English by Lost Sonnet Publishing (Benicia, California) in 1998. Fiction poetry with the premise that Cyrano wrote a sequence of 57 sonnets during the last year of his life. Heavily annotated.

Cyrano de Bergerac is the leading male character in Charles Lecocq&#x27;s 1896 opéra comique &quot;Ninette&quot;.

=== Film ===
Most recently, his likeness was the center of a musical romantic drama, &quot;Cyrano&quot;, adapted as a screenplay by Erica Schmidt who had previously written the script as a stage musical of the same name. Schmidt&#x27;s husband, Peter Dinklage, starred as a reimagined Cyrano who is short-statured rather than having a large nose due to Dinklage&#x27;s dwarfism. The film was widely received with positive reviews and went on to be nominated for awards at the 79th Golden Globe Awards (including Best Actor for Dinklage), four nominations at the 75th British Academy Film Awards and a Best Costume Design nod at the 94th Academy Awards.

There is also a popular French film, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, starring Gérard Depardieu, which earned him a Best Actor nomination at the Academy Awards. Additionally, Cyrano de Bergerac is the subject of a 1925 film and a 1950 film; the latter of which earned José Ferrer both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Actor. He also won a Tony Award for the same role on Broadway, a few years prior to making the film.

&quot;Roxanne (film)&quot;, a 1987 film by Fred Schepisi and starring Steve Martin (with a prosthetic nose), is a modern retelling of the story. Another rendition is a gender-flipped romantic comedy interpretation, &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (1996), starring Janeane Garofalo as a veterinarian/radio talk show host (and the Cyrano in question), and Uma Thurman as her model friend/facsimile.

<doc id="70370" wikidata="Q189286" url="?curid=70370" title="Linus's law">
<text>In software development, Linus&#x27;s law is the assertion that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot;.
The law was formulated by Eric S. Raymond in his essay and book &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; (1999), and was named in honor of Linus Torvalds.

A more formal statement is: &quot;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&quot; Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software reviewing. Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown the effectiveness of reviewing processes in finding bugs and security issues.

== Validity ==
In &quot;Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering,&quot; Robert Glass refers to the law as a &quot;mantra&quot; of the open source movement, but calls it a fallacy due to the lack of supporting evidence and because research has indicated that the rate at which additional bugs are uncovered does not scale linearly with the number of reviewers; rather, there is a small maximum number of useful reviewers, between two and four, and additional reviewers above this number uncover bugs at a much lower rate. While closed-source practitioners also promote stringent, independent code analysis during a software project&#x27;s development, they focus on in-depth review by a few and not primarily the number of &quot;eyeballs&quot;.

The persistence of the Heartbleed security bug in a critical piece of code for two years has been considered as a refutation of Raymond&#x27;s dictum. Larry Seltzer suspects that the availability of source code may cause some developers and researchers to perform less extensive tests than they would with closed source software, making it easier for bugs to remain.
In 2015, the Linux Foundation&#x27;s executive director Jim Zemlin argued that the complexity of modern software has increased to such levels that specific resource allocation is desirable to improve its security. Regarding some of 2014&#x27;s largest global open source software vulnerabilities, he says, &quot;In these cases, the eyeballs weren&#x27;t really looking&quot;. Large scale experiments or peer-reviewed surveys to test how well the mantra holds in practice have not been performed.

Empirical support of the validity of Linus&#x27;s law was obtained by comparing popular and unpopular projects of the same organization. Popular projects are projects with the top 5% of GitHub stars (7,481 stars or more). Bug identification was measured using the corrective commit probability, the ratio of commits determined to be related to fixing bugs. The analysis showed that popular projects had a higher ratio of bug fixes (e.g., Google&#x27;s popular projects had a 27% higher bug fix rate than Google&#x27;s less popular projects). Since it is unlikely that Google lowered its code quality standards in more popular projects, this is an indication of increased bug detection efficiency in popular projects.

<doc id="70374" wikidata="Q297871" url="?curid=70374" title="Øresund Bridge">
<text>The Øresund or Öresund Bridge is a combined railway and motorway cable-stayed bridge across the Øresund strait between Denmark and Sweden. It is the second longest bridge in Europe with both roadway and railway combined in a single structure, running nearly from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The crossing is completed by the Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.

The bridge connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with those of Central and Western Europe. A data cable also makes the bridge the backbone of Internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden. The international European route E20 crosses via road, the Øresund Line via railway. The construction of the Great Belt Fixed Link (1988–1998), connecting Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula, and the Øresund Bridge have connected Central and Western Europe to Sweden by road and rail.

The bridge was designed by Jørgen Nissen and Klaus Falbe Hansen from Ove Arup and Partners, and Niels Gimsing and Georg Rotne.

The justification for the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel for part of the way, rather than raising that section of the bridge, was to avoid interfering with air traffic from the nearby Copenhagen Airport, to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad, and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait. Construction began in 1995, with the bridge opening to traffic on 1 July 2000. The bridge received the 2002 IABSE Outstanding Structure Award.

==History==
Ideas for a fixed link across the Øresund were advanced as early as the first decade of the 20th century. In 1910, proposals were put to the Swedish Parliament for a railway tunnel across the strait, which would have comprised two tunnelled sections linked by a surface road across the island of Saltholm. The concept of a bridge over the Øresund was first formally proposed in 1936 by a consortium of engineering firms who proposed a national motorway network for Denmark.

The idea was dropped during World War II, but picked up again thereafter and studied in significant detail in various Danish-Swedish government commissions through the 1950s and 1960s. However, disagreement existed regarding the placement and exact form of the link, with some arguing for a link at the narrowest point of the sound at Helsingør–Helsingborg, further north of Copenhagen, and some arguing for a more direct link from Copenhagen to Malmö. Additionally, some regional and local interests argued that other bridge and road projects, notably the then-unbuilt Great Belt Fixed Link, should take priority. The governments of Denmark and Sweden eventually signed an agreement to build a fixed link in 1973. It would have comprised a bridge between Malmö and Saltholm, with a tunnel linking Saltholm to Copenhagen, and would have been accompanied by a second rail tunnel across the Øresund between Helsingør and Helsingborg.

However, that project was cancelled in 1978 due to the economic situation, and growing environmental concerns. As the economic situation improved in the 1980s, interest resumed and the governments signed a new agreement in 1991.

An OMEGA centre report identified the following as primary motivations for construction of the bridge:

* to improve transport links in northern Europe, from Hamburg to Oslo;
* regional development around the Øresund as an answer to the intensifying globalisation process and Sweden&#x27;s decision to apply for membership of the European Community;
* connecting the two largest cities of the region, which were both experiencing economic difficulties;
* improving communications to Kastrup airport, the main flight transport hub in the region.

A joint venture of Hochtief, Skanska, Højgaard &amp; Schultz and Monberg &amp; Thorsen (the same of the previous Great Belt Fixed Link), began construction of the bridge in 1995 and completed it 14 August 1999. Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden met midway across the bridge-tunnel on 14 August 1999 to celebrate its completion. The official dedication took place on 1 July 2000, with Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden as the hostess and host of the ceremony. Because of the death of nine people, including three Danes and three Swedes, at the Roskilde Festival the evening before, the ceremony opened with a minute of silence. The bridge-tunnel opened for public traffic later that day. On 12 June 2000, two weeks before the dedication, 79,871 runners competed in Broloppet, a half marathon from Amager, Denmark, to Skåne, Sweden.

Despite two schedule setbacks – the discovery of 16 unexploded World War II bombs on the seafloor and an inadvertently skewed tunnel segment – the bridge-tunnel was finished three months ahead of schedule.

Although traffic between Denmark and Sweden increased by 61 percent in the first year after the bridge opened, traffic levels were not as high as expected, perhaps due to high tolls. However, since 2005, traffic levels have increased rapidly. This may be due to Danes buying homes in Sweden to take advantage of lower housing prices in Malmö and commuting to work in Denmark. In 2012, to cross by car cost DKK 310, SEK 375 or €43, with discounts of up to 75% available to regular users. In 2007, almost 25 million people travelled over the Øresund Bridge: 15.2 million by car and bus and 9.6 million by train. By 2009, the figure had risen to 35.6 million by car, coach or train.

==Link features==

===Bridge===

At , the bridge covers half the distance between Sweden and the Danish island of Amager, the border between the two countries being from the Swedish end. The structure has a mass of 82,000 tonnes and supports two railway tracks beneath four road lanes in a horizontal girder extending along the entire length of the bridge. On both approaches to the three cable-stayed bridge sections, the girder is supported every by concrete piers. The two pairs of free-standing cable-supporting towers are high allowing shipping of head room under the main span, but most ships&#x27; captains prefer to pass through the unobstructed Drogden Strait above the Drogden Tunnel. The cable-stayed main span is long. A girder and cable-stayed design was chosen to provide the specific rigidity necessary to carry heavy rail traffic, and also to resist large accumulations of ice.
The bridge experiences occasional brief closures during very severe weather, such as the St. Jude storm of October 2013.

Due to high longitudinal and transverse loads acting over the bridge and to accommodate movements between the superstructure and substructure, it has bearings weighing up to each, capable of bearing vertical loads up to in a longitudinal direction and up to in transverse direction. The design, manufacturing and installation of the bearings were carried out by the Swiss civil engineering firm Mageba.

Vibration issues, caused by several cables in the bridge moving under certain wind and temperature conditions, were combatted with the installation of compression spring dampers installed in pairs at the centre of the cables. Two of these dampers were equipped with laser gauges for ongoing monitoring. Testing, development and installation of these spring dampers was carried out by specialists European Springs.

===Peberholm===

The bridge joins Drogden tunnel on the artificial island of Peberholm (Pepper Islet). The Danes chose the name to complement the natural island of Saltholm (Salt Islet) just to the north. Peberholm is a designated nature reserve built from Swedish rock and the soil dredged up during the bridge and tunnel construction, approximately long with an average width of . It is high.

===Drogden Tunnel===

The connection between Peberholm and the artificial peninsula at Kastrup on Amager island, the nearest populated part of Denmark, is through the Drogden Tunnel (&quot;Drogdentunnelen&quot;). It comprises a immersed tube plus entry tunnels at each end. The tube tunnel is made from 20 prefabricated reinforced concrete segments – the largest in the world at 55,000 tonnes each – interconnected in a trench dug in the seabed. Two tubes in the tunnel carry railway tracks, two carry roads and a small fifth tube is provided for emergencies. The tubes are arranged side by side.
==Rail transport==


The rail link is operated jointly by the Swedish Transport Administration (&quot;Trafikverket&quot;) and the Danish railway infrastructure manager Banedanmark. Passenger train service is commissioned by Skånetrafiken and the Danish Civil Aviation and Railway Authority (&quot;Trafikstyrelsen&quot;) under the Øresundståg brand, with Transdev and DSB being the current operators. A series of new dual-voltage trains was developed, linking the Copenhagen area with Malmö and southern Sweden as far as Gothenburg and Kalmar. SJ operates X2000 trains over the bridge, with connections to Gothenburg and Stockholm. Copenhagen Airport at Kastrup has its own railway station close to the western bridgehead. Since December 2022, trains operate typically every 15 minutes during the day, reducing to once an hour during the night in both directions. Additional Øresundstrains are operated at rush hour. Freight trains also use the crossing.

The rail section is double track and capable of speeds of up to , but slower in Denmark, especially in the tunnel section. There were challenges related to the difference in electrification and signalling between the Danish and Swedish railway networks. The solution chosen is to switch the electrical system from Swedish 15 kV, 16.7 Hz to Danish 25 kV, 50 Hz before the eastern bridgehead at Lernacken in Sweden. The line is signalled according to the standard Swedish system across the length of the bridge. On Peberholm the line switches to Danish signalling, which continues into the tunnel. There is no way of changing between a locomotive for Danish standard and one for Swedish standard. All rail vehicles using the bridge must be custom made for the standards of both countries.

Trains run on the left in Sweden, and on the right in Denmark. Initially the switch was made at Malmö Central Station, a terminus at that time. After the 2010 inauguration of the Malmö City Tunnel connection, a tunnel was built at Burlöv, north of Malmö, where the two southbound tracks cross over the northbound pair. The railway in Malmö thus uses the Danish standard.

==Border checks==
With both Sweden and Denmark being part of the Nordic Passport Union since the 1950s, border controls between the two countries have been abolished for decades and travellers can normally move freely across the Øresund Bridge. In 2001, both countries also joined the Schengen area, and since then the abolition of border controls is primarily regulated by European Union law, more specifically the Schengen acquis.

However, in November 2015, during the European migrant crisis, Sweden introduced temporary border controls at the border to Denmark in accordance with the provisions of the Schengen acquis on the reintroduction of temporary internal border controls. As such, travellers into Sweden from Denmark (but not travellers into Denmark from Sweden) must show a valid passport or national ID card (citizens of EU/EEA countries) or passport and entry visa (if required) for nationals of other non-EU/EEA countries. The move marked a break with 60 years of border control free travel between the Nordic countries. In January 2016, these border measures were extended by a special carriers&#x27; liability, forcing carriers (such as bus, train and ferry companies) to check the identity of all passengers from Denmark before they boarded a bus, train or ferry to Sweden. These checks were enforced by a fine of SEK 50,000 as punishment for serving those without such identity documents. This led to the enforcement of checks by private security guards at, for instance, the rail station in Kastrup airport in Denmark, an unpopular move with passengers, due to the delays imposed.

In May 2017, Sweden removed the carriers&#x27; liability, but the ordinary border controls carried out by the Swedish Police Authority remained on the Swedish side of the Øresund Bridge. In accordance with the Schengen Borders Code, these border controls are only allowed for a period of six months at a time, and therefore have to be renewed twice a year.

==Costs and benefits==
The cost for the Øresund Connection, including motorway and railway connections on land, was DKK 30.1 billion (~€4.0 billion) according to the 2000 year price index, with the cost of the bridge expected in 2003 to be recouped by 2037.

In 2006, Sweden began work on the Malmö City Tunnel, a SEK 9.45 billion connection with the bridge that was completed in December 2010. The connection will be entirely user-financed. The owner company is owned half by the Danish state and half by the Swedish state. This owner company has taken loans guaranteed by the governments to finance the connection and the user fees are its only income. After the increase in traffic, these fees are enough to pay the interest and begin repaying the loans, which is expected to take about 30 years.

Taxpayers have paid for neither the bridge nor the tunnel, but tax money has been used for the land connections. On the Danish side, the land connection has domestic benefits, mainly to connect the airport to the railway network. The Malmö City Tunnel has the benefit of connecting the southern part of the inner city to the rail network and allowing many more trains to and from Malmö.

According to The Öresund Committee, the bridge has made a national economic gain of DKK 57 billion, or SEK 78 billion SEK (~€8.41 billion) on both sides of the strait by increased commuting and lower commuting expense. The gain is estimated to be SEK 6.5 billion per year but this could be increased to 7.7 billion by removing the three biggest obstacles to integration and mobility, the two largest being that non-EU nationals in Sweden are not allowed to work in Denmark and that many professional qualifications and merits are not mutually recognised.

A 2021 study found that the bridge led to an increase in innovation in Malmö. The key mechanism appears to be that high-skilled workers were drawn to Malmö. A 2022 study found that the bridge caused an increase of 13.5% in the average wage of workers in the region, as the bridge expanded the size of the labor market.

==Cultural references==
*The bridge lends its name to the Nordic noir television series &quot;The Bridge&quot;, which is set in the region around the bridge.
*When Malmö hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, the bridge was the inspiration for a similar element in the set design, symbolising the connection between Sweden and the rest of Europe.
*The bridge was the inspiration behind the 2014 song &quot;Walk Me to the Bridge&quot; by Manic Street Preachers from their album &quot;Futurology&quot;.

==Environmental effects==
The underwater parts of the bridge have become covered in marine organisms and act as an artificial reef.

<text>Thinks ... is a 2001 novel by British author David Lodge. The novel concerns the extramarital affairs between faculty members at a fictional British university.

== Plot ==
Helen Reed, an English novelist in her early forties, arrives at the University of Gloucester to spend the term there as &quot;writer-in-residence&quot; and to teach a creative writing class. Still grieving over the death of her beloved husband, Helen thinks a change of scenery might be a good idea to get over her loss. Apart from the English Department, she is intrigued by the department of Cognitive Science and by its head, 50-year-old Ralph Messenger, to whom she is introduced at a social function very soon during her stay. Helen feels curiously attracted by Messenger but she soon learns about his reputation as a womaniser.

When a student submits some chapters from the novel she is writing, Helen recognises one of the male characters as having been modelled on her late husband Martin. Gradually it dawns upon Helen that her husband must have had a succession of young lovers, with everyone except herself knowing everything. During a fundraising event, Messenger&#x27;s wife Carrie tells Helen she knows about her own husband&#x27;s flings and, by taking a lover herself, tries to get back at him. Ralph Messenger, she is quite sure, does not know anything about her affair. Helen decides to get on with her life and allows herself to be drawn into an affair with Messenger. Soon, Helen ponders whether she is falling in love with him.

When he is waiting for Helen in her maisonette, Messenger cannot resist the temptation to turn on her laptop and read parts of her journal. This is how he learns about his wife&#x27;s infidelity. When Helen enters her apartment, his jealousy gets the better of him so that he cannot hide the fact that he has invaded her privacy.

Ralph Messenger undergoes surgery, after which he loses his reputation as a woman-chaser. In 1999, he publishes a new book entitled &quot;Machine Living&quot; and in due course is awarded a CBE. He never confronts Carrie with her affair and remains married to her. Helen Reed returns to London and resumes writing. In the following year she publishes &quot;Crying is a Puzzler&quot;, a novel about life on campus quite similar to that of the University of Gloucester.

==Reception==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; gave a neutral review, noting the similarities between &quot;Thinks...&quot; and Lodge&#x27;s other &quot;campus novels&quot;, as well as Lodge&#x27;s use of his characters as philosophical mouthpieces. Literary website &quot;Bookish Thoughts&quot; called &quot;Thinks...&quot; &quot;a thought experiment on the nature of consciousness&quot; even as it cautioned readers about extensive and explicit discussions of sex.

<text>The Intel486 DX2, rumored as 80486DX2 (later rebadged i486DX2), is a CPU produced by Intel that was first introduced in 1992. The i486DX2 was nearly identical to the i486DX, but it had additional clock multiplier circuitry. It was the second CPU chip to use clock doubling, whereby the processor runs two internal logic clock cycles per external bus cycle. An i486 DX2 was thus significantly faster than an i486 DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked external bus. Both 25/50 and 33/66 MHz Intel486 DX2 CPU uses the 800 nm process technology. With the internal clock doubler CPU, it boosts overall system performance between 50 and 70 percent above the original Intel486 DX series. In other words, the 50-MHz Intel486 DX2 provides about 70 percent improvement over the 25-MHz Intel486 and about 30-percent improvement over the 33-MHz Intel486 CPU. The 50-MHz Intel486 DX2 CPU was rated at 40 Dhrystone MIPS.

The i486DX2-66 was a very popular processor for video games enthusiasts in the early to mid-90s. Often coupled with 4 to 8 MB of RAM and a VLB video card, this CPU was capable of playing virtually every game title available for years after its release, right up to the end of the MS-DOS game era, making it a &quot;sweet spot&quot; in terms of CPU performance and longevity. The introduction of 3D graphics spelled the end of the 486&#x27;s reign, because of their heavy use of floating point calculations and the need for faster cache and more memory bandwidth. Developers began to target the P5 Pentium processor family almost exclusively with x86 assembly language optimizations which led to the usage of terms such as &quot;Pentium compatible processor&quot; for software requirements. An i486DX2-50 version was also available, but because the bus speed was 25 MHz rather than 33 MHz, this was a significantly less popular processor.

There are two major versions of the DX2 - Identified by P24 and P24D, the latter has a faster L1 cache mode, called &quot;write-back&quot;, that improves performance. The original P24 version offered only the slower &quot;write-through&quot; cache mode. AMD and Cyrix both produced a competitor for the Intel i486DX2.

The 50-MHz Intel486 DX2 were available in production volumes for US$550 each in 1,000-pieces quantities at the time of the press.

<doc id="70381" wikidata="Q150974" url="?curid=70381" title="Tehran Conference">
<text>The Tehran Conference (codenamed Eureka) was a strategy meeting of the Allies of World War II, held between Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill from 28 November to 1 December 1943. It was the first of the Allied World War II conferences involving the &quot;Big Three&quot; (the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom) and took place at the Soviet embassy in Tehran just over a year after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. The meeting occurred shortly after the Cairo Conference was held in Egypt for a discussion between the United States, the United Kingdom, and China from 22 to 26 November 1943. The Big Three would not meet again until 1945, when the Yalta Conference was held in Crimea from 4 to 11 February and the Potsdam Conference was held in Allied-occupied Germany from 17 July to August 2.

Although the three leaders arrived in Tehran with differing objectives, the main outcome of the meeting was a British and American commitment to opening a second front against Nazi Germany, thereby forcing it to pull military assets away from the Eastern Front with the Soviets. In addition to this decision, the Tehran Conference also addressed: the Big Three&#x27;s relations with Turkey and Iran, as the former was being pressed to enter the conflict and the latter was under Allied occupation; operations in Yugoslavia and against Japan; and the envisaged settlement following the expected defeat of the Axis powers. A separate contract also saw the Big Three pledge to recognize Iranian independence.

==Background==
Once the German-Soviet War broke out in June 1941, Churchill offered assistance to the Soviets, and an agreement to that effect was signed on 12 July 1941. However, Churchill, in a spoken radio transmission announcing the alliance with the Soviets, reminded listeners that the alliance would not change his stance against communism.

Delegations had traveled between London and Moscow to arrange the implementation of that support, and when the United States joined the war in December 1941, the delegations met in Washington as well. A Combined Chiefs of Staff committee was created to co-ordinate British and American operations and their support to the Soviets. The consequences of a global war, the absence of a unified Allied strategy, and the complexity of allocating resources between Europe and Asia had not yet been sorted out, which soon gave rise to mutual suspicions between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. There was the question of opening a second front to alleviate the German pressure on the Soviet Red Army on the Eastern Front, the question of mutual assistance (since both the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were looking towards the United States for credit and material support, there was tension between the United States and Britain since the Americans had no desire to prop up the British Empire in the event of an Allied victory). Also, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom was prepared to give Stalin a free hand in Eastern Europe, and there was no common policy on how to deal with Germany after the war. Communications regarding those matters between Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin took place by telegrams and via emissaries, but it was evident that direct negotiations were urgently needed.

Stalin was reluctant to leave Moscow and unwilling to risk journeys by air. He went by train to Baku, and then by air. There were two planes at Baku; one for him piloted by a colonel-general and one for officials piloted by a colonel. but Stalin chose the colonel&#x27;s aircraft, saying &quot;Colonel-General&#x27;s don&#x27;t often pilot aircraft.&quot;

Roosevelt was physically disabled and found travel difficult. Churchill was an avid traveller and, as part of an ongoing series of wartime conferences, had already met with Roosevelt five times in North America and twice in Africa and had also held two prior meetings with Stalin in Moscow. To arrange the urgently-needed meeting, Roosevelt tried to persuade Stalin to travel to Cairo. Stalin turned down the offer and also offers to meet in Baghdad or Basra. He finally agreed to meet in Tehran in November 1943. Iran was a neutral country but was nevertheless invaded jointly by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in August 1941.

==Proceedings==

The conference was to convene at 16:00 on 28 November 1943. Stalin had arrived well before, followed by Roosevelt, who was brought in his wheelchair from his accommodation adjacent to the venue. Roosevelt, who had traveled to attend and whose health was already deteriorating, was met by Stalin. This was the first time that they had met. Churchill, walking with his general staff from their accommodations nearby, arrived half an hour later. According to Roosevelt&#x27;s interpreter, Charles Bohlen, Roosevelt was accompanied by Harry Hopkins, who had served as Roosevelt&#x27;s personal emissary to Churchill, and W. Averell Harriman, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Stalin was accompanied by Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov and military leader Kliment Voroshilov. Churchill brought Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden his CGS Alanbrooke, chief military assistant Hastings Ismay plus Dill, Cunningham, Portal, Boyle, and his interpreter Arthur Birse. Three Western women attended: Churchill&#x27;s daughter Sarah, Averell Harriman&#x27;s daughter Kathleen and Roosevelt&#x27;s daughter Anna Boettiger.


As Stalin had been advocating for a second front since 1941, he was very pleased and felt that he had accomplished his principal goal for the meeting. Moving on, Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan once Germany was defeated:

The leaders then turned to the conditions under which the Western Allies would open a new front by invading northern France (Operation Overlord), as Stalin had pressed them to do since 1941. Until then, Churchill had advocated the expansion of joint operations of British, American, and Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean, as opening a new western front had been physically impossible because of a lack of existing shipping routes. That left the Mediterranean and Italy as viable goals for 1943. It was agreed Operation Overlord would be launched by American and British forces by May 1944 and that Stalin would support the Allies with a concurrent major offensive on Germany&#x27;s eastern front (Operation Bagration) to divert German forces from northern France.

Additional offensives were also discussed to complement the undertaking of Operation Overlord, including the possible allied invasion of southern France prior to the landings at Normandy with the goal of drawing German forces away from the northern beaches and even a possible strike at the northern tip of the Adriatic to circumvent the Alps and drive towards Vienna. Either plan would have relied on Allied divisions engaged against the German Army in Italy around the time of the conference.

Churchill argued for the invasion of Italy in 1943, then Overlord in 1944, on the basis that Overlord was physically impossible in 1943 for lack of shipping and that it would be unthinkable to do anything important until it could be launched. Churchill successfully proposed to Stalin a westward movement of Poland, which Stalin accepted. It gave the Poles industrialized German land to the west but took marshlands to the east. It also provided a territorial buffer to the Soviet Union against invasion. Churchill&#x27;s plan involved a border along the Oder and the Neisse, which he views to give Poland a fair compensation for the Eastern Borderlands.

=== Discussion on Iran and Turkey ===

Iran and Turkey were discussed in detail. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin all agreed to support the Iranian government, as addressed in the following declaration:

In addition, the Soviets pledged support to Turkey if it entered the war. Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin agreed that it would also be most desirable if Turkey entered on the Allies&#x27; side before the year was out. In order to encourage Turkey to act as soon as possible, they agreed to make &quot;the offer to take Crete and the Dodecanese islands because they are rather close to Turkey.&quot;

===Dinner meeting===
Before the Tripartite Dinner Meeting of 29 November 1943 at the Conference, Churchill presented Stalin with a specially commissioned ceremonial sword (the &quot;Sword of Stalingrad,&quot; made in Sheffield), as a gift from King George VI to the citizens of Stalingrad and the Soviet people, commemorating the Soviet victory at Stalingrad. When Stalin received the sheathed sword, he took it with both hands and kissed the scabbard. Stalin held the sword by the sheathe and angled the pommel downwards, causing the sword to slide out of its scabbard and fall to the ground. He then handed it to Marshal Kliment Voroshilov

Stalin proposed executing 50,000 to 100,000 German officers so that Germany could not plan another war. Roosevelt, believing that Stalin was not serious, joked that &quot;maybe 49,000 would be enough.&quot; Churchill, however, was outraged and denounced &quot;the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country.&quot; He said that only war criminals should be put on trial in accordance with the Moscow Document, which he had written. He stormed out of the room but was brought back in by Stalin, who said he was joking. Churchill was glad Stalin had relented but thought that Stalin had been testing the waters.

==Military decisions==
# The Yugoslav Partisans would be supported by supplies, equipment, and commando operations.
# The leaders stated that it would be desirable for Turkey to join the war on the side of the Allies before the end of the year.
# The leaders took note of Stalin&#x27;s statement that if Turkey found herself at war with Germany and, as a result, Bulgaria declared war on or attacked Turkey, the Soviet Union would immediately be at war with Bulgaria. The Conference noted that this could be mentioned in the forthcoming negotiations to bring Turkey into the war.
#The cross-channel invasion of France (Operation Overlord) would be launched during May 1944, in conjunction with an operation against southern France (Operation Dragoon). The latter operation would be undertaken in as great a strength as the availability of landing-craft permitted. The Conference further took note of Stalin&#x27;s statement that the Soviet forces would launch an offensive (Operation Bagration) about the same time with the object of preventing the German forces from transferring from the Eastern Front to the Western Front. Operation Overlord was to be on 1 June, but the moon and tides required to be delayed to 5 June. 
# The leaders agreed for the military staff of the three powers to keep in close contact with one another in regard to the impending operations in Europe. In particular, a cover plan to mislead the enemy about the operations was to be concocted by the staff concerned.

=== Political decisions ===
Stalin and Churchill discussed the future borders of Poland, stating a variant of the so-called Curzon Line for the eastern border, supporting the annexation of the rest by the USSR, proposing annexation of German territories in the north and west to Poland instead. Roosevelt had asked to be excused from any discussion of Poland, stating it as matter for the effects of any decision on Polish voters in the US and the upcoming 1944 election. The decisions were not officially ratified until the Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference in 1945. Soon before the conference, the USSR unilaterally withdrew recognition of the Polish government-in-exile, still recognized by the UK and the US and the negotiations were made covertly without their involvement.

During the negotiations, Roosevelt had demanded that the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would be deemed as part of the Soviet Union only after the citizens &#x27;voted&#x27; on the action. Roosevelt secured formal &#x27;agreement&#x27;, however, Stalin would not consent to any international control over the elections and stated that all issues would have to be resolved &#x27;in accordance with the Soviet Constitution&#x27;. In the end, after Soviet occupation, the areas were subjected in accordance with Soviet plans. The US, for example in principle never officially recognised.

==Results==
The Yugoslav Partisans were given full Allied support, and Allied support to the Yugoslav Chetniks was halted. (They were believed to be cooperating with the occupying Italians and Germans rather than fighting them; see Yugoslavia and the Allies) .

The communist Partisans under Josip Broz Tito took power in Yugoslavia as the Germans gradually retreated from the Balkans in 1944 and 1945.

Turkish President İsmet İnönü conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Cairo Conference in November 1943 and promised to enter the war when his country had become fully armed. By August 1944, Turkey broke off relations with Germany. In February 1945, Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan, which may have been a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations.

=== Operation Overlord ===
Roosevelt and Stalin spent much of the conference to try to convince Churchill to commit to an invasion of France and finally succeeded on 30 November, when Roosevelt announced at lunch that they would be launching the invasion in May 1944. That pleased Stalin, who had been pressing his allies to open a new front in the west to alleviate some pressure on his troops. That decision may be the most critical to come out of this conference, as the desired effect of the relief of Soviet troops was achieved and led to a Soviet rally and advance toward Germany, a tide that Hitler could not stem.

=== United Nations ===
The Tehran Conference also served as one of the first conversations surrounding the formation of the United Nations. Roosevelt first introduced Stalin to the idea of an international organization comprising all nation states, a venue for the resolution of common issues, and a check against international aggressors. With Germany having thrust the world into chaos for the second time in as many generations, the three world leaders all agreed that something must be done to prevent a similar occurrence.

=== Division of Germany ===
There was a shared view among the participants that a postwar division of Germany was necessary with the sides differing on the number of divisions needed to neutralize her ability to wage war. The numbers that were proposed varied widely and never came to fruition, but the powers would effectively divide modern Germany into two parts until the end of the Cold War. During one dinner, Churchill questioned Stalin on his postwar territorial ambitions. Stalin replied, &quot;There is no need to speak at this present time about any Soviet Desires, but when the time comes we will speak.&quot;

=== Soviet entry to the Pacific War ===

On 29 November, Roosevelt asked Stalin five questions about data and intelligence relating to Japanese and Siberian ports and about air bases in the Maritime Provinces for up to 1,000 heavy bombers. On 2 February, Stalin told the American ambassador that America could operate 1,000 bombers from Siberia after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan (Vladivostok is in the Russian Far East, not Siberia).

==Alleged assassination plot==
According to Soviet reports, German agents planned to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference, but called off the assassination while it was still in the planning stage. The NKVD, the USSR&#x27;s counterintelligence unit, first notified Mike Reilly, Roosevelt&#x27;s chief of security, of the suspected assassination plot several days before Roosevelt&#x27;s arrival in Tehran. Reilly had gone to Tehran several days early to evaluate security concerns and explore potential routes from Cairo to Tehran. Just before Reilly returned to Cairo, the NKVD informed him that dozens of Germans had been dropped into Tehran by parachute the day before. The NKVD suspected German agents were planning to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference.

When housing accommodations for the meeting were originally discussed, both Stalin and Churchill had extended invitations to Roosevelt, asking him to stay with them during the meeting. However, Roosevelt wanted to avoid the appearance of choosing one ally over another and decided it was important to stay at the American legation to remain independent. Roosevelt arrived in Tehran on 27 November 1943 and settled into the American legation. Close to midnight, Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin&#x27;s top aide, summoned Archibald Clark-Kerr (the British ambassador in the Soviet Union) and Averell Harriman (the American ambassador in the Soviet Union) to the Soviet embassy, warning them of an assassination plot against Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Molotov informed them several assassins had been apprehended, but reported additional assassins were at large and expressed concerns for President Roosevelt&#x27;s safety. Molotov advised Roosevelt should be moved to the safety of the British or Soviet embassy.

Americans suspected Stalin had fabricated the assassination plot as an excuse to have Roosevelt moved to the Soviet embassy. Mike Reilly, Roosevelt&#x27;s chief of Secret Service, advised him to move to either the Soviet or British embassies for his safety. One of the underlying factors influencing their decision was the distance Churchill and Stalin would need to travel for meetings at the American legation. Harriman reminded the President that the Americans would be held responsible if Stalin or Churchill were assassinated while traveling to visit Roosevelt all the way across the city. Earlier that day, Molotov had agreed to hold all meetings at the American legation because traveling was difficult for Roosevelt. The timing of Molotov announcing an assassination plot later that night aroused suspicion that his motives were to keep Stalin safely within the guarded walls of the Soviet embassy. Harriman doubted the existence of an assassination plot, but urged the President to relocate to avoid the perception of putting Churchill and Stalin in danger. Roosevelt did not believe there was a credible threat of assassination, but agreed to the move so he could be closer to Stalin and Churchill. Living in the Soviet embassy also allowed Roosevelt to gain more direct access to Stalin and build his trust. Stalin liked having Roosevelt in the embassy because it eliminated the need to travel outside the compound and it allowed him to spy on Roosevelt more easily. The Soviet embassy was guarded by thousands of secret police and located adjacent to the British embassy, which allowed the Big Three to meet securely.

After the Tehran Conference ended, Harriman asked Molotov whether there was really ever an assassination threat in Tehran. Molotov said that they knew about German agents in Tehran, but did not know of a specific assassination plot. Molotov&#x27;s response minimized their assertions of an assassination plot, instead emphasizing that Stalin thought President Roosevelt would be safer at the Soviet embassy. American and British intelligence reports generally dismissed the existence of this plot and Otto Skorzeny, the alleged leader of the operation, later claimed that Hitler had dismissed the idea as unworkable before planning had even begun. The topic continues to be a theme of certain Russian historians.

<text>In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus &quot;Prunus&quot;) and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

Colloquially, flowers of orange are referred to as such as well. Peach blossoms (including nectarine), most cherry blossoms, and some almond blossoms are usually pink. Plum blossoms, apple blossoms, orange blossoms, some cherry blossoms, and most almond blossoms are white.

Blossoms provide pollen to pollinators such as bees, and initiate cross-pollination necessary for the trees to reproduce by producing fruit.

==Herbal use==

The ancient Phoenicians used almond blossoms with honey and urine as a tonic, and sprinkled them into stews and gruels to give muscular strength. Crushed petals were also used as a poultice on skin spots and mixed with banana oil, for dry skin and sunburn.

In herbalism the crab apple was used as treatment for boils, abscesses, splinters, wounds, coughs, colds and a host of other ailments ranging from acne to kidney ailments. Many dishes made with apples and apple blossom are of medieval origin. In the spring, monks and physicians would gather the blossoms and preserve them in vinegar for drawing poultices and for bee stings and other insect bites. Descending from China and south east Asia, the earliest orange species moved westwards via the trade routes.
In 17th century Italy peach blossoms were made into a poultice for bruises, rashes, eczema, grazes and stings.

In ancient Greek medicine plum blossoms were used to treat bleeding gums, mouth ulcers and tighten loose teeth. Plum blossoms mixed with sage leaves and flowers were used in plum wine or plum brandy as a mouthwash to soothe sore throats and mouth ailments and sweeten bad breath.

== Blossom festivals ==
 is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers; in this case almost always refer to those of the or, less frequently, trees.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the National Trust organises the environmental awareness campaign #BlossomWatch, which is designed to raise awareness of the first signs of Spring, by encouraging people to share images of blossoms via social media.

<text>The Herald and Weekly Times Pty Ltd (HWT) is a newspaper publishing company based in Melbourne, Australia. It is owned and operated by News Pty Ltd, which as News Ltd, purchased the HWT in 1987.

==Newspapers==
The HWT&#x27;s newspaper interests date back to 1840 and the launch of &quot;The Port Phillip Herald&quot;. The company publishes the morning daily tabloid &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, which was created in 1990 from a merger of the company&#x27;s morning tabloid paper, &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot;, with its afternoon broadsheet paper, &quot;The Herald&quot;. &quot;The Herald&quot; had a 150-year history, and &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot; a 68-year history, in Melbourne. The HWT had bought &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot; in 1925.

The HWT also publishes &quot;The Weekly Times&quot;, aimed at farmers and rural businesses.

The HWT bought a controlling stake in &quot;The Advertiser&quot; of Adelaide in 1929. From 1929 until 1987, HWT owned and operated Melbourne radio station 3DB. In 1929, 3DB along with 3UZ participated in experimental television broadcasts using the &quot;Radiovision&quot; system. &quot;The Advertiser&quot; took a stake in &quot;The News&quot; two years later. &quot;The News&quot; was sold in 1949.

The HWT bought &quot;The West Australian&quot; in 1969. 

By 1986 Queensland Press was the largest shareholder of HWT which was targeted for a takeover by the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch in the course of the big media shake-up of 1986/87, which was enabled by the Australian Federal Government under Prime Minister Bob Hawke to curry favour with the nation&#x27;s major media and their owners in order to foster its re-election chances in the 1987 Australian federal election. In the end, some major assets of HWT were divided up between Murdoch&#x27;s rival Robert Holmes a Court. Holmes a Court agreed to drop his $1.4 billion bid for the Melbourne-based Herald and Weekly Times in return for the right to buy its two Perth newspapers, &quot;The West Australian&quot; and its afternoon counterpart, &quot;The Daily News&quot;, as well as the Melbourne television station of Channel 7, HSV-7. Murdoch in turn acquired Queensland Press in January 1987 via his family company Cruden Investments for $ 700 million.
