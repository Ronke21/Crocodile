<text>A scribe is a person who serves as a professional copyist, especially one who made copies of manuscripts before the invention of automatic printing.

The work of scribes can involve copying manuscripts and other texts as well as secretarial and administrative duties such as the taking of dictation and keeping of business, judicial, and historical records for kings, nobles, temples, and cities.

The profession of scribe first appears in Mesopotamia. Scribes contributed in fundamental ways to ancient and medieval cultures, including Egypt, China, India, Persia, the Roman Empire, and medieval Europe. Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam have important scribal traditions. Scribes have been essential in these cultures for the preservation of legal codes, religious texts, and artistic and didactic literature. In some cultures, social functions of the scribe and of the calligrapher overlap, but the emphasis in scribal writing is on exactitude, whereas calligraphy aims to express the aesthetic qualities of writing apart from its content.

Scribes, previously so widespread across cultures, lost most of their prominence and status with the advent of the printing press. The generally less prestigious profession of scrivener continued to be important for copying and writing out legal documents and the like. In societies with low literacy rates, street-corner letter-writers (and readers) may still be found providing scribe service.

==Mesopotamia==
The Sumerians developed one of the earliest writing systems (the Cuneiform), the first body of written literature, and an extensive scribal profession to further these activities. The work of Near Eastern scribes primarily exists on clay tablets and stone monuments written in cuneiform, though later in the period of cuneiform writing they begin to use papyrus, parchment, and writing tablets. The body of knowledge that scribes possessed belonged to an elite urban culture, and few had access to it. Traveling scribes played a vital role in the dissemination of literary culture.

During the middle to late 3rd millennium BCE, Sumerian literature in the form of disputations proliferated, such as the &quot;Debate between bird and fish&quot;; the &quot;Debate between Summer and Winter&quot;, in which Winter wins; and others between the cattle and grain, the tree and the reed, silver and copper, the pickaxe and the plough, and the millstone and the gul-gul stone. Nearly all known Sumerian literary works were preserved as a result of young scribes apprenticing for their profession. In addition to literary works, the contents of the tablets they produced include word lists, syllabaries, grammar forms, and lists of personal names.

To the extent that the curriculum in scribal schools can be reconstructed, it appears that they would have begun by studying lists and syllabaries and learning metrology, the formulas for writing legal contracts, and proverbs. They then might have advanced to praise poems and finally to copying more sophisticated works of literature. Some scholars have thought that apprentice scribes listened to literary compositions read aloud and took dictation; others, that they copied directly from master copies. A combination of dictation, copying, and memorization for reproduction has also been proposed.
==Ancient Egypt==

One of the most important professionals in ancient Egypt was a person educated in the arts of writing (both hieroglyphics and hieratic scripts, as well as the demotic script from the second half of the first millennium BCE, which was mainly used as shorthand and for commerce) and arithmetic. Sons of scribes were brought up in the same scribal tradition, sent to school, and inherited their fathers&#x27; positions upon entering the civil service.

Much of what is known about ancient Egypt is due to the activities of its scribes and the officials. But because of their ability to study in the vast Egyptian libraries, they were entrusted with jobs bigger than just copyists. Monumental buildings were erected under their supervision, administrative and economic activities were documented by them, and stories from Egypt&#x27;s lower classes and foreign lands survive due to scribes putting them in writing.

Scribes were considered part of the royal court, were not conscripted into the army, did not have to pay taxes, and were exempt from the heavy manual labor required of the lower classes (corvée labor). The scribal profession worked with painters and artisans who decorated reliefs and other building works with scenes, personages, or hieroglyphic text. However, the physical aspect of their work sometimes took a toll on their joints, with ancient bones showing some signs of arthritis that might be attributable to their profession.

The hieroglyph used to signify the scribe, &quot;to write&quot; and &quot;writings&quot;, etc., is Gardiner sign Y3, Y3 from the category of &#x27;writings, &amp; music&#x27;. The hieroglyph contains the scribe&#x27;s ink-mixing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the black and red ink blocks.
The demotic scribes used rush pens which had stems thinner than that of a reed (2 mm). The end of the rush was cut obliquely and then chewed so that the fibers became separated. The result was a short, stiff brush which was handled in the same manner as that of a calligrapher.

Thoth was the god credited with the invention of writing by the ancient Egyptians. He was the scribe of the gods who held knowledge of scientific and moral laws.

== China ==

The earliest known examples of writing in China are a body of inscriptions made on bronze vessels and oracle bones during the late Shang dynasty (), with the very oldest dated to . It was originally used for divination, with characters etched onto turtle shells to interpret cracks caused by exposure to heat. By the sixth century BCE, scribes were producing books using bamboo and wooden slips. Each strip contained a single column of script, and the books were bound together with hemp, silk, or leather. China is well-known as being the place where paper was originally invented, likely by an imperial eunuch named Cai Lun in 105 CE. The invention of paper allowed for the later invention of woodblock printing, where paper was rubbed onto an inked slab to copy the characters. Despite this invention, calligraphy remained a prized skill due to the belief that &quot;the best way to absorb the contents of a book was to copy it by hand&quot;.

Chinese scribes played an instrumental role in the imperial government&#x27;s civil service. During the Tang dynasty, private collections of Confucian classics began to grow. Young men hoping to join the civil service would need to pass an exam based on Confucian doctrine, and these collections, which became known as &quot;academy libraries&quot; were places of study. Within this merit system, owning books was a sign of status. Despite the later importance of Confucian manuscripts, they were initially heavily resisted by the Qin dynasty. Though their accounts are likely exaggerated, later scholars describe a period of book burning and scholarly suppression. This exaggeration likely stems from Han dynasty historians being steeped in Confucianism as state orthodoxy.

Similarly to the west, religious texts, particularly Buddhist, were transcribed in monasteries and hidden during &quot;times of persecution&quot;. In fact, the earliest known copy of a printed book is of the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; dating to 868 CE, which was found alongside other manuscripts within a walled-in cave called Dunhuang.

As professionals, scribes would undergo three years of training before becoming novices. The title of &quot;scribe&quot; was inherited from father to son. Early in their careers, they would work with local and regional governments and did not enjoy an official rank. A young scribe needed to hone their writing skills before specializing in an area like public administration or law. Archaeological evidence even points to scribes being buried with marks of their trade such as brushes, &quot;administrative, legal, divinatory, mathematical, and medicinal texts&quot;, thus displaying a personal embodiment of their profession.

== South Asia ==

The Buddhist Tripiṭaka emerged at the beginning of the first century. Buddhist texts were treasured and sacred throughout Asia and were written in different languages. Buddhist scribes believed that, “The act of copying them could bring a scribe closer to perfection and earn him merit.”

Rather later, Hindu texts were written, although the most sacred, especially the Vedas, were not written down until much later, and were learnt by heart by the priestly Brahmins. Writing in the several scripts of Indic languages was generally not regarded as a distinct artistic form, in a situation similar to Europe, but different from East Asian traditions of calligraphy.

==Japan==

By the 5th century CE, written Chinese was being adapted in Japan to represent spoken Japanese. The complexity of reconciling Japanese with a system of writing not meant to express it meant that acquiring literacy was a long process. Phonetic syllabaries &quot;(kana)&quot;, used for private writing, were developed by the 8th century and were in use along with &quot;kanji&quot;, the logographic system, used for official records. Gendering of the private and public spheres led to a characterization of &quot;kana&quot; as more feminine and &quot;kanji&quot; as masculine, but women of the court were educated and knew &quot;kanji&quot;, and men also wrote in &quot;kana&quot;, while works of literature were produced in both.
The earliest extant writings take the form of &quot;mokkan&quot;, wooden slips used for official memoranda and short communications and for practical purposes such as shipping tags; inscriptions on metal and stone; and manuscripts of sutras and commentaries. &quot;Mokkan&quot; were often used for writing practice. Manuscripts first took the form of rolls made from cloth or sheets of paper, but when manuscripts began to appear as bound books, they coexisted with handscrolls &quot;(makimono)&quot;.

The influence of Chinese culture, especially written culture, made writing &quot;immensely important&quot; in the early Japanese court. The earliest Japanese writing to survive dates from the late Asuka and Nara periods (550–794), when Buddhist texts were being copied and disseminated. Because Buddhism was text-based, monks were employed in scribal and bureaucratic work for their skill in writing and knowledge of Chinese culture. In portraits of Buddhist clerics, a handscroll is a symbol of scribal authority and the possession of knowledge.
Government offices and Buddhist centers employed copyists on a wide scale, requiring an abundance of materials such as paper, glue, ink, and brushes; exemplars from which to copy; an organizational structure; and technicians for assembly, called &quot;sōkō&quot; or &quot;sō’ō&quot;. More than 10,000 Nara documents are preserved in the Shōsōin archives of the Tōdai-ji temple complex. The institution of the &quot;ritsuryō &quot; legal state from the 8th to 10th centuries produced &quot;a mountain of paperwork&quot; employing hundreds of bureaucratic scribes in the capital and in the provinces. The average sutra copyist is estimated to have generated 3,800–4,000 characters a day. Scribes were paid by the &quot;page,&quot; and the fastest completed thirteen or more sheets a day, working on a low table and seated on the floor. Both speed and accuracy mattered. Proofreaders checked the copy against the exemplar, and the scribe&#x27;s pay was docked for errors.

In the 8th century, the demand for vast quantities of copies meant that scribes in the Office of Sutra Transcription were lay people of common status, not yet ordained monks, some finding opportunities for advancement. In Classical Japan, even lay scribes at some sutra copyist centers were required to practice ritual purity through vegetarian dietary restrictions, wearing ritual garments &quot;(jōe)&quot;, ablution, avoiding contact with death and illness, and possibly sexual abstinence. Outside Buddhist centers, professional scriveners practiced copyist craft. Court-commissioned chronicles of the 8th century, such as &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon shoki&quot;, survive in much later copies, as is the case for the first Japanese poetry anthologies.

The earliest printed books were produced under the Empress Shōtoku on a large scale in the 8th century, only three centuries after Japanese became a written language, and by the Edo period (1603–1868) bound printed books predominated. Manuscripts remained valued for their aesthetic qualities, and the scribal tradition continued to flourish for a wide range of reasons. In addition to handwritten practical documents pertaining to legal and commercial transactions, individuals might write journals or commonplace books, which involved copying out sometimes lengthy passages by hand. This copying might extend to complete manuscripts of books that were expensive or not readily available to buy.
But scribal culture was not merely or always a matter of need or necessity. Copying Buddhist sutras was a devotional practice &quot;(shakyō)&quot;. In the Nara period, wealthy patrons commissioned sutra copying on behalf of ancestors to gain them spiritual passage from the Buddhist hells. The Edo-period court noble Konoe Iehiro created a sutra manuscript in gold ink on dark blue paper, stating his purpose in the colophon as &quot;to ensure the spiritual enlightenment of his departed mother.&quot;

Creating a calligraphic and pictorial work by copying secular literature likewise was an aesthetic practice for its own sake and a means of study. Within the social elite of the court, calligraphy was thought to express the inner character of the writer. In the Heian period, the book collector, scholar-scribe, and literary artist Fujiwara no Teika was a leader in preserving and producing quality manuscripts of works of literature. Even so prolific an author of printed prose works as Ihara Saikaku (1642–1693) also produced handwritten works in several formats, including manuscripts, handscrolls, and poetry slips &quot;(tanzaku)&quot; and cards &quot;(shikishi)&quot;. Unique and prized handscrolls preserved the collaborative poetry sessions characteristic of &quot;renga&quot; and &quot;haikai&quot; poetic composition, distributed more widely in printed copies.
For authors not located near the major centers of publishing and printing, manuscripts were a route to publication. Some authors self-published their books, especially romance novels &quot;(ninjōbon)&quot;, in manuscript form. Women&#x27;s prose writings in general were circulated as manuscripts during the Edo period. Women were not prevented from writing and circulating their work, but private publication may have been a way for women to adhere to gender norms in not making themselves available in the public sphere.

Manuscripts could more readily evade government censorship, and officially banned books that could no longer be printed were copied for personal use or circulated privately. Lending libraries &quot;(kashihon&#x27;ya)&quot; offered manuscript books, including illicit texts, along with printed books. Books might also be composed as manuscripts when their transmission was limited to a particular circle of interested parties or sharers in the knowledge, such as local history and antiquarianism, a family&#x27;s accumulated lore or farming methods, or medical texts of a particular school of medicine. Intentional secrecy might be desired to protect arcane knowledge or proprietary information with commercial value.

In the esoteric strand of Japanese Buddhism, scribes recorded oracles, the utterances of a &quot;kami&quot;-inspired person often in the form of dialogues in response to questions. The transcriber also filled in context for the transmission. After the text was verified, it became part of the canon, stored in secret places, viewable by affiliated monks, and used to legitimate forms of religious authority. Because they dealt with genealogies and sacral boundaries, oracle texts were consulted as references in questions of lineage and land ownership.
At contemporary Shinto or Buddhist shrines, scribal traditions still play a role in creating &quot;ofuda&quot; (talismans), &quot;omikuji&quot; (fortunes or divination lots), &quot;ema&quot; (votive tablets), &quot;goshuin&quot; (calligraphic visitor stamps), and &quot;gomagi&quot; (inscribed sticks for ritual burning), forms that may employ a combination of stamps and handwriting on media. Today these are often mass produced and commercialized for marketing to tourists. &quot;Ema&quot;, for instance, began as large-scale pictorial representations that historically were created by professional artists. Small versions began to be produced and sold, and a complex symbology developed for the messages. Modern versions sold at shrines, often already stamped with their local affiliation, tend to be used more verbally, with space left for individuals to act as their own scribes in messaging the &quot;kami&quot;.

==Judaism==

Scribes of ancient Israel were a literate minority in an oral based-culture. Some of them belonged to the priestly class, other scribes were the record-keepers and letter-writers in the royal palaces and administrative centers, affiliated with the ancient equivalent of professional guilds. 
There were no scribal schools in Israel during the early part of the Iron Age (1200–800 B.C.E.). Between the 13th and 8th centuries B.C.E., the Hebrew alphabetic system had not been developed. Only after the appearance of the Kingdom of Israel, Finkelstein points to the reign of Omri, did the scribal schools begin to develop, reaching their culmination in the time of Jeroboam II, under Mesopotamian influence. The eventual standardization of the Hebrew writing system between the eighth and sixth centuries B.C.E. would presumably have given rise to codified rules and principles of language that scribes would then have learned. The education of scribes in ancient Israel was supported by the state, although some scribal arts could have been taught within a small number of families.
Some scribes also copied documents, but this was not necessarily part of their job.

The Jewish scribes used the following rules and procedures while creating copies of the Torah and eventually other books in the Hebrew Bible.

# They could only use clean animal skins, both to write on, and even to bind manuscripts.
# Each column of writing could have no less than 48, and no more than 60, lines.
# The ink must be black, and of a special recipe.
# They must say each word aloud while they were writing.
# They must wipe the pen and wash their entire bodies before writing the most Holy Name of God, YHVH, every time they wrote it. Also before they would write the Most Holy Name of God, they would wash their hands 7 times.
# There must be a review within thirty days, and if as many as three pages required corrections, the entire manuscript had to be redone.
# The letters, words, and paragraphs had to be counted, and the document became invalid if two letters touched each other. The middle paragraph, word and letter must correspond to those of the original document.
# The documents could be stored only in sacred places (synagogues, etc.).
# As no document containing God&#x27;s Word could be destroyed, they were stored, or buried, in a genizah (Hebrew: &quot;storage&quot;).

===Sofer===

Sofers (Jewish scribes) are among the few scribes that still do their trade by hand, writing on parchment. Renowned calligraphers, they produce the Hebrew Torah scrolls and other holy texts.

====Accuracy====
Until 1948, the oldest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible dated back to CE 895. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some scrolls dated between 100 BCE and CE 100, inside a cave west of the Dead Sea. Over the next decade, more scrolls were found in caves and the discoveries became known collectively as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Every book in the Hebrew Bible was represented except Esther. Numerous copies of each book were discovered, including 25 copies of the book of Deuteronomy.

While there were other items found among the Dead Sea Scrolls not currently in the Hebrew Bible, and many variations and errors occurred when they were copied, the texts, on the whole, testify to the accuracy of the scribes. The Dead Sea Scrolls are currently the best route of comparison to the accuracy and consistency of translation for the Hebrew Bible because they are the oldest out of any biblical text currently known.

====Corrections and editing====

Priests who took over the leadership of the Jewish community preserved and edited biblical literature. Biblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests&#x27; political and religious authority.

Corrections by the scribes (Tiqqun soferim) refers to changes that were made in the original wording of the Hebrew Bible during the second temple period, perhaps sometime between 450 and 350 BCE. One of the most prominent men at this time was Ezra the scribe. He also hired scribes to work for him, in order to write down and revise the oral tradition. After Ezra and the scribes had completed the writing, Ezra gathered the Jews who had returned from exile, all of whom belonged to Kohanim families. Ezra read them an unfamiliar version of the Torah. This version was different from the Torah of their fathers. Ezra did not write a new bible. Through the genius of his ‘editing&#x27;, he presented the religion in a new light.

==Ancient Rome==
Ancient Rome had several occupations for which the ability to write accurately and clearly was the primary qualification. The English word “scribe” derives from the Latin word &quot;scriba&quot;, a public notary or clerk. The public &quot;scribae&quot; were the highest in rank of the four prestigious occupational grades (&quot;decuriae&quot;) among the attendants of the Roman magistrates.

In the city of Rome, the &quot;scribae&quot; worked out of the state treasury and government archive. They received a good salary. &quot;Scribae&quot; were often former slaves and their sons; other literary or educated men who advanced to the job through patronage; or even men as highly ranked as the equestrian order. Among the writing duties of a &quot;scriba&quot; was the recording of sworn oaths on public tablets. The office afforded several advantages, including a knowledge of Roman law that was traditionally the privilege of the elite. People who needed legal documents drawn up and whose own literacy was low could make use of a public scribe. A &quot;scriba&quot; might also be a private secretary.

A &quot;tabellio&quot; (Greek &quot;agoraios&quot;) was a lower rank of scribe or notary who worked in civil service. A &quot;notarius&quot; was a stenographer.

An &quot;amanuensis&quot; was a scribe who took dictation and perhaps offered some compositional polish. &quot;Amanuenses&quot; were typically Greek and might be either male or female. Upper-class Romans made extensive use of dictation, and Julius Caesar was said to employ as many as four secretaries at once on different projects. The Apostle Paul, a Roman citizen literate in Greek, made use of an amanuensis for his epistles. It was considered impolite, however, to use a scribe for writing personal letters to friends; these were to be written by one&#x27;s own hand. The Vindolanda tablets (early 2nd century CE) from a fort in Roman Britain contain several hundred examples of handwriting; a few tablets stand out as having been written by professional scribes.

Some Roman households had libraries extensive enough to require specialized staff including &quot;librarii&quot;, copyists or scribes, who were often slaves or freedmen, along with more general librarians &quot;(librarioli)&quot;. Public libraries also existed under imperial sponsorship, and bookshops both sold books and employed independent &quot;librarii&quot; along with other specialists who constructed the scrolls. A copyist (&quot;librarius&quot; or &quot;libraria&quot;) was said to need an &quot;irrational knack&quot; for copying text accurately without slowing down to comprehend it. Some literary slaves specialized in proofreading.

Occasionally even senators took dictation or copied texts by hand for personal use, as did &quot;grammatici&quot; (“grammarians” or professors of higher education), but generally the routine copying of manuscripts was a task for educated slaves or for freedpersons who worked independently in bookshops. Books were a favored gift for friends, and since they had to be individually written out, &quot;deluxe&quot; editions, made from higher-grade papyrus and other fine materials, might be commissioned from intellectuals who also acted as editors. Unscrupulous copyists might produce and trade in unauthorized editions, sometimes passing them off as autograph manuscripts by famous authors.
The literacy of a &quot;librarius&quot; was also valued in business settings, where they might serve as clerks. For example, a &quot;libraria cellaria&quot; would be a woman who kept business records such as inventories. An early 2nd-century marble relief from Rome depicts a female scribe, seated on a chair and writing on kind of a tablet, facing the butcher who is chopping meat at a table.

Eleven Latin inscriptions uncovered from Rome identify women as scribes in the sense of copyists or amanuenses (not public &quot;scribae&quot;). Among these are Magia, Pyrrhe, Vergilia Euphrosyne, and a freedwoman whose name does not survive; Hapate, a shorthand writer of Greek who lived to the age of 25; and Corinna, a storeroom clerk and scribe. Three are identified as literary assistants: Tyche, Herma, and Plaetoriae.

==Europe in the Middle Ages==
===Monastic scribes===
In the Middle Ages, every book was made by hand. Specially trained monks, or scribes, had to carefully cut sheets of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. This was all accomplished in a monastic writing room called a scriptorium which was kept very quiet so scribes could maintain concentration. A large scriptorium may have up to 40 scribes working.

Scribes woke to morning bells before dawn and worked until the evening bells, with a lunch break in between. They worked every day except for the Sabbath. The primary purpose of these scribes was to promote the ideas of the Christian Church, so they mostly copied classical and religious works. The scribes were required to copy works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew whether or not they understood the language. These re-creations were often written in calligraphy and featured rich illustrations, making the process incredibly time-consuming. Scribes had to be familiar with the writing technology as well. They had to make sure that the lines were straight and the letters were the same size in each book that they copied. It typically took a scribe fifteen months to copy a Bible.

Such books were written on parchment or vellum made from treated hides of sheep, goats, or calves. These hides were often from the monastery&#x27;s own animals as monasteries were self-sufficient in raising animals, growing crops, and brewing beer. The overall process was too extensive and costly for books to become widespread during this period.

Although scribes were only able to work in daylight, due to the expense of candles and the rather poor lighting they provided, monastic scribes were still able to produce three to four pages of work per day. The average scribe could copy two books per year. They were expected to make at least one mistake per page.

During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, copying became more of a specialized activity and was increasingly performed by specialists. To meet expanding demand, the &quot;pecia&quot; system was introduced, in which different parts of the same text were assigned to hired copiers working both in and out of the monasteries.

===Female scribes===

Women also played a role as scribes in Anglo-Saxon England, as religious women in convents and schools were literate. Excavations at medieval convents have uncovered styli, indicating that writing and copying were done at those locations. Also, female pronouns are used in prayers in manuscripts from the late 8th century, suggesting that the manuscripts were originally written by and for female scribes.
In the 12th century within a Benedictine monastery at Wessobrunn, Bavaria there lived a female scribe named Diemut. She lived within the monastery as recluse and professional scribe. Two medieval book lists exist that have named Diemut as having written more than forty books. Fourteen of Diemut&#x27;s books are in existence today. Included in these are four volumes of a six volume set of Pope Gregory the Great&#x27;s &quot;Moralia in Job&quot;, two volumes of a three-volume Bible, and an illuminated copy of the Gospels. It has been discovered that Diemut was a scribe for as long as five decades. She collaborated with other scribes in the production of other books. Since the Wessobrunn monastery enforced its strict claustration it is presumed that these other scribes were also women. Diemut was credited with writing so many volumes that she single-handedly stocked the Wessobrunn&#x27;s library. Her dedication to book production for the benefit of the Wessobrunn monks and nuns eventually led to her being recognized as a local saint. At the Benedictine monastery within Admont, Austria it was discovered that some of the nuns had written verse and prose in both Latin and German. They delivered their own sermons, took dictation on wax tablets, and copied and illuminated manuscripts. They also taught Latin grammar and biblical interpretation at the school. By the end of the 12th century they owned so many books that they needed someone to oversee their scriptorium and library. Two female scribes have been identified within the Admont Monastery; Sisters Irmingart and Regilind.

There are several hundred women scribes that have been identified in Germany. These women worked within German women&#x27;s convent from the thirteenth to the early 16th century. Most of these women can only be identified by their names or initials, by their label as &quot;scriptrix&quot;, &quot;soror&quot;, &quot;scrittorix&quot;, &quot;scriba&quot; or by the colophon (scribal identification which appears at the end of a manuscript). Some of the women scribes can be found through convent documents such as obituaries, payment records, book inventories, and narrative biographies of the individual nuns found in convent chronicles and sister books. These women are united by their contributions to the libraries of women&#x27;s convents. Many of them remain unknown and unacknowledged but they served the intellectual endeavor of preserving, transmitting and on occasion creating texts. The books they left their legacies within were usually given to the sister of the convent and were dedicated to the abbess, or given or sold to the surrounding community. There are two obituaries that have been found that date back to the 16th century, both of the obituaries describe the women who died as a &quot;scriba&quot;. In an obituary found from a monastery in Rulle, describes Christina Von Haltren as having written many other books.
Women&#x27;s monasteries were different from men&#x27;s in the period from the 13th to the 16th century. They would shift their order depending on their abbess. If a new abbess would be appointed then the order would change their identity. Every time a monastery would shift their order they would need to replace, correct and sometimes rewrite their texts. Many books survived from this period. Approximately 4,000 manuscripts have been discovered from women&#x27;s convents from late medieval Germany. Women scribes served as the business women of the convent. They produced a large amount of archival and business materials, they recorded the information of the convent in the form of chronicles and obituaries. They were responsible for producing the rules, statutes and constitution of the order. They also copied a large amount of prayer books and other devotional manuscripts. Many of these scribes were discovered by their colophon.

Despite women being barred from transcribing Torah scrolls for ritual use, a few Jewish women between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries are known to have copied other Hebrew manuscripts. They learned the craft from male scribes they were related to, and were unusual because women were not typically taught Hebrew. Knowledge of these women scribes comes from their colophon signatures.

===Town scribe===

The scribe was a common job in medieval European towns during the 10th and 11th centuries. Many were employed at scriptoria owned by local schoolmasters or lords. These scribes worked under deadlines to complete commissioned works such as historic chronicles or poetry. Due to parchment being costly, scribes often created a draft of their work first on a wax or chalk tablet.

<doc id="69314" wikidata="Q669096" url="?curid=69314" title="Declaration of Geneva">
<text>The Declaration of Geneva was adopted by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association at Geneva in 1948, amended in 1968, 1983, 1994, editorially revised in 2005 and 2006 and amended in 2017.

It is a declaration of a physician&#x27;s dedication to the humanitarian goals of medicine, a declaration that was especially important in view of the medical crimes which had just been committed in German-occupied Europe. The Declaration of Geneva was intended as a revision of the Hippocratic Oath to a formulation of that oath&#x27;s moral truths that could be comprehended and acknowledged in a modern way. Unlike the case of the Oath of Hippocrates, the World Medical Association calls the statement a &quot;pledge&quot;.

==Creation==
During the post World War II era and immediately after its foundation, the World Medical Association (WMA) showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and all over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. The details of the Nazi Doctors&#x27; Trial at Nuremberg which ended August 1947 and the revelations about what the Imperial Japanese Army had done at Unit 731 in China during the war clearly demonstrated the need for reform, and for a re-affirmed set of guidelines regarding both human rights and the rights of patients.

A study committee was appointed to prepare a &quot;Charter of Medicine&quot; which could be adopted as an oath or promise that every doctor in the world would make upon receiving their medical degree or diploma. It took two years of intensive study of the oaths and promises submitted by member associations to draft a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates which was sent for consideration at the WMA&#x27;s second general assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the assembly agreed to name it the &quot;Declaration of Geneva.&quot; This document was adopted by the World Medical Association only three months before the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) which provides for the security of the person.

==Declaration==
The Declaration of Geneva (2017), as currently published by the World Medical Association
reads:
===Changes from original===
The original oath read &quot;My colleagues will be my brothers,&quot; later changed to &quot;sisters and brothers.&quot; Until 1994 it also read &quot;I will maintain the utmost respect for human life, from the time of its conception (...)&quot;. Age, disability, gender, and sexual orientation have been added as factors that must not interfere with a doctor&#x27;s duty to a patient; some rephrasing of existing elements has occurred. Secrets are to remain confidential &quot;even after the patient has died.&quot; The violation of &quot;human rights and civil liberties&quot; replaces the violation of &quot;the laws of humanity&quot; as a forbidden use of medical knowledge. &quot;The health&quot; in general of a patient is now the doctor&#x27;s first consideration compared to the &quot;health and life&quot; as stated in the original declaration. This was apparently changed to free the medical profession from extending life at all costs.
The 68th WMA General Assembly in October 2017 approved revisions including: respecting the autonomy of the patient; mutual respect for teachers, colleagues and students physicians to share medical knowledge for the benefit of their patients and the advancement of healthcare; a requirement for physicians to attend to their own health as well as their patients. Furthermore, the revised text is meant to be used by all active physicians (&quot;as member of the medical profession&quot;) while before the text was used by beginners only (&quot;At the time of being admitted as a member of the medical profession&quot;).

===Discussions of the declaration changes===
The Declaration of Geneva was originally adopted by the WMA General Assembly in 1948 right after one year of the formation of World Medical Association, and has undergone a series of amendments throughout the years, until 2006 and the latest amendments, made at the 68th WMA General Assembly in Chicago in October 2017, make several significant additions. The most notable addition was a result of ongoing lobbying by New Zealand doctors&#x27; well-being advocate Dr Sam Hazledine, of MedWorld; in order to provide a high standard of care to patients, doctors must look after their own health. 

The newly revised Declaration of Geneva, released in October 2017, contains some modifications in terms of words throughout but also three entirely new points:
* I WILL RESPECT the autonomy and dignity of my patient.
* I WILL SHARE my medical knowledge for the benefit of the patient and the advancement of healthcare.
* I WILL ATTEND TO my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard.

The new Geneva Declaration version acknowledges respect for human rights of patients, the value of sharing knowledge with the community and profession, and the right and obligation of physicians to care for themselves, and to maintain their abilities for the benefit of society.

<text>Sceva () was a Jew called a &quot;chief priest&quot; in , although whether he was a chief priest is disputed by some writers. Although there was no high priest in Jerusalem by this name, some scholars note that it was not uncommon for some members of the Zadokite clan (Sons of Zadok) to take on an unofficial high-priestly role, which may explain this moniker. However, it is more likely that he was an itinerant exorcist based on the use of the Greek term () &quot;going from place to place&quot; used in in relation to his so-called &quot;sons&quot;.

According to the book of Acts of the Apostles, he had seven sons who attempted to exorcise a demon from a man in the town of Ephesus by using the name of Jesus as an invocation. This practice is similar to the Jewish practice, originating in the Testament of Solomon, of invoking Angels to cast out demons. Because of the emphasis on healing and spiritual authority in the ministry of Sceva, it may be accurate to think of him as a Shaman figure for the Jewish communities in which he worked.

<doc id="69317" wikidata="Q149441" url="?curid=69317" title="Samaritan Pentateuch">
<text>The Samaritan Pentateuch, also called the Samaritan Torah (Samaritan Hebrew: , ), is the sacred scripture of the Samaritans. Written in the Samaritan script, it dates back to one of the ancient versions of the Torah that existed during the Second Temple period. It constitutes the entire biblical canon in Samaritanism.

Some 6,000 differences exist between the Samaritan and the Jewish Masoretic Text. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly 2,000 of these textual variations agree with the Koine Greek Septuagint, and some are shared with the Latin Vulgate. Throughout their history, Samaritans have used translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek, and Arabic, as well as liturgical and exegetical works based upon it.

It first became known to the Western world in 1631, proving the first example of the Samaritan alphabet and sparking an intense theological debate regarding its relative age versus the Masoretic Text. This first published copy, much later labelled as Codex B by , became the source of most Western critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch until the latter half of the 20th century; today the codex is held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Some Pentateuchal manuscripts discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls have been identified as bearing a &quot;pre-Samaritan&quot; text type.

==Origin and canonical significance==
===Samaritan traditions===

Samaritans believe that God authored their Pentateuch and gave Moses the first copy along with the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments. They believe that they preserve this divinely composed text uncorrupted to the present day. Samaritans commonly refer to their Pentateuch as (, &#x27;Truth&#x27;).

Samaritans include only the Pentateuch in their biblical canon. They do not recognize divine authorship or inspiration in any other book in the Jewish Tanakh. A Samaritan Book of Joshua partly based upon the Tanakh&#x27;s Book of Joshua exists, but Samaritans regard it as a non-canonical secular historical chronicle.

According to a view based on the biblical Book of Ezra (Ezra 4:11), the Samaritans are the people of Samaria who parted ways with the people of Judah (the Judahites) in the Persian period. The Samaritans believe that it was not they, but the Jews, who separated from the authentic stream of the Israelite tradition and law, around the time of Eli, in the 11th century BCE.

===Scholarly perspective===
Modern scholarship connects the formation of the Samaritan community with events which followed the Babylonian captivity. One view is that the Samaritans are the people of the Kingdom of Israel who separated from the Kingdom of Judah. Another view is that the event happened somewhere around 432 BCE, when Manasseh, the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, founded a community in Samaria, as related in the Book of Nehemiah 13:28 and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; by Josephus. Josephus, however, dates this event and the building of the temple at Shechem to the time of Alexander the Great. Others believe that the real schism between the peoples did not take place until Hasmonean times, when the Temple on Mount Gerizim was destroyed in 128 BCE by John Hyrcanus.

The script of the Samaritan Pentateuch, its close connections at many points with the Septuagint, and its even closer agreements with the present Masoretic Text, all suggest a date about 122 BCE. Excavation work undertaken since 1982 by Yitzhak Magen has firmly dated the temple structures on Gerizim to the middle of the 5th century BCE, built by Sanballat the Horonite, a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah, who lived more than 100 years before the Sanballat mentioned by Josephus.

The adoption of the Pentateuch as the sacred text of the Samaritans before their final schism with the Judean Jewish community provides evidence that it was already widely accepted as a canonical authority in that region.

==Comparison with other versions==
===Masoretic Text===
Manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch are written in a different script than the one used in the Masoretic Pentateuch. The Samaritan text is written with the Samaritan alphabet, derived from the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet used by the Israelite community prior to the Babylonian captivity. During the exile in Babylon, Jews adopted the Ashuri script, based on the Babylonians&#x27; Aramaic alphabet, which was developed into the modern Hebrew alphabet. Originally, all manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consisted of unvocalized text written using only the letters of the Samaritan alphabet. Beginning in the 12th century, some manuscripts show a partial vocalization resembling the Jewish Tiberian vocalization used in Masoretic manuscripts. More recently, manuscripts have been produced with full vocalization. The Samaritan Pentateuchal text is divided into 904 paragraphs. Divisions between sections of text are marked with various combinations of lines, dots or an asterisk; a dot is used to indicate the separation between words.

The &quot;London Polyglot&quot; lists 6,000 instances where the Samaritan Pentateuch differs from the Masoretic text. As different printed editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch are based upon different sets of manuscripts, the precise number varies significantly from one edition to another. Only a minority of such differences are significant. Most are simply spelling differences, usually concerning Hebrew letters of similar appearance; the use of more &quot;matres lectionis&quot; (symbols indicating vowels) in the Samaritan Pentateuch, compared with the Masoretic; different placement of words in a sentence; and the replacement of some verbal constructions with equivalent ones. A comparison between both versions shows a preference in the Samaritan version for the Hebrew preposition where the Masoretic text has .

The most notable substantial differences between both texts are those related to Mount Gerizim, the Samaritans&#x27; place of worship. The Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments includes the command that an altar be built on Mount Gerizim on which all sacrifices should be offered. The Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following paragraph, which is absent from the Jewish version:

Another important difference is in Deuteronomy 27:4. According to the Jewish text, the Israelites were told to enter the Promised Land and build an altar on Mount Ebal, while the Samaritan text says that such altar, the first built by the Israelites in the Promised Land, should be built on Mount Gerizim. A few verses afterwards, both the Jewish and the Samaritan texts contain instructions for the Israelites to perform two ceremonies upon entering the Promised Land: one of blessings, to be held on Mount Gerizim, and one of cursings, to take place on Mount Ebal. In 1946, the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, which include the oldest known versions of the Torah. In Deuteronomy 27:4–7, the Dead Sea scroll fragments bring &quot;Gerizim&quot; instead of &quot;Ebal&quot;, indicating that the Samaritan version was likely the original reading.

Other differences between the Samaritan and the Masoretic (Jewish) texts include:

* In Numbers 12:1, the Samaritan Pentateuch refers to Moses&#x27; wife as , which translates as &#x27;the beautiful woman&#x27;, while the Jewish version and the Jewish commentaries suggest that the word used was , meaning &#x27;black woman&#x27; or &#x27;Cushite woman&#x27;. For the Samaritans, therefore, Moses had only one wife, Zipporah, throughout his whole life, while Jewish sources generally understand that Moses had two wives, Zipporah and a second, unnamed Cushite woman.

* The Samaritan Pentateuch uses less anthropomorphic language in descriptions of God, with intermediaries performing actions that the Jewish version attributes directly to God. Where the Jewish text describes Yahweh as a &quot;man of war&quot; (Exodus 15:3), the Samaritan has &quot;hero of war&quot;, a phrase applied to spiritual beings. 
* In Numbers 23:4, the Samaritan text reads &quot;The Angel of God found Balaam&quot;, in contrast with the Jewish text, which reads &quot;And God met Balaam.&quot;

* In Genesis 50:23, the Jewish text says that Joseph&#x27;s grandchildren were born &quot;upon the knees of Joseph&quot;, while the Samaritan text says they were born &quot;in the days of Joseph&quot;.

* In about 34 instances, the Samaritan Pentateuch has repetitions in one section of text that was also found in other parts of the Pentateuch. Such repetitions are also implied or presupposed in the Jewish text, but not explicitly recorded in it. For example, the Samaritan text in the Book of Exodus on multiple occasions records Moses repeating to Pharaoh exactly what God had previously instructed Moses to tell him, which makes the text look repetitious, in comparison with the Jewish text. In other occasions, the Samaritan Pentateuch has subjects, prepositions, particles, appositives, including the repetition of words and phrases within a single passage, that are absent from the Jewish text.

===Septuagint and Latin Vulgate===
The Samaritan Torah contains frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. The Septuagint text agrees with the Samaritan version in approximately 1,900 of the 6,000 instances in which it differs from the Masoretic text. Many of these agreements reflect inconsequential grammatical details, but some are significant. For example, Exodus 12:40 in both the Samaritan and the Septuagint reads:

In the Masoretic text, the passage reads:

Passages in the Latin Vulgate also show agreements with the Samaritan version, in contrast with the Masoretic version. For instance, in Genesis 22:2, the Samaritan Pentateuch places the binding and near-sacrifice of Isaac in the &quot;land of Moreh&quot; (Hebrew: ), while the Jewish Pentateuch has &quot;land of Moriah&quot; (Hebrew: ). The Samaritan &quot;Moreh&quot; describes the region around Shechem and modern-day Nablus, where Mount Gerizim is situated, while Jews claim the land is the same as Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. The Vulgate translates this phrase as (&#x27;in the land of vision&#x27;) which implies that Jerome was familiar with the reading &#x27;Moreh&#x27;, a Hebrew word whose triliteral root suggests &#x27;vision.&#x27;

==Evaluations of its relevance for textual criticism==
The earliest recorded assessments of the Samaritan Pentateuch are found in rabbinic literature and the writings of the early Christian Church Fathers of the first millennium. The Talmud records Eleazar ben Simeon, a Rabbinic Jew, condemning the Samaritan scribes: &quot;You have falsified your Pentateuch... and you have not profited aught by it.&quot;

Some early Christian writers found the Samaritan Pentateuch useful for textual criticism. Cyril of Alexandria, Procopius of Gaza, and others spoke of certain words missing from the Hebrew Text but present in the Samaritan Pentateuch. Eusebius writes the &quot;Greek translation [of the Bible] also differs from the Hebrew, though not so much from the Samaritan&quot; and notes that the Septuagint agrees with the Samaritan Pentateuch in the number of years elapsed from Noah&#x27;s Flood to Abraham. Christian interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch fell into neglect during the Middle Ages.

The publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 17th-century Europe reawakened interest in the text and fueled a controversy between Protestants and Roman Catholics over which Old Testament textual traditions are authoritative. Roman Catholics showed a particular interest in the study of the Samaritan Pentateuch on account of the antiquity of the text and its frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. Some Catholics including Jean Morin argue that the Samaritan Pentateuch&#x27;s correspondences with the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint indicate that it represents a more authentic Hebrew text than the Masoretic. Several Protestants replied with a defense of the Masoretic text&#x27;s authority and argued that the Samaritan text is a late and unreliable derivation from the Masoretic.

The 18th-century Protestant Hebrew scholar Benjamin Kennicott&#x27;s analysis of the Samaritan Pentateuch stands as a notable exception to the general trend of early Protestant research on the text. He questioned the underlying assumption that the Masoretic text must be more authentic simply because it has been more widely accepted as the authoritative Hebrew version of the Pentateuch:We see then that as the evidence of one text destroys the evidence of the other and as there is in fact the authority of versions to oppose to the authority of versions no certain argument or rather no argument at all can be drawn from hence to fix the corruption on either side.Kennicott also states that the reading Gerizim may actually be the original reading, since that is the mountain for proclaiming blessings, and that it is very green and rich of vegetation (as opposed to Mount Ebal, which is barren and the mountain for proclaiming curses) amongst other arguments.

German scholar Wilhelm Gesenius published a study of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1815 which biblical scholars widely embraced during the next century. He argued that the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch share a common source in a family of Hebrew manuscripts which he named the &quot;Alexandrino-Samaritanus&quot;. In contrast to the proto-Masoretic &quot;Judean&quot; manuscripts carefully preserved and copied in Jerusalem, he regarded the Alexandrino-Samaritanus as having been carelessly handled by scribal copyists who popularized, simplified, and expanded the text. Gesenius concluded that the Samaritan text contained only four valid variants when compared to the Masoretic text.

In 1915, Paul Kahle published a paper which compared passages from the Samaritan text to Pentateuchal quotations in the New Testament and pseudepigraphal texts including the Book of Jubilees, the First Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses. He concluded that the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves &quot;many genuine old readings and an ancient form of the Pentateuch.&quot; 

Support for Kahle&#x27;s thesis was bolstered by the discovery of biblical manuscripts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which contain a text similar to the Samaritan Pentateuch. The Dead Sea Scroll texts have demonstrated that a Pentateuchal text type resembling the Samaritan Pentateuch goes back to the second century BCE and perhaps even earlier.

These discoveries have demonstrated that manuscripts bearing a &quot;pre-Samaritan&quot; text of at least some portions of the Pentateuch such as Exodus and Numbers circulated alongside other manuscripts with a &quot;pre-Masoretic&quot; text. One Dead Sea Scroll copy of the Book of Exodus, conventionally named 4QpaleoExodm, shows a particularly close relation to the Samaritan Pentateuch:The scroll shares all the major typological features with the SP, including all the major expansions of that tradition where it is extant (twelve), with the single exception of the new tenth commandment inserted in Exodus 20 from Deuteronomy 11 and 27 regarding the altar on Mount Gerizim.Frank Moore Cross has described the origin of the Samaritan Pentateuch within the context of his local texts hypothesis. He views the Samaritan Pentateuch as having emerged from a manuscript tradition local to the Land of Israel. The Hebrew texts that form the underlying basis for the Septuagint branched out from the Israelite tradition as Israelites emigrated to Egypt and took copies of the Pentateuch with them. Cross states that the Samaritan and the Septuagint share a nearer common ancestor than either does with the Masoretic, which he suggested developed from local texts used by the Babylonian Jewish community. His explanation accounts for the Samaritan and the Septuagint sharing variants not found in the Masoretic and their differences reflecting the period of their independent development as distinct local text traditions. On the basis of archaizing and pseudo-archaic forms, Cross dates the emergence of the Samaritan Pentateuch as a uniquely Samaritan textual tradition to the post-Maccabean age.

===Translations===
The Samaritan Targum, composed in the Samaritan variety of Western Aramaic, is the earliest translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch. Its creation was motivated by the same need to translate the Pentateuch into the Aramaic language spoken by the community which led to the creation of Jewish Targums such as Targum Onkelos. Samaritans have traditionally ascribed the Targum to Nathanael, a Samaritan priest who died . The Samaritan Targum has a complex textual tradition represented by manuscripts belonging to one of three fundamental text types exhibiting substantial divergences from one another. Affinities that the oldest of these textual traditions share with the Dead Sea Scrolls and Onkelos suggest that the Targum may originate from the same school which finalized the Samaritan Pentateuch itself. Others have placed the origin of the Targum around the beginning of the third century or even later. Extant manuscripts of the Targum are &quot;extremely difficult to use&quot; on account of scribal errors caused by a faulty understanding of Hebrew on the part of the Targum&#x27;s translators and a faulty understanding of Aramaic on the part of later copyists.

Scholia of Origen&#x27;s Hexapla and the writings of some church fathers contain references to &quot;the Samareitikon&quot; (), a work that is no longer extant. Despite earlier suggestions that it was merely a series of Greek scholia translated from the Samaritan Pentateuch, scholars now concur that it was a complete Greek translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch either directly translated from it or via the Samaritan Targum. It may have been composed for the use of a Greek-speaking Samaritan community residing in Egypt.

With the displacement of Samaritan Aramaic by Arabic as the language of the Samaritan community in the centuries following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, they employed several Arabic translations of the Pentateuch. The oldest was an adaptation of Saadia Gaon&#x27;s mid-900s &quot;Tafsir Rasag&quot; or Arabic targum of the Masoretic Text. Although the text was modified to suit the Samaritan community, it still retained many unaltered Jewish readings.

By the 11th or 12th century, a new Arabic translation directly based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch had appeared in Nablus. Manuscripts containing this translation are notable for their bilingual or trilingual character; the Arabic text is accompanied by the original Samaritan Hebrew in a parallel column and sometimes the Aramaic text of the Samaritan Targum in a third. Later Arabic translations also appeared; one featured a further Samaritan revision of Saadia Gaon&#x27;s translation to bring it into greater conformity with the Samaritan Pentateuch and others were based upon Arabic Pentateuchal translations used by Christians.

In April 2013, a complete English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch comparing it to the Masoretic version was published.

===Exegetical and liturgical texts===
Several biblical commentaries and other theological texts based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch have been composed by members of the Samaritan community from the fourth century CE onwards. Samaritans also employ liturgical texts containing catenae extracted from their Pentateuch.

==Manuscripts and printed editions==

=== Abisha Scroll ===
Samaritans attach special importance to the &quot;Abisha Scroll&quot; used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. It consists of a continuous length of parchment sewn together from the skins of rams that, according to a Samaritan tradition, were ritually sacrificed. The text is written in gold letters. Rollers tipped with ornamental knobs are attached to both ends of the parchment and the whole is kept in a cylindrical silver case when not in use. Samaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron (), thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun, although contemporary scholars describe it as a composite of several fragmentary scrolls each penned between the 12th and 14th centuries CE. Other manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consist of vellum or cotton paper written upon with black ink. Numerous manuscripts of the text exist, but none written in the original Hebrew or in translation predates the Middle Ages. The scroll contains a cryptogram, dubbed the &quot;tashqil&quot; by scholars, which Samaritans consider to be Abishua&#x27;s ancient colophon:
I am Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the Priest, unto them be accorded the grace of YHWH and His glory—I wrote this holy book at the entrance of the tabernacle on Mount Gerizim, in the year thirteen of the Israelites&#x27; possession of the Land of Canaan according to its boundaries [all] around; I praise YHWH.

===Western scholarship===

Interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch was awakened in 1616 when the traveler Pietro della Valle purchased a copy of the text in Damascus. This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library. In 1631, an edited copy of Codex B was published in Le Jay&#x27;s (Paris) Polyglot by Jean Morin. It was republished in Walton&#x27;s Polyglot in 1657. Subsequently, Archbishop Ussher and others procured additional copies which were brought to Europe and later, America.

===Modern publications===
Until the latter half of the 20th century, critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch were largely based upon Codex B. The most notable of these is &quot;Der Hebräische Pentateuch der Samaritaner&quot; (&quot;The Hebrew Pentateuch of the Samaritans&quot;) compiled by August von Gall and published in 1918. An extensive critical apparatus is included listing variant readings found in previously published manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch. His work is still regarded as being generally accurate despite the presence of some errors, but it neglects important manuscripts including the Abisha Scroll which had not yet been published at the time. Textual variants found in the Abisha scroll were published in 1959 by Federico Pérez Castro and between 1961 and 1965 by A. and R. Sadaqa in &quot;Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch – With Particular Stress on the Differences Between Both Texts&quot;. In 1976 L.F. Giron-Blanc published Codex Add. 1846, a Samaritan Pentateuch codex dating to 1100 CE in the critical edition &quot;Pentateuco Hebreo-Samaritano: Génesis&quot; supplemented with variants found in fifteen previously unpublished manuscripts. Certain recently published critical editions of Pentateuchal books take Samaritan variants into account, including D.L. Phillips&#x27; edition of Exodus.

The Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch has been edited and published at the beginning of the 21st century.

Several publications containing the text of the Samaritan Targum have appeared. In 1875, the German scholar Adolf Brüll published his (&quot;The Samaritan Targum to the Pentateuch&quot;). More recently a two volume set edited by Abraham Tal appeared featuring the first critical edition based upon all extant manuscripts containing the Targumic text.

<doc id="69319" wikidata="Q158129" url="?curid=69319" title="Victoria Island">
<text>Victoria Island () is a large island in the Arctic Archipelago that straddles the boundary between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories of Canada. It is the eighth-largest island in the world, and at in area, it is Canada&#x27;s second-largest island. It is nearly double the size of Newfoundland (), and is slightly larger than the island of Great Britain () but smaller than Honshu (). The western third of the island lies in the Inuvik Region of the Northwest Territories; the remainder is part of Nunavut&#x27;s Kitikmeot Region. The population of 2,168 is divided between two settlements, the larger of which is Cambridge Bay (Nunavut) and the other Ulukhaktok (Northwest Territories).

The island is named after Queen Victoria, the Canadian sovereign from 1867 to 1901 (though she first became Queen in 1837). The features bearing the name &quot;Prince Albert&quot; are named after her consort, Albert.

==History==
Victoria Island was inhabited by the Thule culture, with five prehistoric &quot;qamutiik&quot; (sleds) belonging to the Neoeskimo culture being found on the Wollaston Peninsula, dating to 1250–1573 AD. The Inuinnaqtun name for the island is &quot;Kitlineq&quot;, with the local Inuit people called &quot;Kitlinermiut&quot; (Copper Inuit).

In 1826 John Richardson was the first European to see the southwest coast and called it &quot;Wollaston Land&quot;. In 1839, Peter Warren Dease and Thomas Simpson followed its southeast coast and called it &quot;Victoria Land&quot;. A map published by John Barrow in 1846 shows a complete blank from these two lands north to &quot;Banks Land&quot; which is the north coast of Banks Island. In 1851 John Rae charted its entire south coast and connected the two &quot;lands&quot;. In 1850 and 1851 Robert McClure circumnavigated most of Banks Island, thereby separating it from the rest of Victoria Land. His men also charted the northwest and west coasts of Victoria Island.

One of Roald Amundsen&#x27;s men, Godfred Hansen, charted its east coast as far as Cape Nansen in 1905, and in 1916 and 1917 Storker T. Storkerson, of Vilhjalmur Stefansson&#x27;s Canadian Arctic Expedition, charted its northeast coast, sighting the Storkerson Peninsula.

In 2008 Clark Carter and Chris Bray became the first recorded people to walk across Victoria Island. Their first attempt at the trek in 2005 failed, so they returned and completed the remaining in 2008.

==Geography==

Viscount Melville Sound lies to the north, and the M&#x27;Clintock Channel and Victoria Strait lie eastward. On the west are Amundsen Gulf and Banks Island, which is separated from Victoria by a long sound called the Prince of Wales Strait. To the south (from west to east) lie the Dolphin and Union Strait, Austin Bay, Coronation Gulf and the Dease Strait.

The southern waterways, and sometimes the Prince of Wales Strait, form part of the disputed Northwest Passage which the Government of Canada claims are Canadian Internal Waters, while other nations state they are either territorial waters or international waters.

Victoria Island is an island of peninsulas, having a heavily indented coastline with many inlets. In the east, pointing northwards, is the Storkerson Peninsula, which ends with the Goldsmith Channel, the body of water separating Victoria from Stefansson Island. The Storkerson Peninsula is separated from the island&#x27;s north-central areas by Hadley Bay, a major inlet. Another, broad peninsula is found in the north, Prince Albert Peninsula. This ends at the Prince of Wales Strait. In the south, and pointing westwards, is the Wollaston Peninsula, separated from the island&#x27;s central areas by Prince Albert Sound.

The highest point of Victoria Island is in the Shaler Mountains in the north-central region. Located in the southeast, just north of Cambridge Bay, is Tahiryuaq (formerly Ferguson Lake). With an area of , it is the largest lake on the island.

It was said by Andrew Hund in his book, &quot;Antarctica and the Arctic Circle: A Geographic Encyclopedia of the Earth&#x27;s Polar Regions&quot;, that the island resembles a stylized maple leaf, the predominant symbol of Canada.

===Climate===
Victoria Island has a polar climate, with no month having an average temperature of or higher, and is listed as &quot;ET&quot; on the Köppen climate classification. Summers are typically cool and rainy, with pleasant days and chilly nights. Winters are cold, dark, and long, with October being the snowiest month. Snowfall and frosts are possible all year round. Rainfall is usually limited to the summer months, when the temperature shortly rises above freezing for a few months before dipping back down for another 9 months of winter. Springs are typically sunny but still very chilly. Autumns are short and crisp, with more frequent cloud cover starting to appear during August and with September being almost constantly cloudy.

At Cambridge Bay, the sun is continuously below the horizon, polar night, from approximately 30 November to 11 January and above the horizon, midnight sun, 19 May to 22 July.

==Biology==
The Dolphin-Union caribou herd locally known as Island Caribou are a migratory population of barren-ground caribou, &quot;Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus&quot;, that occupy Victoria Island in Canada&#x27;s High Arctic and the nearby mainland. They are endemic to Canada. They migrate across the Dolphin and Union Strait from their summer grazing on Victoria Island to their winter grazing area on the Nunavut-NWT mainland. It is unusual for North American caribou to seasonally cross sea ice and the only other caribou to do so are the Peary caribou, which are smaller in size and population, and also occur on Victoria Island.

Victoria Island contains the world&#x27;s largest island within an island within an island.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census the population of the island was 2,168; 1,760 in Nunavut and 408 in the Northwest Territories. Of the two settlements on the island the larger is Cambridge Bay, which lies on the south-east coast and is in Nunavut. Ulukhaktok is on the west coast and is in the Northwest Territories. Trading posts, such as Fort Collinson on the northwest coast, have long been abandoned.

<text>A sabbatical (from the Hebrew: (i.e., Sabbath); in Latin ; Greek: ) is a rest or break from work; &quot;an extended period of time intentionally spent on something that’s not your routine job.&quot;

The concept of the sabbatical is based on the Biblical practice of &quot;shmita&quot; (sabbatical year), which is related to agriculture. According to , Jews in the Land of Israel must take a year-long break from working the fields every seven years.

Starting with Harvard University in 1880, many universities and other institutional employers of scientists, physicians, and academics offer the opportunity to qualify for paid sabbatical as an employee benefit, called &quot;sabbatical leave&quot;. Early academic sabbatical policies were designed to aid their faculty in resting and recovering, but were also provided in order to facilitate &quot;advancements in knowledge in vogue elsewhere...an intellectual and practical necessity&quot; for both the professors and university education more broadly. Present-day academic sabbaticals typically excuse the grantee from day-to-day teaching and departmental duties, though progress on research is expected to continue or even increase while away. Academic sabbaticals come in the form of either semester-long or full-academic year terms.

A &quot;sabbatical&quot; has also come to mean a lengthy, intentional break from a career for non-academic professionals as well. There are very few norms and expectations for non-academic, or professional, sabbaticals. They can be paid or unpaid, affiliated with one&#x27;s employer or self-directed, and have a variety of durations, from several weeks to over a year.

A 2022 study of working professionals on extended leave identified three types of sabbaticals:

* Working Holidays - characterized by &quot;intense periods of work and dedicated breaks to rest and rekindle long-neglected relationships.&quot;
* Free Dives - during which participants &quot;leaped out of work and dove straight into intense exploration.&quot;
* Quests - which found people &quot;pushing their personal limits to discover themselves.&quot;

The popularity of sabbaticals for non-academics has increased in the 21st century: 17% of companies offered some sort of sabbatical policy to their employees in 2017, according to a survey by the Society For Human Resource Management.

Sabbaticals are also becoming more common in the medical profession, and are being used in intense subfields such as emergency medicine to reduce physician burnout.

<doc id="69323" wikidata="Q43432" url="?curid=69323" title="Justin Timberlake">
<text>Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and dancer. Dubbed the &quot;Prince of Pop&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; honored him as the best performing solo act on Pop Airplay and one of the Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century. Timberlake remains among the best-selling recording artists of all time, with sales of over 117 million records worldwide. His awards include ten Grammy Awards, four Primetime Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and MTV&#x27;s Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.

Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Timberlake appeared on musical television shows as a child, competing on &quot;Star Search&quot;; in the early to mid-1990s, he was a cast member on the Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, where he performed cover songs, skits, and choreography. While on the show, Timberlake worked with future bandmate JC Chasez, and the two rose to prominence in 1997 as the lead vocalists for the boyband NSYNC. The group released four commercially successful studio albums, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time with sales of over 70 million units worldwide.

Timberlake established himself as a solo artist with his first two albums, &quot;Justified&quot; (2002) and &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; (2006), both of which sold over 10 million copies and received triple platinum certification by the RIAA, with the latter becoming his first US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart number-one album. He further topped the chart on three more occasions, with &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot;, &quot;The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2&quot; (both 2013) and &quot;Man of the Woods&quot; (2018). &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot; became the best-selling album of the year. Throughout his career, Timberlake scored numerous high-charting US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles, including &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, &quot;SexyBack&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot;, &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot;, &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot;, &quot;Dick in a Box&quot;, &quot;Give It to Me&quot;, &quot;4 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Pusher Love Girl&quot;, &quot;Suit &amp; Tie&quot;, &quot;Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Feeling!&quot;, which earned him an Academy Award nomination.

Timberlake enhanced his popularity with an acting career. He landed starring roles in the films &quot;The Love Guru&quot; (2008), &quot;The Social Network&quot; (2010), &quot;Bad Teacher&quot; (2011), &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot; (2011), &quot;In Time&quot; (2011), &quot;Wonder Wheel&quot; (2017) and &quot;Palmer&quot; (2021). He also voiced Artie in &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007), Boo-Boo Bear in &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; (2010) and Branch in the &quot;Trolls&quot; franchise since 2016.

==Early life==
Justin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Janet Lynn (Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director. Timberlake has two half-brothers, Jonathan and Stephen, from Charles&#x27; second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth in 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album &quot;NSYNC&quot; as &quot;My Angel in Heaven&quot;.

His family circle includes several musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from country music artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Performing as a child, Timberlake sang country and gospel music: at the age of 11, he appeared on the television show &quot;Star Search&quot;, performing country songs as &quot;Justin Randall&quot;. By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.

From 1993 to 1995, he was a Mouseketeer on &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell. In 1995 Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, put together by Chris Kirkpatrick and financed by boy band manager Lou Pearlman, that eventually became NSYNC.

==Career==
===1995–2002: NSYNC===

The boy band NSYNC formed in 1995, and they began recording and performing in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers. In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and includes the single &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot;. The group had a series of legal battles with former manager Lou Pearlman, and they subsequently signed with Jive Records. They released their third studio album &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2000) which sold 2.4 million copies in the first week, becoming the fastest-selling album of all time. They held this record until 2015 when Adele surpassed the record with her third album &quot;25&quot;. No Strings Attached also includes the number one single &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, and &quot;This I Promise You&quot;. NSYNC&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Celebrity&quot; (2001) was also financially successful, selling 1.8 million copies in the first week and spawning top-five singles such as &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went on an indefinite hiatus in 2002. NSYNC performed at the Academy Awards in 2000, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. The band sold more than 70 million records worldwide, becoming the fifth-best selling boy band in history.

In 2000, Timberlake appeared in The Wonderful World of Disney movie &quot;Model Behavior&quot;. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model.

The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake&#x27;s actions in his memoir &quot;Out of Sync&quot;. By 2002, when the group went on an indefinite hiatus and members were doing individual projects, he partnered with Pharrell Williams of the producing team The Neptunes–and Timbaland to start working on new music. The idea of going solo was strengthened a year earlier. Timberlake originally wrote the single &quot;Gone&quot; around 2001 for Michael Jackson, but he turned the song down, and it was instead recorded by NSYNC. Before its release, however, Jackson contacted him. Timberlake declared in a later interview that the first time he felt confident to go solo happened after that conversation. In a retrospective article in 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; considered &quot;Celebrity&quot; &quot;the group&#x27;s swan song, setting the stage for Timberlake&#x27;s equally massive solo career&quot;.
===2002–2004: &quot;Justified&quot; and Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy===
In August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single &quot;Like I Love You&quot;; it peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. His debut solo studio album &quot;Justified&quot; was released in November and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous &#x27;N Sync releases. It sold over three million copies in the U.S. and more than ten million copies worldwide. Its R&amp;B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland, was complimented by music critics. About the musical direction of the record, he commented, &quot;I just want to do R&amp;B. It&#x27;s what I grew up listening to&quot;. The album spawned the top-five singles &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;.

In summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera co-headlined The Justified &amp; Stripped Tour. Later that year he recorded a song &quot;I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; It&quot;, used by McDonald&#x27;s as the theme to its &quot;I&#x27;m Lovin&#x27; It&quot; campaign. The deal with McDonald&#x27;s earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin&#x27; It Live was included with the deal, following his initial Justified World Tour. Timberlake was featured on Nelly&#x27;s song, &quot;Work It&quot;, which was remixed and included on Nelly&#x27;s 2003 remix album.

Near the end of 2002, Timberlake was the first celebrity to appear on &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, a &quot;candid camera&quot; type show created by Ashton Kutcher to trick celebrities. Timberlake, who cried during the episode, later admitted to being under the influence of cannabis when he was pranked. Three episodes later, he set up Kelly Osbourne to be &quot;punk&#x27;d&quot;, thus making him the first celebrity to appear on the show more than once. Timberlake later spoofed Ashton Kutcher and &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; in a 2003 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Timberlake co-starred in a skit titled &quot;The Barry Gibb Talk Show&quot; alongside comedian Jimmy Fallon, where the duo portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Fallon.

In February 2004, during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, broadcast on the CBS television network from Houston, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson&#x27;s black leather costume in a &quot;costume reveal&quot; meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson&#x27;s representative explained Timberlake intended &quot;to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. Part of the costume detached, and Jackson&#x27;s breast was briefly exposed. Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was &quot;sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...&quot; The phrase &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture. Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for &quot;Justified&quot; and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;). He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for &quot;Justified&quot;, and Record of the Year along with Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot; with The Black Eyed Peas.

===2004–2007: Acting and &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot;===
After the Super Bowl incident, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several films, having starred in a few feature films earlier in his career. The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in &quot;Edison Force&quot;, filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006. He also appeared in the films &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;, &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;, Richard Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Southland Tales&quot;, and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated film &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, released on May 18, 2007. He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John&#x27;s song &quot;This Train Don&#x27;t Stop There Anymore&quot;. Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the film version of the rock musical &quot;Rent&quot;, but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of &quot;Rent&quot;, so the role was reprised by Adam Pascal.

He continued to record with other artists. After &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot;, he again collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas on the 2005 track &quot;My Style&quot; from their album &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. When recording the 2005 single &quot;Signs&quot; with Snoop Dogg, Timberlake discovered a throat condition. Nodules were subsequently removed from his throat in an operation that took place on May 5, 2005. He was advised not to sing or speak loudly for at least a few months. In 2005, he began his own record company, JayTee records.

Timberlake released his second studio album, &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot;, on September 12, 2006. The album, which Timberlake created from 2005 to 2006, debuted at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, selling 684,000 copies its first week. It became the biggest album for pre-orders on iTunes, and beat Coldplay&#x27;s record for the biggest one-week sales of a digital album. The album was produced by Timbaland and Danja (who produced a bulk of the album), will.i.am, Rick Rubin and Timberlake himself, and features guest vocals by Snoop Dogg, Three 6 Mafia, T.I. and will.i.am. A studio representative described it as being &quot;all about sexiness&quot; and aiming for &quot;an adult feel&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;SexyBack&quot;, was performed by Timberlake at the opening of the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks. &quot;My Love&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, also produced by Timbaland and featuring rapper T.I., reached number-one on the Hot 100, as did third single &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot;. The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert. In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his film roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a &quot;dumb thing to do at this point&quot;. He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show where he sang &quot;SexyBack&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot; and &quot;LoveStoned&quot;.

Timberlake hosted many music events, including the European MTV Music Awards in 2006. On December 16, 2006, Timberlake hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, doing double duty as both host and musical guest for the second time. During this appearance, he and Andy Samberg performed an R&amp;B song for a skit titled &quot;Dick in a Box&quot;, which some radio stations aired as an unofficial single from Timberlake. Called &quot;one of the most iconic musical moments in the show&#x27;s history&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, it became a viral hit and one of the most viewed videos on YouTube at the time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the skit at number three on their &quot;50 Greatest &#x27;Saturday Night Live&#x27; Sketches of All Time&quot;. The song earned him an Emmy Award and was later featured on The Lonely Island&#x27;s debut album &quot;Incredibad&quot;.

In January 2007, Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour. Following singles off the album, &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows (Interlude)&quot; and &quot;Until the End of Time&quot;, peaked within the top 20 on the Hot 100, while the fourth single &quot;Summer Love&quot; reached the top 10. The song &quot;Give It to Me&quot;, a Timbaland single on which Timberlake guests with Nelly Furtado, reached the Hot 100 number-one spot. Eventually, &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s musical library and archive.

===2008–2012: Musical hiatus and focus on acting===
The song &quot;4 Minutes&quot; was first played by Timbaland at Philadelphia&#x27;s Jingle Ball on December 17, 2007. When released on March 17, 2008, &quot;4 Minutes&quot; was revealed to be a duet between Timberlake and Madonna, with backing vocals by Timbaland. It was lead single from Madonna&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Hard Candy&quot;, which featured four other song-writing collaborations with Timberlake, being also one of the executive producers. The single was an international hit, topping the charts in over 21 countries worldwide. Timberlake also appears in the music video, which was directed by Jonas &amp; François. On March 30, 2008, Timberlake performed the song at Madonna&#x27;s Hard Candy Promo Show at Roseland Ballroom in New York City.

Also in 2007, Timberlake made an appearance on 50 Cent&#x27;s third album &quot;Curtis&quot;. Timberlake, along with Timbaland, is featured on a track called &quot;Ayo Technology&quot;, which was the album&#x27;s fourth single. Also, another possible collaboration was to occur with Lil Wayne for his album &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; with Nelly Furtado and Timbaland. With the wrapping up of the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour of Australasia and the Middle East in November 2007, Timberlake resumed his film career. Projects underway early in 2008 were starring roles in Mike Myers&#x27; comedy &quot;The Love Guru&quot; (released June 20, 2008) and Mike Meredith&#x27;s drama &quot;The Open Road&quot; (released August 28, 2009).

The song was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Timberlake hosted the 16th ESPY Awards, and the musical number &quot;I Love Sports&quot; was later nominated for an Emmy award. Timberlake and his production team The Y&#x27;s, along with Mike Elizondo, produced and co-wrote the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; for Leona Lewis&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Echo&quot;, released on November 17, 2009.

===2013–2017: &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot;, &quot;2 of 2&quot;, and &quot;Trolls&quot;===

Timberlake began working on his third studio album &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot; in June 2012 with &quot;no rules and/or end goal in mind&quot;.

===2018–2022: &quot;Man of the Woods&quot; and Super Bowl LII halftime show===

Speaking of his fifth studio album in 2016, Timberlake stated, &quot;I think where I grew up in America has a lot of influence. Growing up in Tennessee—very central of the country—Memphis is known as the birthplace of rock &amp; roll, but also the home of the blues, but Nashville&#x27;s right down the street so there&#x27;s a lot of country music.&quot; In following interviews, Timberlake confirmed working with producers Timbaland and Pharrell Williams, while stating, &quot;It sounds more like where I&#x27;ve come from than any other music I&#x27;ve ever made... It&#x27;s Southern American music. But I want to make it sound modern – at least that&#x27;s the idea right now.&quot;

His fifth studio album &quot;Man of the Woods&quot; was released on February 2, 2018, two days before he headlined the Super Bowl LII halftime show in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 4, where Timberlake performed a medley of his songs featuring both the Tennessee Kids and the Minnesota Marching Band alongside him, as well as a duet of &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; with a video projection of late singer Prince on screen.

On January 30, he appeared on &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot; and held an &quot;intimate&quot; concert at Irving Plaza in New York City on January 31, his 43rd birthday. He appeared as the musical guest, where he performed &quot;Selfish&quot; on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; recorded in London on February 22, 2024, the night before he cancelled &quot;A&quot; &quot;One Night Only&quot; concert, to be held at the Roundhouse, London, on February 23, 2024. Timberlake was recovering from an illness. The promotional single &quot;Drown&quot; was released on February 23, 2024. Timberlake also appeared on Complex Networks &quot;Sneaker Shopping&quot; on March 11, 2024, and mentioned the release of his new album at the end of the video.

On March 13, 2024, in anticipation of the album release, Timberlake performed a one-off concert at The Wiltern in Los Angeles. The show featured a surprise reunion with his NSYNC bandmates, with the group playing a medley of hits and the new album track “Paradise.” Timberlake then performed on NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk series on March 15 for a half-hour-long concert. Timberlake also announced the release of a documentary showing the album&#x27;s creation process. The second single off the record, &quot;No Angels&quot;, was released on March 15, 2024, the same day as the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Everything I Thought It Was&quot; debuted at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, giving Timberlake his sixth consecutive top five album in the country.

In April 2024, Timberlake opened the iHeartRadio Music Awards, performing both singles off the album, &quot;Selfish&quot; and &quot;No Angels&quot;. Timberlake also promoted the album on the Forget Tomorrow World Tour, which began on April 29, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada. On February 23, 2024, Timberlake announced summer 2024 Europe tour dates. In March 2024, prior to the tour launching, Trace William Cowen of &quot;Complex&quot; reported that the Forget Tomorrow World Tour had become Timberlake&#x27;s fastest selling tour to date. They stated that the tour had amassed over $140 million globally in initial ticket sales from over 70 dates and that more than one million attendees are expected. Cowen concluded that &quot;Justin Timberlake&#x27;s Forget Tomorrow World Tour Is Set to Become His Biggest Yet.&quot; On May 20, 2024, &quot;Pollstar&quot; announced that nine additional shows were added due to &quot;overwhelming demand&quot; and reported that over 1 million tickets were already sold, becoming Timberlake&#x27;s fastest selling tour to date. The tour received generally positive reviews.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
In early 1999, Timberlake began dating fellow former &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; cast member and singer Britney Spears. Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002. Spears wrote in her 2023 memoir &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; that she became pregnant during their relationship and had an abortion in late 2000 after Timberlake said they were not prepared for parenthood and he did not want to be a father. In 2003, he briefly dated British singer Emma Bunton. In April 2003, he began a relationship with actress Cameron Diaz soon after they met at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship, the couple split in December 2006 shortly after she introduced him as a musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel. They became engaged in December 2011 and married on October 19, 2012, at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy. Their first child, a son, was born in April 2015. In July 2020, they had a second son.

=== Legal issues ===
Shortly after midnight on June 18, 2024, Timberlake was arrested in Sag Harbor, New York for driving while intoxicated (DWI). In addition to being charged with one count of DWI, Timberlake was issued two citations, one for running a stop sign and one for failure to keep in lane. He was released nine hours later following his first arraignment at Sag Harbor Village Justice Court. The Sag Harbor Police Department would later release his mugshot. Timberlake was scheduled to return to court on July 26, 2024. According to his arrest report, Timberlake alleged to authorities that he only had one martini shortly before he was pulled over. Despite making this claim, Timberlake refused a breathalyzer.

On June 22, 2024, bartender employees at the hotel where Timberlake was staying before his DWI arrest confirmed to &quot;People&quot; that he only had one martini while at the hotel bar. One employee stating that “If he was drinking more, it wasn&#x27;t here.&quot; However, according to the arrest report, the officer who pulled Timberlake over after he drove through a stop sign and failed to keep on the right side of the road stated that his &quot;eyes were bloodshot and glassy&quot; at the time, and that &quot;A strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests.&quot; During the stop, Timberlake reportedly said, &quot;this is going to ruin the tour.&quot; The officer asked &quot;what tour?&quot; And Timberlake replied with &quot;the world tour.&quot; That exchange went viral, spawning several memes. Despite the arrest, Timberlake still continued to perform concerts, including a concert in Chicago on June 21, 2024, where he appeared to address the arrest, saying &quot;We&#x27;ve been through ups and downs and lefts and rights... It&#x27;s been a tough week - but you&#x27;re here, and I&#x27;m here...I know sometimes I&#x27;m hard to love, but you keep on loving me and I love you right back.&quot;

Timberlake, who was performing overseas in Poland, would not attend his July 26, 2024 court arraignment, with his lawyer Edward Burke attending instead. Despite Burke&#x27;s arguments that Timberlake was not intoxicated at the time of his arrest, Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace ordered for Timberlake to be re-arraigned on August 2. For the August 2 arraignment, Timberlake, who was still on tour, appeared virtually from Antwerp, Belgium. During this arraignment, Timberlake pled not guilty to a revised misdemeanor charge of driving drunk. Irace also agreed to review Burke&#x27;s motion to dismiss the DWI charge. However, Timberlake&#x27;s New York license was suspended by the judge for an indeterminate amount of time.

Timberlake was scheduled to have another hearing on August 9, 2024. In contrast to the August 2 hearing, Timberlake was not required to attend this court hearing. On September 11, 2024, it was revealed that Timberlake would plead guilty to a less serious traffic offense during his September 13 court appearance, with the DWI charge being dropped. Under his plea deal, Timberlake agreed to plead guilty to driving while impaired, a lesser offense which carries a penalty of a $300 to $500 fine and a 90-day driver license suspension.

On September 13, 2024, during an in-person appearance at the Sag Harbor Village Justice Courthouse, Timberlake pled guilty to a noncriminal driving while impaired traffic violation. Irace then sentenced Timberlake to a $500 fine with a $260 surcharge, 25 hours of community service at the nonprofit of his choosing and required him to make a public safety announcement. It also revealed that Timberlake&#x27;s refusal to take a breathlyzer automatically triggered a suspension of his driver&#x27;s license under New York state law.

===Residences===
In July 2002, Timberlake purchased a mansion in Hollywood Hills for $8.3 million from Helen Hunt. In 2010, Timberlake purchased a unit at 311 West Broadway in SoHo, formerly owned by Oscar de la Renta, for $6.56 million. He sold the unit in 2018 for $6.35 million, incurring a loss.

In 2015, Timberlake bought a house in the Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana. In May 2017, Timberlake and his wife, Jessica Biel, paid $20.2 million for a penthouse unit at 443 Greenwich Street in Tribeca, Manhattan.

===Earnings===
&quot;Forbes&quot; began reporting on Timberlake&#x27;s earnings in 2008, calculating that he earned $44 million between June 2007 and June 2008 for his music, tour, commercials, and hospitality, making him the world&#x27;s 4th best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion. That year, he was ranked twelfth on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100 list and second on the &quot;Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30&quot; list.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, Timberlake was the third highest-paid musician of 2013, with earnings of $31 million. He was ranked 26th with earnings of $57 million on the Celebrity 100 list for 2014, and 19th on the 2015 list with $63 million. Timberlake was listed at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Money-Makers List of 2014.

He was ranked 41st on the 2019 Celebrity 100 list by &quot;Forbes&quot;, with earnings of $57.5 million in 2019.

==Artistry==
Timberlake possesses a lyric tenor vocal range. He began including beatboxing in his records near the end of his boyband era and into his emergence as a solo act with &quot;Justified&quot; and &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot;. Many of his songs draw from his personal life and relationships, such as &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; (about his breakup with Britney Spears). Described by critics as a &quot;consummate showman&quot;, Timberlake usually plays guitar, piano and keyboard in his shows. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake&#x27;s crossover appeal after his performance with Chris Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards.

Primarily an R&amp;B album, his 2002 debut &quot;Justified&quot; also includes influence from dance-pop, funk and soul music. Timberlake has described it as influenced by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. For the album&#x27;s supporting tour Justified and Stripped Tour, he co-headlined with Christina Aguilera, drawing praise from Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for his comfort in performing as part of a package.

His 2006 followup album &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; departed from his earlier work to explore a broader sound, with elements of rap, rock, funk, soul, gospel, new wave, opera, and world music. During production, Timberlake was interested in musical techniques associated with rock music, which inspired his approach to recording. He described the album as drawing from David Bowie and Prince. Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence, Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.

Timberlake&#x27;s next album, &quot;The 20/20 Experience&quot; (2013) is a neo soul album partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. Mikael Wood of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found its elaborate structures ambitious in the vein of Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Michael Jackson. He supported the album with a pair of tours: Legends of the Summer, which he co-headlined with Jay-Z, and The 20/20 Experience World Tour. These tours introduced his backing ensemble, the Tennessee Kids, a 15-piece multi-instrumentalist throwback to big band music.

==Public image==
Timberlake&#x27;s fashion and style evolution, from &quot;boy-band synchronized wardrobe days&quot; to &quot;a notable source of fashion inspiration to men all over&quot;, has been noticed by the media. As noted by a &quot;Billboard&quot; editor, &quot;Since his solo career began with the 2002 release of debut album &quot;Justified&quot;, Timberlake has honed his unique sense of style&quot;, while citing Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Frank Sinatra as style influences: &quot;guys who were just really never trying to be that [stylish], they just were that&quot;. According to American fashion designer Tom Ford, who has dressed Timberlake since 2011 and created more than 600 exclusive pieces for The 20/20 Experience World Tour, Timberlake &quot;has a kind of effortless cool that makes classic menswear tailoring modern&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; editor Sia Michel wrote in 2007, &quot;Since his last tour, for 2002&#x27;s multiplatinum &quot;Justified&quot;, he has learned how to project sex-symbol edge&quot; adding &quot;he&#x27;s a rock star who can commit.&quot; Napster&#x27;s founder Sean Parker, portrayed by Timberlake in &quot;The Social Network&quot;, stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think I look anything like Timberlake, but it&#x27;s not so bad being played by a sex symbol.&quot; In Nielsen Music&#x27;s U.S. report for 2015, Timberlake led the &quot;Top 10 Musicians Among Millennials&quot; list. His high-profile relationships earned him the nickname &quot;Trousersnake&quot;, a reference to his allegedly big penis. Wax statues of Timberlake are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in New York, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Nashville, Berlin, Amsterdam, and London. His costume used in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit &quot;Dick in a Box&quot; is displayed at &quot;Saturday Night Live: The Exhibition&quot; in New York.

After New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011, he voiced his support for LGBT equality in the U.S., stating, &quot;We&#x27;re people and we&#x27;re different, all of us. And we should be using our differences to bring ourselves closer together.&quot; Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel received the Inspiration Award at the GLSEN Respect Awards in 2015, with the executive director saying, &quot;They are two vocal and committed allies to the LGBT community who are also devoted to charitable works that improve the lives of youth.&quot;

Timberlake&#x27;s pronunciation of the word &quot;me&quot; on &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; was popularized as an internet meme titled &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be May&quot;, after a Tumblr image of Timberlake was posted in 2012 with the respective caption. The meme eventually became an annually recurring joke throughout the month of April, which gained the attention of Barack Obama and Timberlake himself. Influenced by the national attention received by Timberlake&#x27;s selfie inside a voting booth shared on Instagram during the 2016 presidential election, which was at the moment an illegal act, Senator Brian Kelsey of Germantown, Tennessee brought up a bill that would allow taking photos in voting poll stations, with some exceptions against bad procedures. It was later approved by the Tennessee Senate.

In June 2021, Timberlake spoke out in support of Britney Spears during her court battle over her conservatorship. Timberlake wrote on his Twitter that &quot;No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body [...] [Jessica Biel] and I send our love, and our absolute support to Britney during this time. We hope the courts, and her family make this right and let her live however she wants to live&quot;.

===Controversies===

Following the release of &quot;Framing Britney Spears&quot;, public attention was brought to old comments Timberlake made in 2002 to describe his relationship with Britney Spears following their breakup, with some considering them to contain misogynistic rhetoric. It also led to renewed interest in his participation in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, where he exposed Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast on live television. Following much public pressure, Timberlake issued a public apology on his Instagram page, writing he &quot;benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism&quot; and &quot;I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again.&quot; He finished by saying &quot;I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better and I will do better&quot;.

Public scrutiny surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII incident was raised when a stylist alleged that the plan was originally for Timberlake to step on the back of Jackson&#x27;s dress &quot;to reveal her butt in this pearl g-string&quot; but that he changed the plan to exposing her breast because he wanted a &quot;reveal&quot; to &quot;one-up&quot; Britney Spears&#x27; and Madonna&#x27;s kiss at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The claim that Timberlake wanted the breast reveal, however, is contradictory to a statement from Salli Frattini, the producer of the Halftime show, who stated in 2018 that the production team experimented with removing elements of clothing in rehearsal to reveal Jackson&#x27;s skirt without nudity but that the idea was ultimately nixed. According to Frattini, it was Jackson&#x27;s team who pitched the idea to Timberlake prior to the show that led to Jackson&#x27;s breast being exposed.

== Legacy ==

Timberlake has been referred to as the &quot;President of Pop&quot; and &quot;Prince of Pop&quot; by contemporary journalists. In a 2016 article of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, editor Scott Feinberg stated Timberlake is &quot;widely regarded as one of the greatest all-around entertainers in the history of show business&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the biggest pop star of the year and featured him on the magazine&#x27;s cover, commenting that he &quot;attained the one thing most pop stars don&#x27;t, and the one thing he wanted more than anything else: credibility&quot;. For &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; his second studio album, &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot;, &quot;redefined pop&#x27;s cutting edge&quot;; for &quot;Vibe&quot; it &quot;pushed boundaries more forcefully&quot; than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV&#x27;s editor Jason Lipshutz stated it &quot;changed the game. [The album] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. It had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You have to go back to 1979 for &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, to find a pop album with a first half that matches up.&quot; He was ranked 66th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. Timberlake appeared for the first time on the Time 100 list of most influential people by &quot;Time&quot; in 2007. In 2013, he made his second appearance on the 100 list, with Stevie Wonder writing &quot;Justin has accomplished a lot at a young age, taking advantage of all the possibilities, and yet he&#x27;s found time to give of himself too—he gets and gives back. He has a spirit. He does God&#x27;s work through using the most of his talent.&quot;

&quot;Justified&quot;&#x27;s single &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; was ranked at number 20 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 100 Best Songs of the 2000s, and one of their 500 greatest songs of all time. &quot;Billboard&quot; editor Jason Lipshutz named the song&#x27;s music video &quot;one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century&quot;. His second album &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; was placed at 46 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 100 Best Albums of the 2000s, the ninth best album of the decade for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and the greatest of the decade for &quot;Vibe&quot;. The lead single, &quot;SexyBack&quot;, helped introduce EDM sounds to top 40 radio, as it brought together variations of electronic dance music with Timberlake&#x27;s R&amp;B tone. Aside from earning critical acclaim for its parent album, Sia Michel of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that he was responsible for popularizing in 2006 the catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;m bringing sexy back&quot;.

Considered a pop icon by media outlets, his work has influenced numerous artists, including Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, Olly Murs, Maroon 5, Britney Spears, Lorde, Marilyn Manson, Joe Jonas, Thomas Rhett, Ed Sheeran, Jason Derulo, Tori Kelly, Liam Payne, Bridgit Mendler, Hunter Hayes, BoA, Seungri, Taeyang, Rain, Lloyd Banks, Maluma, Rosalía, and Jungkook. Bieber and Nick Jonas have cited him as one of their role models, with the latter stating is for &quot;not only transitioning from where he started, but also balancing acting and singing&quot;. Christian hip hop artist tobyMac has stated Timberlake&#x27;s work inspires him, commenting &quot;he&#x27;s setting himself up to be a classic, making decisions and moving on them. That&#x27;s a great place to be.&quot; In the context of male artists that achieved commercial success after leaving their boy bands, Brittany Spanos from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;Timberlake and Michael Jackson set a high bar for what could be attained by solo success in that they not only scored numerous number-one hits but they also crafted the mold for what it meant to be a male pop star&quot;, while for &quot;Variety&quot;″s Jeremy Blacklow the singer is &quot;the modern case study&quot;. Multiple music publications have deemed &quot;Justified&quot; as the standard for post boy-band solo albums and teen pop stars seeking credibility. &quot;Billboard&quot; critics discussed in 2018 whether Timberlake is &quot;the Best Male Pop Star of the 21st century;&quot; those in favor named his crossover appeal, career longevity, showmanship and credibility within the industry among the reasons.

On November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour announced that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a six handicap, would become the host of the tour&#x27;s Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake&#x27;s agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament. The activity was a success and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake&#x27;s contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the U.S. during 2009, and worth over $US9 million. However, in 2012, the event&#x27;s chair Raoul Frevel told reporters Timberlake would no longer be involved in the event: &quot;We tried everything we could to get him more involved with our kids and the hospitals. But it seemed that when the TV cameras weren&#x27;t on, he disappeared.&quot;
Timberlake often participates in the American Century Championship and the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Both annual tournaments raise money for a range of national and local non-profits.

In late 2012, Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel volunteered in Far Rockaway, Queens over the weekend after Hurricane Sandy. Joined by their friend Timbaland, the couple helped distribute backpacks of supplies to members of the community who were still struggling after the hurricane.

Timberlake has donated items for auction for several charities, including by Ten O&#x27;Clock Classics and MusiCares. In 2010, Timberlake participated in the Hope for Haiti Now telethon performing &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. The cover was made available for digital download with all proceeds donated to organizations doing relief work in Haiti. In 2016, Timberlake was featured in a new version of &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot;. The proceeds of the charity single will go to educational programs. In 2017, Timberlake and Eminem helped raise over $2 million for Manchester Arena bombing victims.

=== Book ===
Timberlake&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Hindsight &amp; All the Things I Can&#x27;t See In Front of Me&quot;, was released on October 30, 2018. The book covers some on and off camera candid images, the singer&#x27;s early life and inspiration for songs. According to publisher HarperCollins, &quot;Hindsight&quot; includes a &quot;collection of anecdotes, reflections, and observations on his life and work&quot;.

<text>The United Arab Emirates (UAE), or simply the Emirates, is a country in West Asia, in the Middle East, at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a federal elective monarchy made up of seven emirates, with Abu Dhabi serving as its capital. It shares land borders with Oman to the east and northeast, and with Saudi Arabia to the southwest; as well as maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran, and with Oman in the Gulf of Oman. , the UAE has an estimated population of over 10 million, of which 11% are Emiratis; Dubai is its most populous city and is an international hub. Islam is the official religion and Arabic is the official language, while English is the most spoken language and the language of business.

The United Arab Emirates oil and natural gas reserves are the world&#x27;s seventh and seventh-largest, respectively. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country&#x27;s first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The country has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). In the 21st century, the UAE has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The UAE is considered a middle power. It is also a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, World Trade Organization, and BRICS. The UAE is also a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Human rights organisations consider the UAE substandard on human rights, ranking only 6.06 in the human freedom index, citing reports of government critics being imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, expression, and the freedom of the press are severely repressed.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

Stone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from Africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago. In time, lively trading links developed with civilisations in Mesopotamia, Iran, and the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. This contact persisted and became wider, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains, which commenced around 3,000 BCE. Sumerian sources talk of the Magan civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman.

There are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the region before Islam, which include the Hafit period from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE, the Umm Al Nar culture from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE, and the Wadi Suq culture from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. From 1,200 BCE to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive Iron Ages and the Mleiha period, the area was variously occupied by the Achaemenids and other forces, and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the &quot;falaj&quot; irrigation system.

===Islam===
The spread of Islam to the northeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to the rulers of Oman in 630 CE. This led to a group of rulers travelling to Medina, converting to Islam, and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids, who dominated the coast at the time. Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders. Caliph Abu Bakr sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory (the Ridda Wars) with the Battle of Dibba in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost. This assured the integrity of the Caliphate and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging Rashidun Caliphate.

In 637, Julfar (in the area of today&#x27;s Ras Al Khaimah) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the Sasanian Empire. The area of the Al Ain/Buraimi Oasis was known as Tu&#x27;am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.

The earliest Christian site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as Sir Bani Yas Island and which dates back to the seventh century. Thought to be Nestorian and built in 600 CE, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 CE. It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity, which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 CE following trade routes. Certainly, by the fifth century, Oman had a bishop named John – the last bishop of Oman being Etienne, in 676 CE.

=== Portuguese era ===

The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the &quot;versatile tribesman&quot;, nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture, and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the Bani Yas and Al Bu Falah of Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Liwa, and the west coast; the Dhawahir, Awamir, Al Ali, and Manasir of the interior; the Sharqiyin of the east coast; and the Qawasim to the north.

With the expansion of European colonial empires, Portuguese, English, and Dutch forces appeared in the Persian Gulf region. By the 18th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi, while the Northern Al Qawasim (Al Qasimi) dominated maritime commerce. The Portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements, building forts in the wake of the bloody 16th-century conquests of coastal communities by Albuquerque and the Portuguese commanders who followed him – particularly on the east coast at Muscat, Sohar, and Khor Fakkan.

The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British as the &quot;Pirate Coast&quot;, as boats of the Al Qawasim federation harassed British-flagged shipping from the 17th century into the 19th. The charge of piracy is disputed by modern Emirati historians, including the current ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan Al Qasimi, in his 1986 book &quot;The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf&quot;.

British expeditions to protect their Indian trade routes led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast, including the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 and the more successful campaign of 1819. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a maritime truce, giving rise to the term Trucial States, which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and in 1853, the Perpetual Maritime Truce was agreed. To this was added the &#x27;Exclusive Agreements&#x27;, signed in 1892, which made the Trucial States a British protectorate.

Under the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.

In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at Khor Al Adaid and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans. Khor Al Adaid was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, Percy Cox, confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan (&#x27;Zayed the Great&#x27;), that Khor Al Adaid belonged to his sheikhdom.

=== British era and discovery of oil ===

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pearling industry thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The First World War had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl, that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.

In 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement, which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC&#x27;s operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.
The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council, and appointed Adi Al Bitar, Dubai&#x27;s Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum&#x27;s legal advisor, as secretary general and legal advisor to the council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed. The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The Trucial Oman Scouts was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.

In 1953, a subsidiary of BP, D&#x27;Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later Total) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer Jacques Cousteau. In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg, Germany, and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama rock formation. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the Fateh oilfield off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).

Meanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the United Kingdom represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the Buraimi Oasis. A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi border dispute, but this has not been ratified. The UAE&#x27;s border with Oman was ratified in 2008.

PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif. In 1962, PDTC became the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals, and roads. When Dubai&#x27;s oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern global city of Dubai.

=== Independence ===
By 1966, it had become clear that the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect the Trucial States, what is now the United Arab Emirates. British Members of Parliament (MPs) debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government&#x27;s decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath, to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates. The British Labour government rejected the offer. After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.

Fears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the Tunb islands. The islands were taken by force, civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion. A destroyer group approached the island of Abu Musa as well. But there, Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi had already negotiated with the Iranian shah, and the island was quickly leased to Iran for $3 million a year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi.

Originally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates, Bahrain became independent in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, both emirates became fully independent. On 2 December 1971, six of the emirates (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain) agreed to enter into a union named the United Arab Emirates. Ras al-Khaimah joined later, on 10 January 1972. In February 1972, the Federal National Council (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers. The UAE joined the Arab League on 6 December 1971 and the United Nations on 9 December. It was a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council in May 1981, with Abu Dhabi hosting the first GCC summit.

=== Post-Independence period ===

The UAE supported military operations by the US and other coalition states engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan (2001) and Saddam Hussein in Ba&#x27;athist Iraq (2003) as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi. The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch. The country had already signed a military defence agreement with the U.S. in 1994 and one with France in 1995. In January 2008, France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March 2011.

On 2 November 2004, the UAE&#x27;s first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, died. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the president of the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded Sheikh Khalifa as crown prince of Abu Dhabi. In January 2006, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, died, and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assumed both roles.

The first ever national elections were held on 16 December 2006. A number of voters chose half of the members of the Federal National Council. The UAE has largely escaped the Arab Spring, which other countries have experienced; however, 60 Emirati activists from Al Islah were apprehended for an alleged coup attempt and the attempt of the establishment of an Islamist state in the UAE. Mindful of the protests in nearby Bahrain, in November 2012 the UAE outlawed online mockery of its government or attempts to organise public protests through social media.

On 29 January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the UAE. Two months later, in March, the government announced the closure of shopping malls, schools, and places of worship, in addition to imposing a 24-hour curfew, and suspending all Emirates passenger flights. This resulted in a major economic downturn, which eventually led to the merger of more than 50% of the UAE&#x27;s federal agencies.

On 29 August 2020, the UAE established normal diplomatic relations with Israel and with the help of the United States, they signed the Abraham Accords with Bahrain.

On 9 February 2021, the UAE achieved a historic milestone when its probe, named &quot;Hope&quot;, successfully reached Mars&#x27;s orbit. The UAE became the first country in the Arab world to reach Mars, the fifth country to successfully reach Mars, and the second country, after an Indian probe, to orbit Mars on its maiden attempt.

On 14 May 2022, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the UAE&#x27;s new president after the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

== Geography ==
The United Arab Emirates is situated in the Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia; it is in a strategic location slightly south of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for world crude oil.

The UAE lies between 22°30&#x27; and 26°10&#x27; north latitude and between 51° and 56°25′ east longitude. It shares a border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a border with Oman on the southeast and northeast. The land border with Qatar in the Khor Al Adaid area is about in the northwest; however, it is a source of ongoing dispute. Following Britain&#x27;s military departure from the UAE in 1971, and its establishment as a new state, the UAE laid claim to Iranian-occupied islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs, when Iran captured them during the British rule, resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved. The UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of Qatar. The largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, accounts for 87% of the UAE&#x27;s total area, . The smallest emirate, Ajman, encompasses only .

The UAE coast stretches for nearly along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, briefly interrupted by an isolated outcrop of the Sultanate of Oman. Six of the emirates are situated along the Persian Gulf, and the seventh, Fujairah, is on the eastern coast of the peninsula with direct access to the Gulf of Oman. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend inland. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the Al Bāţinah coast of the Gulf of Oman. The Musandam Peninsula, the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, and Madha are exclaves of Oman separated by the UAE.
South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About to the northeast of Liwa is the Al-Buraimi oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. Lake Zakher in Al Ain is a human-made lake near the border with Oman that was created from treated waste water.

Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British interventions, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the Western Hajar Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.

=== Biodiversity ===

The UAE contains the following terrestrial ecoregions: Al Hajar montane woodlands and shrublands, Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert, and Al-Hajar foothill xeric woodlands and shrublands.

The oases grow date palms, acacia, and eucalyptus trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on Sir Bani Yas Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, Arabian Oryx, Arabian camel, and leopards. Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel, perch, and tuna, as well as sharks and whales.

=== Climate ===
The climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The climate is categorized as desert climate. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above on the coastal plain. In the Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation. Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between . During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e. &quot;Easterner&quot;) makes the coastal region especially unpleasant. The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than , but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches . Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the winter months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds. The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility.

On 28 December 2004, snow was recorded in the UAE for the first time, in the Jebel Jais mountain cluster in Ras al-Khaimah. A few years later, there were more sightings of snow and hail. The Jebel Jais mountain cluster has experienced snow only twice since records began.

== Government and politics ==


=== Government ===
The United Arab Emirates is a federal constitutional monarchy made up from a federation of seven hereditary tribal monarchy-styled political units called Sheikhdoms. It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the ruling Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah, and Umm Al Quwain. All responsibilities not granted to the federal government are reserved to the individual emirate. A percentage of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE&#x27;s central budget.

The UAE uses the title Sheikh instead of Emir to refer to the rulers of individual emirates. The title is used due to the sheikhdom styled governing system in adherence to the culture of tribes of Arabia, where Sheikh means leader, elder, or the tribal chief of the clan who partakes in shared decision making with his followers. The president and vice president are elected by the Federal Supreme Council. Usually, the Head of the Al Nahyan family, who are based in Abu Dhabi, holds the presidency and the Head of the Al Maktoum family, based in Dubai, the prime ministership. All prime ministers but one have served concurrently as vice president.
The federal government is composed of three branches:
* Legislative: A unicameral Federal Supreme Council and the advisory Federal National Council (FNC).
* Executive: The President, who is also commander-in-chief of the military, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers.
* Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts.

The UAE e-Government is the extension of the UAE federal government in its electronic form. The UAE&#x27;s Council of Ministers () is the chief executive branch of the government presided over by the prime minister. The prime minister, who is appointed by the Federal Supreme Council, appoints the ministers. The Council of Ministers is made up of 22 members and manages all internal and foreign affairs of the federation under its constitutional and federal law. In December 2019, the UAE became the only Arab country, and one of only five countries in the world, to attain gender parity in a national legislative body, with its lower house 50 per cent women.

The UAE is the only country in the world that has a Ministry of Tolerance, a Ministry of Happiness, and a Ministry of Artificial Intelligence. The UAE also has a virtual ministry called the Ministry of Possibilities, designed to find solutions to challenges and improve quality of life. The UAE also has a National Youth Council, which is represented in the UAE cabinet by the Minister of Youth.

The UAE legislative body is the Federal National Council which convenes nationwide elections every four years. The FNC consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates. Each emirate is allocated specific seats to ensure full representation. Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates, and the other half are elected. By law, the council members have to be equally divided between males and females. The FNC is restricted to a largely consultative role.

The United Arab Emirates is an authoritarian federal monarchy. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the UAE is &quot;an autocracy with the sheen of a progressive, modern state&quot;. The UAE has been described as a &quot;tribal autocracy&quot; where the seven constituent monarchies are led by tribal rulers in an autocratic fashion. There are no democratically elected institutions, and there is no formal commitment to free speech. According to human rights organisations, there are systematic human rights violations, including the torture and forced disappearance of government critics. The UAE ranks poorly in freedom indices measuring civil liberties and political rights. The UAE is annually ranked as &quot;Not Free&quot; in Freedom House&#x27;s annual &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; report, which measures civil liberties and political rights. The UAE also ranks poorly in the annual Reporters without Borders&#x27; Press Freedom Index. The Bertelsmann Transformation Index describes the UAE as a &quot;moderate monarchy&quot;. The country was ranked 91 out of 137 states and is far below the average scoring for development towards a democracy. According to the 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices, the United Arab Emirates is the third least electoral democratic country in the Middle East.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The United Arab Emirates comprises seven emirates. The Emirate of Dubai is the most populous emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population lives in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

Abu Dhabi has an area of , which is 86.7% of the country&#x27;s total area, excluding the islands. It has a coastline extending for more than and is divided for administrative purposes into three major regions. The Emirate of Dubai extends along the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE for approximately . Dubai has an area of , which is equivalent to 5% of the country&#x27;s total area, excluding the islands. The Emirate of Sharjah extends along approximately of the UAE&#x27;s Persian Gulf coastline and for more than into the interior. The northern emirates which include Fujairah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, and Umm al-Qaiwain all have a total area of . There are two areas under joint control. One is jointly controlled by Oman and Ajman, the other by Fujairah and Sharjah.

There is an Omani exclave surrounded by UAE territory, known as Wadi Madha. It is located halfway between the Musandam peninsula and the rest of Oman in the Emirate of Sharjah. It covers approximately and the boundary was settled in 1969. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khor Fakkan-Fujairah road, barely away. Within the Omani exclave of Madha, is a UAE exclave called Nahwa, also belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange.

=== Foreign relations ===

The United Arab Emirates has broad diplomatic and commercial relations with most countries and members of the United Nations. It plays a significant role in OPEC, and is one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The UAE is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies (ICAO, ILO, UPU, WHO, WIPO), as well as the World Bank, IMF, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the Non-Aligned Movement. Also, it is an observer in the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Most countries have diplomatic missions in the capital Abu Dhabi with most consulates being in UAE&#x27;s largest city, Dubai.

Emirati foreign relations are motivated to a large extent by identity and relationship to the Arab world. The United Arab Emirates has strong ties with Bahrain, China, Egypt, France, India, Jordan, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.

Following the British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to three islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran, namely Abu Musa, Greater Tunb, and Lesser Tunb. The UAE tried to bring the matter to the International Court of Justice, but Iran dismissed the notion. Pakistan was the first country to formally recognise the UAE upon its formation. The UAE alongside multiple Middle Eastern and African countries cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in June 2017 due to allegations of Qatar being a state sponsor of terrorism, resulting in the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Ties were restored in January 2021. The UAE recognized Israel in August 2020, reaching a historic Israel–United Arab Emirates peace agreement and leading towards full normalization of relations between the two countries.

UAE is the 53rd most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.

Gulf Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, are showing interest in engaging with Syria&#x27;s new leadership to promote political transition and address regional concerns. By engaging with Syria&#x27;s new leadership, Gulf states hope to counterbalance Turkish influence in the region. Additionally, the UAE leadership see the change in Syria as an opportunity to undermine Iranian influence in the Levant. The hope is to help push Iran out of Syria and cut its pathways between Iraq and Lebanon.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On 14 January 2025, the UAE signed an economic partnership agreement with Kenyan President William Ruto to boost Emirati investments in Kenya and increase trade beyond $3 billion. Observers noted that Kenya, which maintained neutrality in Sudan’s conflict, offered a platform to the UAE-backed Rapid Support Forces shortly after. On 18 February 2025, Nairobi hosted a meeting that included the RSF militia and its allies, who signed a charter and agreed to establish a parallel government in Sudan. The meeting was criticized by Sudan’s government, which was excluded from the closed-door signing ceremony, accusing Kenya of threatening Sudan’s unity. Meanwhile, the UAE media defended Kenya’s role, highlighting its aim to promote peace. Analysts speculated whether the UAE’s partnership with Kenya was coincidental or part of its broader strategy in Africa. Sudanese politician Dr. Ahmed Maglad also warned Kenya to save itself from the UAE and the RSF, stating that “the UAE will destroy Kenya like Sudan, Libya, Congo, Yemen and Central Africa.” 

=== Military ===
The armed forces of the United Arab Emirates consist of 44,000 active personnel in the Army, 2,500 personnel and 46 ships in the Navy, 4,500 personnel and 386 aircraft in the Air Force, and 12,000 personnel in the Presidential Guard. In 2022 the country spent US$20.4 billion on defense, which is 4% of its GDP. The UAE is considered to have the most capable military among the Gulf states.

Although initially small in number, the UAE armed forces have grown significantly over the years and are presently equipped with some of the most modern weapon systems, purchased from a variety of western military advanced countries, mainly France, the US, and the UK. Most officers are graduates of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with others having attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Australia, and St Cyr, the military academy of France. France and the United States have played the most strategically significant roles with defence cooperation agreements and military material provision.

Some of the UAE military deployments include an infantry battalion to the United Nations UNOSOM II force in Somalia in 1993, the 35th Mechanised Infantry Battalion to Kosovo, a regiment to Kuwait during the Iraq War, demining operations in Lebanon, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, American-led intervention in Libya, American-led intervention in Syria, and the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. The active and effective military role, despite its small active personnel, has led the UAE military to be nicknamed as &quot;Little Sparta&quot; by United States Armed Forces Generals and former US defense secretary James Mattis.

The UAE intervened in the Libyan Civil War in support of General Khalifa Haftar&#x27;s Libyan National Army in its conflict with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).

Examples of the military assets deployed include the enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Libya by sending six UAEAF F-16 and six Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter aircraft, ground troop deployment in Afghanistan, 30 UAEAF F-16s and ground troops deployment in Southern Yemen, and helping the US launch its first airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria.

The UAE has begun production of a greater amount of military equipment, in a bid to reduce foreign dependence and help with national industrialisation. Example of national military development include the Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding company (ADSB), which produces a range of ships and is a prime contractor in the Baynunah Programme, a programme to design, develop, and produce corvettes customised for operation in the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The UAE is also producing weapons and ammunition through Caracal International, military transport vehicles through Nimr LLC, and unmanned aerial vehicles collectively through Emirates Defence Industries Company. The UAE operates the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon F-16E Block 60 unique variant unofficially called &quot;Desert Falcon&quot;, developed by General Dynamics in collaboration with the UAE and specifically for the United Arab Emirates Air Force. The United Arab Emirates Army operates a customized Leclerc tank and is the only other operator of the tank aside from the French Army. The largest defence exhibition and conference in the Middle East, International Defence Exhibition, takes place biennially in Abu Dhabi.

The UAE introduced a mandatory military service for adult males, since 2014, for 16 months to expand its reserve force. The highest loss of life in the history of UAE military occurred on Friday 4 September 2015, in which 52 soldiers were killed in Marib area of central Yemen by a Tochka missile which targeted a weapons cache and caused a large explosion.

=== Law ===


The United Arab Emirates has a federal court system, and the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Ras Al Khaimah also have local court systems. The UAE&#x27;s judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction in Muslim family law matters, while civil courts deal with all other legal matters. Since September 2020, corporal punishment is no longer a legal form of punishment under UAE federal law. Under the decree, legal forms of punishment are retribution and blood money payments, capital punishment, life imprisonment, temporary imprisonment, indefinite detention, and fines. Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code was amended in 2020 to state that Islamic Law applies only to retribution and blood money punishments; previously the article stated that &quot;provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money.&quot; Before 2020, flogging, stoning, amputation, and crucifixion were technically legal punishments for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex, and drug or alcohol use. In recent history, the UAE has declared its intention to move towards a more tolerant legal code, and to phase out corporal punishment altogether in favor of private punishment. With alcohol and cohabitation laws being loosened in advance of the 2020 World Expo, Emirati laws have become increasingly acceptable to visitors from non-Muslim countries.

Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Muslim family law matters such as marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Muslim women must receive permission from a male guardian to marry and remarry. This requirement is derived from Sharia law and has been federal law since 2005. It is illegal for Muslim women to marry non-Muslims and is punishable by law. Non-Muslim expatriates were liable to Sharia rulings on marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance, however, federal law was changed to introduce non-Sharia personal status law for non-Muslims. Recently, the emirate of Abu Dhabi opened a civil law family court for non-Muslims and Dubai has announced that non-Muslims can opt for civil marriages.

Apostasy is a technically capital crime in the UAE, however, there are no documented cases of apostates being executed. Blasphemy is illegal; expatriates involved in insulting Islam are liable for deportation.

Sodomy is illegal and is punishable by a minimum of 6-month imprisonment or a fine or both, but the law does not apply &quot;except on the basis of a complaint from the husband or legal guardian&quot;, but the penalty may be suspended if the complaint is waived. In 2013, an Emirati man was on trial for being accused of a &quot;gay handshake&quot;.

Due to local customs, public shows of affection in certain public places are illegal and could result in deportation, but holding hands is tolerated. Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public. In several cases, the courts of the UAE have jailed women who have reported rape. Federal law in the UAE prohibits swearing on social media. Dancing in public is illegal in the UAE. In November 2020, UAE announced that it decriminalised alcohol, lifted the ban on unmarried couples living together, and ended lenient punishment on honor killing. Foreigners living in the Emirates were allowed to follow their native country&#x27;s laws on divorce and inheritance.

Despite the Sharia laws that restrict gambling tools and machines in the UAE, the country granted its first commercial gaming operator&#x27;s licence to Wynn Resorts that was developing a luxury resort, including a casino component, at Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah. In September 2023, the UAE established the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), hinting towards its plans to legalize gambling. The GCGRA has outlined a comprehensive framework that includes licenses for casinos, slot machines, and poker tables, as well as lotteries, internet gaming, and sports wagering. The GCGRA emphasizes responsible gaming, requiring operators to implement socially responsible gaming programs and undergo audits every two years. These programs include player education, responsible marketing, employee training, and evaluation plans to measure their effectiveness. Gaming operators must have a &quot;qualifying domestic entity&quot; in the UAE, defined as any UAE company with substantial business operations in the jurisdiction. The GCGRA also mandates player management tools, including deposit limits and cooling-off periods for online gaming.

The first lottery license has been granted to The Game LLC, operating under the banner of the &#x27;UAE Lottery&#x27;. This move supersedes existing lottery operators like Mahzooz and Big Ticket, which are no longer legally permitted to offer their services. Players are required to engage only with licensed gaming operators to avoid severe penalties. The regulations also specify that operators must enable players to restrict themselves from online gaming platforms for a period of at least 72 hours upon request. This is part of the broader initiative to ensure a secure and responsible commercial gaming environment in the UAE.

The UAE&#x27;s move to legalize gaming is seen as a strategic step to enhance its tourism and entertainment sector, leveraging its existing infrastructure and business-friendly environment. This development is expected to attract major gaming operators and contribute significantly to the country&#x27;s economy.

The country does not have any formal gaming laws, and therefore the project details about the casino were not completely made public. Local citizens are not permitted for gambling, which remains a legal and cultural taboo.

=== Human rights ===

The state security apparatus in the UAE has been accused of human rights abuses including forced disappearance, arbitrary arrests and torture. The annual Freedom House report on Freedom in the World has listed the United Arab Emirates as &quot;Not Free&quot; every year since 1999, the first year for which records are available on their website. Freedom of association is also severely curtailed. Associations and NGOs are required to register with the government; however twenty non-political groups were reportedly operating in the country without registration. All associations have to be submitted to censorship guidelines and all publications have first to be approved by the government. In its 2013 Annual Report, Amnesty International criticized the UAE&#x27;s poor record on human rights issues; highlighting restrictions of freedom of speech and assembly, the use of arbitrary arrest and torture, and the use of the death penalty.

The UAE has escaped the Arab Spring; and since 2011, human rights organizations claim that the government has increasingly carried out forced disappearances. The Arab Organization for Human Rights obtained testimonies from defendants who claimed being kidnapped, tortured and abused in detention centres; they reported 16 methods of torture including beatings, threats with electrocution and denial of medical care. Repressive measures, including deportation, were applied on foreigners based on allegations of attempts to destabilize the country. The issue of sexual abuse among female domestic workers is another area of concern, particularly given that domestic servants are not covered by the UAE labour law of 1980 or the draft labour law of 2007. Worker protests have been suppressed and protesters imprisoned without due process.

Amnesty International reported that Qatari men have been abducted by the UAE government and allegedly withheld information about the men&#x27;s fate from their families. According to some organizations, over 4,000 Shia expatriates have been deported from the UAE; including Lebanese Shia families for their alleged sympathies for Hezbollah. In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government; a relative of a defendant was arrested for tweeting about the trial, and sentenced to 10 months in jail. The latest forced disappearance involves three sisters from Abu Dhabi.

Sara Jacobs held foreign actors, including the UAE, responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. She expressed her views in March 2024 visit to the refugee camps, stating the children in Sudan are living with extensive trauma. The US representative also claimed that the war could be quickly ended if the involvement of countries like the UAE is stopped. Jacobs also said that the US is morally obligated to take measures and stop the arms to the Emirates, until the UAE stops providing weapons to the RSF.

On 29 March 2024, Sudan filed a 78-page formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), accusing the UAE of planning and backing the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militias&#x27; against the Sudanese army. The Emirates was allegedly taking assistance from Chad, which acted as a channel for military supplies and mercenaries to reach RSF in Sudan. Human rights organizations pointed out that Sudan&#x27;s conflict was among the &quot;world&#x27;s worst humanitarian crisis&quot;, while foreign nations like the UAE continued to supply weapons and equipment to the warring parties. Reports also revealed that the Emirates claimed of carrying out a humanitarian campaign to provide aid for Sudanese people. In fact, it was expanding a covert operation of funneling weapons, money and even powerful drones for the militias in Sudan. Officials said the UAE was playing the most consequential role by inflaming the crisis, while pledging to ease it. In October 2024, Sudan wrote a second official letter to the UNSC, calling for it to take strong action against the UAE&#x27;s continued aggression towards Sudan. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry also claimed that the UAE is not just an indirect supported of RSF, but rather a &quot;vicious frontline player in the war of aggression&quot; against Sudan.

In December 2024, ECDHR highlighted UAE&#x27;s human rights issues and absence of judicial independence, mainly focusing on unfair trials leading defendants to face barbaric detention conditions. Such trials are often held in secrecy and the defendants&#x27; lawyers are neglected from accessing case files and court documents. The UAE&#x27;s 2014 Counter-Terrorism Law is used to enforce travel bans, life imprisonment and even death penalty for peaceful critics of the regime and those managing an organization. ECDHR stated that the UAE&#x27;s counterterrorism law represses freedom of expression and called for the Emirati government to amend it. Pointing that the country&#x27;s judicial system requires more transparency and independence, the rights organization said that an independent committee must be set up to review all allegations of torture, incommunicado detention, and unfair trials.&lt;br&gt;

In January 2025, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report highlighting the human rights abuses committed by the UAE in 2024, majorly focusing on the unfair mass trial. It pointed out to the case involving multiple significant violations, where 44 individuals who were part of “UAE94” were unjustly convicted and sentenced on terrorism-related charges. HRW criticized the UAE&#x27;s use of Federal Penal Code and the Cybercrime Law to silence government critics, journalists, dissidents and activists, while restricting their freedom of expression. In July 2024, Emirati authorities sentenced 57 Bangladeshi to life imprisonment, over protests in the UAE against their home government. The report accused the UAE of whitewashing its image by hosting major global events like COP28, which faced criticism for its ongoing contribution to fossil fuel production and human rights violations. It also raised concerns about the UAE&#x27;s role in arming and supporting RSF in the conflict in Sudan, meanwhile violating the UN arms embargo. HRW urged the UNSC to renew and enforce the Sudan 1591 sanctions, and to impose sanctions on violators, including those in the UAE.

=== Migrant workers ===

Migrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions or go on strike. Those who strike may risk prison and deportation, as seen in 2014 when dozens of workers were deported for striking. The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour.

In 2019, an investigation performed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; revealed that thousands of migrant construction workers employed on infrastructure and building projects for the UAE&#x27;s Expo 2020 exhibition were working in an unsafe environment. Some were even exposed to potentially fatal situations due to cardiovascular issues. Long hours in the sun made them vulnerable to heat strokes.

A report in January 2020 highlighted that the employers in the United Arab Emirates have been exploiting the Indian labor and hiring them on tourist visas, which is easier and cheaper than work permits. These migrant workers are left open to labor abuse, where they also fear reporting exploitation due to their illegal status. Besides, the issue remains unknown as the visit visa data is not maintained in both the UAE and Indian migration and employment records.
In a 22 July 2020 news piece, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported human rights groups as saying conditions had deteriorated because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many migrant workers racked up debt and depended on the help of charities. The report cited salary delays and layoffs as a major risk, in addition to overcrowded living conditions, lack of support and problems linked with healthcare and sick pay. Reuters reported at least 200,000 workers, mostly from India but also from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Nepal, had been repatriated, according to their diplomatic missions.

On 2 May 2020, the Consul General of India in Dubai, Vipul, confirmed that more than 150,000 Indians in the United Arab Emirates registered to be repatriated through the e-registration option provided by Indian consulates in the UAE. According to the figures, 25% of applicants lost their jobs and nearly 15% were stranded in the country due to lockdown. Besides, 50% of the total applicants were from the state of Kerala, India.

On 9 October 2020, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that many migrant workers were left abandoned, as they lost their jobs amidst the tightening economy due to COVID-19.

Various human rights organisations have raised serious concerns about the alleged abuse of migrant workers by major contractors organising Expo 2020. UAE&#x27;s business solution provider German Pavilion is also held accountable for abusing migrant workers.

=== Environmental policy ===

The country is a leading oil and gas producer. Its energy consumption per capita is around 370 Gigajoule. The UAE&#x27;s carbon dioxide emissions per capita are high, ranking sixth among countries globally. Recently, it made efforts to make itself more sustainable. Those include:

* Setting a target to reduce GHG emissions by 31% in comparison to business scenario by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.
* Launching a program to make the 3 most emissions-intensive sectors, 40% more energy efficient.
* Launching some programs related to green building. Retrofitting of 30,000 buildings alone, should cut 1 million tons emissions.
* Promoting public transport and more.

According to official sources, in Dubai, &quot;the share of mass transport in people&#x27;s mobility increased from 6 per cent in 2006 to 20.61 per cent in 2022.&quot; Together with the USA the country invested 17 billion dollars in sustainable agriculture.

== Economy ==


The United Arab Emirates has developed from a juxtaposition of Bedouin tribes to one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest states in only about 50 years, boasting one of the highest GDP (PPP) per capita figures in the world. Economic growth has been impressive and steady throughout the history of this young confederation of emirates with brief periods of recessions only, e.g. in the global financial and economic crisis years 2008–09, and a couple of more mixed years starting in 2015 and persisting until 2019. Between 2000 and 2018, average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was at close to 4%. It is the second largest economy in the GCC (after Saudi Arabia), with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414.2 billion, and a real GDP of 392.8 billion constant 2010 USD in 2018. Since its independence in 1971, the UAE&#x27;s economy has grown by nearly 231 times to 1.45 trillion AED in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to 1.2 trillion AED, a growth by around 28 times from 1981 to 2012. Supported by the world&#x27;s seventh-largest oil reserves and aided by prudent investments coupled with a resolute commitment to economic liberalism and strong governmental oversight, the UAE has witnessed its real GDP increase by more than three times over the past four decades. Presently, the UAE is among the wealthiest countries globally, with GDP per capita nearly 80% higher than the OECD average.

As impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies – where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.

Between 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.

As for competitiveness, in June 2024 it was reported that the UAE has moved up three place to the 7th place among the top 10 countries in the IMD World Competitiveness. This ranking is issued by the World Competitiveness Centre of the Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland.

=== Business and finance ===
The UAE is ranked as the 26th best country in the world for doing business by the Doing Business 2017 Report published by the World Bank Group. The UAE are in the top ranks of several other global indices, such as the World Economic Forum&#x27;s (WEF), Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), the World Happiness Report (WHR), and 32nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) assigns the UAE rank two regionally in terms of business environment and 22 worldwide. From the 2018 Arab Youth Survey, the UAE emerges as the top Arab country in areas such as living, safety and security, economic opportunities, and starting a business, and as an example for other states to emulate.

The weaker points remain the level of education across the UAE population, limitations in the financial and labour markets, barriers to trade and some regulations that hinder business dynamism. The major challenge for the country, though, remains translating investments and strong enabling conditions into innovation and creative outputs.

UAE law does not allow trade unions to exist. The right to collective bargaining and the right to strike are not recognised, and the Ministry of Labour has the power to force workers to go back to work. Migrant workers who participate in a strike can have their work permits cancelled and be deported. Consequently, there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis – and other GCC Arabs – getting preference in public sector jobs despite lesser credentials than competitors and lower motivation. In fact, just over eighty per cent of Emirati workers hold government posts, with many of the rest taking part in state-owned enterprises such as Emirates airlines and Dubai Properties. Western states, including the United Kingdom, were also warned by the Emirati Trade Minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, to keep politics separate from trade and the economy, as it dilutes the agreements&#x27; main objectives. In 2023, Al Zeyoudi indicated that these countries should &quot;tone down&quot; the human and workers&#x27; rights provisions in the trade deals, in order to gain greater market access and business opportunities.

The UAE&#x27;s monetary policy stresses stability and predictability. The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) keeps a peg to the US Dollar (USD) and moves interest rates close to the Federal Funds Rate.

According to Fitch Ratings, the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 – which the UAE currency complies to – have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the economy.
Since 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018, growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy, the government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 2018. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the government&#x27;s expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.

The UAE has an attractive tax system for companies and wealthy individuals, making it a preferred destination for companies seeking tax avoidance. The NGO Tax Justice Network places them in 2021 in the group of the ten largest tax havens. In 2023, the UAE&#x27;s legal system fell under international scrutiny, as the members of the British Parliament opened an inquiry into how the foreign business executives are treated in the country, in case of accusations of breaking the law.

2024 will be the third consecutive year that the UAE holds first place as the world&#x27;s leading wealth magnet, as 6,700 wealthy migrants are set to move to the country.

The UAE government implemented value-added tax (VAT) in the country from January 1, 2018, at a standard rate of 5%.
While the government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE&#x27;s main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.

=== Energy ===


Oil and gas production is an important part of the economy of the UAE. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The UAE leadership initiated economic diversification efforts even before the oil price crash in the 1980s, resulting in the UAE having the most diversified economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region at present. Although the oil and gas sector continues to be significant to the UAE economy, these efforts have yielded great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. The introduction of the VAT has provided the government with an additional source of income – approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) – affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total government revenue.

The Barakah nuclear power plant is the first on the Arabian peninsula and expected to reduce the carbon footprint of the country.

The UAE has solar generation potential, and its energy policy has shifted due to the declining price of solar. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy aims to provide 7 per cent of Dubai&#x27;s energy from clean energy sources by 2020. It will increase this target to 25 per cent by 2030 and 75 per cent by 2050.

In 2023, ADNOC and its CEO Sultan Al Jaber closed at least 20 business deals worth nearly $100 billion. The state oil firm was alleged of exploiting the UAE&#x27;s COP28 presidency to pursue oil and gas deals. As per leaked documents, Al Jaber&#x27;s team targeted 16 nations to lobby firms, delegates or ministers on such deals. ADNOC sought deals with companies from 12 countries, which included 11 of the 16 target nations. Al Jaber and senior ADNOC officials openly discussed deals. COP28 organising teams were excluded from meetings and replaced by ADNOC officials, leaving a closed group that made deals.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy. Dubai is the top tourism destination in the Middle East. According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world. Dubai holds up to 66% share of the UAE&#x27;s tourism economy, with Abu Dhabi having 16% and Sharjah 10%. Dubai welcomed 10 million tourists in 2013.

The UAE has the most advanced and developed infrastructure in the region. Since the 1980s, the UAE has been spending billions of dollars on infrastructure. These developments are particularly evident in the larger emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The northern emirates are rapidly following suit, providing major incentives for developers of residential and commercial property.

The inbound tourism expenditure in the UAE for 2019 accounted for 118.6 per cent share of the outbound tourism expenditure. Since 6 January 2020, tourist visas to the United Arab Emirates are valid for five years. It has been projected that the travel and tourism industry will contribute about 280.6 billion United Arab Emirati dirham to the UAE&#x27;s GDP by 2028.

The country&#x27;s major tourist attraction includes the famous Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest tower in the world; The World archipelago and Palm Jumeirah also in Dubai; Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi; Al Hajar Mountains in Fujairah. The uniqueness of the country&#x27;s natural desert life, especially with the Bedouins, also facilitates the country&#x27;s tourist industry.

=== Transport ===
Dubai International Airport became the busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic in 2014, overtaking London Heathrow. Abu Dhabi International Airport is the second-largest airport in the UAE. Due to the announced expansion of Al Maktoum Airport on 28 April 2024, Dubai International Airport will be shut down once Al Maktoum Airport expansion will be completed.

Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Ras Al Khaimah are connected by the E11 highway, which is the longest road in the UAE. In Dubai, in addition to the Dubai Metro, The Dubai Tram and Palm Jumeirah Monorail also connect specific parts of the city. There is also a bus, taxi, abra (traditional boat), and water taxi network run by RTA. T1, a double-decker tram system in Downtown Dubai, were operational from 2015 to 2019.

Salik, meaning &quot;open&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;, is Dubai&#x27;s electronic toll collection system that was launched in July 2007 and is part of Dubai&#x27;s traffic congestion management system. Each time one passes through a Salik tolling point, a toll is deducted from the drivers&#x27; prepaid toll account using advanced Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. There are four Salik tolling points placed in strategic locations in Dubai: at Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, and along Sheikh Zayed Road at Al Safa and Al Barsha.

A country-wide railway is under construction which will connect all the major cities and ports. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula.

The major ports of the United Arab Emirates are Khalifa Port, Zayed Port, Port Jebel Ali, Port Rashid, Port Khalid, Port Saeed, and Port Khor Fakkan. The Emirates are increasingly developing their logistics and ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China or Africa. For this purpose, ports are being rapidly expanded and investments are being made in their technology.

The Emirates have historically been and currently still are part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region and the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the North Sea.

=== Telecommunications ===
The United Arab Emirates is served by two telecommunications operators, Etisalat and Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (&quot;du&quot;). Etisalat operated a monopoly until du launched mobile services in February 2007. Internet subscribers were expected to increase from 0.904 million in 2007 to 2.66 million in 2012. The regulator, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, mandates filtering websites for religious, political, and sexual content.

5G wireless services were installed nationwide in 2019 through a partnership with Huawei.

== Demographics ==
According to an estimate by the World Bank, the UAE&#x27;s population in 2020 was 9,890,400. Immigrants accounted for 88.52% while Emiratis made up the remaining 11.48%. This unique imbalance is due to the country&#x27;s exceptionally high net migration rate of 21.71, the world&#x27;s highest. UAE citizenship is very difficult to obtain other than by filiation and only granted under very special circumstances.
The UAE is ethnically diverse. The five most populous nationalities in the emirates of Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman are Indian (25%), Pakistani (12%), Emirati (9%), Bangladeshi (7%), and Filipino (5%). Immigrants from Europe, Australia, and North America make up around 100,000 of the population. The rest of the population are from other Arab states.

About 88% of the population of the United Arab Emirates is urban. The average life expectancy was 76.7 in 2012, higher than for any other Arab country. With a male/female sex ratio of 2.2 males for each female in the total population and 2.75 to 1 for the 15–65 age group, the UAE&#x27;s gender imbalance is second highest in the world after Qatar.

=== Largest cities ===
=== Language ===
Modern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates. English is the most commonly spoken language, whereas Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people.

=== Religion ===

Islam is the largest and the official state religion of the United Arab Emirates. The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely interferes in the religious activities of non-Muslims.

There are more Sunni than Shia Muslims in the United Arab Emirates, and 85% of the Emirati population are Sunni Muslims. The vast majority of the remainder 15% are Shia Muslims, who are concentrated in the Emirates of Dubai and Sharjah. Although no official statistics are available for the breakdown between Sunni and Shia Muslims among noncitizen residents, media estimates suggest less than 20% of the noncitizen Muslim population are Shia. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is the largest mosque in the country and a major tourist attraction. Ibadi is common among Omanis in the UAE, while Sufi influences exist as well.

Christians account for 9% of the total population of the United Arab Emirates, according to the 2005 census; estimates in 2010 suggested a figure of 12.6%. Roman Catholics and Protestants form significant proportions of the Christian minority. The country has over 52 churches in 2023. Many Christians in the United Arab Emirates are of Asian, African, and European origin, along with fellow Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. The United Arab Emirates forms part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia and the Vicar Apostolic Bishop Paul Hinder is based in Abu Dhabi.

There is a small Jewish community in the United Arab Emirates. Before 2023, there was only one known synagogue in Dubai, which has been open since 2008 and the synagogue also welcomes visitors. Another synagogue, Moses Ben Maimon Synagogue was completed in 2023 as part of the Abrahamic Family House complex in Abu Dhabi. As of 2019, according to Rabbi Marc Schneier of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, it is estimated that there are about 150 families to 3,000 Jews who live and worship freely in the UAE.

South Asians in the United Arab Emirates constitute the largest ethnic group in the country. Over 2 million Indian migrants (mostly from the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Coastal Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu) are estimated to be living in the UAE. There are currently three Hindu temples in the country. Other religions also exist in the United Arab Emirates, including Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Judaism, Baháʼís, and Druze.

The UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, Abdullah bin Zayed, announced in 2019 the design and construction plan of the Abrahamic Family House, which will serve as an interfaith complex that houses a synagogue, mosque, and a church on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi.

=== Education ===

The education system through secondary level is administered by the Ministry of Education in all emirates except Abu Dhabi, where it falls under the authority of the Department of Education and Knowledge. Public schools are divided into primary schools, middle schools, and high schools. The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates&#x27; development goals. The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language. There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited. Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary.

The higher education system is monitored by the Ministry of Higher Education. The ministry also is responsible for admitting students to its undergraduate institutions. The adult literacy rate in 2015 was 93.8%.

The UAE has shown a strong interest in improving education and research. Enterprises include the establishment of the CERT Research Centres and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology and Institute for Enterprise Development. According to the QS Rankings, the top-ranking universities in the country are the United Arab Emirates University (421–430th worldwide), Khalifa University (441–450th worldwide), the American University of Sharjah (431–440th), and University of Sharjah (551–600th worldwide). United Arab Emirates was ranked 33rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 36th in 2019.

=== Health ===
The life expectancy at birth in the UAE is at 76.96 years. Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death in the UAE, constituting 28% of total deaths; other major causes are accidents and injuries, malignancies, and congenital anomalies. According to World Health Organization data from 2016, 34.5% of adults in the UAE are clinically obese, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 30 or more.

In February 2008, the Ministry of Health unveiled a five-year health strategy for the public health sector in the northern emirates, which fall under its purview and which, unlike Abu Dhabi and Dubai, do not have separate healthcare authorities. The strategy focuses on unifying healthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost, at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment. The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14, and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86. Nine were scheduled to open in 2008.

The introduction of mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi for expatriates and their dependents was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy. Abu Dhabi nationals were brought under the scheme from 1 June 2008 and Dubai followed for its government employees. Eventually, under federal law, every Emirati and expatriate in the country will be covered by compulsory health insurance under a unified mandatory scheme.
The country has benefited from medical tourists from all over the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf. The UAE attracts medical tourists seeking cosmetic surgery and advanced procedures, cardiac and spinal surgery, and dental treatment, as health services have higher standards than other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf.

== Culture ==

Emirati culture is based on Arabian culture and has been influenced by the cultures of Persia, India, and East Africa. Arabian and Arabian inspired architecture is part of the expression of the local Emirati identity. Arabian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture and folk arts. For example, the distinctive wind tower that tops traditional Emirati buildings, the &quot;barjeel&quot;, has become an identifying mark of Emirati architecture and is attributed to Arabian influence. This influence is derived both from traders who fled the tax regime in Persia in the early 19th century and from Emirati ownership of ports on the Arabian coast, for instance the Al Qassimi port of Lingeh.

The United Arab Emirates has a diverse society. Dubai&#x27;s economy depends more on international trade and tourism, and is more open to visitors, while Abu Dhabi society is more domestic as the city&#x27;s economy is focused on fossil fuel extraction.

Major holidays in the United Arab Emirates include &quot;Eid al Fitr&quot;, which marks the end of &quot;Ramadan&quot;, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates. Emirati males prefer to wear a kandura, an ankle-length white tunic woven from wool or cotton, and Emirati women wear an abaya, a black over-garment that covers most parts of the body.

The earliest known poet in the UAE is Ibn Majid, born between 1432 and 1437 in Ras Al-Khaimah. The most famous Emirati writers were Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959), and Ahmed bin Sulayem (1905–1976). Three other poets from Sharjah, known as the Hirah group, are observed to have been heavily influenced by the Apollo and Romantic poets. The Sharjah International Book Fair is the oldest and largest in the country.

The list of museums in the United Arab Emirates includes some of regional repute, most famously Sharjah with its Heritage District containing 17 museums, which in 1998 was the Cultural Capital of the Arab World. In Dubai, the area of Al Quoz has attracted a number of art galleries as well as museums such as the Salsali Private Museum. Abu Dhabi has established a culture district on Saadiyat Island. Six grand projects are planned, including the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Dubai also plans to build a Kunsthal museum and a district for galleries and artists.

Emirati culture is a part of the culture of Eastern Arabia. Liwa is a type of music and dance performed locally, mainly in communities that contain descendants of Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region. The Dubai Desert Rock Festival is also another major festival consisting of heavy metal and rock artists. The cinema of the United Arab Emirates is minimal but expanding.

=== Media ===


The UAE&#x27;s media is annually classified as &quot;not free&quot; in the Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House. The UAE ranks poorly in the annual Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders. Dubai Media City is the UAE&#x27;s main media zone. The UAE is home to some pan-Arab broadcasters, including the Middle East Broadcasting Centre and Orbit Showtime Network. In 2007, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum decreed that journalists can no longer be prosecuted or imprisoned for reasons relating to their work. At the same time, the UAE has made it illegal to disseminate online material that can threaten &quot;public order&quot;, and hands down prison terms for those who &quot;deride or damage&quot; the reputation of the state and &quot;display contempt&quot; for religion. Journalists who are arrested for violating this law are often brutally beaten by the police.

According to UAE Year Book 2013, there are seven Arabic newspapers and eight English language newspapers, as well as a Tagalog newspaper produced and published in the UAE.

New media, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are used widely in the UAE by the government entities and by the public as well. The UAE government avails official social media accounts to communicate with public and hear their needs.

In recent years, there has been a notable surge in digital media consumption in the UAE, driven by the widespread use of platforms like Snapchat and TikTok among the younger population.  Influencers on these platforms play a significant role in shaping trends and promoting various products and services. The government has also implemented digital initiatives to enhance e-Government services and promote smart city concepts, further demonstrating the UAE&#x27;s commitment to technological advancements.

=== Cuisine ===

The traditional food of the Emirates has always been rice, fish, and meat. The people of the United Arab Emirates have adopted most of their foods from other West and South Asian countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, and India. Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. Meat and rice are other staple foods, with lamb and mutton preferred to goat and beef. Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be complemented with cardamom or saffron to give them a distinctive flavour.

Popular cultural Emirati dishes include &quot;threed&quot;, &quot;machboos&quot;, &quot;khubisa&quot;, &quot;khameer&quot;, and &quot;chabab&quot; bread among others while lugaimat is a famous Emirati dessert.

With the influence of western culture, fast food has become very popular among young people, to the extent that campaigns have been held to highlight the dangers of fast food excesses. Alcohol is allowed to be served only in hotel restaurants and bars. All nightclubs are permitted to sell alcohol. Specific supermarkets may sell alcohol, but these products are sold in separate sections. Likewise, pork, which is haram (not permitted for Muslims), is sold in separate sections in all major supermarkets. Although alcohol may be consumed, it is illegal to be intoxicated in public or drive a motor vehicle with any trace of alcohol in the blood.

=== Sports ===

Formula One is particularly popular in the United Arab Emirates, and a Grand Prix is annually held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. The race takes place in the evening, and was the first ever Grand Prix to start in daylight and finish at night. Other popular sports include camel racing, falconry, endurance riding, and tennis. The emirate of Dubai is also home to two major golf courses: the Dubai Golf Club and Emirates Golf Club.

In the past, child camel jockeys were used, leading to widespread criticism. Eventually, the UAE passed laws banning the use of children for the sport, leading to the prompt removal of almost all child jockeys. Recently robot jockeys have been introduced to overcome the problem of child camel jockeys which was an issue of human rights violations. Ansar Burney is often praised for the work he has done in this area.

==== Football ====

Football is a popular sport in the UAE. Al Nasr, Al Ain, Al Wasl, Sharjah, Al Wahda, and Shabab Al Ahli are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions. The United Arab Emirates Football Association was established in 1971 and since then has dedicated its time and effort to promoting the game, organising youth programmes, and improving the abilities of not only its players, but also the officials and coaches involved with its regional teams. The UAE qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1990, along with Egypt. It was the third consecutive World Cup with two Arab nations qualifying, after Kuwait and Algeria in 1982, and Iraq and Algeria again in 1986. The UAE has won the Gulf Cup Championship twice: the first cup won in January 2007 held in Abu Dhabi and the second in January 2013, held in Bahrain. The country hosted the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. The UAE team went all the way to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by the eventual champions, Qatar.

==== Cricket ====

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the UAE, largely because of the expatriate population from the SAARC countries, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The headquarters of the International Cricket Council (ICC) have been located in the Dubai Sports City complex since 2005, including the ICC Academy which was established in 2009. There are a number of international cricket venues in the UAE, which are frequently used for international tournaments and &quot;neutral&quot; bilateral series due to the local climate and Dubai&#x27;s status as a transport hub. Notable international tournaments hosted by the UAE have included the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, and three editions of the Asia Cup (1984, 1995, and 2018). Notable grounds include the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in Sharjah, Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, and Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai.

The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) became a member of the ICC in 1990. The UAE national cricket team has qualified for the Cricket World Cup on two occasions (1996 and 2015) and the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup on two occasions (2014 and 2022). The national women&#x27;s team is similarly one of the strongest associate teams in Asia, notably participating in the 2018 ICC Women&#x27;s World Twenty20 Qualifier.

Following the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team, the UAE served as the &quot;de facto&quot; home of the Pakistan national cricket team for nearly a decade, as well as hosting the Pakistan Super League. The UAE has also hosted one full edition of Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2020 and two partial editions of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2014 and 2021.

<text>Rizpah (riz&#x27;-pa, &quot;coal&quot;, &quot;hot stone&quot;) was the daughter of Aiah, and one of Saul&#x27;s concubines. She was the mother of Armoni and Mephibosheth (; ).

After the death of Saul, according to the Bible, Abner was implicitly accused of having aspirations to the throne by taking Rizpah as his wife, resulting in a quarrel between him and Saul&#x27;s son and successor, Ishbosheth. () The quarrel led to Abner&#x27;s defection to David, () who was then king of the breakaway Kingdom of Judah. This incident led to the downfall of Ishbosheth and the rise of David as king of a reunited Kingdom of Israel.

A famine lasting three years hit Israel during the earlier half of David&#x27;s reign at Jerusalem. God revealed that this calamity happened because of &quot;Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.&quot; The Gibeonites were not Israelites, but the remnant of the Amorites, which Saul pursued from within Israel. David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul&#x27;s sons.()

David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Michal (according to the Masoretic Text; the Septuagint has &quot;Merab&quot;), Saul&#x27;s daughter. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies at the sanctuary at Gibeah (). Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah, and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, () till they were at length taken down and buried by David () in the family grave at Zelah with the bones of Saul and Jonathan. Only once both restitution had been made for Saul&#x27;s betrayal of the Gibeonites and an olive branch extended to Rizpah and the house of Saul by giving Saul&#x27;s sons the honour of burial with their father did God respond to the plea of the land and end the famine (2 Samuel 21:14).

British rabbi Jonathan Magonet has described Rizpah as &quot;every mother who sees her sons killed before their time for reasons of state, be they in time of peace or in war. All that remains is for her to preserve the dignity of their memory and live on to bear witness and call to account the rulers of the world&quot;.

<text>Java is one of the islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population of 153.8 million people, Java is the world&#x27;s most populous island, home to approximately 54% of the Indonesian population. Indonesia&#x27;s capital city, Jakarta, is on Java&#x27;s northwestern coast.

Many of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia&#x27;s eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.

Java was formed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the Australian Plate under the Sunda Plate. It is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass, at about (including Madura&#x27;s ). A chain of volcanic mountains is the east–west spine of the island.

Four main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Betawi. Javanese and Sundanese are the most spoken. The ethnic groups native to the island are the Javanese in the central and eastern parts and Sundanese in the western parts. The Madurese in the Eastern salient of Java are migrants from Madura Island, while the Betawi in the capital city of Jakarta are hybrids from various ethnic groups in Indonesia. Most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java&#x27;s population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.

Java is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java, Central Java, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.

==Etymology==
The origins of the name &quot;Java&quot; are not clear. The island could possibly have been named after the &quot;jáwa-wut&quot; plant, which was said to be common in the island during the time, and that prior to Indianization the island had different names. There are other possible sources: the word &quot;jaú&quot; and its variations mean &quot;beyond&quot; or &quot;distant&quot;. And, in Sanskrit &quot;yava&quot; means barley, a plant for which the island was famous. &quot;Yavadvipa&quot; is mentioned in India&#x27;s earliest epic, the Ramayana. Sugriva, the chief of Rama&#x27;s army, dispatched his men to Yavadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita. It was hence referred to in India by the Sanskrit name &quot;yāvaka dvīpa&quot; (dvīpa = island). Java is mentioned in the ancient Tamil text &quot;Manimekalai&quot; by Chithalai Chathanar which states that Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram. Another source states that the word &quot;Java&quot; is derived from a Proto-Austronesian root word, meaning &quot;home&quot;. The great island of Iabadiu or Jabadiu was mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; composed around 150 CE in the Roman Empire. &quot;Iabadiu&quot; is said to mean &quot;barley island&quot;, to be rich in gold, and have a silver town called Argyra at the west end. The name indicates Java and seems to be derived from the Sanskrit name Java-dvipa (Yavadvipa).

The annual news of Songshu and Liangshu (5th century CE) referred to Java as 闍婆 (&quot;She-pó&quot; or &quot;She-bó&quot;), He-ling (640–818), then called it She-po again until the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), where they began mentioning 爪哇 (&quot;Zhao-Wa&quot; or &quot;Chao-Wa&quot;). According to Ma Huan&#x27;s book (the Yingya Shenlan), the Chinese called Java Chao-Wa, and the island was called She-po in the past. Sulaiman al-Tajir al-Sirafi mentioned two notable islands which separated Arabia and China: One is the 800 farsakh long Al-Rami, which is identified as Sumatra, and the other is Zabaj (Arabic: الزابج, Indonesian: Sabak), 400 farsakh in length, identified as Java. When John of Marignolli returned from China to Avignon, he stayed at the Kingdom of Saba for a few months, which he said had many elephants and was led by a queen; Saba may be his interpretation of She-bó.&quot;&quot; Afanasij Nikitin, a merchant from Tver (in Russia), traveled to India in 1466 and described the land of java, which he called шабайте (shabait/šabajte).

==Geography==

Java lies between Sumatra to the west and Bali to the east. Borneo lies to the north, and Christmas Island is to the south. It is the world&#x27;s 13th largest island. Java is surrounded by the Java Sea to the north, the Sunda Strait to the west, the Indian Ocean to the south and Bali Strait and Madura Strait in the east.

Java is almost entirely of volcanic origin; it contains 38 mountains forming an east–west spine that have at one time or another been active volcanoes. There are 112 volcanoes in all, 35 of which are active. The highest volcano in Java is Mount Semeru, . The most active volcano in Java and also in Indonesia is Mount Merapi, . In total, Java has more than 150 mountains.

Java&#x27;s mountains and highlands split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions suitable for wet-rice cultivation; the rice lands of Java are among the richest in the world. Java was the first place where Indonesian coffee was grown, starting in 1699. Today, coffea arabica is grown on the Ijen Plateau by small-holders and larger plantations. 

The area of Java is about (including Madura&#x27;s and minor offshore islands). It is about long and up to wide. The island&#x27;s longest river is the 600 km long Solo River. The river rises from its source in central Java at the Lawu volcano, then flows north and eastward to its mouth in the Java Sea near the city of Surabaya. Other major rivers are Brantas, Citarum, Cimanuk and Serayu.

The average temperature ranges from to ; average humidity is 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter, averaging during the day in the dry season. The south coast is generally cooler than the north, and highland areas inland are even cooler. The wet season begins in November and ends in April. During that rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year. The wettest months are January and February.

West Java is wetter than East Java, and mountainous regions receive much higher rainfall. The Parahyangan highlands of West Java receive over annually, while the north coast of East Java receives annually.

==Natural environment==

Java is an island with a large amount of biodiversity. The natural environment of Java is tropical rainforest, with ecosystems ranging from coastal mangrove forest on the north coast, rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast, and low-lying tropical forest to high altitude rainforest on the slopes of mountainous volcanic regions in the interior. The Javan environment and climate gradually alters from west to east; from wet and humid dense rainforest in western parts, to a dry savanna environment in the east, corresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions.
Javan wildlife originally supported a rich biodiversity, where numbers of endemic species of flora and fauna flourished; such as the Javan rhinoceros, Javan banteng, Javan warty pig, Javan silvery gibbon, Javan lutung, Java mouse-deer, Javan rusa, and Javan leopard. With over 450 bird species and 37 endemic species including the Javan green magpie, Javan hawk-eagle, and Javan peafowl, Java is a birdwatcher&#x27;s paradise. There are about 130 freshwater fish species in Java. There are also several endemic amphibian species in Java, including 5 species of tree frogs.

Since ancient times, people have opened the rainforest, altered the ecosystem, shaped the landscapes and created rice paddy and terraces to support the growing population. Javan rice terraces have existed for more than a millennium and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms. The growing human population has put severe pressure on Java&#x27;s wildlife, as rainforests were diminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas. Some of Java&#x27;s endemic species are now critically endangered, with some already extinct; Java used to have Javan tigers and Javan elephants, but both have been rendered extinct. Today, several national parks exist in Java that protect the remnants of its fragile wildlife, such as Ujung Kulon, Mount Halimun-Salak, Gede Pangrango, Baluran, Meru Betiri, Bromo Tengger Semeru and Alas Purwo.

==History==
=== &quot;Homo erectus&quot; presence ===
Fossilised remains of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, popularly known as the &quot;Java Man&quot;, dating back 1.3 million years were found along the banks of the Bengawan Solo River.

&quot;H. erectus&quot; arrived in Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago, in an event considered to be the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of &quot;H. erectus&quot; lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated (&quot;hydromorphic savanna&quot;). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, &quot;Ficus&quot;, and &quot;Indigofera&quot;, which are typical of lowland rainforest.

&quot;H. e. soloensis&quot; was the last population of a long occupation history of the island of Java by &quot;H. erectus&quot;, beginning 1.51 to 0.93 million years ago at the Sangiran site, continuing 540 to 430 thousand years ago at the Trinil site, and finally 117 to 108 thousand years ago at Ngandong. If the date is correct for Solo Man, then they would represent a terminal population of &quot;H. erectus&quot; which sheltered in the last open-habitat refuges of East Asia before the rainforest takeover. Before the immigration of modern humans, Late Pleistocene Southeast Asia was also home to &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; endemic to the island of Flores, Indonesia, and &quot;H. luzonensis&quot; endemic to the island of Luzon, the Philippines. Genetic analysis of present-day Southeast Asian populations indicates the widespread dispersal of the Denisovans (a species currently recognisable only by their genetic signature) across Southeast Asia, whereupon they interbred with immigrating modern humans 45.7 and 29.8 thousand years ago. A 2021 genomic study indicates that, aside from the Denisovans, modern humans never interbred with any of these endemic human species, unless the offspring were unviable or the hybrid lineages have since died out.

Judging by the sheer number of specimens deposited at Ngandong at the same time, there may have been a sizeable population of &quot;H. e soloensis&quot; before the volcanic eruption which resulted in their interment, but population is difficult to approximate with certainty. This site is quite far from the north coast of Java Island, and it is not always easy to determine the position of the coastline in prehistoric times because of significant geographical changes.

The southern coastline and estuary of the Bengawan Solo River at that time may have been different from what it is today, due to geological factors such as sedimentation, erosion, and changes in sea level over time. Currently, the estuary of the Bengawan Solo is in the Java Sea, but in prehistoric times, the river flow and estuary location may have changed. Geological and paleogeographic studies are often used to understand these changes.

=== After the arrival of modern humans ===

The island&#x27;s exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of wet-field rice cultivation, which required sophisticated levels of cooperation between villages. Out of these village alliances, small kingdoms developed. The chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of Java kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively isolated. Before the advent of Islamic states and European colonialism, the rivers provided the main means of communication, although Java&#x27;s many rivers are mostly short. Only the Brantas river and Solo river could provide long-distance communication and this way their valleys supported the centers of major kingdoms. A system of roads, permanent bridges, and toll gates is thought to have been established in Java by at least the mid-17th century. Local powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was highly dependent on constant maintenance. Consequently, communication between Java&#x27;s population was difficult.
The emergence of civilization on the island of Java is often associated with the arrival of Aji Saka in 78 AD. Although Aji Saka is said to be the bearer of civilization on Java, the story received several objections and rebuttals from other historical sources. Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana, made around 500 BC, records that Java already had a governmental organization long before the story:&quot;Yawadwipa is decorated with seven kingdoms, gold and silver islands, rich in gold mines, and there is Cicira (cold) Mountain that touches the sky with its peak.&quot;

The Greek geographer Ptolemy called the island Iabadius or Sabadius (). Ptolemy said that the name meant the &quot;Island of Barley&quot; and produced a lot of grain and gold, adding that its metropolis was Argyre (Ἀργυρῆ) meaning silver in Greek.

According to Chinese record &quot;Míng Shǐ&quot;, the Javanese kingdom was founded in 65 BC, or 143 years before the story of Aji Saka began.

The story of Aji Saka is a Neo Javanese story. This story has not yet been found to be relevant in the Old Javanese text. This story tells of events in the Medang Kamulan kingdom in Java in the past. At that time, the king of Medang Kamulan Prabu Dewata Cengkar was replaced by Aji Saka. This story is considered as an allegory of the entry of Indians into Java. Referring to the Liang dynasty information, the Javanese kingdom was divided into two: the pre-Hinduism kingdom and the post-Hindu kingdom, which began in 78 AD.

===Hindu–Buddhist kingdoms era===

The Taruma kingdom of western Java existed from the 5th to the 7th centuries, while the Heling kingdom sent embassies to China starting in 640. However, the first major principality was the Mataram Kingdom that was founded in central Java at the beginning of the 8th century. Mataram&#x27;s religion centered on the Hindu god Shiva, and the kingdom produced some of Java&#x27;s earliest Hindu temples on the Dieng Plateau. Around the 8th century, the Sailendra dynasty rose in Kedu Plain and become the patron of Mahayana Buddhism. This ancient kingdom built monuments such as the 9th century Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java.

Around the 10th century, the center of power shifted from central to eastern Java. The eastern Javanese kingdoms of Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit were mainly dependent on rice agriculture, yet also pursued trade within the Indonesian archipelago, and with China and India. Majapahit was established by Wijaya, and by the end of the reign of Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350–89) it claimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although control was likely limited to Java, Bali, and Madura. Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s prime minister, Gajah Mada, led many of the kingdom&#x27;s territorial conquests. Previous Javanese kingdoms had their power based on agriculture, however, Majapahit took control of ports and shipping lanes and became Java&#x27;s first commercial empire. With the death of Hayam Wuruk and the coming of Islam to Indonesia, Majapahit went into decline.

===Spread of Islam and rise of Islamic sultanates===

Islam became the dominant religion in Java at the end of the 16th century. During this era, the Islamic kingdoms of Demak, Cirebon, and Banten were ascendant. The Mataram Sultanate became the dominant power of central and eastern Java at the end of the 16th century. The principalities of Surabaya and Cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only Mataram and Banten were left to face the Dutch in the 17th century.

===Colonial periods===
Java&#x27;s contact with the European colonial powers began in 1522 with a treaty between the Sunda kingdom and the Portuguese in Malacca. After its failure, the Portuguese presence was confined to Malacca and to the eastern islands.
In 1596, a four-ship expedition led by Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutch contact with Indonesia. By the end of the 18th century the Dutch had extended their influence over the sultanates of the interior through the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia. Internal conflict prevented the Javanese from forming effective alliances against the Dutch. Remnants of the Mataram survived as the Surakarta (Solo) and Yogyakarta principalities. Javanese kings claimed to rule with divine authority and the Dutch helped them to preserve remnants of a Javanese aristocracy by confirming them as regents or district officials within the colonial administration.

Java&#x27;s major role during the early part of the colonial period was as a producer of rice. In spice-producing islands like Banda, rice was regularly imported from Java, to supply the deficiency in means of subsistence.

During the Napoleonic wars in Europe, the Netherlands fell to France, as did its colony in the East Indies. During the short-lived Daendels administration, as French proxy rule on Java, the construction of the Great Post Road was commenced in 1808. The road, spanning from Anyer in Western Java to Panarukan in East Java, served as a military supply route and was used in defending Java from British invasion. In 1811, Java was captured by the British, becoming a possession of the British Empire, and Sir Stamford Raffles was appointed as the island&#x27;s governor. In 1816, under the governorship of John Fendall, Java was returned to the Dutch as per the terms of the Treaty of Paris.

In 1815, there may have been five million people in Java. In the second half of the 18th century, population spurts began in districts along the north-central coast of Java, and in the 19th century population grew rapidly across the island. Factors for the great population growth include the impact of Dutch colonial rule including the imposed end to civil war in Java, the increase in the area under rice cultivation, and the introduction of food plants such as cassava and maize that could sustain populations that could not afford rice. Others attribute the growth to the taxation burdens and increased expansion of employment under the Cultivation System to which couples responded by having more children in the hope of increasing their families’ ability to pay tax and buy goods. Cholera claimed 100,000 lives in Java in 1820.

The advent of trucks and railways where there had previously only been buffalo and carts, telegraph systems, and more coordinated distribution systems under the colonial government all contributed to famine elimination in Java, and in turn, population growth. There were no significant famines in Java from the 1840s through to the Japanese occupation in the 1940s. However, other sources claimed the Dutch&#x27;s Cultivation system is linked to famines and epidemics in the 1840s, firstly in Cirebon and then Central Java, as cash crops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice.

===Independence===
Indonesian nationalism first took hold in Java in the early 20th century, and the struggle to secure the country&#x27;s independence following World War II was centered in Java. In 1949, Indonesian independence was recognized.

==Administration==
Java is divided into four provinces and two special regions:
* Banten, capital: Serang
* Special Capital Region of Jakarta, capital: Central Jakarta (&quot;de facto&quot;)
* West Java, capital: Bandung
* Central Java, capital: Semarang
* Special Region of Yogyakarta, capital: Yogyakarta
* East Java, capital: Surabaya, (which province also includes Madura Island)
(1) including (all within Sumenep Regency) the neighbouring small archipelagos of the Kangean Islands (648.55 km2), the Sapudi Islands (167.41 km2), Talango Island (50.278 km2), Masalembu (40.85 km2) and the Giligenteng Islands (30.32 km2).&lt;br&gt;
(2) Other offshore islands are included in this figure, but are comparatively very small in population and area; they include Nusa Barong (100 km2), Bawean (196 km2), Karimunjawa (78 km2), Nusa Kambangan (121 km2), Panaitan (170 km2), and the Thousand Islands (8.7 km2) – with a combined population of roughly 90,000.

(3) Land area of provinces updated in mid 2023 regency/city annual statistics.

==Demographics==

===Demographic profile===

Java has been traditionally dominated by an elite class, while the people in the lower classes were often involved in agriculture and fishing. The elite class in Java has evolved over the course of history, as cultural wave after cultural wave immigrated to the island. There is evidence that South Asian emigres were among this elite, as well as Arabian and Persian immigrants during the Islamic eras. More recently, Chinese immigrants have also become part of the economic elite of Java. Although politically the Chinese generally remain sidelined, there are notable exceptions, such as the former governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama.Java houses the majority of Indonesia&#x27;s urban population. Currently, 65% of the island is urbanized. Unlike the rest of Java, the population growth in Central Java remains low. Central Java however has a younger population than the national average. The slow population growth can in part be attributed to the choice by many people to leave the more rural Central Java for better opportunities and higher incomes in the bigger cities. Java&#x27;s population continues to rapidly increase despite many Javanese leaving the island. This is somewhat due to the fact that Java is the business, academic, and cultural hub of Indonesia, which attracts millions of non-Javanese people to its cities. The population growth is most intense in the regions surrounding Jakarta and Bandung, which is reflected through the demographic diversity in those areas.

===Population development===

Java is the most populous major island in the world and is home to 54% of Indonesia&#x27;s population, with a combined population of 153.8 million according to the official estimates as at mid 2024 (including Madura&#x27;s 4.06 million). At nearly 1,164 people per km2 in 2024, it is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world, on a par with Bangladesh. Every region of the island has numerous volcanoes, with the people left to share the remaining flatter land. Because of this, many coasts are heavily populated and cities ring around the valleys surrounding volcanic peaks.

The population growth rate more than doubled in economically depressed Central Java in the latest 2010–2020 period vs 2000–2010, indicative of migration or other issues; there were significant volcanic eruptions during the earlier period. Approximately 45% of the population of Indonesia is ethnically Javanese, while Sundanese make a large portion of Java&#x27;s population as well.

The western third of the island (West Java, Banten, and DKI Jakarta) has an even higher population density, of roughly 1,563 per square kilometre and accounts for most of the population growth of Java. It is home to three metropolitan areas, Greater Jakarta (with outlying areas of Greater Serang and Greater Sukabumi), Greater Bandung, and Greater Cirebon.

From the 1970s to the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998, the Indonesian government ran transmigration programs aimed at resettling the population of Java on other less populated islands of Indonesia. This program has met with mixed results, sometimes causing conflicts between the locals and the recently arrived settlers. Nevertheless, it has caused Java&#x27;s share of the nation&#x27;s population to progressively decline.

Jakarta and its outskirts, being the dominant metropolis, is also home to people from all over the nation. East Java is also home to ethnic Balinese, as well as large numbers of Madurans due to their historic poverty.

===Ethnicity and culture===

Despite its large population and in contrast to the other larger islands of Indonesia, Java is comparatively homogeneous in ethnic composition. Only two ethnic groups are native to the island—the Javanese and Sundanese. A third group is the Madurese, who inhabit the island of Madura off the northeast coast of Java, and have immigrated to East Java in large numbers since the 18th century. The Javanese comprise about two-thirds of the island&#x27;s population, while the Sundanese and Madurese account for 38% and 10% respectively. The fourth group is the Betawi people that speak a dialect of Malay, they are the descendants of the people living around Batavia from around the 17th century. Betawis are creole people, mostly descended from various Indonesian archipelago ethnic groups such as Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Balinese, Minang, Bugis, Makassar, Ambonese, mixed with foreign ethnic groups such as Portuguese, Dutch, Arab, Chinese and Indian brought to or attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs. They have a culture and language distinct from the surrounding Sundanese and Javanese.

The Javanese prose text Tantu Pagelaran () explained the mythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature.

Four major cultural areas exist on the island: the central part of Java or Yogyakarta is the Javanese people heartland and the north coast of the &quot;pasisir&quot; region, the Sunda lands (Sundanese: , &quot;Tatar&quot; &quot;Sunda&quot;) in the western part of Java and Parahyangan as the heartland, the eastern salient of Java also known as Blambangan. Madura makes up a fifth area having close cultural ties with coastal eastern Java. The &quot;kejawen of Javanese&quot; culture is the island&#x27;s most dominant. Java&#x27;s remaining aristocracy is based here, and it is the region from where the majority of Indonesia&#x27;s army, business, and political elite originate. Its language, arts, and etiquette are regarded as the island&#x27;s most refined and exemplary. The territory from Banyumas in the west through to Blitar in the east and encompasses Indonesia&#x27;s most fertile and densely populated agricultural land.&quot;&quot;

In the southwestern part of Central Java, which is usually named the Banyumasan region, a cultural mingling occurred; bringing together Javanese culture and Sundanese culture to create the Banyumasan culture. In the central Javanese court cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, contemporary kings trace their lineages back to the pre-colonial Islamic kingdoms that ruled the region, making those places especially strong repositories of classical Javanese culture. Classic arts of Java include gamelan music and wayang puppet shows.

Java was the site of many influential kingdoms in the Southeast Asian region, and as a result, many literary works have been written by Javanese authors. These include &quot;Ken Arok and Ken Dedes&quot;, the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom; and translations of &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Pramoedya Ananta Toer is a famous contemporary Indonesian author, who has written many stories based on his own experiences of having grown up in Java, and takes many elements from Javanese folklore and historical legends.

===Languages===
The three major languages spoken on Java are Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese. Other languages spoken include Betawi (a Malay dialect local to the Jakarta region), Osing, Banyumasan, and Tenggerese (closely related to Javanese), Baduy and Bantenese (closely related to Sundanese), Kangeanese (closely related to Madurese), and Balinese. The vast majority of the population also speaks Indonesian, often as a second language.

===Religion===

Indian influences came first with Shaivism and Buddhism penetrating deeply into society, blending with indigenous tradition and culture. One conduit for this were the ascetics, called &quot;resi&quot;, who taught mystical practices. A &quot;resi&quot; lived surrounded by students, who took care of their master&#x27;s daily needs. Resi&#x27;s authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and &quot;pudjangga&quot; (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to their political needs. Small Hindu enclaves are scattered throughout Java, but there is a large Hindu population along the eastern coast nearest Bali, especially around the town of Banyuwangi.
The coming of Islam, strengthened the status structure of this traditional religious pattern. More than 98 percent of the Muslims in Java are Sunnis with very minority being Shia and Ahmadis (respectively 1% and 0.2%), on a broad continuum between &quot;abangan&quot; (more syncretic) and &quot;santri&quot; (more orthodox). Muslim scholars (&quot;Kyai&quot;) became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese &quot;pesantren&quot; (Islamic schools), The &quot;Kyai&quot; perpetuated the tradition of the &quot;resi&quot;. Students around him provided his needs, even peasants around the school.

Pre-Islamic Javan traditions have encouraged Islam in a mystical direction. There emerged in Java a loosely structured society of religious leadership, revolving around &quot;kyais&quot;, possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-Islamic and Islamic lore, belief and practice. The kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the supernatural. However, this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has promoted schism. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who merely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught mysticism and those who sought to reform Islam with modern scientific concepts. As a result, there is a division between &quot;santri&quot;, who believe that they are more orthodox in their Islamic belief and practice, with &quot;abangan&quot;, who have mixed pre-Islamic animistic and Hindu-Indian concepts with a superficial acceptance of Islamic belief.

There are also Christian communities, mostly in the larger cities, primarily among Chinese Indonesian and minority Javanese even some rural areas of south-central Java are strongly Roman Catholic. Buddhist communities also exist in the major cities, primarily among the Chinese Indonesian. The Indonesian constitution recognises six official religions.

A wider effect of this division is the number of sects. In the middle of 1956, the Department of Religious Affairs in Yogyakarta reported 63 religious sects in Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 35 were in Central Java, 22 in West Java and six in East Java. These include Kejawen, Sumarah, Subud, etc. Their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official religions. Sunda Wiwitan is a traditional Sundanese religion, its adherents still exist in several villages.

==Economy==

Initially the economy of Java relied heavily on rice agriculture. Ancient kingdoms such as the Kingdoms of Sunda, Mataram, and Majapahit were dependent on rice yields and tax. Java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export since ancient times, and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth of the island. Trade with other parts of Asia such as ancient India and China flourished as early as the 4th century, as evidenced by Chinese ceramics found on the island dated to that period. Java also took part in the global trade of Maluku spice from ancient times in the Majapahit era, until well into the Dutch East India Company (VOC) era.

The VOC set their foothold on Batavia in the 17th century and was succeeded by the Dutch East Indies in the 19th century. During these colonial times, the Dutch introduced the cultivation of commercial plants in Java, such as sugarcane, rubber, coffee, tea, and quinine. In the 19th and early 20th century, Javanese coffee gained global popularity. Thus, the name &quot;Java&quot; today has become a synonym for coffee.
Java has been Indonesia&#x27;s most developed island since the Dutch East Indies era and continues to be so today in the modern Republic of Indonesia. The road transportation networks that have existed since ancient times were connected and perfected with the construction of Java Great Post Road by Daendels in the early 19th century. It became the backbone of Java&#x27;s road infrastructure and laid the base of Java North Coast Road (). The need to transport commercial produces such as coffee from plantations in the interior of the island to the harbour on the coast spurred the construction of railway networks in Java. Today, industry, business, trade and services flourished in major cities of Java, such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, and Bandung; while some traditional Sultanate cities such as Yogyakarta, Surakarta, and Cirebon preserved its royal legacy and has become the centre of art, culture and tourism. Industrial estates are also growing in towns on northern coast of Java, especially around Cilegon, Tangerang, Bekasi, Karawang, Gresik and Sidoarjo. The toll road highway networks was built and expanded since the New Order until the present day, connecting major urban centres and surrounding areas, such as in and around Jakarta and Bandung; also the ones in Cirebon, Semarang and Surabaya. In addition to these motorways, Java has 16 national highways.

Based on the statistical data by the year of 2021 released by Statistics Indonesia (&quot;Badan Pusat Statistik&quot;), Java alone contributes around 60% of Indonesia&#x27;s GDP or equivalent to US$686 billion (int$2.0 trillion, PPP).

<text>High Force is a waterfall on the River Tees, near Middleton-in-Teesdale, Teesdale, England. The waterfall is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the European Geopark. The whole of the River Tees plunges over a precipice (an almost vertical cliff edge) in two stages. After heavy rainfall the river will also flow over the usually dry right-hand side channel, creating two falls. Very occasionally the river level will be high enough to flow over the central section of rock; the last recorded time this happened was in December 2015 after Storm Desmond. In harsh winters the falls have been known to freeze, creating cathedral-like ice formations.

Access to the northern bank is via a private footpath on the Raby estate for which a fee is charged. The southern bank can be reached free of charge via the Pennine Way public footpath which crosses the Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve.

==Geology==
High Force was formed where the River Tees crosses the Whin Sill – a hard layer of igneous rock (also seen at Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and other locations). The waterfall itself consists of three different types of rock. The upper band is made up of whinstone, or dolerite, a hard igneous rock which the waterfall takes a lot of time to erode. The lower section is made up of Carboniferous Limestone, a softer rock which is more easily worn away by the waterfall. Between these two layers is a thinner layer of Carboniferous sandstone, which was baked hard when the Whin Sill was molten 295 million years ago. The wearing away of rock means that the waterfall is slowly moving upstream, leaving a narrow, deep gorge in front of it. The length of the gorge is currently about . The bed load (rocks that the river is carrying) is mainly composed of large boulders, which are rolled along the river bed. Upstream of the waterfall, the river is narrow; downstream, it widens and meanders.

==Relative height==
Despite popular belief that it is the highest waterfall in England, at , others have a longer fall: Cautley Spout, in Cumbria&#x27;s Howgill Fells, is almost high, and Hardraw Force, in North Yorkshire, has an unbroken drop of . Underground, on the flanks of Ingleborough, Fell Beck falls an unbroken down the Jib Tunnel of Gaping Gill Hole. However, High Force does have the largest volume of water falling over an unbroken drop when in full spate, thereby earning its Nordic name &quot;High Fosse&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Stock footage of the waterfalls was featured in the film &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot;. Although the story of the film is supposed to occur in the American Southwest, stock footage of High Force was used. High Force also appeared in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; in 2021.

==Notable visitors==
The painter J. M. W. Turner arrived at High Force at 10:00 a.m. on 3 August 1816 to sketch the scene. He then travelled upstream to Cauldron Snout and eventually made his way to Dufton, across the fells, in inclement weather.

Arthur Young came with his wife on horseback from Durham in 1771 and made the following comment:
The whole river (no trifling one) divided by one rock into two vast torrents pours down a perpendicular precipice of near fourscore feet: The deluging force of the water throws up such a foam and misty rain, that the sun never shines without a large and brilliant rainbow appearing...

After preaching at Cuthberton and in Teesdale, I went a little out of my way, to see one of the wonders of nature. The river Tees rushes down between two rocks, and falls sixty feet perpendicular into a basin of water sixty feet deep ...

<text>Rimmon or Rimon () is a Hebrew word meaning &#x27;pomegranate&#x27;. It appears as a name in the Hebrew Bible where, when translated to Greek, it takes the form Remmon (Ρεμμων, &quot;Remmōn&quot;).

==Hebrew Bible==
===Place-names===
Rimmon may refer to:
* Rimmon, one of the &quot;uttermost cities&quot; of Judah, afterwards given to Simeon (Joshua 15:21, 32; 19:7; 1 Chronicles 4:32). In Joshua 15:32, Ain and Rimmon are mentioned separately, but in Joshua 19:7 and 1 Chronicles 4:32 the two words are probably to be combined, as forming together the name of one place, Ain-Rimmon = &quot;the spring of the pomegranate&quot; (compare Nehemiah 11:29). It has been identified with Um er-Rumamin, about 13 miles south-west of Hebron. Zechariah 14:10 describes it as &quot;south of Jerusalem,&quot; to distinguish it from other Rimmons; and uses it in conjunction with Geba to describe the latitudinal span of the kingdom of Judah.

* The &quot;Rock of Rimmon&quot;, where the Benjamites fled (Judges 20:45, 47; 21:13), and where they maintained themselves for four months after the battle at Gibeah. It is the present village of Rammun, &quot;on the very edge of the hill country, with a precipitous descent toward the Jordan valley&quot;, supposed to be the site of Ai. Israeli settlement Rimonim nearby is named after the biblical place.

*Hadad-Rimmon near Megiddo
===Biblical figure===
Rimon is mentioned as a man of Beeroth of the tribe of Benjamin, whose two sons, Baanah and Rechab, were captains of the army of Ish-bosheth, son of King Saul.

===Syrian deity===
Rimmon (&quot;pomegranate&quot; in Hebrew) was a Syrian deity mentioned in the Second Book of Kings (), to whom a temple was dedicated. In Syria, this storm god was also known as Hadad (interpreted to mean &quot;the breast&quot; in Biblical Hebrew) or Baal (&quot;the Lord&quot;), and in Assyria as Ramanu (&quot;the thunderer&quot;, when borrowed from Akkadian - cf. Akkadian &quot;ramanu&quot;, &quot;to roar&quot;).

According to the biblical narrative, the Aramean commander Naaman, having been healed of his leprosy by the Israelite prophet Elisha, requested pardon from God for continuing to minister to the King of Syria who would continue to worship in the Temple of Rimmon. Elisha granted him this pardon.

== Extra-biblical usage ==
* An adornment of the Torah scroll (usually plural: &quot;Torah rimonim&quot;), from the Hebrew word for pomegranate.
*&quot;Rimmon&quot;, a poem by Rudyard Kipling written in 1903 after the Boer War.
*According to &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, allegedly revealed by celestial beings and published in 1955 in the US, Rimmon was a small city in the region of Galilee which &quot;had once been dedicated to the worship of a Babylonian god of the air, Ramman&quot; (see Hadad/Ramman).

<text>The ancient town of Riblah, today a tell covered by a cemetery not far from the town of Ribleh on the Syrian side of the border with Lebanon, was in biblical times located on the northern frontier of the land of Canaan. The site lies on the eastern bank of the Orontes river, in a wide and fertile plain, 35 miles north-east of Baalbek and 10 or 12 miles south of the artificial Lake Homs created by the Romans. Brenton translated the place as &quot;Rablaam&quot; in his translation of the Septuagint.

It was at Riblah that Necho II, pharaoh of Egypt (c. 610 – c. 595 BCE), established his camp after he had routed Josiah&#x27;s Judahite army at Megiddo in 609 BCE. Soon after this, the son of Josiah, the newly anointed King Jehoahaz, was made prisoner and held at Riblah to prevent him from ruling Judah; he was later taken to Egypt where he died (). A reference in :
:&quot;The nations combined against him [Jehoahaz]; he was caught in their pit;&quot;
:&quot;They dragged him off with hooks to the land of Egypt&quot;
is interpreted as stating that Necho had invited Jehoahaz to a conference in Riblah and trapped him there.

Some two decades later, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon also set up his headquarters here during his campaign against Judah, which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 or 586 BCE. King Zedekiah was taken captive and brought to Riblah, described as a dependency of Hamath, where he had to witness how his sons were killed, after which he was blinded and taken to Babylon. His officials were also put to death in Riblah ().

The town was situated on the main international trade route from Egypt to Mesopotamia, via Israel and the town of Carchemish where the road crossed over the Euphrates River. An important strategic asset, Riblah had plenty of water, food and fuel, which made also suitable as a military camp.

In Roman times, the town also bore the name Daphne.

==Riblah in Canaan==
There was also a town with the same name on the eastern boundary of the land promised to Moses in Canaan, known from , but whose location is still uncertain. The town is described in as &quot;on the eastern side of Ain&quot;. Two springs still called &quot;el-Ain el-Fauqah&quot; and &quot;el-Ain el-Tahta&quot; (&quot;the upper&quot; and &quot;the lower fountain&quot;) can still be found about 10 miles east of the Sea of Galilee, close to the town of Samar in Irbid Governorate, Jordan.

<doc id="69346" wikidata="Q30903" url="?curid=69346" title="Soprano">
<text>A soprano () is a type of classical singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano&#x27;s vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C4) = 261 Hz to &quot;high A&quot; (A5) = 880 Hz in choral music, or to &quot;soprano C&quot; (C6, two octaves above middle C) = 1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which often encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;soprano&quot; comes from the Italian word &quot;&quot; (above, over, on top of), as the soprano is the highest pitch human voice, often given to the leading female roles in operas. &quot;Soprano&quot; refers mainly to women, but it can also be applied to men; &quot;sopranist&quot; is the term for a male countertenor able to sing in the soprano vocal range, while a castrato is the term for a castrated male singer, typical of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and a treble is a boy soprano, whether they finished puberty or are still a child, as long as they are still able to sing in that range.

The term &quot;soprano&quot; is also based on the Latin word &quot;&quot; which, like soprano, referred to the highest pitch vocal range of all human voice types. The word &quot;superius&quot; was especially used in choral and other multi-part vocal music between the 13th and 16th centuries.

== Vocal range ==
The soprano has the highest vocal range of all voice types, with the highest tessitura. A soprano and a mezzo-soprano have a similar range, but their tessituras will lie in different parts of that range.

The low extreme for sopranos is roughly A3 or B3 (just below middle C). Within opera, the lowest demanded note for sopranos is F3 (from Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;). Often low notes in higher voices will project less, lack timbre, and tend to &quot;count less&quot; in roles (although some Verdi, Strauss and Wagner roles call for stronger singing below the staff). However, rarely is a soprano simply unable to sing a low note in a song within a soprano role. Low notes can be reached with a lowered position of the larynx.

The high extreme, at a minimum, for non-coloratura sopranos is &quot;soprano C&quot; (C6 two octaves above middle C), and many roles in the standard repertoire call for C6 or D6. A couple of roles have optional E6s, as well. In the coloratura repertoire, several roles call for E6 on up to F6. In rare cases, some coloratura roles go as high as G6 or G6, such as Mozart&#x27;s concert aria &quot;Popoli di Tessaglia!&quot;, or the title role of Jules Massenet&#x27;s opera &quot;Esclarmonde&quot;. While not necessarily within the tessitura, a good soprano will be able to sing her top notes full-throated, with timbre and dynamic control.

In opera, the tessitura, vocal weight, and timbre of voices, and the roles they sing, are commonly categorized into voice types, often called ( , from German or , &quot;vocal category&quot;). A singer&#x27;s tessitura is where the voice has the best timbre, easy volume, and most comfort.

== In choral music ==

In SATB four-part mixed chorus, the soprano is the highest vocal range, above the alto, tenor, and bass. Sopranos commonly sing in the tessitura G4-A5. When the composer calls for divisi, sopranos can be separated into Soprano I (highest part) and Soprano II (lower soprano part).

In contrast to choral singing, in classical solo singing a person is classified through the identification of several vocal traits, including range, vocal timbre, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal resonance, and vocal transition points (lifts or &quot;passaggio&quot;) within the singer&#x27;s voice.

These different traits are used to identify different sub-types within the voice. Within opera, particular roles are written with specific kinds of soprano voices in mind, causing certain roles to be associated with certain kinds of voices.

== Subtypes and roles in opera ==

Within the soprano voice type category are five generally recognized subcategories: coloratura soprano, soubrette, lyric soprano, spinto soprano, and dramatic soprano.

=== Coloratura ===

The coloratura soprano may be a lyric coloratura or a dramatic coloratura. The lyric coloratura soprano is a very agile light voice with a high upper extension capable of fast vocal coloratura. Light coloraturas have a range of approximately middle C (C4) to &quot;high F&quot; (&quot;in alt&quot;) (F6) with some coloratura sopranos being able to sing somewhat lower or higher, e.g. an interpolated A6 in the Doll Aria, &quot;Les oiseaux dans la charmille&quot;, from &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, e.g. by Rachele Gilmore in a 2009 performance, and a written A6 by Audrey Luna in 2017 in &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot;, both at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

The dramatic coloratura soprano is a coloratura soprano with great flexibility in high-lying velocity passages, yet with great sustaining power comparable to that of a full spinto or dramatic soprano. Dramatic coloraturas have a range of approximately &quot;low B&quot; (B3) to &quot;high F&quot; (F6) with some coloratura sopranos being able to sing somewhat higher or lower.

=== Soubrette ===

In classical music and opera, a soubrette soprano refers to both a voice type and a particular type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet timbre, a tessitura in the mid-range, and with no extensive coloratura. The soubrette voice is not a weak voice, for it must carry over an orchestra without a microphone like all voices in opera. The voice, however, has a lighter vocal weight than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes, but, as they grow older and the voice matures more physically, they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a light lyric soprano, a lyric coloratura soprano, or a coloratura mezzo-soprano. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career. A soubrette&#x27;s range extends approximately from Middle C (C4) to &quot;high D&quot; (D6). The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and spinto soprano.

=== Lyric ===

The lyric soprano is a warm voice with a bright, full timbre, which can be heard over a big orchestra. It generally has a higher tessitura than a soubrette and usually plays &quot;ingénues&quot; and other sympathetic characters in opera. Lyric sopranos have a range from approximately middle C (C4) to &quot;high D&quot; (D6).

The lyric soprano may be a light lyric soprano or a full lyric soprano. The light lyric soprano has a bigger voice than a soubrette but still possesses a youthful quality. The full lyric soprano has a more mature sound than a light-lyric soprano and can be heard over a bigger orchestra.

=== Spinto ===

Also lirico-spinto, Italian for &quot;pushed lyric&quot;, the spinto soprano has the brightness and height of a lyric soprano, but can be &quot;pushed&quot; to dramatic climaxes without strain, and may have a somewhat darker timbre. Spinto sopranos have a range from approximately B (B3) to &quot;high D&quot; (D6).

=== Dramatic ===

A dramatic soprano (or &quot;soprano robusto&quot;) has a powerful, rich, emotive voice that can sing over a full orchestra. Usually (but not always) this voice has a lower tessitura than other sopranos, and a darker timbre. Dramatic sopranos have a range from approximately A (A3) to &quot;high C&quot; (C6).

Some dramatic sopranos, known as Wagnerian sopranos, have a very big voice that can assert itself over an exceptionally large orchestra (over eighty pieces). These voices are substantial and very powerful and ideally even throughout the registers.

=== Other types ===
Two other types of soprano are the &quot;Dugazon&quot; and the &quot;Falcon&quot;, which are intermediate voice types between the soprano and the mezzo-soprano: a Dugazon is a darker-colored soubrette, a Falcon a darker-colored soprano drammatico.

<text>Rephidim or Refidim () is one of the places visited by the Israelites in the biblical account of the Exodus from Egypt.
== Biblical account ==

This episode is described in the Book of Exodus. The Israelites under Moses have come from the Wilderness of Sin. At Rephidim, they can find no water to drink, and angrily demand that Moses give them water. Moses, fearing they will stone him, calls on Jehovah for help and is told to strike a certain &quot;rock in Horeb,&quot; in God&#x27;s name which causes a stream to flow from it, providing ample water for the people. He names the place Massah and Meribah (meaning &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;quarreling&quot;). In the Book of Numbers a similar event is described as taking place near Kadesh. 

Afterwards, the Amalekites attack the Israelites encamped at Rephidim, but are defeated. The Israelites are led in the battle by Joshua, while Moses, Aaron and Hur watch from a nearby hill. Moses notices that when his arms are raised the Israelites gained the upper hand, but when they are down the Amalekites prevail. He sits with his hands held up by Aaron and Hur until sunset, securing the Israelite victory. The image of Moses raising his arms in battle against Amalek has been seen by allegorical Christian commenters as a prefiguration of Jesus&#x27;s arms extended on the cross battling sin.

==Location==
One proposal places Rephidim in the Wadi Feiran, near its junction with the Wadi esh-Sheikh. When they leave Rephidim, the Israelites advance into the Sinai Wilderness, possibly marching through the passes of the Wadi Solaf and the Wadi esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the er-Rahah plain (which would then be identified with the &quot;Sinai Wilderness&quot;), which is three kilometers long and about eight hundred metres wide. Wadi Feiran was an oasis, which would explain the battle with the Amalekites in terms of a struggle for control of water sources.

Another proposed location for Rephidim is in northwestern Saudi Arabia north of the town of al-Bad, the ancient city of Midian. Some researchers suggest that Mount Sinai was not in the Sinai Peninsula, but in Midian, which is modern-day Saudi Arabia, and subsequently place Rephidim here as well. Jabal Maqla has been the subject of several explorations since the early 1980s. To the northwest of this mountain is a large plain and a massive split rock that shows signs of water erosion (Rephidim is also where Moses is recorded as striking a rock and water coming from it for the parched Hebrews). The plain, or wadi runs from this split rock all the way to Jabal Maqla.
The name &quot;Rephidim&quot; () means &quot;place of rest&quot;.

More recent scholarship identifies Rephidim with Wadi Refayid in the southwest Sinai.

<text>The Drechtsteden (; Dutch for &quot;Drecht cities&quot;) are a number of towns and cities bordering each other in the delta area of the rivers Oude Maas, Noord, and Beneden-Merwede in the province of South Holland, Netherlands. These cooperate in the &quot;Gemeenschappelijke Regeling Drechtsteden&quot; (&quot;joint arrangement Drechtsteden&quot;), which performs common tasks for the municipalities in the field of economy, development, culture, and social assistance. Collectively, a little more than 250,000 people call one of the towns and cities of Drechtsteden home.

The associated towns and cities are:
* Alblasserdam
* Dordrecht
* Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht
* Papendrecht
* Sliedrecht
* Hardinxveld-Giessendam
* Zwijndrecht

The name &quot;Drechtsteden&quot; was chosen because the name of several of the associated cities and towns ends in the suffix (meaning: place where ships are pulled or carried across the land). It is also an informal name for the area.

<text>A religious festival is a time of special importance marked by adherents to that religion. Religious festivals are commonly celebrated on recurring cycles in a calendar year or lunar calendar. The science of religious rites and festivals is known as heortology.

== Ancient Roman ==

Festivals &quot;(feriae)&quot; were an important part of Roman religious life during both the Republican and Imperial eras, and were one of the primary features of the Roman calendar. &quot;Feriae&quot; (&quot;holidays&quot; in the sense of &quot;holy days&quot;) were either public &quot;(publicae)&quot; or private &quot;(privatae)&quot;. State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. &quot;Feriae privatae&quot; were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families.

The 1st-century BC scholar Varro defined &quot;feriae&quot; as &quot;days instituted for the sake of the gods.&quot; A deity&#x27;s festival often marked the anniversary (&quot;dies natalis,&quot; &quot;birthday&quot;) of the founding of the deity&#x27;s temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Public business was suspended for the performance of religious rites on the &quot;feriae&quot;. Cicero says that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labors. On calendars of the Republic and early Empire, the religious statusdays were marked by letters such as &quot;F&quot; (for &quot;fastus)&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; (for &quot;nefastus&quot;, when political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited). By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show these letters, probably as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius that recognized the changed religious environment of the empire.
On surviving Roman calendars, festivals that appear in large capital letters (such as the Lupercalia and Parilia) are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC. Some of the oldest festivals are not named for deities. During the Imperial period, several traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. Games &quot;(ludi)&quot;, such as the Ludi Apollinares, were often dedicated to particular deities, but were not technically &quot;feriae&quot;, although they might be holidays in the modern sense of days off work &quot;(dies festi)&quot;. After the mid-1st century AD, there were more frequent spectacles and games &quot;(circenses)&quot; held in the venue called a &quot;circus&quot;, in honor of various deities or for imperial anniversaries &quot;(dies Augusti)&quot;. A religious festival held on a single day, such as the Floralia, might be expanded with games over multiple days &quot;(Ludi Florae)&quot;; the festival of Flora is seen as a precursor of May Day festivities.

A major source for Roman holidays is Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;, a poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of Augustus. Because it ends with June, less is known about Roman festivals in the second half of the year, with the exception of the Saturnalia, a religious festival in honor of Saturn on December 17 that expanded with celebrations through December 23. Probably the best-known Roman festival, some of its customs, such as gift-giving and the prevalence of candles, are thought to have influenced popular celebrations of Christmas.

== Buddhist ==

Japanese festivals and Barua festivals often involve Buddhist culture, as do pagoda festivals held as fairs held at Buddhist temples in countries such as Thailand. Features of Buddhist Tibetan festivals may include the traditional cham dance, which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in India and Bhutan. Many festivals of Nepal are religious festivals involving Buddhism.

== Christian ==
The central festival of Christianity is Easter, on which Christians celebrate their belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. Even for Easter, however, there is no agreement among the various Christian traditions regarding the date or manner of the observance, less for Christmas, Pentecost, or various other holidays. Both Protestants and Catholics observe certain festivals commemorating events in the life of Christ, and as well as Eastern Orthodox they often celebrate patronal festivals. Of these, the two most important are Christmas, which commemorates the Birth of Jesus, and Easter, which marks his resurrection.

== Festival of Faiths ==
A celebration of interfaith dialogue, the first Festival of Faiths was held in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1998, Senator Wendell Ford passed a resolution in the United States Congress &quot;to express the sense of the Senate that the Louisville Festival of Faiths should be commended and should serve as model for similar festivals in other communities throughout the United States.&quot; Several cities throughout the United States now host interfaith festivals including Kansas City, Kansas, St Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio.

== Hindu ==
&#x27;Utsava&#x27; is the Sanskrit word for Hindu festivals, meaning &#x27;to cause to grow &#x27;upward&#x27;. Hindus observe sacred occasions by festive observances. All festivals in Hinduism are predominantly religious in character and significance. Many festival are seasonal. Some celebrate harvest and the birth of gods or heroes. Some are dedicated to important events in Hindu mythology. Many are dedicated to Shiva and Parvati, Vishnu and Lakshmi and Brahma and Saraswati. A festival may be observed with acts of worship, offerings to deities, fasting, feasting, vigil, rituals, fairs, charity, celebrations, Puja, Homa, aarti etc. They celebrate individual and community life of Hindus without distinction of caste, gender or class. In the Hindu calendar dates are usually prescribed according to the lunar calendar. In vedic timekeeping, a tithi is a lunar day. Among major festivals are Diwali, Gudi Padwa, Pongal, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Raksha Bhandan, Krishna Janmashtami, Dasara or Dussehra, which may refer to the ten days of Sharada Navratri or the tenth day, Vijayadashami. Others include Onam, Shivaratri, Ugadi, Rathayatra of Jagannath at Puri in Ilam, Nepal and many other places in Nepal and many other countries

== Islamic ==

Among major Islamic religious festivals are Eid ul-Adha, Eid ul-Fitr and Ramadan.
== Jain ==

Important festivals include Paryushan, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and Diwali.

== Jewish ==
A Jewish holiday (&quot;Yom Tov&quot; or &quot;chag&quot; in Hebrew) is a day that is holy to the Jewish people according to Judaism and is usually derived from the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Torah, and in some cases established by the rabbis in later eras. There are a number of festival days, fast days (&quot;ta&#x27;anit&quot;) and days of remembrance.

== Mandaean ==

Parwanaya is the largest Mandaean festival.

&quot;Dehwa Honina&quot; or &quot;Dehwa Ṭurma&quot; (the Little Feast) is a Mandaean religious festival which takes place on the 18th of Taura (Ayar), celebrating the return of the divine messenger Hibil Ziwa from the World of Darkness to the World of Light.

Mandaeans also celebrate Dehwa Rabba (New Year&#x27;s Day) and Dehwa Daymaneh (Birthday of John the Baptist).

== Neo-Pagan ==
Natale di Roma, historically known as &quot;Dies Romana&quot; and also referred to as Romaia, the festival linked to the foundation of Rome, celebrated on April 21. According to legend, Romulus is said to have founded the city of Rome on April 21, 753 BC. From this date, the Roman chronology derived its system, known by the Latin phrase &quot;Ab Urbe condita&quot;, meaning &quot;from the founding of the City&quot;, which counted the years from this presumed foundation.

== Baháʼí Faith ==

The Baháʼí Faith has eleven holy days, which are important anniversaries in the history of the religion.

== Sikh ==

Major Sikh festivals include Guru Nanak Gurpurab, Guru Gobind Gurpurab, Maghi, Poonai, Sangrand, and Vaisakhi.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1968 was the 13th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in London, United Kingdom, following the country&#x27;s first victory at the with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; by Sandie Shaw. Despite having won for the first time the year before, it was actually the third time that the United Kingdom had hosted the competition, having previously done so in and , both of which also took place in London. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the contest was held at Royal Albert Hall on 6 April 1968, and was hosted by Katie Boyle for the third time. It was notably also the first time that the contest was broadcast in colour.

Seventeen countries participated in the contest, the same countries that had participated the previous year.

The winner was with the song &quot;La La La&quot; by Massiel, and written/composed by Manuel de la Calva and Ramón Arcusa. This was Spain&#x27;s first victory - and their first ever top five placing - in the contest.

== Location ==

The contest was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The Royal Albert Hall is known for hosting the world&#x27;s leading artists from several performance genres, sports, award ceremonies, the annual summer Proms concerts and other events since its opening in 1871, and has become one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most treasured and distinctive buildings. At the time of the contest in 1968, the hall had a capacity of 7,000 seats.

== Participating countries ==

All countries that had participated in 1967 also participated in 1968.

The contest featured one representative who had previously performed as lead artists for the same country. Isabelle Aubret had won Eurovision for .

Originally Spanish broadcaster (TVE) entered Joan Manuel Serrat to sing &quot;La La La&quot;, but his demand to sing in Catalan was an affront to the Francoist State dictatorship. Therefore, Massiel, who was on tour in Mexico, was brought in as a late replacement. In just two weeks, she had to rush back to Spain, learn the song, record it in several languages, travel to Paris to get a dress and go to London for rehearsals. She sang the song in the contest in Castilian Spanish with the new arrangement made to fit her. In her winning reprise, she performed part of her song in English, in addition to the original version, becoming the first winner to do so. The Norwegian national selection, Melodi Grand Prix, ended with Kirsti Sparboe and Odd Børre winning with the song &quot;&quot;. However the composer, Kari Diesen withdrew the song due to receiving multiple accusations of plagiarism of the song &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; by Cliff Richard. The runner-up song in the selection, &quot;Stress&quot; would perform in the contest instead, where Odd Børre was chosen to be the singer.

== Format ==
1968 was the first time that the Eurovision Song Contest was broadcast in colour. The countries that broadcast it in colour were France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, although in the UK it was broadcast as an encore presentation in colour on BBC Two the next day. Many Eastern European countries as well as Tunisia broadcast the contest.

Prior to the contest, the bookmakers were sure of another British victory, as the English singer Cliff Richard, who was already dominating the music charts at that time, was hotly tipped as the favourite to win, but in the end he lost out to Spain&#x27;s song by a margin of just one point.

== Contest overview ==

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1968 contest are listed below.
* 
* Michael Aspel

== Detailed voting results ==

Due to a misunderstanding by the hostess, Katie Boyle, Switzerland were erroneously awarded 3 points by Yugoslavia, instead of 2. The scrutineer asked for the Yugoslav votes from TV Skopje to be announced a second time.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in Tunisia, and in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union via Intervision, with an estimated global audience of between 150 to 200 million.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>IJsselmonde () is a river island in the Netherlands, between the Nieuwe Maas, Noord and Oude Maas branches rivers of the Rhine-Meuse delta in the province of South Holland. The city of Rotterdam now occupies most of the northern part of the island and includes the eponymous former village of IJsselmonde, once a separate community. The island was once a rich agricultural region but is mostly suburbs today. Only the mid-south parts of the island have retained their agricultural character.

== Boundaries ==
IJsselmonde is separated by these waterways:

*from the mainland on the north by the Nieuwe Maas
*from the island of Putten on the west by the Oude Maas
*from Hoeksche Waard on the south by the Oude Maas
*from the island of Dordrecht on the southeast by the Oude Maas
*from the Alblasserwaard mainland on the east by river Noord

== Municipalities and regions ==
IJsselmonde consists of the following six municipalities:

* Albrandswaard
* Barendrecht
* Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht
* Ridderkerk
* Rotterdam (southern part)
* Zwijndrecht

Albrandswaard, Barendrecht, Ridderkerk and Rotterdam belong to the region of Rijnmond, Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht and Zwijndrecht belong to the region of Zuid-Holland Zuid.

== Zwijndrechtse Waard ==

Originally the Zwijndrechtse Waard, on which the municipalities of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht and Zwijndrecht and the village of Rijsoord (partially) lie, was a separate river island, the western branch of river Waal separating the two. However, as the Waal stretch has been closed off at both ends, the Waard is now generally considered to be part of IJsselmonde. The dammed western end of the Waal river is now commonly referred to as Waaltje (&quot;little Waal&quot;).

<text>This is a list of the etymologies of continent names as they are currently found on Earth.

== Africa ==

The name &quot;Africa&quot; was originally used by the ancient Romans to refer to the northern part of the continent that corresponds to modern-day Tunisia. There are many theories regarding its origin.

* &quot;Africa terra&quot; means &quot;land of the Afri&quot; (plural, or &quot;Afer&quot; singular), referring to the Afri tribe, who dwelt in Northern Africa around the area of Carthage. Their name might come from Phoenician &quot;afar&quot; &quot;dust”.
* Greek &quot;aphrike&quot; (*ἀφρίκη) &quot;without cold&quot;. This was proposed by historian Leo Africanus (1488-1554), who suggested the Greek word &quot;phrike&quot; (φρίκη, meaning &quot;cold and horror&quot;), combined with the negating prefix &quot;a-&quot;, thus indicating a land free of cold and horror. However, as the change of sound from &quot;ph&quot; to &quot;f&quot; in Greek is datable to about the 10th century, it is unlikely this is the origin.
* Latin &quot;aprica&quot; &quot;sunny&quot;.
* Another suggestion is that the name comes from the Ancient Egyptian word &quot;afruika&quot; - which means &#x27;turning towards the ka&#x27; or &#x27;turning towards the birthplace&#x27; or &#x27;motherland&#x27; of humanity.

The name &quot;Africa&quot; began to be stretched to encompass a larger area when the provinces of Tripolitania, Numidia and Mauretania Caesariensis were subdued to the Diocesis of Africa, following the administrative restructuring of Diocletian. Later, when Justinian I reconquered lands of the former West Roman Empire, all the regions from the Chelif River to the Gulf of Sidra were annexed to the Byzantine Empire as the &quot;Exarchate of Africa&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, as the Europeans increased their knowledge and awareness of the size of the African continent, they progressively extended the name of Africa to the rest of the continent.

==America==
The continent of America is thought to be named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (who styled himself &quot;Americus Vespucius&quot; in Latin). Amerigo Vespucci was named after Saint Emeric of Hungary, who was in turn named for his maternal uncle, the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II. Vespucci, following his four voyages exploring the coastlines of Venezuela and Brazil, first developed the idea that the newly discovered western land was in fact a continent. The German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller created the earliest known map showing the name &quot;America&quot;, which he applied to the South American continent only.
The 1594 map by Petrus Plancius labels the two landmasses &quot;America Mexicana&quot; and &quot;America Peruana&quot;, two terms still used in the 17th century.

In the late 19th century, it was theorized that the name could have been patterned on the Mayan language for the Amerrisque Mountains in present-day Nicaragua.

An alternative theory was proposed by the local Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd who proposed that the word America had evolved from Amerike or ap Meryk, based on a lost manuscript which he claimed to have seen. Alfred Hudd was an aristocrat who belonged to the Clifton Antiquarian Club of Bristol, founded in 1884 to arrange meetings and excursions for the study of objects of archaeological interest in the West of England and South Wales. He also collected butterflies, was a naturalist and member of the Bristol Naturalists&#x27; Society. Hudd proposed that the word &quot;America&quot; was originally applied to a destination across the western ocean, possibly an island or a fishing station in Newfoundland. After the king of Denmark and ruler of Iceland had cut off trade for fish, England sent out expeditions to find new sources. Hudd suggested Amerike&#x27;s sponsorship made his name known in Bristol in association with the North American destinations prior to other mapmaking or voyages. The writer Jonathan Cohen noted he made a conjectural leap to reach that conclusion, and no extant evidence supports it. In the 21st century, the scholar John Davies briefly mentioned the story as a kind of Welsh patriot piece.

== Antarctica ==
The word &quot;Antarctica&quot; comes from Greek &quot;antarktikos&quot; (ἀνταρκτικός), from &quot;anti&quot; (ἀντί) and &quot;arktikos&quot; (ἀρκτικός) &quot;Arctic&quot;. Literally &quot;opposite to the Arctic (opposite to the North)&quot;. &quot;Arktikos&quot; comes from &quot;Arktos&quot;, the Greek name for the constellation of the Great Bear Ursa Major, visible only in the Northern Hemisphere, which comes from the ancient Greek word ἄρκτος (), which means &quot;bear&quot;.

== Asia ==
The word &quot;Asia&quot; originated from the Ancient Greek word Ἀσία, first attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE) in reference to Anatolia or to the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt.

It originally was just a name for the east bank of the Aegean Sea, an area known to the Hittites as Assuwa. In early Classical times, the Greeks started using the term &quot;Asia&quot; to refer to the whole region known today as Anatolia (the peninsula which forms the Asian portion of present-day Turkey). The Roman Empire referred to the entire Lydian region of what is now northwestern Turkey as the province of Asia. Eventually, however, the name had been stretched progressively further east, until it came to encompass the much larger land area with which we associate it today, while the Anatolian Peninsula started being called &quot;Asia Minor&quot; or &quot;The Lesser Asia&quot; instead.

The deeper root of the etymology can only be guessed at. The following two possibilities have been suggested: 
* It could have originated from the Aegean root &quot;Asis&quot; which means &quot;muddy and silty&quot; as a description of the eastern shores of the Aegean Sea.
* It could derive from the borrowed Semitic root &quot;Asu&quot;, which means varyingly &quot;rising&quot; or &quot;light&quot;, of course a directional referring to the sunrise, Asia thus meaning &#x27;Eastern Land&#x27;.

However, since the Greek name &quot;Asia&quot; is in all likelihood related to Hittite Assuwa, the etymology of one has to account for the other as well.

It is personified in Greek mythology by the deity of the same name.

== Australia ==
The word &quot;Australia&quot; means &quot;Southern Land&quot; in Neo-Latin, adapted from the legendary pseudo-geographical &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; (&quot;Unknown Southern Land&quot;) dating back to the Roman era. First appearing as a corruption of the Spanish name for an island in Vanuatu in 1625, &quot;Australia&quot; was slowly popularized following the advocacy of the British explorer Matthew Flinders in his 1814 description of his circumnavigation of the island. Lachlan Macquarie, a Governor of New South Wales, used the word in his dispatches to England and recommended it be formally adopted by the Colonial Office in 1817. The Admiralty agreed seven years later and the continent became officially known as Australia in 1824.

== Europe ==

In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, &quot;Eurṓpē&quot;) was a Phoenician princess. Greek (&quot;Eurṓpē&quot;) contains the elements εὐρύς (&quot;eurus&quot;), &quot;wide, broad&quot; and ὤψ/ὠπ-/ὀπτ- (&quot;ōps&quot;/ &quot;ōp&quot;-/&quot;opt-&quot;) &quot;eye, face, countenance&quot;. &quot;Broad&quot; has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion.

It is common in ancient Greek mythology and geography to identify lands or rivers with female figures. Thus, &quot;Europa&quot; is first used in a geographic context in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea.
As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus.
The weakness of an etymology with εὐρύς (&quot;eurus&quot;), is 1. that the -u stem of εὐρύς disappears in Εὐρώπη Europa and 2. the expected form εὐρυώπη euryopa that retains the -u stem in fact exists.

An alternative suggestion due to Ernest Klein and Giovanni Semerano (1966) attempted to connect a Semitic term for &quot;west&quot;, Akkadian &quot;erebu&quot; meaning &quot;to go down, set&quot; (in reference to the sun), Phoenician &quot; &#x27;ereb&quot; &quot;evening; west&quot;, which would parallel &quot;occident&quot; (the resemblance to &quot;Erebus&quot;, from PIE &quot;*h1regʷos&quot;, &quot;darkness&quot;, is accidental, however). Barry (1999) adduces the word &quot;Ereb&quot; on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of &quot;night&quot;, &quot;[the country of] sunset&quot;, in opposition to &quot;Asu&quot; &quot;[the country of] sunrise&quot;, i.e. Asia (Anatolia coming equally from Ἀνατολή, &quot;(sun)rise&quot;, &quot;east&quot;). This proposal is mostly considered unlikely or untenable.

== Oceania ==
The word &quot;Oceania&quot; comes from the English word ocean for &#x27;a large body of water&#x27;. It is ultimately derived from Greek (&quot;Okeanos&quot;), the great river or sea surrounding the disk of the Earth. In Greek mythology, it is personified as Oceanus, son of Uranus and Gaia and husband of Tethys.

==Other==
===Zealandia===
Zealandia (), also known as the New Zealand continent or Tasmantis, is a nearly submerged continental fragment that sank after breaking away from Australia 60–85 Ma (million years) ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean. It derives its name from the island country of New Zealand which occupies the vast majority of its non-submerged land. Dutch explorers named the land &quot;Nova Zeelandia&quot; after the Dutch province of Zeeland, and British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.

===Pangaea===
The name &quot;Pangaea/Pangea&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;pan&quot; (, &quot;all, entire, whole&quot;) and &quot;Gaia&quot; (, &quot;Mother Earth, land&quot;). The word was allegedly coined by German meteorologist Alfred L. Wegener in 1915. The name was meant to imply the all-encompassing nature of Pangaea, that all the earth (landmass) on the planet at the time was encompassed within the Supercontinent.

<text>The pidyon haben () or redemption of the first-born son is a mitzvah in Judaism whereby a Jewish firstborn son is &quot;redeemed&quot; with money.

The redemption is attained by paying five silver coins to a kohen (a patrilineal descendant of the priestly family of Aaron), on behalf of one&#x27;s firstborn son. Another object of equivalent value may also be used.

&quot;Pidyon haben&quot; is a relatively rare ceremony. A family does not perform the ceremony if their firstborn is either a girl, or born by caesarian section, or preceded by a miscarriage (although some early miscarriages do not count as miscarriages), or if either grandfather is a Kohen or a Levite.

==Origin==

In the Hebrew Bible the laws (see mitzvah) concerning the redemption of the first-born male are referred to in Exodus, Numbers and Leviticus:
The redemption price for firstborn non-Levites was set at 5 shekels:
The arakhin laws set the redemption price of different classes of people whose &quot;value&quot; was consecrated; the price for a male child under five years is similarly five shekels.

The Torah describes the tribe of Levi (to which the priests belong) as having inherited the role of divine service which previously belonged to the firstborns:
According to the traditional rabbinic interpretation, even before the Exodus the priestly duties were reserved for the oldest son in each family.

The priesthood was given specifically to the kohanim (Aaron and his descendants), and at the same time, it was instituted that the firstborn should be redeemed. The replacement of firstborns with Levites occurred following the golden calf episode, during that episode the Levites remained loyal to God.

==Laws==
The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; states that when a Jewish woman gives birth to a firstborn male by natural means (i.e. a boy born vaginally and not by Caesarean section) then the child must be &quot;redeemed&quot;. The father of the child must &quot;redeem&quot; the child from a known kohen representing the original Temple priesthood, for the sum of five silver shekels, or equivalent in country&#x27;s currency (if it has silver currency of the correct weight).

This redemption ceremony is performed when at least thirty days have passed since the child&#x27;s birth. If the 31st day falls on Shabbat or a festival, the redemption is delayed, because any sort of business transaction is not allowed on those days. The elapsed days are counted from sunset to sunset, and the day of birth counts as the first day. While the redemption could be performed immediately after dark on the 31st night, it is usually done the next day; but if the 31st day is a fast day, it is done the previous night, so that it can be accompanied by a festive meal. It is also possible to hold the ceremony on the 30th day itself, if it will be impossible to perform it the next day, so long as at least one synodic month has passed since the moment of birth.

If a first-born son reaches &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; age without having been redeemed, he is responsible for arranging the mitzvah himself as soon as possible.

===Exemptions===
Redemption is required for &quot;the first to exit the womb&quot; () so it is not performed if a daughter is born first. If a woman gives birth to a second son vaginally when the first son was born by caesarean section, that child is not redeemed either. Also, a first-born male does not require redemption if his birth was preceded by an earlier miscarriage by the mother that occurred after the third month of pregnancy. However, if the miscarriage occurred during the first 40 days of pregnancy, redemption is required. If the previous miscarriage occurred after forty days, but before the fetus developed distinguishing characteristics, redemption of the first-born is still required, but the blessing said by the father is omitted.

The procedure does not apply when the father is a kohen or Levite, and does not normally apply when the mother is the daughter of one. The reason is that the Levites, as substitutes for the first-born, are pledged to minister and assist the &quot;kohanim&quot; in divine service, and cannot be redeemed from this service obligation.

The first-born son from a Levite&#x27;s daughter is not redeemed (whether or not the father is Jewish). Similarly, the first-born son of a kohen&#x27;s daughter, as long as the father is Jewish.

===Bat Kohen===
Some sources state that a bat kohen (daughter of a priest) may accept &quot;pidyon haben&quot; money, just as a priest may, but this option is not accepted in practice.

==Ceremony==

In the traditional ceremony, the father brings the child to the kohen and recites a formula, or responds to ritual questions, indicating that this is the Israelite mother&#x27;s firstborn son and he has come to redeem him as commanded in the Torah. If the family is Sephardic, the kohen asks the mother if the child is indeed her firstborn son and if she did not miscarry in the past. The kohen asks the father which he would rather have, the child or the five silver shekels which he must pay. The father states that he prefers the child to the money, then he recites a blessing and hands over five silver coins (or an equivalent amount of total silver). The kohen holds the coins over the child and declares that the redemption price is received and accepted in place of the child. He then blesses the child. (Note: The kohen would not receive the child if the father would refuse to redeem the boy. The function of the question is merely to formally endear the mitzvah to the father.)

The ceremony traditionally takes place before a minyan of 10 men. The child is sometimes presented on a silver tray, surrounded by jewelry lent for the occasion by women in attendance. This is to contrast with the golden calf, when gold and jewelry was used for a sinful purpose.

The event starts by beginning a festive meal (unlike a &quot;brit milah&quot; or wedding where the meal comes after the ceremony). If the family is Sephardic, the event starts with the ceremony. Guests in some places are given cloves of garlic and cubes of sugar to take home: these strongly flavored foods can be used to flavor a large quantity of food which will in some sense extend the mitzvah of participation in the ceremony to all who eat them.

==Coins==

Contemporary religious authorities believe that the &quot;Shekel HaKodesh&quot; (Holy Shekel) of the Temple was larger and of purer silver content than the standard shekel used for trade in ancient Israel. Halakha requires that the coins used have a requisite total amount of actual silver. There are varying opinions as to the correct amount of silver, they fall in between 96.15 grams and 102 grams. Coins which do not contain the requisite amount of silver do not result in a valid redemption.

The Israeli Mint has minted two sets of coins for this purpose: an edition of 20.57 gram silver commemorative coins, five of which would come to 102 grams of silver,
and a special edition 26 gram silver commemorative coins, five of which would come to 130 grams of silver. Pre-1936 American silver dollars (commonly known as Morgan dollars or Peace dollars) weigh 26.73 grams of 90% silver content and hence contain 24.06g of pure silver, although such coins have become increasingly rare (modern U.S. coins contain no silver). Four American Silver Eagle coins, specially minted coins sold to collectors and investors which contain 31.1035 grams of 99.9% pure silver, or five of the above-mentioned specially minted silver coins of Israel are commonly used for &quot;pidyon haben&quot; in the United States. One may use silver bullion as well; it is not necessary for it to be a coin per se.

Moreover, it is not mandatory to redeem the son in silver coins, and the ceremony can be held using any movable object worth the same value as five silver coins in the same day, other than promissory notes, which is not acceptable for the ceremony. Later halachic authorities discuss whether paper money is included in promissory notes; according to the stringent approach, it is possible that modern coins, which are fiat money not valued according to their metal value, would be the same as paper money.

Although the silver coins are the payment to the kohen according to the 613 commandments and are one of the twenty-four priestly gifts, they are sometimes returned by the kohen to the family as a gift for the child, although halachic authorities stipulate that, for the &quot;pidyon&quot; to be valid, the choice of returning the coins as a gift rests upon the kohen whereas pressuring the kohen to do so would render the redemption invalid.

===&quot;Pidyon&quot; certificate===
Some kohens officiating for the &quot;pidyon&quot; ceremony will present the father with a &quot;&quot;Pidyon HaBen&quot; certificate&quot; of the &quot;pidyon&quot; transaction, the certificate will usually be framed for display and may serve as a receipt (and evidence) that the transaction was done according to halacha (i.e. the kohen was not pressured to return the coins), with the kohen and two witnesses (&quot;Eidim&quot;) affixing their signatures at the time of the ceremony.

<text>Ovos moles de Aveiro (literally, &quot;soft eggs from Aveiro&quot;)—sometimes written as ovos-moles de Aveiro—are a local pastry delicacy from Aveiro District, Portugal, made of egg yolks and sugar, and sometimes chocolate. This mixture is then put inside small rice paper casings or wheat flour casings similar to communion wafers shaped into nautical shapes such as shells.

In 2008, it was designated a product with Protected Geographical Indication by the European Union.

==History==
Ovos moles are a traditional pastry of the Aveiro region. They trace their origin to the nuns who lived at various convents of the Dominican, Franciscan, and Carmelite orders present in the area until the early 20th century—particularly the (Monastery of Jesus). According to popular legend, the nuns used egg whites to clean their habits, while they used the yolks to make sweets so as not to waste them, and in order to raise money for their religious communities. When the First Portuguese Republic suppressed the convents in 1910, the nuns transferred their artisanal knowledge to educated upper-class women. Ovos moles grew in popularity when women wearing traditional Aveiro costume started selling them at the Aveiro train station on the Lisbon–Porto line.

==Preparation==
In order to make the egg yolk and sugar mixture for ovos moles, the yolks are carefully separated from the egg whites and mixed with about half their weight in sugar. The mixture is very smooth and creamy. It is not beat in a circular motion, which would result in undesirable striations, but in a simple back-and-forth or side-to-side motion with a wooden spoon. The mixture is then heated in a copper pan until the pan&#x27;s bottom is visible.

The mixture is wrapped in a thin casing made of rice paper or wheat flour similar to communion wafers. These casings are shaped into various nautical forms such as boats, clamshells, conches, fish, and shells. Sometimes the casings are passed through simple syrup in order to give them more consistency or turn them opaque.

Shops selling ovos moles usually display them in ceramic bowls or wood barrels painted with boats and other motifs related to the Ria de Aveiro.

===Chocolate ovos moles===
Ovos moles made with 63% cocoa and covered in chocolate are a traditional variation on the pastry. They essentially became extinct during World War II due to chocolate&#x27;s scarcity at the time. In December 2015 the Associação de Produtores de Ovos-Moles de Aveiro (Association of Producers of Aveiro Ovos-Moles) decided to reintroduce chocolate ovos moles and create a standard recipe for them. In Portuguese, chocolate ovos moles are called ovos moles de chocolate or ovos moles pretos (literally, black soft eggs).

<doc id="69371" wikidata="Q202023" url="?curid=69371" title="Herm">
<text>Herm (Guernésiais: , ultimately from Old Norse &#x27;arm&#x27;, due to the shape of the island, or Old French &#x27;hermit&#x27;) is one of the Channel Islands and part of the Parish of St Peter Port in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. It is located in the English Channel, north-west of France and south of England. It is long and under wide; oriented north–south, with several stretches of sand along its northern coast. The much larger island of Guernsey lies to the west, Jersey lies to the south-east, and the smaller island of Jethou is just off the south-west coast.

Herm was first discovered in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, the majority in the north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but was transferred to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the island that the &#x27;identity&#x27; of the island was at threat.

Herm&#x27;s harbour is on its west coast. There are several buildings of note in the vicinity, including the White House, St Tugual&#x27;s Chapel, Fisherman&#x27;s Cottage, The Mermaid pub and restaurant, and a small primary school with about eight pupils. During a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists visit the island, arriving by one of the catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company. Cars are banned from the island as are bicycles, although quad bikes and tractors are allowed for staff and luggage transport, respectively.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Herm was first found in the Mesolithic period (between 10,000 and 8,000 BC), when hunters were in search of food. In the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, settlers arrived; the remains of chamber tombs have been found on the island, and may be seen today; specifically on the Common, and the Petit and Grand Monceau; it has been suggested that the northern end of the island, i.e. the Common, was set apart for burials. After a three-year project by the University of Durham, supported by specialists from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the Guernsey museum, they stated that the &quot;density of tombs suggests that the northern end of Herm may have been a place set apart for funerary activity&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
The first records of Herm&#x27;s inhabitants in historic times are from the 6th century, when the island became a centre of monastic activity; the followers of Saint Tugual (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing Saint Tugual&#x27;s Chapel. In 709 AD, a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Jethou.

An important moment in Herm&#x27;s political history was in 933 AD, when the Channel Islands were annexed to the Duchy of Normandy, they remained so until the division of Normandy in 1204, when they became a Crown Dependency. In 1111 Brother Claude Panton was a hermit in &quot;Erm&quot; and in 1117 the then hermit, Brother Francis Franche Montague is recorded as living on &quot;Erm&quot;. After the annexation, Herm gradually lost its monastic inhabitants, and between 1570 and 1737 the governors of Guernsey used it as a hunting ground; visiting to shoot, hunt, and fish.

===19th century to the Second World War===
In 1810, an inn was founded; and during the Industrial Revolution, roads, paths, a harbour, accommodation, a forge, blacksmiths, a brewery, a bakery and a prison were built to cater for the largest number of inhabitants since prehistoric times. Most were quarrymen working in new granite quarries. Several quarries can still be seen at present, such as on the Common. When Prince Gebhard Fürst Blücher von Wahlstatt and Princess Blücher leased the island from the British government in 1889, he introduced a colony of red-necked wallabies to the island, which lasted until 1910. Offspring were &quot;said to have been eaten as food by English soldiers occupying the island during World War 2&quot;.

Compton Mackenzie, an English-born Scottish novelist, acquired the tenancy in 1920. He recalled that his three years there had numerous logistical problems. It has been suggested that Mackenzie was the basis for the character Mr Cathcart in D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Man who Loved Islands&quot;, about a man who moved to ever smaller islands much as Mackenzie moved from Herm to the smaller Jethou, but Lawrence himself denied it. Percival Lea Dewhurst Perry was the tenant from 1923 to 1939.

The German occupation of the Channel Islands during the Second World War essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by Nazi Germany, a few weeks after the arrival of German troops in Guernsey and Jersey; German soldiers landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, &quot;The Invasion of the Isle of Wight.&quot; Herm&#x27;s sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the invasion of England, but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits. Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a flak battery was placed on the island for a few weeks, and mines were placed in an area. Occasionally German soldiers would travel to Herm to cut wood for fuel.

====Operation Huckaback====
Operation Huckaback was a British Second World War military operation that was originally designed to be a raid on Herm, Jethou and Brecqhou, but instead became only a raid on Herm undertaken on the night of 27 February 1943, following an earlier attempt that had been aborted. Ten men of the Small Scale Raiding Force and No. 4 Commando under Captain Patrick Anthony Porteous landed 200 yards to the north-west of Selle Rocque on a shingle beach and made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the cliff in front of them. Porteous finally managed to climb up the bed of a stream and pulled the others up with a rope. They later reported that they had found no sign of any Islanders or Germans (who were supposed to be billeted near the harbour). They had failed to make contact with the few civilians on the island whose duties included looking after the sheep.

===Since 1945===

In 1949, the States of Guernsey bought Herm from the Crown because of the &quot;unspoilt island idyll that could be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike&quot;. One of the island&#x27;s most influential tenants was Major Peter Wood, who looked after the island from 1949 to 1980 with his wife. The island was run down when he arrived, with the manor hidden in undergrowth, the windows and roofs of the houses having been blown off by a sea mine drifting into the harbour shortly after their arrival, but they created a school, and restored St Tugual&#x27;s Chapel. Major Wood&#x27;s daughter Pennie Wood Heyworth and her husband Adrian succeeded them; Major Wood died in 1998. Their early efforts are recorded in &quot;Herm, Our Island Home&quot;, written by Major Wood&#x27;s wife Jenny Wood.

On 17 May 2008, the BBC reported that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000. Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers. In September 2008 it was announced that Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than the asking price. The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.

In 2013, negotiations for a 21-year extension to the lease broke down, with the tenant offering £440,000 and the owner requesting £6,000,000 plus improvements to infrastructure, the offer was later reduced to £2.44m. In 2023 the lease to Starboard Settlement Charitable Trust was extended to 2069 for an undisclosed sum.

==Geography and geology==

Herm is only  miles long (north-south) and less than half a mile wide (east-west). In the northern part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grand Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on the northern coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La Pointe du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner. To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to the west is The Bear&#x27;s Beach, leading down to the harbour. Half of the coastline of the northern part of the island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky. Much of Herm&#x27;s bedrock is granite. In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island&#x27;s tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point. The northernmost point of the island, Alderney Point, sits directly south of the Isle of Portland.

Off the northwestern coast of Herm is the islet of Le Plat Houmet, and beyond that Fondu, which like Herm belongs to Guernsey. In Belvoir Bay on the eastern side of the island are the islets of Mouliere, situated off Frenchman&#x27;s Point, which is to the northeast of the manor village, and Caquorobert, the latter of which can be accessed at low tide via a vaguely marked path. To the south of this off the southeastern coast is Puffin Bay, which contains the islet of Putrainez near the coast and the islet of Selle Rocque further out to the south. The far southwestern point of the island is Point Sauzebourge, and Bishop&#x27;s Cove is just to the north of this. North of the cove and south along the beach from the harbour and White House are the Rosiere Steps, with a quarry and cottage of the same name in the vicinity. The Mouette and Percee reefs are offshore here. Hermetier, also known as Rat&#x27;s Island, lies about off the western coast between Fisherman&#x27;s Beach and The Bear&#x27;s Beach, to the north of the harbour, linked by a low causeway from the beach. The islet can be accessed at low tide from the beach around Fisherman&#x27;s Cottage.

The isle of Jethou is around three-quarters of a mile to the southwest beyond Point Sauzebourge. It is possible that in AD 709 a storm washed away the strip of land that connected Jethou to Herm. About off the northern coast of Jethou is the islet of Crevichon, which measures about , with an area of less than three hectares. To the west, between Herm and Guernsey, lies the channel Little Roussel (Petit Ruau); between Herm and Sark, to the east, lies the Big Roussel (Grand Ruau). Bréhon Tower, a Victorian-era fortification, is in the Little Roussel between Herm and Saint Peter Port. The tower was created between 1854 and 1856 by Thomas Charles de Putron (1806–1869) using granite from Herm.

==Politics==
Herm is part of the St Peter Port parish of Guernsey but is not part of any canton. It belongs to the Electoral District of Saint Peter Port South. It is rented out to various tenants. Unlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick, Herm is administered entirely by the States of Guernsey.

Cars and bicycles are banned from Herm, in order to keep &quot;peace and tranquillity&quot;. Herm does allow quad bikes and tractors for staff and luggage transport, respectively.

===Tenants===
Holders of the post of tenant of Herm:
*Prince Gebhard Fürst Blücher von Wahlstatt (1889–1914)
*Compton Mackenzie (1920–1923)
*Percival Lea Dewhurst Perry (1923–1939)
*A. G. Jefferies (1948–1949)
*Major Alexander Gough (Peter) Wood (1949–1998)
*Adrian Heyworth and Pennie Wood Heyworth (c.1980–2008) 
*The Starboard Settlement (John and Julia Singer) (2008- ) 

==Economy and services==
===Tourism===
Tourism is Herm&#x27;s main source of income.
During a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists visit the island, arriving by one of the Travel Trident catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company. Money is also made from vegetable growing, livestock and the occasional issue of postage stamps, which occurred between 1949 and 1969. The residents in Herm are workers on the island and their families. The island is very popular for camping, particularly favoured by schools in nearby Guernsey or Jersey conducting overnight field trips. There are ample camping grounds.

===Crime and law enforcement===

There are three volunteer Special Constables resident on the island, trained and supervised by the States of Guernsey Police Service. On Bank Holidays they are augmented by a visiting full-time Constable from Guernsey. Crime rates on the island are low.

===Health===
There are no medical facilities on Herm and no resident doctor. A small team of first aiders and community first responders is maintained amongst the resident population, and receives regular training from the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, a private company operating on a charitable basis under the umbrella of the Venerable Order of Saint John. Medical evacuation to hospital in Guernsey, where necessary, is achieved by means of the ambulance launch &quot;Flying Christine III&quot; operated by the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service.

===Public toilets===
There are three sets of public toilets on the island, one in the west and two on the east coasts. The facilities on the east coast sit in between Shell Beach and Belvoir Bay, serving both beaches. The other set of facilities sit about a minute&#x27;s walk north of the harbour, serving the shops in the village and the harbour itself.

===Fire service===
A voluntary fire service operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water tank, and basic fire-fighting equipment which they use while waiting for assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.

===Transport===

Herm is entirely car free. Transport around the island is mostly on foot via the footpaths snaking through the island, but quadbikes and tractors are also used by farm and island staff for agricultural activities and carrying luggage. Travel to the island can be completed through the Travel Trident ferry, which runs ferries throughout the day from Saint Peter Port in Guernsey. In 2022 a second ferry was run by the Herm Island owners, but this appears to have been discontinued as of 2024. Supplies also arrive on the Travel Trident ferry daily, such as newspapers and stock for island businesses. The ferry docks in Herm at the Harbour during high tides, but at low tides Rosaire Steps are used, which is approximately a 5 minute walk from the village centre.

==Notable landmarks==

The nondenominational St Tugual&#x27;s Chapel dates to the 11th century, but it is believed that there was a place of worship on Herm as far back as the 6th century, although it has not been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date. The current building is Norman and appears to have been a monastery during medieval times. Of particular note is its stained glass windows featuring Noah&#x27;s Ark and Guernsey cows and Jesus talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour. In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.

Other buildings on the island include the White House hotel, &quot;The Mermaid&quot; pub and restaurant, and 20 self-catering cottages. The most notable cottages are Fisherman&#x27;s Cottage, north of the harbour, and Manor Cottage. There is an obelisk on The Common, in the north of the island. The White House has no clocks, televisions, or phones, which is described as &quot;part of its charm&quot;, and has a customer return rate of 70% (i.e. each year, 70% of customers have been before). Herm has no consecrated religious buildings or resident professional clergy, but visiting clergy conducts non-denominational weekly services during the summer months, and monthly services, led by local lay people, are held during the winter.

Sculptor Antony Gormley had a sculpture installed on Herm in 2010, originally planned to be removed after one year, but it received such a positive reception that it was kept for two years, and removed in 2012. The statue was number XI (11) of the Another Time series.

===Walking around Herm===
The distance around the perimeter of the island is and walking it takes about two hours. If one cuts across the common the distance is and takes about an hour and a half. One can walk from the harbour to Rosaire Steps in about seven minutes. The walk from the harbour to Shell Beach takes about 20 minutes and from the harbour to Belvoir Bay it takes about 15 minutes. One can also walk in between Belvoir Bay and Shell Beach along the rocky eastern coast of the island. Beginning at the rock pools at Belvoir Bay&#x27;s northern end, the route passes below the round-island path, and the walk takes about 20 minutes but does not follow a marked path.

Film of walking around Herm in 1948 is held by the Cinema Museum in London Ref HM0364 

== Education and culture ==

A number of French/Norman place names remain, from the period when the island was in the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Normandy. The Herm Island map, published by the tenant of Herm, states that main place names, including the island name itself, have unclear origins, although there is an unofficial Anglicisation of names; for example, was changed to &quot;Alderney Point&quot;. The primary present language on Herm is English.

Herm has one primary school, with around eight pupils; their teacher travels from Guernsey daily. Children over eleven are schooled in Guernsey, usually as boarders.

Herm has won Britain in Bloom categories several times: in 2002, 2008, and 2012, Herm won the Britain in Bloom Gold Award.

The island and its history has been depicted in a number of works of literature: the author Compton Mackenzie, who was the island tenant 1920–23, represented it in &quot;Fairy Gold&quot;, albeit in a fictional portrayal. Jenny Wood, the wife of tenant Major Peter Wood, published her memoirs in 1986. The island&#x27;s history is told in &quot;Hidden Treasures of Herm Island&quot; by Catherine Kalamis. Paul Sherman has written two collections of short stories set on the island: &quot;Where Seagulls Dare&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Puffin&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

The northern part of the island was recognised in 2016 as an area of international environmental importance under the Ramsar Convention.

<text>The Rechabites () were a Biblical clan, the descendants of Rechab through Jehonadab.

==Biblical sources==
One theory is the Rechabites belonged to the Kenites, who accompanied the Israelites into the Holy Land and dwelt among them; the sources of information are few and unclear. Kenites dwelt in cities and adopted settled habits of life. Whoever he was, Jehonadab ben Rechab forbade his descendants to drink wine, to own land or vineyards, or to live in cities. They were commanded to always lead a nomadic life.

The Rechabites adhered to the law laid down by Jehonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah; and this feature of their character is referred to by God for the purpose of giving point to his message to the King of Judah. As a reward for their fidelity, God proclaims that there will always be a descendant of Jonadab in his service.

==Claims of descent from the Rechabites==
The Mekhilta tells a story—presumably dating to the late Second Temple period—of Rechabites, known as &quot;sons of water drinkers&quot; due to their abstention from wine.

Rabbi Halafta (1st–2nd centuries) was a descendant of the Rechabites.

The apocryphal &quot;Story of Zosimus&quot;, from late antiquity, details the journey of a monk named Zosimus to the &quot;Land of the Rechabites&quot;.

In 1839 the Reverend Joseph Wolff found in Yemen, near Sana&#x27;a, a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab; and in the late nineteenth century a Bedouin tribe was found near the Dead Sea who also professed to be descendants of Jehonadab.

Many Muslims still claim descent from Rechab, along with the nearly-universal claim of Arabs to be descended from Abraham through Ishmael (Ismail).

==Similar later groups==
The term Rechabites also refers to a religious order, similar in some ways to the Nazirites, and they are mentioned by Eusebius of Emesa. 

In more recent times, the name has been used by Christian groups keen to promote total abstinence from alcohol, such as the Independent Order of Rechabites.

<text>Luzon ( , ) is the largest and most populous island in the Philippines. Located in the northern portion of the Philippine archipelago, it is the economic and political center of the nation, being home to the country&#x27;s capital city, Manila, as well as Quezon City, the country&#x27;s most populous city. With a population of 64 million , it contains 52.5% of the country&#x27;s total population and is the 4th most populous island in the world. It is the 15th largest island in the world by land area.

&quot;Luzon&quot; may also refer to one of the three primary island groups in the country. In this usage, it includes the Luzon Mainland, the Batanes and Babuyan groups of islands to the north, Polillo Islands to the east, and the outlying islands of Catanduanes, Marinduque and Mindoro, among others, to the south. The islands of Masbate, Palawan and Romblon are also included, although these three are sometimes grouped with another of the island groups, the Visayas.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Luzon&quot; is thought to derive from &quot;lusong&quot;, a Tagalog word referring to a particular kind of large wooden mortar used in dehusking rice. A 2008 research paper by Eulito Bautista and Evelyn Javier provides an image of a lusong, explaining:

In old Latin, Italian, and Portuguese maps, the island is often called &quot;Luçonia&quot; or &quot;Luconia&quot;.

&quot;Luções,&quot; (also &quot;Luzones&quot; in Spanish) was a demonym used by Portuguese sailors in Malaysia during the early 1500s, referring to the Kapampangan and Tagalog people who lived in Manila Bay, which was then called &quot;Lusong&quot; (Kapampangan: &quot;Lusung&quot;, ), from which Luzon was also derived. The term was also used for Tagalog settlers in Southern Tagalog region, where they created intensive contact with the Kapampangans. Eventually, the term &quot;Luzones&quot; would refer to the settlers of Luzon island, and later on, would be exclusive to the peoples of Central Luzon.

==History==
=== Before European colonization ===
Before 1000 CE, the Tagalog, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan peoples of south and central Luzon had established several major coastal polities, notably Maynila, Tondo and Namayan. The oldest known Philippine document, written in 900, is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which names places in and around Manila Bay and also mentions Medan, a place in Indonesia. These coastal Philippine kingdoms were thalassocracies, based on trade with neighboring Asian political entities, and structured by leases between chiefs or lords (&quot;Datu&quot;) and paramount lords (&quot;Lakan&quot;) or Rajahs, by whom tributes were extracted and taxes were levied.

There was also a Buddhist polity known as Ma-i or Maidh, described in Chinese and Bruneian records in the 10th century, although its location is still unknown and scholars are divided on whether it is in modern-day Bay, Laguna or Bulalacao, Mindoro.

According to sources at the time, the trade in large native &quot;Ruson-tsukuri&quot; (literally &quot;Luzon-made&quot;, Japanese:) clay jars used for storing green tea and rice wine with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan potters had marked each jar with Baybayin letters denoting the particular urn used and the kiln the jars were manufactured in. Certain kilns were renowned over others; prices depended on the reputation of the kiln. Of this flourishing trade, the &quot;Burnay&quot; jars of Ilocos are the only large clay jar manufactured in Luzon today with origins from this time.

In the early 1300s the Chinese annals, &quot;Nanhai zhi&quot;, reported that Hindu Brunei invaded or administered Sarawak and Sabah as well as the Philippine kingdoms of Butuan, Sulu, and in Luzon: Ma-i (Mindoro) and Malilu 麻裏蘆 (present-day Manila); Shahuchong 沙胡重 (present-day Siocon or Zamboanga), Yachen 啞陳 Oton (Part of the Madja-as Kedatuan), and 文杜陵 Wenduling (present-day Mindanao), which would regain their independence at a later date.

In 1405, the Yongle Emperor appointed a Chinese governor of Luzon, Ko Ch&#x27;a-lao, during Zheng He&#x27;s voyages. China also had vassals among the leaders in the archipelago. China attained ascendancy in trade with the area in Yongle&#x27;s reign.Afterwards, some parts of Luzon were Islamized when the former Majapahit province of Poni broke free, converted to Islam, and imported Sharif Ali, a prince from Mecca who became the Sultan of Brunei, a nation that then expanded its realms from Borneo to the Philippines and set up the Kingdom of Maynila as its puppet-state. The invasion of Brunei spread Chinese royal descent like Ong Sum Ping&#x27;s kin and Arab dynasties too into the Philippines like the clan of Sultan Sharif Ali. However, other Luzon kingdoms resisted Islam, like Pangasinan. It had remained a tributary state of China and was a largely Sinified kingdom, which maintained trade with Japan. The Polity of Cainta also existed as a fortified city-state, armed with walls and cannons.

=== Interactions with the Portuguese ===
The Portuguese were the first European explorers who recorded it in their charts as &quot;Luçonia&quot; or &quot;Luçon&quot;, calling the inhabitants &quot;Luções&quot;. Edmund Roberts, who visited Luzon in the early 19th century, wrote that Luzon was &quot;discovered&quot; in 1521.

Many people from Luzon were employed within Portuguese Malacca. For example, the spice magnate Regimo de Raja, based in Malacca, was highly influential and was appointed as &quot;Temenggong&quot; (Sea Lord)—a governor and chief general responsible for overseeing of maritime trade—by the Portuguese. As &quot;Temenggong&quot;, de Raja was also the head of an armada which traded and protected commerce in the Indian Ocean, the Strait of Malacca, the South China Sea, and the medieval maritime principalities of the Philippines. His father and wife carried on his maritime trading business after his death. Another important Malacca trader was Curia de Raja who also hailed from Luzon. The &quot;surname&quot; of &quot;de Raja&quot; or &quot;diraja&quot; could indicate that Regimo and Curia, and their families, were of noble or royal descent as the term is an abbreviation of Sanskrit &quot;adiraja&quot;.

Fernão Mendes Pinto noted that a number of Luções in the Islamic fleets went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511. Antonio Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521. However, the Luções did not only fight on the side of the Muslims. Pinto says they were also apparently among the natives of the Philippines who fought the Muslims in 1538.

On Mainland Southeast Asia, Lusung/Luções warriors aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547. At the same time, Lusong warriors fought alongside the Siamese king and faced the same elephant army of the Burmese king in the defence of the Siamese capital at Ayutthaya. Luções military and trade activity reached as far as Sri Lanka in South Asia where Lungshanoid pottery made in Luzon were discovered in burials.

Scholars have thus suggested that they could be mercenaries valued by all sides.

=== Spanish Colonial Era ===
In 1569, a Spanish expedition dispatched by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi led by Luis Enriquez de Guzman and Augustinian friar Alonso Jimenez first set foot in Albay. They arrived on the coastal settlement called Ibalon in present-day Magallanes, Sorsogon after exploring the islands of Masbate, Ticao and Burias and proceeded inland as far as present-day Camalig, Albay. The Spanish arrival in the 16th century saw the incorporation of the Luções people and the breaking up of their kingdoms and the establishment of the &quot;Las Islas Filipinas&quot; with its capital Cebu, which was moved to Manila following the defeat of the local Rajah Sulayman in 1570. Martín de Goiti, having been dispatched by Legazpi to Luzon, conquered Maynila. Legazpi followed with a larger fleet comprising both Spanish and a majority Visayan force, taking a month to bring these forces to bear due to slow speed of local ships. This large force caused the surrender of neighboring Tondo. An attempt by some local leaders, known as the Tondo Conspiracy, to defeat the Spanish was repelled. Legazpi renamed Maynila &quot;Nueva Castilla&quot;, and declared it the capital of the Philippines, and thus of the rest of the Spanish East Indies, which also encompassed Spanish territories in Asia and the Pacific. Legazpi became the country&#x27;s first governor-general. Under Spain, Luzon also came to be known as the Nueva Castilla or the New Castile. The population of Luzon at the time of the first Spanish missions is estimated as between 1 and 1.5 million, overall density being low. Moros from western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago also raided the coastal Christian areas of Luzon and the Visayas. Settlers had to fight off the Chinese pirates (who lay siege to Manila, the most famous of which was Limahong in 1573).after the successful expedition and the exploration of the North, Juan de Salcedo founded &quot;Villa Fernandina de Vigan&quot; in honor of King Philip II&#x27;s son, Prince Ferdinand, who died at the age of four. From Vigan, Salcedo rounded the tip of Luzón and proceeded to pacify Camarines, Albay, and Catanduanes. As a reward for his services to the King of Spain, Salcedo was awarded the old province of Ilocos, which consisted of the modern provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, La Union and part of Mountain Province as his hacienda (estate), and was accorded the title of &quot;Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos&quot; (Province Mayor of Ilocos).

In Spanish times, Luzon became the focal point for trade between the Americas and Asia. The Manila Galleons constructed in the Bicol region brought silver mined from Peru and Mexico to Manila. The silver was used to purchase Asian commercial goods like Chinese silk, Indian gems and Indonesian spices, which were then exported back to the Americas. The Chinese valued Luzon so much, in that when talking about Spain and the 

Spanish-Americas, they preferred to call it as &quot;Dao Lusong&quot; (Greater Luzon) while the original Luzon was referred to as &quot;Xiao (Small) Lusong&quot; to refer to not only Luzon but the whole Philippines.

Luzon also became a focal point for global migration. The walled city of Intramuros was initially founded by 1200 Spanish families. The nearby district of Binondo became the center of business and transformed into the world&#x27;s oldest Chinatown. There was also a smaller district reserved for Japanese migrants in Dilao. Cavite City also served as the main port for Luzon and many Mexican soldiers and sailors were stationed in the naval garrisons there. When the Spanish evacuated from Ternate, Indonesia; they settled the Papuan refugees in Ternate, Cavite which was named after their evacuated homeland. After the short British Occupation of Manila, the Indian Sepoy soldiers that mutinied against their British commanders and joined the Spanish, then settled in Cainta, Rizal.

Newcomers who were impoverished Mexicans and peninsulares were accused of undermining the submission of the natives. In 1774, authorities from Bulacan, Tondo, Laguna Bay, and other areas surrounding Manila reported with consternation that discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British war. There was also continuous immigration of Tamils and Bengalis into the rural areas of Luzon: Spanish administrators, native nobles, and Chinese businessmen imported them as slave labor during this period.

In the 1600s, Fr. Joaqin Martinez de Zuñiga, conducted a census of the Archdiocese of Manila which held most of Luzon under its spiritual care, and it had the following number of tributes, with each tribute representing a family of 6-7, and he reported 90,243 native Filipino tributes; 10,512 Chinese (Sangley) and mixed Chinese Filipino mestizo tributes; and 10,517 mixed Spanish Filipino mestizo tributes. Pure Spaniards are not counted as they are exempt from tribute. Out of these, Fr. Joaqin Martinez de Zuñiga estimated a total population count exceeding half a million souls.

People from the Philippines, primarily from Luzon, were recruited by France (then in alliance with Spain), first to defend Indo-Chinese converts to Christianity being persecuted by their native governments. Eventually, Filipino mercenaries helped the French conquer Vietnam and Laos and to re-establish Cambodia as a French Protectorate. This process culminated in the establishment of French Cochinchina, centered in Saigon.

A great number of infrastructure projects were undertaken during the 19th century that put the Philippine economy and standard of living ahead of most of its Asian neighbors and even many European countries at that time. Among them were a railway system for Luzon, a tramcar network for Manila, and Asia&#x27;s first steel suspension bridge Puente Claveria, later called Puente Colgante.

=== After Spanish colonization ===
After many years of Spanish occupation and resistance to reform, the Andres Novales uprising occurred and it was inspired by the Latin American Wars of Independence. Novales&#x27; uprising was primarily supported by Mexicans living in the Philippines as well as immigrant Latinos from the now independent nations of Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Costa Rica. Although the uprising failed it inspired the Cavite Mutiny, the suppression of which, lead to the martyrdoms of Priests, Gomburza and the subsequent execution of the reformist and hero, Jose Rizal. Reeling against this, the Philippine Revolution against Spain erupted in Cavite and spread all throughout Luzon and the Philippines. Consequently, the First Philippine Republic was established in Malolos, Bulacan. In the meantime, Spain sold the Philippines to the United States and the First Philippine Republic resisted the United States in the Philippine–American War which the Republic&#x27;s forces lost due to its diplomatic isolation (no foreign nation recognized the First Republic) as well as due to the numerical superiority of the American military. The Americans then set up the cool mountain city of Baguio as a summer retreat for its officials. The Americans also rebuilt the capital, Manila, and established American military bases in Olongapo and Angeles cities mainly Clark Airbase and Subic Naval Base.

During the Pacific War, the Philippines were considered to be of great strategic importance because their capture by Japan would pose a significant threat to the U.S. As a result, 135,000 troops and 227 aircraft were stationed in the Philippines by October 1941. Luzon was captured by Imperial Japanese forces in 1942 during their campaign to capture the Philippines. General Douglas MacArthur—who was in charge of the defense of the Philippines at the time—was ordered to Australia, and the remaining U.S. forces retreated to the Bataan Peninsula.

A few months after this, MacArthur expressed his belief that an attempt to recapture the Philippines was necessary. The U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Chester Nimitz and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King both opposed this idea, arguing that it must wait until victory was certain. MacArthur had to wait two years for his wish; it was 1944 before a campaign to recapture the Philippines was launched. The island of Leyte was the first objective of the campaign, which was captured by the end of December 1944. This was followed by the attack on Mindoro and later, Luzon.

The end of the World War necessitated decolonization due to rising nationalist movements across the world&#x27;s many colonies. Subsequently, the Philippines gained independence from the United States. Luzon then arose to become the most developed island in the Philippines. However, the lingering poverty and inequality caused by the long dictatorship of US-supported dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, gave rise to the Philippine diaspora and many people from Luzon have migrated elsewhere and had established large overseas communities; mainly in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. Eventually, the People Power Revolution led by Corazon Aquino and Cardinal Jaime Sin, removed Marcos and his cronies from power and they fled to Hawaii where the US granted them asylum. The following administrations are subsequently managing the political and economic recovery of the Philippines with the particular aim of spreading development outside of Luzon and into the more isolated provinces of the Visayas and Mindanao. During the administration of Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; son, Bongbong Marcos, Luzon became a destination of American and Japanese investments, it being the location of the Luzon Economic Corridor.

==Geography==

Luzon island alone has an area of , making it the world&#x27;s 15th largest island. It is bordered on the west by the South China Sea (&quot;Luzon Sea&quot; in Philippine territorial waters), on the east by the Philippine Sea, and on the north by the Luzon Strait containing the Babuyan Channel and Balintang Channel. The mainland is roughly rectangular in shape and has the long Bicol Peninsula protruding to the southeast.

Luzon is roughly divided into four sections; Northern Luzon, Central Luzon, Southern Luzon, and Southeastern Luzon.

===Physical===
==== Northern Luzon ====
The northwestern portion of the island, which encompasses most of the Ilocos Region, is characterized by a flat terrain extending east from the coastline toward the Cordillera Central mountains.

The Cordillera mountain range, which feature the island&#x27;s north-central section, is covered in a mixture of tropical pine forests and montane rainforests, and is the site of the island&#x27;s highest mountain, Mount Pulag, rising at 2,922 metres. The range provides the upland headwaters of the Agno River, which stretches from the slopes of Mount Data, and meanders along the southern Cordillera mountains before reaching the plains of Pangasinan.

The northeastern section of Luzon is generally mountainous, with the Sierra Madre, the longest mountain range in the country, abruptly rising a few miles from the coastline. Located in between the Sierra Madre and the Cordillera Central mountain ranges is the large Cagayan Valley. This region, which is known for being the second largest producer of rice and the country&#x27;s top corn-producer, serves as the basin for the Cagayan River, the longest in the Philippines.

Along the southern limits of the Cordillera Central lies the lesser-known Caraballo Mountains. These mountains form a link between the Cordillera Central and the Sierra Madre mountain ranges, separating the Cagayan Valley from the Central Luzon plains.

===== Image gallery =====
==== Central Luzon ====

The central section of Luzon is characterized by a flat terrain, known as the Central Luzon plain, the largest in the island in terms of land area. The plain, approximately in size, is the country&#x27;s largest producer of rice, and is irrigated by two major rivers; the Cagayan to the north, and the Pampanga to the south. In the middle of the plain rises the solitary Mount Arayat.

The western coasts of Central Luzon are typically flat extending east from the coastline to the Zambales Mountains, the site of Mount Pinatubo, made famous because of its enormous 1991 eruption. These mountains extend to the sea in the north, forming Lingayen Gulf, and to the south, forming the Bataan Peninsula. The peninsula encloses Manila Bay, a natural harbor considered to be one of the best natural ports in East Asia, due to its size and strategic geographical location.

The Sierra Madre mountain range continues to stretch across the western section of Central Luzon, snaking southwards into the Bicol Peninsula.

==== Southern Luzon ====
Southern Luzon is dominated by Laguna de Bay (Old Spanish, &quot;Lake of Bay town&quot;), the largest lake in the country. The lake is drained into Manila Bay by the Pasig River, one of the most important rivers in the country due to its historical significance and because it runs through the center of Metro Manila.

Located southwest of Laguna de Bay is Taal Lake, a crater lake containing the Taal Volcano, the smallest in the country. The environs of the lake form the upland Tagaytay Ridge, which was once part of a massive prehistoric volcano that covered the southern portion of the province of Cavite and the whole of Batangas province.

South of Laguna Lake are two solitary mountains, Mount Makiling in Laguna and Batangas provinces, and Mount Banahaw, the highest in the region of Calabarzon.

==== Southeastern Luzon ====
The southeastern portion of Luzon is dominated by the Bicol Peninsula, a mountainous and narrow region extending approximately southeast from the Tayabas Isthmus in Quezon province to the San Bernardino Strait along the coasts of Sorsogon. The area is home to several volcanoes, the most famous of which is the high symmetrically shaped Mayon Volcano in Albay province. The Sierra Madre range has its southern limits at Quezon province. Ultra-prominent mountains dot the landscape, which include Mount Isarog and Mount Iriga in Camarines Sur, and Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon.

The peninsula&#x27;s coastline features several smaller peninsulas, gulfs and bays, which include Lamon Bay, San Miguel Bay, Lagonoy Gulf, Ragay Gulf, and Sorsogon Bay.

==== Outlying islands ====
Several outlying islands near mainland Luzon are considered part of the Luzon island group.
The largest include Palawan, Mindoro, Masbate, Catanduanes, Marinduque, Romblon and Polillo.

===Administrative divisions===
The island is covered by 8 administrative regions, 30 provinces and, , 68 cities (8 regions, 38 provinces and 71 cities if associated islands are included).


Table note(s):

===Tectonics===
Luzon is part of the Philippine Mobile Belt, a fast deforming plate boundary zone (Gervasio, 1967) hemmed in between two opposing subduction zones, the west-dipping Philippine Trench-East Luzon Trench subduction zone, and the east-dipping north–south trending Manila Trench-Negros Trench-Cotabato Trench. The Philippine Sea Plate subducts under eastern Luzon along the East Luzon Trench and the Philippine Trench, while the South China Sea basin, part of the Eurasian Plate, subducts under western Luzon along the Manila Trench.

The North-Southeastern trending braided left-lateral strike-slip Philippine Fault System traverses Luzon, from Quezon province and Bicol to the northwestern part of the island. This fault system takes up part of the motion due to the subducting plates and produces large earthquakes. Southwest of Luzon is a collision zone where the Palawan micro-block collides with SW Luzon, producing a highly seismic zone near Mindoro island. Southwest Luzon is characterized by a highly volcanic zone, called the Macolod Corridor, a region of crustal thinning and spreading.

Using geologic and structural data, seven principal blocks were identified in Luzon in 1989: the Sierra Madre Oriental, Angat, Zambales, Central Cordillera of Luzon, Bicol, and Catanduanes Island blocks. Using seismic and geodetic data, Luzon was modeled by Galgana et al. (2007) as a series of six micro blocks or micro plates (separated by subduction zones and intra-arc faults), all translating and rotating in different directions, with maximum velocities ~100 mm/yr NW with respect to Sundaland/Eurasia.

==Demographics==

As of the 2015 census, the population of Luzon Island is 57,470,097 people, making it the 4th most populated island in the world.

===Cities===

Metro Manila is the most populous of the 3 defined metropolitan areas in the Philippines and the 11th most populous in the world. , census data showed it had a population of 11,553,427, comprising 13% of the national population. Including suburbs in the adjacent provinces (Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal) of Greater Manila, the population is around 21 million.


===Ethnic groups===

Seven major Philippine ethnolinguistic groups predominate Luzon. Ilocanos and Pangasinenses dominate northern Luzon, particularly in the Ilocos Region to parts of the Cagayan Valley, while Kapampangans, Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Sambals populate Central Luzon. Tagalogs dominate the National Capital Region, Calabarzon and the island provinces of Marinduque, Mindoro and extending to parts of Palawan and northern Bicol Peninsula, while Bicolanos populate the Bicol peninsula. Visayans, such as Masbateños, Romblomanons, Waray Sorsogonons, Cuyunons, mainly populate in the southern Bicol peninsula and island provinces of Masbate, Romblon, and Palawan.

Other ethnic groups lesser in population include the Aetas of Zambales and Bataan, the Ibanags of Cagayan and Isabela, the Gaddang of Nueva Vizcaya, the Igorot of the Cordilleras, and the Mangyans of Mindoro.

Due to historical centuries-old migrations, populations of ethnic Chinese Filipinos, Spanish Filipinos, Japanese Filipinos, Indian Filipinos, and Muslim Moros from Mindanao have also been present in urban areas. Historical mixed mestizo populations, particularly Chinese mestizos (&quot;mestizo de Sangley&quot;) and Spanish mestizos, and more recent mixed mesitzos of Americans, Japanese, Koreans, Indians (mostly Punjabis), and Arabs are also occasionally present. The historical Sangley Chinese and their pure and mixed-mestizo descendants are spread all across Luzon of several generations across the centuries. According to old Spanish censuses, around 1/3rd of the population of Luzon are mestizo admixed with either or both Southern Han Chinese (mostly from Manila to Pampanga) and/or Hispanic (Spanish or Latino) descent (Mostly in Cavite and Manila). Most Americans have settled in Central Luzon&#x27;s highly urbanized cities of Angeles and Olongapo due to the former presence of the U.S. air and naval bases (Clark &amp; Subic) there, while a majority of the Koreans and Japanese have mainly settled in the major cities and towns like Koreatown in Angeles City and Baguio and Subic.

===Languages===
Almost all of the languages of Luzon belong to the Philippine group of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Major regional languages include: Tagalog, Ilocano, Central Bikol, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan.

English is spoken by many inhabitants. The use of Spanish as an official language declined following the American occupation of the Philippines. Almost inexistent among the general populace, Spanish is still used by the elderly of some families of great tradition (Rizal, Liboro...).

===Religion===


Like most of the Philippines, the major religion in Luzon is Christianity, with Roman Catholicism being the major denomination. Other major sects includes Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Protestantism, the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayans), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and the Iglesia ni Cristo. Indigenous traditions and rituals, though rare, are also present.

There are also sizable communities of Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims in Metro Manila and in other, especially, urban areas due to the immigration of Indians, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Moros and Muslims from other countries to the island.

==Economy==
The economy of the island is centered in Metro Manila with Makati serving as the main economic and financial hub. Major companies such as Ayala, Jollibee Foods Corporation, SM Group, and Metrobank are based in the business hubs of Makati Central Business District, Ortigas Center, and Bonifacio Global City. Industry is concentrated in and around the urban areas of Metro Manila while agriculture predominates in the other regions of the island producing crops such as rice, bananas, mangoes, coconuts, pineapple, and coffee. Other sectors include livestock raising, tourism, mining, and fishing.

<text>In the Hebrew Bible and in the Old Testament, the word ranges has two very different meanings.

==Leviticus==
In Leviticus 11:35, ranges (כירים) probably means a cooking furnace for two or more pots, as the Hebrew word here is in the dual number; or perhaps a fireplace fitted to receive a pair of ovens.

==2 Kings==
In 2 Kings 11:8, the Hebrew word is here different from the preceding: שדרות, meaning &quot;ranks of soldiers.&quot; The Levites were appointed to guard the king&#x27;s person within the temple (2 Chronicles 23:7), while the soldiers were his guard in the court, and in going from the temple to the palace. The soldiers are here commanded to slay any one who should break through the &quot;ranks&quot; (as rendered in the Revised Version) to come near the king. 

In 2 Kings 11:15, the expression, &quot;Have her forth without the ranges (לשדרת),&quot; is in the Revised Version, &quot;Have her forth between the ranks;&quot; i.e., Jehoiada orders that Athaliah should be kept surrounded by his own guards, and at the same time conveyed beyond the precincts of the temple.

<text>Ramoth-Gilead (, meaning &quot;Heights of Gilead&quot;), was a Levitical city and city of refuge east of the Jordan River in the Hebrew Bible, also called &quot;Ramoth in Gilead&quot; (; ; ) or &quot;Ramoth Galaad&quot; in the Douay–Rheims Bible. It was located in the tribal territorial allotment of the tribe of Gad.

==Biblical events==
According to (), Ramoth-Gilead was the base of Ben-Geber, one of King Solomon&#x27;s regional governors. He was responsible for (&quot;to him belonged&quot;) the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, in Gilead and the region of Argob in Bashan: sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars.

It appears to have been lost to Syria (Aram-Damascus) during the battles between the northern kingdom of Israel and Syria, as Ahab, King of Israel, proposed to go to battle to win it back. After consulting prophets about the prospects of success, Ahab went to fight for Ramoth in Gilead, aided by Jehoshaphat, King of Judah. During the battle, Ahab was wounded by an arrow. He was propped up in his chariot facing the enemy, but by evening Ahab had bled to death and the Syrians won the battle.

Later, an incident occurred when Ahaziah and Joram fought against Hazael, king of Aram-Damascus, and Joram was wounded (2 Kings 8:28).

Also in this city, Elisha, the prophet of God told one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, Joram&#x27;s commander, king over Israel ().

The British Bible scholar, Hugh J. Schonfield theorized that the location of Armageddon, mentioned only in the New Testament, at (), is a Greek garbling of a supposed late Aramaic name for Ramoth-Gilead; that this location, having anciently belonged to the Hebrew tribe of Gad, was, in New Testament times, part of the Greek region known as the Decapolis, it was (Schonfield theorized) known as &quot;Rama-Gad-Yavan&quot; (Yavan meaning Greek), which when translated into Greek became Armageddon (much as Ramathaim was translated to Aramathea).

==Location==
It has been tentatively identified with Reimun, on the northern slope of the Zarqa River, about west of Jerash or Gerasa, one of the cities of the Decapolis.

Other possible locations include:
#Tell er-Rumeith, about 3 miles south of ar-Ramtha, Jordan
#as-Salt.

<doc id="69383" wikidata="Q1014993" url="?curid=69383" title="Burgh Island">
<text>Burgh Island is a tidal island on the coast of South Devon in England near the small seaside village of Bigbury-on-Sea. There are several buildings on the island, the largest being the Art Deco Burgh Island Hotel. The other buildings are three private houses, and a pub, the Pilchard Inn, which dates to the 14th century. The island is strongly associated with writer Agatha Christie, who often visited and used the island and its hotel as a setting and inspiration for two famous novels: &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1939) and &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1941).

== History ==

Archaeological discovery of tin ingots at the River Erme estuary wreck show that the local area was a significant tin trading port in ancient times; it is unclear whether the ingots date from the Iron Age or Sub-Roman periods, however this discovery so close to Burgh Island has drawn comparisons with Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s 1st century BCE text, more often associated with St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall:

The island has been known by various names over the years. Early records and maps mention it as St Michael&#x27;s Island. The name later changed to Borough Island, eventually shortened to Burgh. As late as 1947 an Ordnance Survey map refers to the island as Borough Island. In 1908 a postcard produced by Stengel &amp; Co Ltd of London referred to it as Burr Island. A map published in 1765 shows &quot;Borough or Bur Isle&quot;.
It is believed a monastery was established on the island, most of the remains of which may lie beneath the current hotel. The ancient &quot;Pilchard Inn&#x27;s&quot; history dates to 1336 and may have started life as the guest lodgings for the monastery.

A small, possibly transient, population of fishermen occupied the island following the dissolution of the monastery, specialising in pilchard fishing. There are the remains of a chapel atop the island, which later became a &quot;huers hut&quot; — a place where fishermen would make a &quot;hue and cry&quot; call to inform other fishermen of shoals of pilchards. During this period, smuggling, wrecking, and piracy were common, benefiting from a natural barrier for half the day.

Fear that German landing forces might use the island as a beachhead during World War II resulted in the area&#x27;s fortification with anti-tank defences and two pillboxes, positioned on both sides of the causeway. An observation post was also established on the summit to monitor the coastline.

A beach house was built for Agatha Christie as a writer&#x27;s retreat and still exists on the island.
==The hotel==

Burgh Island is well-known today as the location of a restored 1930s Art Deco-style hotel.

== Notable setting and visitors==
Burgh Island is closely linked to Agatha Christie, as it served as the inspirational setting for Soldier Island (&quot;And Then There Were None&quot;) and for the setting of the Hercule Poirot mystery &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot;. The 2002 TV adaptation of &quot;Evil Under The Sun&quot; used the island as a filming location. In 1994 an episode of the television series &quot;Lovejoy&quot; was set and filmed on the island, entitled &quot;Somewhere - Over the Rainbow?&quot; Several scenes from the BBC&#x27;s 1987 dramatisation of Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple mystery, &quot;Nemesis,&quot; were also filmed in the hotel.

The hotel, with its Art Deco styling, was also a bolt hole in the 1930s for some of London&#x27;s rich and famous, including Noël Coward. The hotel has had many other famous visitors, from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to The Beatles.

The island was also the location for GMTV&#x27;s &quot;Inch-loss Island&quot; slimming feature in 2008, as it was for the original series in 2001. The climactic scene of the 1965 British film &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; (featuring The Dave Clark Five) takes place at the island.

English singer-songwriter Ben Howard&#x27;s 2012 EP was named after the island.

==Transport==

The island is approximately from the mainland at Bigbury-on-Sea and is approachable on foot at low tide. At high tide, the sea tractor, which is operated by the hotel, transports passengers back and forth. The original vehicle was constructed in 1930 (see 1933 photo); the current third generation tractor dates from 1969. The vehicle drives across the beach with its wheels underwater on the sandy bottom while its driver and passengers sit on a platform high above. Power from a Fordson tractor engine is relayed to the wheels via hydraulic motors.

==Footpaths==
The island has an extensive network of footpaths and the owner until 2003 was a keen hiker who welcomed walkers. The new owners, however, erected signs closing footpaths and obtained an exemption from the public &quot;rights to roam&quot; enabled in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The exemption was overturned, except for the routes closest to the hotel, in 2006.

==Sale==
In April 2018, the owners of the island, Deborah Clark and Tony Orchard, announced that the island had been bought by &quot;Project Archie&quot;, a joint venture between Bluehone Capital and Marechale Capital, for an undisclosed sum.

In May 2023, the island went up for sale again.

<doc id="69385" wikidata="Q1135632" url="?curid=69385" title="Rahab">
<text>Rahab (; ) was, according to the Book of Joshua, a Gentile and a Canaanite woman who resided within Jericho in the Promised Land and assisted the Israelites by hiding two men who had been sent to scout the city prior to their attack. In the New Testament, she is lauded both as an example of a saint who lived by faith, and as someone &quot;considered righteous&quot; for her works. According to biblical research, the author intended that she did not actually contribute in conquering the city, but rather saved herself and her family from death by the Israelites&#x27; forces.

The King James Version renders the name as &quot;Rachab&quot;, after its literal spelling in Greek, which differs from the spelling for Rahab in James and Hebrews. Most modern versions render it as &quot;Rahab&quot; ignoring the distinction.

==Rahab&#x27;s profession==
The Hebrew אשה זונה (&quot;ishah zonah&quot;), used to describe Rahab in , literally means &quot;a prostitute woman&quot;. While the Talmud holds to that interpretation, some sources in Rabbinic literature insists that she was an &quot;innkeeper,&quot; based on Targum Jonathan and other texts (). Rahab&#x27;s name is presumably the shortened form of a sentence name &quot;rāḥāb-N&quot;, &quot;the god &quot;N&quot; has opened/widened (the womb?)&quot;. The Hebrew &quot;zōnâ&quot; may refer to secular or cultic prostitution, and the latter is widely believed to have been an invariable element of Canaanite religion, although recent scholarship has disputed this. However, there was a separate word, &quot;qǝdēšâ&quot;, that could be used to designate ritual prostitutes.

Josephus mentions that Rahab kept an inn but is silent as to whether merely renting out rooms was her only source of income. It was not uncommon for both an inn and a brothel to operate within the same building; thus entering Rahab&#x27;s quarters was not necessarily a deviation from Joshua&#x27;s orders. Indeed, as Robert Boling notes, such an establishment might have represented an ideal location for spies to gather intelligence. A number of scholars have noted that the narrator in Joshua 2 may have intended to remind the readers of the &quot;immemorial symbiosis between military service and bawdy house&quot;.

In the Christian New Testament, the Epistle of James and the Epistle to the Hebrews follow the tradition set by the translators of the Septuagint in using the Greek word &quot;πόρνη&quot; (&quot;pórnē&quot;, which is usually translated to English as &quot;harlot&quot; or &quot;prostitute&quot;) to describe Rahab.

William L. Lyons observed that biblical interpreters have viewed Rahab as a model of hospitality, mercy, faith, patience, and repentance in her interaction with Joshua&#x27;s spies. Thus the harlot of Jericho became a paragon of virtue.

== In the Hebrew Bible ==

According to the book of Joshua, when the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim in the Arabah or Jordan Valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to investigate the military strength of Jericho. The spies stayed in Rahab&#x27;s house, which was built into the city wall. The soldiers sent to capture the spies asked Rahab to bring out the spies. Instead, she hid them under bundles of flax on the roof. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that &quot;the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then&quot;.

Rahab told the spies: 

After escaping, the spies promised to spare Rahab and her family after taking the city, even if there should be a massacre, if she would mark her house by hanging a red cord out the window. Some have claimed that the symbol of the red cord is related to the practice of the red-light district.

When the city of Jericho fell, Rahab and her whole family were preserved according to the promise of the spies and were incorporated among the Jewish people. According to some rabbinic authorities, Rahab was treated as a beautiful captive woman in order to bring her into a marital union with Israel. (In siege warfare of antiquity, a city that fell after a prolonged siege was commonly subjected to a massacre and sack, while others taken captive.)

Tikva Frymer-Kensky regards Rahab as &quot;smart, proactive, tricky and unafraid to disobey and deceive her king&quot;. She also credits Rahab with being &quot;one of Israel’s early saviors&quot; due to &quot;her allegiance to God and Israel&quot;. As the first non-Israelite person, and in particular the first Canaanite woman, to ally with Israel, Rahab&#x27;s convictions led her to protect the men sent by Joshua despite her background.

Michael Coogan says the book of Joshua, more than any other book of the Bible, contains short etiological narratives that explain the origins of religious rituals, topographical features, genealogical relationships, and other aspects of ancient Israelite life, and that the legend of Rahab is such an example. The story of Rahab would therefore provide an answer as to how a Canaanite group became part of Israel in spite of the Deuteronomistic injunction to kill all Canaanites and not to intermarry with them.

Some scholars see the parallels between Joshua 2 and Genesis 19, which narrates the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, Jericho was presumed to be equally as wicked, with Rahab challenging Jericho&#x27;s &quot;oppressive establishment&quot; by siding with Jericho&#x27;s destroyers (i.e. the Israelites). Coincidentally, these cities were believed to lie among a major fault line extending 1,100 kilometers from the Red Sea to Turkey.

== In rabbinic literature ==
In the midrash, Rahab is named as one of the four most beautiful women the world has ever known, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther. In the Babylonian Talmud, Rahab was so beautiful that the very mention of her name could cause arousal (&quot;Megillah&quot; 15a). Rahab is said to have converted at the age of 50, after practising prostitution for 40 years, and repented according to three sins, saying:

A similar tradition has Rahab declaring, &quot;Pardon me by merit of the rope, the window, and the flaxen [the stalks of flax under which she concealed the spies].&quot;

Because of this, rabbis interpret Biblical verses that talk about the citizens of Jericho &quot;melting in fear&quot;, such as and , as describing their inability to maintain erections upon hearing Israelite military victories. Rahab knew this because &quot;there was no minister or prince that did not pay a visit to Rahab the harlot&quot;.

The rabbis viewed Rahab as a worthy convert to Judaism, and attested that following her conversion, Rahab married Salmon ( &quot;Śalmōn&quot;), also called Salmah (שַׂלְמָה &quot;Śalmā&quot;, ), and their descendants included the prophets Jeremiah, Hilkiah, Seraiah, Mahseiah, Baruch, Ezekiel and the prophetess Hulda, although there is no report in the book of Joshua of the leader marrying anyone, or having any family life. Rahab often is mentioned alongside Jethro (Yitro) and Na&#x27;aman as &quot;positive examples&quot; of the converts who joined Israel, and another midrash has Rahab acting as an advocate for all nations of the world.

Some believe that the genealogies described in and served to dispel accusations that Jeremiah and Ezekiel were descendants of Rahab. At the time, the Israelites discriminated against these prophets for this alleged heritage.

==In the New Testament==
In the New Testament, Rahab (Greek &quot;Ῥαάβ&quot;) of the Book of Joshua is mentioned as an example of a person of faith and of good works. Rahab is referred to as &quot;the harlot&quot; in each of these passages.

A different spelling of the name, &quot;Rachab&quot; (as transliterated in the King James translation of the Greek &quot;Ῥαχάβ&quot;) is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew as one of the ancestors of Jesus (Matthew 1:5). She married Salmon of the Tribe of Judah and was the mother of Boaz. Most other English Bibles transcribe her name as &quot;Rahab&quot;.

==In fiction==
* Rahab is depicted as a virtuous soul (in The Third Circle of Heaven) in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (Paradiso 9.112 ff.)
*Rahab is a figure in the mythos of William Blake. She is pictured as a harlot, akin to the whore of Babylon, and figures alongside Blake&#x27;s character of Tirzah, as representing materialism, false religion, and fallen sexuality. Rahab&#x27;s embrace of Urizen, who loosely represents fallen reason, is seen as the consolidation of error necessary to bring about the Final Judgment.
* The claim of Hugh Broughton, a controversial historian, that Rahab was already &quot;a harlot at ten years of age&quot; is used by Humbert Humbert to explain or perhaps justify his attraction to young girls in Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot;.

<text>Groote Eylandt (Anindilyakwa: &quot;Ayangkidarrba&quot;; meaning &quot;island&quot; ) is the largest island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and the fourth largest island in Australia. It was named by the explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 and is Dutch for &quot;Large Island&quot; in archaic spelling. The modern Dutch spelling is &quot;Groot Eiland&quot;.

The original inhabitants of Groote Eylandt are the Anindilyakwa, an Aboriginal Australian people, who speak the Anindilyakwa language (also known as Amamalya Ayakwa). They consist of 14 clan groups which make up the two moieties on the island. The clans maintain their traditions and have strong ties with the people in the community of Numbulwar and on Bickerton Island. The island&#x27;s population was 2,811 in the 2016 census.

There are four communities on Groote Eylandt. The mining company GEMCO established the township of Alyangula for its workers. The three main Aboriginal communities are Angurugu and Umbakumba, and Milyakburra on Bickerton Island. There are also a number of outstations on the island.

The Anindilyakwa Land Council is one of four land councils in the Northern Territory. It is a representative body with statutory authority under the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976&quot; and has responsibilities under the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; and the &quot;Pastoral Land Act 1992&quot;.

== Geography ==
Groote Eylandt lies about offshore from the Northern Territory mainland (i.e. the east coast of Arnhem Land), about from Darwin, opposite Blue Mud Bay. The island measures about from east to west and from north to south; its area is . It is generally quite low-lying, with an average height above sea level of , although Central Hill reaches an elevation of .

== Politics and administration ==

=== Electorates ===
Groote Eylandt is part of the federal electorate of Lingiari, for which the current member is Marion Scrymgour, who replaced the inaugural member Warren Snowdon at the 2022 Australian federal election. The island is within the Northern Territory electoral division of Arnhem. The current member for Arnhem is Labor Party member Selena Uibo, whose mother is a Nunggubuyu and Anindilyakwa woman.

=== Local government ===
With Bickerton Island and a few smaller satellite islands, Groote Eylandt forms Anindilyakwa Ward of East Arnhem Region. It contains the communities of Angurugu, Alyangula, Umbakumba, Yadagba District, Uburamudja District and Sandy Hill (Groote Eylandt) and Milyakburra District (Bickerton Island).

Outside the local government, subdivision is the mining company GEMCO town of Alyangula, an unincorporated territory within the Northern Region of Northern Territory.

==Environment==
The whole of Groote Eylandt and its surrounding waters lie within the Anindilyakwa Indigenous Protected Area. BirdLife International has classified an unnamed islet off the north-eastern coast as an important bird area because of its global importance as a roseate tern breeding site.

Groote Eylandt has a variety of habitats: dense stands on monsoon forests rising behind coastal sand dunes, alternating with mangrove and mudflats. Sandstone outcrops and laterite provide excellent niches for shellfish.

=== Fauna ===
The island hosts 27 species of native mammal, making it the third most mammal diverse Australian island after Melville Island and Tasmania.

=== Fishing ===
Until recently, the island had been open to the public only with permission, and the local Aboriginal Land Council did not encourage tourism. There is now a resort-style hotel on the island, and visitors are welcome. The island is becoming renowned for its fine Aboriginal rock art sites, arts and crafts and outstanding sport-fishing, including sailfish, marlin, tuna, Spanish mackerel, giant trevally, queenfish, and coral trout.

== History ==
=== Traditional owners ===
The traditional owners of Groote Eylandt, the Anindilyakwa people, have 14 clan groups, which make up the two moieties on Groote Eylandt. The Anindilyakwa people have inhabited the island for thousands of years. The clans maintain their traditions and have strong ties with the people in the community of Numbulwar and on Bickerton Island.

In 1856, the Jurambunga tribe, a local aboriginal conglomerate would regularly pass the island.

=== Macassan traders ===
There had been regular contact between local Aboriginal people and Macassan traders who would visit the area searching for trepang from around the early to mid-1700s. They introduced culinary delights such as tamarinds, chilli and beer. The trade continued until the Australian Government introduced the White Australia Policy in 1906.

There is still evidence of the Macassans, such as the wild tamarind trees, which the traders introduced to the area. Some Groote Eylandt settlements, such as Umbakumba, can trace their names back to Macassan origin.

=== Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) ===
The first recorded European sighting of Groote Eylandt was in 1623, by the Dutch ship &quot;Arnhem&quot;, under Willem van Coolsteerdt. However, the relative prevalence of the hereditary Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) in the Groote Eylandt community (a condition otherwise mainly found in the Azores) was previously suggested as evidence of early contact with Portuguese sailors. (Contact with Chinese traders has also been suggested as a cause.) Recent genetic studies showed that the Groote Eylandt families with MJD shared a haplogroup with some families from Taiwanese, Indian, and Japanese families.

=== European Colonisation ===

==== Church Mission Society ====
The first European settlement on the island was a Christian mission established by the Church Missionary Society at Emerald River in 1921. In 1943, after a cyclone swept through the mission, CMS decided to move the settlement south of the Angurugu River. The local Anindilyakwa people called the chosen location &quot;Mungwardinamanja&quot;. However, as it was difficult for the European missionaries to pronounce, the local Anindilyakwa men guiding them chose the name of the Angurugu River mouth &quot;Angurrkwa&quot;, which was later Anglicised to Angurugu.

==== Umbakumba ====
Mr Fred H. Gray, a pearl and trepang trader, established the Umbakumba Native Settlement on an old Macassan trading post in 1938. The place-name itself &quot;Umbakumba&quot; comes from the Malay word &quot;ombak-ombak&quot;, which means ‘lapping of waves’. He used the settlement as a base for trepanging and employed many of the Aboriginal locals during the 20s and 30s.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, in 1943, the mission moved to Angurugu, as the RAAF required the use of the mission&#x27;s airstrip: the ruins of the RAAF base are still evident today. Qantas used the island as a flying boat base.

Following the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, Groote Eylandt was converted to Aboriginal freehold title land. In 1979, control of the island was transferred to the local Aboriginal Town Council.

=== Manganese mining ===
==== Groote Eylandt Mining Company ====
The majority of Australia&#x27;s manganese reserves are located on the western side of Groote Eylandt and the deposits there comprise oolitic and pisolitic sedimentary manganese and sit within the Cretaceous Carpentaria Basin. Special mining leases were granted to the Groote Eylandt Mining Company (GEMCO) and it has been in operation since 25 July 1964 near the community of Angurugu and, as a part of its establishment, the town of Alyangula was built as a residence for mine workers in the late 1960s. GEMCO it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHP but has become a part of South32 since 18 May 2015. 

The mine produces more than annuallyabout a quarter of the world&#x27;s total and, , it has produced more than of manganese ore and concentrate.

Concerns have been raised by many community members that this mining, and the resulting dust, posed a significant risk to their health and monitoring has been in place since 2017; South32 does not dispute these readings or provide its own monitoring data. The World Health Organization advised that breathing even low levels of manganese can damage brain functions relating to dexterity and also damage respiratory and reproductive systems. To investigate the possible impacts on humans studies are being undertaken at the University of Queensland.

Sylvia Tkac, an Anindilyakwa woman, who used to work at the mine said of it:

Studies have also taken place looking at the impacts on the ecosystem; this includes specific studies looking at the impact of northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) living in the area.

Mining rights are renewed every 21 years, with operations expected to continue until at least 2027.

In March 2024 a carrier of the manganese ore, MV Anikitos, caused significant damage to the mines port during Cyclone Megan; this did not lead to a fuel leak but did, temporarily, halt production.

==== Winchelsea Mining ====
In 2019 Wichelsea Mining was granted an exploration license covering part of Winchelsea Island (Akwamburrkba), which is off the northwestern coast of Groote Eylandt. This company is a joint venture between the Anindilyakwa Advancement Aboriginal Corporation (AAAC) and AUS China International Mining and, in December 2020, they applied for a stage open cut mine plan and in 2024 they completed works on accommodation at the site.

This mine is part of a strategy to make the residents of Groote Eylandt economically independent and Anindilyakwa Land Council chair, Tony Wurramarrba, says of it:

=== Present-day ===
On 20 May 2008, the federal government signed a deal with local Aboriginal people from Groote Eylandt to lease land to the government for 40 years. In return, the government will spend money in the community to improve housing, education, and health in the area.

<text>Rabshakeh (Akkadian: 𒃲𒁉𒈜𒈨𒌍 &quot;rab šāqê&quot; [GAL.BI.LUL.MEŠ]; ; &quot;Rapsakēs&quot;; ; ; alternative spellings include Rab-shakeh, Rabsaces, or Rab shaqe) is a title meaning &quot;chief of the princes/cup-bearers&quot; in the Semitic Akkadian and Aramaic languages. The title was given to the chief cup-bearer or the vizier of the Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian royal courts in ancient Mesopotamia, and revived by the Assyrians as a military rank during World War I.

==Biblical accounts==
The Hebrew Bible mentions it for one of Sennacherib&#x27;s messengers to Hezekiah, who was sent to Jerusalem along with the Tartan and the Rabsaris. The speech he delivered, in the Hebrew language, in the hearing of all the people, as he stood near the wall on the north side of the city, is quoted in 2 Kings and in Isaiah .

<doc id="69391" wikidata="Q7272882" url="?curid=69391" title="Quotations from the Hebrew Bible in the New Testament">
<text>There are in all 283 direct quotations from the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in the New Testament.

New Testament authors also quote from other sources. The synoptic gospels have Jesus quoting from or alluding to deutero-canonical works several times, such as the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach. Paul makes three quotations from classical poets. The Epistle of Jude quotes the pseudepigraphal Book of Enoch (1 Enoch 1:9) and the Assumption of Moses.

==Formatting==
When the New Testament was written, the Old Testament was not divided into chapters and verses, and there is therefore no uniform standard for these quotes and the authors had to provide contextual references:
* When refers to , he quotes from &quot;Moses at the bush&quot;, i.e. the section containing the record of Moses at the bush.
* refers to , in the words &quot;in the days of Abiathar&quot;.
* refers to 1 Kings ch. 17–19, in the words, &quot;in Elias&quot;, i.e. in the portion of the history regarding Elias.

== In popular culture ==
In November 2022, the game show Jeopardy! created a controversy after bible experts disagree about which of Paul&#x27;s letters had the most Old Testament quotations.

The controversy was not the amount of Old Testament scripture was in letters written by Paul, but rather did Paul write the book of Hebrews which Jeopardy said was the correct answer. There was a time when scholars believed Hebrews was written by Paul, but this was not the predominant opinion in the ancient world (Origen), or of Protestant scholars at the time of the Reformation (Luther, Calvin). Most scholars now agree that it was written not by Paul, but by an unknown author.

<text>Calf of Man ( ) is a island, off the southwest coast of the Isle of Man. It is separated from the Isle of Man by a narrow stretch of water called the Calf Sound.

Like the nearby rocky islets of Chicken Rock and Kitterland, it is part of the historic parish of Rushen and the current parish district of Arbory and Rushen. It has only two seasonal inhabitants. The word &#x27;calf&#x27; derives from the Old Norse word &quot;kalfr&quot;, which means a small island lying near a larger one. One can reach the Calf of Man by boat from either Port Erin or Port St Mary. Cow Harbour and South Harbour are the main landing places. The highest part of the island is in the west where an unnamed peak reaches above sea level.

Until 1939, the island was under private ownership by the Keig family, but the island was purchased by Mr F. J. Dickens of Silverdale, Lancashire, who then donated it to the National Trust for it to become a bird sanctuary. In 1951, the Manx Museum &amp; National Trust, which became known as Manx National Heritage, was established. Manx National Heritage then rented the Calf from the National Trust for a nominal £1 per year, until 1986, when ownership was transferred. In 2006 Manx National Heritage employed the charity Manx Wildlife Trust as the Calf Warden Service Provider, but it retains ownership.

The island has been a bird observatory since 1959, and welcomes visits from volunteers and ornithologists. The observatory is able to accommodate up to eight visitors in basic self-catering accommodation, which can be booked through Manx National Heritage.
The Calf of Man and its offshore rocks have no fewer than four lighthouses: two lighthouses were built in 1818 under the Isle of Man and Calf of Man Lighthouses Act 1815 (55 Geo. 3. c. lxvii) by Robert Stevenson to warn mariners of the hazards of the Chicken Rock off the south end of the Calf. These were replaced in 1875 by a lighthouse built on the Chicken Rocks themselves. In 1968, a third lighthouse was built on the Calf after a severe fire destroyed the Chicken Rock light. The Chicken Rock lighthouse was later rebuilt. There are two minor, unfenced roads on the island, and two very short streams.

Between the Isle of Man and the Calf is the islet of Kitterland, while the islets of The Burroo and The Stack lie close to the Calf&#x27;s shore. The southern shore of the island encloses a small bay called The Puddle. Almost a mile southwest of the Calf is Chicken Rock, the most southerly part of the Isle of Man&#x27;s territory.

Calf of Man is home to a breeding population of Manx shearwaters, a seabird which derives its name from its presence in Manx waters. The Calf of Man also has a large colony of seals which live and breed on the rocky coastline.

<text>The Delta Works () is a series of construction projects in the southwest of the Netherlands to protect a large area of land around the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta from the sea. Constructed between 1954 and 1997, the works consist of dams, sluices, locks, dykes, levees, and storm surge barriers located in the provinces of South Holland and Zeeland.

The aim of the dams, sluices, and storm surge barriers was to shorten the Dutch coastline, thus reducing the number of dikes that had to be raised. Along with the Zuiderzee Works, the Delta Works have been declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

== History ==
Due to indecision and the Second World War, little action was taken. In 1950 two small estuary mouths, the Brielse Gat near Brielle and the Botlek near Vlaardingen were dammed. After the North Sea flood of 1953, a Delta Works Commission was installed to research the causes and develop measures to prevent such disasters in future. They revised some of the old plans and came up with the &quot;Deltaplan&quot;.

=== Delta law and conceptual framework ===

An important part of this project was fundamental research to come up with long-term solutions, protecting the Netherlands against future floods. Instead of analysing past floods and building protection sufficient to deal with those, the Delta Works commission pioneered a conceptual framework to use as norm for investment in flood defences.

The framework is called the &#x27;Delta norm&#x27;; it includes the following principles:
* Major areas to be protected from flooding are identified. These are called &quot;dike ring areas&quot; because they are protected by a ring of primary sea defences.
* The cost of flooding is assessed using a statistical model involving damage to property, lost production, and a given amount per human life lost.
* For the purpose of this model, a human life is valued at €2.2 million (2008 data).
* The chances of a significant flood within the given area are calculated. This is done using data from a purpose-built flood simulation lab, as well as empirical statistical data regarding water wave properties and distribution. Storm behaviour and spring tide distribution are also taken into account.

The most important &quot;dike ring area&quot; is the South Holland coast region. It is home to four million people, most of whom live below normal sea level. The loss of human life in a catastrophic flood here can be very large because there is typically little warning time with North Sea storms. Comprehensive evacuation is not a realistic option for the Holland coastal region.

The commission initially set the acceptable risk for complete failure of every &quot;dike ring&quot; in the country at 1 in 125,000 years. But, it found that the cost of building to this level of protection could not be supported. It set &quot;acceptable&quot; risks by region as follows:

* North and South Holland (excluding Wieringermeer): 1 per 10,000 years
* Other areas at risk from sea flooding: 1 per 4,000 years
* Transition areas between high land and low land: 1 per 2,000 years

River flooding causes less damage than salt water flooding, which causes long-term damage to agricultural lands. Areas at risk from river flooding were assigned a higher acceptable risk. River flooding also has a longer warning time, producing a lower estimated death toll per event.

* South Holland at risk from river flooding: 1 per 1,250 years
* Other areas at risk from river flooding: 1 per 250 years.

These acceptable risks were enshrined in the Delta Law (Dutch: &quot;Deltawet&quot;). This required the government to keep risks of catastrophic flooding within these limits and to upgrade defences should new insights into risks require this. The limits have also been incorporated into the new Water Law (&quot;Waterwet&quot;), effective from 22 December 2009.

The Delta Project (of which the Delta Works are a part) has been designed with these guidelines in mind. All other primary defences have been upgraded to meet the norm. New data elevating the risk assessment on expected sea level rise due to global warming has identified ten &#x27;weak points.&#x27; These have been upgraded to meet future demands. The latest upgrades are made under the High Water Protection Program.

=== Alterations to the plan during the execution of the Works ===

During the execution of the works, changes were made in response to public pressure. In the Nieuwe Waterweg, the heightening and the associated widening of the dikes proved very difficult because of public opposition to the planned destruction of important historic buildings to achieve this. The plan was changed to the construction of a storm surge barrier (the Maeslantkering) and dikes were only partly built up.

==== The storm-surge barrier ====
The Delta Plan originally intended to create a large freshwater lake, the &quot;&quot; (Zeeland Lake). This would have caused major environmental destruction in Oosterschelde, with the total loss of the saltwater ecosystem and, consequently, the harvesting of oysters. Environmentalists and fishermen combined their efforts to prevent the closure; they persuaded parliament to amend the original plan. Instead of completely damming the estuary, the government agreed to build a storm surge barrier. This essentially is a long collection of very large valves that can be closed against storm surges.

The storm surge barrier closes only when the sea-level is expected to rise 3 metres above mean sea level. Under normal conditions, the estuary&#x27;s mouth is open, and salt water flows in and out with the tide. As a result of the change, the weak dikes along the Oosterschelde needed to be strengthened. Over 200 km of the dike needed new revetments. The connections between the Eastern Scheldt and the neighboring Haringvliet had to be dammed to limit the effect of the salt water. Extra dams and locks were needed at the east part of the Oosterschelde to create a shipping route between the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. Since operating the barrier has an effect on the environment, fisheries and the water management system, decisions made on opening or closing the gate are carefully considered. Also the safety of the surrounding dykes are affected by barrier operations.

====Environmental policy implementations====
In an attempt to restore and preserve the natural system surrounded by the dykes and storm-surge barrier, the concept &#x27;building with nature&#x27; was introduced in revised Delta Program updates after 2008. The new integrated water management plan not only takes into account protection against flooding, but also covers water quality, leisure industry, economic activities, shipping, environment and nature. Whenever possible, existing engineering constructions would be replaced by more &#x27;nature friendly&#x27; options in an attempt to restore natural estuary and tides, while still protecting against flooding. In addition, building components of the reinforcements are designed in a way that they support formation of entire ecosystems. As part of the revision, the Room for the River projects, enabled nature to occupy space by lowering or widening the river bed. In order to establish this, agricultural flood plains are turned into natural parks, excavated farmland is used for wild vegetation and newly excavated lakes and bypasses create habitats for fish and birds. Along the coast, natural sand is added each year to allow sand to blow freely through the dunes instead of having the dunes held in place by planted vegetation or revetments. Although the new plan brought along additional cost, it was received favourably. The re-considerations of the Delta Project indicated the growing importance of integrate environmental impact assessments in policy-making.

==Environmental effects==
The Delta Project of which the Delta Works are part of was originally designed in a period of time when environmental awareness and ecological effects of engineering projects were barely taken into consideration. Although the level of awareness for the environment grew throughout the years, the Delta Project has caused numerous irreversible effects on the environment in the past. Blocking the estuary mouths did reduce the length of dykes that otherwise would have to be built to protect against floods, but it also led to major changes in the water systems. For example, the tides disappeared, which resulted in a less smooth transition from sea water into fresh water. Flora and fauna suffered from this noticeable change. In addition, rivers experienced an increase in sedimentation by polluted sludge, since there was no longer an open passage to the sea.

==Project costs==
The projects of the Delta Plan are financed with the Delta Fund. In 1958, when the Delta law was accepted under the Delta Works Commission, the total costs were estimated at 3.3 billion guilder. This was at that time equal to 20% of national GDP. This amount was spread out over the 25 years that it would take to complete the massive engineering project. The Delta works were mostly financed by the national budget, with a contribution of the Marshall Plan of 400 million guilder. In addition, the Dutch natural gas discovery contributed massively to the finance of the project. At completion in 1997, costs were set on 8.2 billion guilder. Nevertheless, in 2012 the total costs were already set on around $13 billion.

== Current status ==
The original plan was completed by the Europoortkering which required the construction of the Maeslantkering in the Nieuwe Waterweg between Maassluis and Hook of Holland and the Hartelkering in the Hartel Canal near Spijkenisse. The works were declared finished after almost forty years in 1997.

Due to climate change and relative sea-level rise, the dikes will eventually have to be made higher and wider. This is a long term uphill battle against the sea. The needed level of flood protection and the resulting costs are a recurring subject of debate, and involve a complicated decision-making process. In 1995 it was agreed in the Delta Plan Large Rivers and Room for the River projects that about 500 kilometres of insufficient dyke revetments were reinforced and replaced along the Oosterschelde and Westerschelde between 1995 and 2015. After 2015, under the High Water Protection Program, additional upgrades are made.

In September 2008, the Delta Commission presided by politician Cees Veerman advised in a report that the Netherlands would need a massive new building program to strengthen the country&#x27;s water defenses against the anticipated effects of global warming for the next 190 years. The plans included drawing up worst-case scenarios for evacuations and included more than €100 billion, or $144 billion, in new spending through the year 2100 for measures, such as broadening coastal dunes and strengthening sea and river dikes.
The commission said the country must plan for a rise in the North Sea of 1.3 meters by 2100 and 4 meters by 2200.

<text>BioWare is a Canadian video game developer based in Edmonton, Alberta. It was founded in 1995 by newly graduated medical doctors Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk and Augustine Yip. Since 2007, the company has been owned by American publisher Electronic Arts.

BioWare specializes in role-playing video games, and achieved recognition for developing highly praised and successful licensed franchises: &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. They proceeded to make several other successful games based on original intellectual property: &quot;Jade Empire&quot;, the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series, and the &quot;Dragon Age&quot; series. In 2011, BioWare launched their first massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;.

==History==

===Foundation===

BioWare was founded by Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. Of the founding team, Muzyka, Zeschuk and Yip had recently graduated from medical school at the University of Alberta, and had a background in programming for use in school. Together with Yip, they had created a medical simulation programme. The three also played video games for recreation, eventually deciding to develop their own. Their success in the medical field provided them with the funding they needed to launch a video game company. To make their first game, they pooled their resources, $100,000 CAD each, which resulted in capital of $300,000. The company was incorporated on 1 February 1995, though formally launched on 22 May 1995.

===1990s: &quot;Shattered Steel&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;===
Their first game, &quot;Shattered Steel&quot;, began its life as a proof-of-concept demo, similar to the &quot;MechWarrior&quot; games. This demo was submitted to ten publishers, seven of whom returned to the company with an offer. A publishing deal for &quot;Shattered Steel&quot; was eventually signed with Interplay Entertainment. Brent Oster and Trent Oster formed Pyrotek Studios, which continued developing &quot;Shattered Steel&quot; but broke up a year later, with Trent joining BioWare as an early employee to finish the game. BioWare&#x27;s first game was released the following year. &quot;Shattered Steel&quot;″s release was described by IGN as a &quot;modest success&quot; with &quot;decent sales&quot;. Two noteworthy points were the deformable terrain (player weapon damage caused craters in the environment) and zone damage (well-aimed gunfire could shoot mounted weapons off enemies). A sequel to &quot;Shattered Steel&quot; was planned for 1998 but never realized.

BioWare&#x27;s founders and staff were keenly interested in both computerized and pen-and-paper variants of role-playing games. Their next development project, therefore, was determined to be a role-playing game. When Interplay financed &quot;exploratory development&quot;, BioWare presented the publishers with a demo called &quot;Battleground: Infinity&quot;. Interplay suggested that the demonstrated gameplay engine would be well-suited to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; licence which it had acquired from Strategic Simulations. Accordingly, &quot;Infinity&quot; was reworked in line with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ruleset.

The result was &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, with a development cycle of three years. During this time, the three doctors continued to practice medicine. The demands of development later prompted Muzyka and Zeschuck to leave medicine and move into full-time development. Augustine Yip decided to continue with his medical practice. &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; sold more than two million copies after its release, nearly matching the sales of &quot;Diablo&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, the Infinity Engine was used for the games &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; series. The success of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; was followed by an expansion pack for the game: &quot;Tales of the Sword Coast&quot;.

===2000s: EA Acquisition, &quot;Mass Effect&quot; &amp; &quot;Dragon Age&quot;===

At this point, BioWare decided to return to the action genre. The company&#x27;s initial thought was to develop a sequel to &quot;Shattered Steel&quot;, but eventually a sequel to &quot;MDK&quot; from Shiny Entertainment was chosen for development. &quot;MDK2&quot; was released on PC, Dreamcast, and eventually PlayStation 2, offering BioWare their first taste of developing games for consoles. &quot;MDK2&quot; drew the same level of praise as its predecessor but, despite the success, BioWare returned to the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series for their next project.

&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; was released in 2000, two years after the release of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;. &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; sold two million copies, matching the sales of the first game in the series. However, the success of both &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; and &quot;MDK2&quot; was not enough to stabilize Interplay financially. Subsequently, BioWare began to work with Infogrames, which was later renamed to Atari. &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; was originally to be published by Interplay, but the company lost the licence of the game to Atari and part of their &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; licence to BioWare. After selling their D&amp;D licence to Atari, BioWare developed &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and &quot;Jade Empire&quot;. It had publishing relationships with Interplay Entertainment, Infogrames, under its new name Atari, LucasArts, and Microsoft.

The next few years saw a number of changes in BioWare&#x27;s corporate status. In November 2005, it was announced that BioWare and Pandemic Studios (itself founded by former Activision employees) would be joining forces (with each maintaining their own branding), with private equity fund Elevation Partners investing in the newly named VG Holding Corp. partnership. On 11 October 2007, it was announced that VG Holding Corp. had been bought by Electronic Arts for million (equivalent to $ billion in ). BioWare therefore became a unit of EA, but still retained its own branding.

In 2007, BioWare released the science fiction role-playing game &quot;Mass Effect&quot;. The following year, BioWare released &quot;Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood&quot; on the Nintendo DS, its first title for a handheld game console. Later, EA announced that BioWare would merge with Mythic Entertainment, another division of EA who would rename itself as BioWare Mythic after the deal.

The growth of the MMORPG group as part of Electronic Arts in 2008 resulted in three additional studios being added to the BioWare group outside BioWare&#x27;s original home base in Edmonton. The first, located in Austin, Texas, and headed by industry veterans Gordon Walton and Richard Vogel, was created to work on the &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; MMORPG project. Both the studio and the project were announced on 13 March 2006. On 2 March 2009, BioWare announced it had opened a new studio in Montreal, Quebec, to assist with existing projects as necessary.

During the mid-2000s, BioWare staff developed a number of video game projects which were ultimately canceled. A handheld spin-off for &quot;Mass Effect&quot; franchise titled &quot;Mass Effect: Corsair&quot;, inspired by the gameplay of &quot;Star Control&quot; and played from a first-person perspective, was briefly explored as a potential project for the Nintendo DS in 2008. A sequel to &quot;Jade Empire&quot; was under development at one point. The project transitioned into a spiritual successor codenamed &quot;Revolver&quot;, which was canceled by 2008. Trent Oster led a team which worked on a spy-themed role-playing game codenamed &quot;Agent&quot; prior to his second departure from BioWare in 2009. Unused concept art for &quot;Agent&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; are featured in the art book &quot;BioWare: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development&quot;, published in January 2021.

On 24 June 2009, Electronic Arts announced a restructuring of their role-playing and massively multiplayer online games development into a new group that included both Mythic Entertainment and BioWare. Ray Muzyka, co-founder and general manager of BioWare, was appointed the group general manager of this newly formed &quot;BioWare Group&quot;. BioWare&#x27;s other co-founder, Greg Zeschuk, became the Group Creative Officer for the new MMORPG studio group. BioWare&#x27;s studios remained unchanged and continued to report to Muzyka. Near the end of 2009, BioWare released the critically acclaimed fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;.

===2010s: Muzyka and Zeschuk&#x27;s departure, &quot;Mass Effect&quot; on hiatus, &quot;Anthem&quot;===
In January 2010, BioWare released the sequel to Mass Effect, &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, which would go on to receive critical acclaim and many awards. The company announced that it would be opening up a new customer service office in Galway, Ireland, in 2011. BioWare completed three major games between 2011 and 2012. The massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; is based on BioWare&#x27;s previous contribution to the Star Wars franchise, and was announced on 21 October 2008, although BioWare had first mentioned an unspecified new collaboration with LucasArts in October the previous year. The other games were &quot;Dragon Age II&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;, and &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot; in March 2012, numerous players complained about its endings failing to fulfill the developer&#x27;s earlier promises regarding the conclusion of the trilogy. In response to the controversy surrounding the game&#x27;s ending sequence, BioWare announced on 5 April that they would reschedule their post-release content production and release an &quot;Extended Cut&quot; DLC that would expand the original endings and address the most common points of critique. The Extended Cut was released as a free download on 26 June 2012. On 18 September 2012, the next day after the official announcement of the third &quot;Dragon Age&quot; title, both Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, two of the remaining co-founders of BioWare, simultaneously announced they would be retiring from the gaming industry. After almost a year without a formal head, EA appointed Matthew Bromberg the group general manager of the BioWare label on 9 September 2013. Former CEO and president of Major League Gaming, Bromberg worked as the general manager of BioWare Austin since 2012; after his promotion, Jeff Hickman took over as the general manager in Austin. Aaryn Flynn remained in charge of BioWare Canada (Edmonton and Montreal) and Jon Van Caneghem, the head of Victory Games and Waystone Studio (also parts of the BioWare label).

After acquiring and dismantling LucasArts, The Walt Disney Company announced in May 2013 that Electronic Arts will produce future &quot;Star Wars&quot; games, &quot;in addition to the BioWare team, which is already developing for the Star Wars franchise.&quot; In November 2013, teaser images from the next instalment of the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series were released. At E3 2014, BioWare Edmonton announced working on a new (unnamed) original intellectual property in addition to continuing their established series. Another new IP, titled &quot;Shadow Realms&quot; is an episodic 4 vs. 1 story-driven online action role-playing game, and was announced on Gamescom 2014. On 9 February 2015, BioWare Austin announced that development on &quot;Shadow Realms&quot; would not continue.

Casey Hudson, the creator of the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series, left BioWare in May 2014, while Drew Karpyshyn, writer of &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and the first two &quot;Mass Effect&quot; games, returned in 2015. &quot;Dragon Age&quot;″s writer David Gaider left BioWare in January 2016. Chris Wynn and Chris Schlerf, both of whom had an important role in the development of &quot;Mass Effect: Andromeda&quot;, left in December 2015 and February 2016 respectively. Alexis Kennedy, co-founder of Failbetter Games and the creative director of &quot;Dragon Age: The Last Court&quot;, joined BioWare as its &quot;first ever guest writer&quot; in September 2016.

On 13 September 2016, EA announced the formation of EA Worldwide Studios, which would consist of BioWare Studios, EA Mobile, and Maxis, and led by DICE co-founder Patrick Soderlund. At the same time, Samantha Ryan, head of EA Mobile and Maxis, was appointed the new head of BioWare Studios. Released in March 2017, &quot;Andromeda&quot; was at the center of controversy of equal proportions, if not higher than that around the third chapter; starting with heavy criticisms that were addressed before the video game was released to the lukewarm response received by the specialized press and the fandom with sales lower than the previous &quot;Mass Effect&quot; games. Given the circumstances Electronic Arts had reportedly frozen the entire &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series, downgrading the BioWare Montréal branch from a leading development team to a support team, and later merging it into Motive Studios.

During EA&#x27;s &quot;EA Play&quot; pre-E3 press conference on 10 June 2017, BioWare revealed &quot;Anthem&quot;, a new action role-playing game, with BioWare&#x27;s story writer, Drew Karpyshyn, who previously worked on &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, contributing to the new game. In July 2017, Aaryn Flynn, general manager of BioWare, announced that he would depart from the company. Hudson returned to BioWare as its new general manager. Lead story developer for &quot;Jade Empire&quot; and &quot;Dragon Age&quot; creative director Mike Laidlaw announced his departure from BioWare in October 2017 after 14 years with the company. James Ohlen, the lead designer of the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, &quot;Jade Empire&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;, as well as the game director of &quot;The Old Republic&quot; MMO, left the studio after 22 years in July 2018.

On 24 September 2019, it was announced that BioWare had moved from their old location on Calgary Trail into 3 stories of the Epcor Tower in downtown Edmonton.

===2020s: New &quot;Dragon Age&quot; and &quot;Mass Effect&quot; games===

On 7 November 2020 or &quot;N7 Day&quot;, a date first declared in 2012 by BioWare as an annual &quot;worldwide celebration&quot; of the &quot;Mass Effect franchise&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&quot; was announced as well as an all-new entry to the franchise that had just started development. The following month, on 3 December, both Hudson and Mark Darrah, the executive producer on the &quot;Dragon Age&quot; series, announced their departures from the studio. Electronic Arts stated that work on the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and &quot;Dragon Age&quot; games would still continue at the studio. A week later, a teaser trailer for the next &quot;Mass Effect&quot; game was shown at The Game Awards.

On 14 May 2021, &quot;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&quot; was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and the Xbox One series.

On 23 August 2023, about 50 BioWare developers were laid off. A group of former employees later sued EA, seeking better severance following their layoffs.

On 31 October 2024, the fourth instalment in the Dragon Age series, &quot;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&quot;, was released. The game received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews from critics for its Windows and PlayStation 5 versions and &quot;universal acclaim&quot; for its Xbox Series X/S version, according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; described the sales as &quot;decent&quot; but said the numbers may not have pleased publisher EA. &quot;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&quot; was review bombed by users for being &quot;&#x27;woke,&#x27; &#x27;DEI,&#x27; &#x27;propaganda,&#x27; and &#x27;agenda-driven&#x27;&quot; on Metacritic, causing the platform to respond with a statement and by removing user reviews which had violated their guidelines. &quot;Veilguard&quot; is the first BioWare game that allows the player character to identify as transgender. On 7 November 2024, or &quot;N7 Day&quot;, BioWare released a patch which added several &quot;Mass Effect&quot;-inspired costumes into the game. In late October 2024, following the release of &quot;Veilguard&quot;, creative director John Epler stated that BioWare&#x27;s attention had &quot;shifted entirely to the next &quot;Mass Effect&quot; [game]&quot; in an interview with Rolling Stone. &quot;Veilguard&quot; game director Corinne Busche exited BioWare for a role at a different company in January 2025.

Amazon MGM Studios officially confirmed on 7 November 2024 that a &quot;Mass Effect&quot; TV series is in development, following negotiations that had started in late 2021. BioWare executive producer Michael Gamble will also act as an executive producer on the TV adaptation.

In January 2025, EA lowered its upcoming annual revenue forecast due to the underperformance of both &quot;EA Sports FC 25&quot; and &quot;Veilguard&quot;. EA stated that &quot;Veilguard&quot; had &quot;engaged&quot; 1.5 million players during the three months ending December 31, 2024, underperforming their expectations by half. Later that month, EA restructured and downsized BioWare. While a small &quot;Mass Effect&quot; team was retained to continue work, the studio &quot;is now down from more than 200 people two years ago to less than 100 today&quot;. This restructuring included layoffs in the &quot;Dragon Age&quot; team,&quot;&quot; with IGN noting that &quot;terminated&quot; employees &quot;are being offered time to apply to other roles within the company if they so choose&quot;. Bloomberg stated that some BioWare employees were &quot;loaned out to other teams within their parent company&quot; and then later informed &quot;that the loans had morphed into permanent relocations&quot; to various EA subsidiaries. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; highlighted that &quot;well-known BioWare veterans&quot; are no longer at the company and &quot;collectively, the cuts represent a major loss of creative talent for the studio, and bears echoes of BioWare&#x27;s layoff of roughly 50 employees in 2023&quot;.

==Technology==
Between 1998 and 2011, BioWare developed a number of in-house video game engines to serve as technical basis for their games. Some of these engines were then licensed to other companies to develop their own games. Others came with modding toolkits, allowing the fan community to implement original adventures using the technology of BioWare&#x27;s games.

BioWare created the Infinity Engine to use it as a core component for development of the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series (1998–2001), which were 2D role-playing video games based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The engine was also used by Black Isle Studios to create the critically acclaimed &quot;&quot; (1999) and the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; series (2000–2002). When Beamdog sought out a license from BioWare and started engineering enhanced versions of these games in 2012, they created an updated version of the Infinity Engine, referred to as the &quot;Infinity Enhanced Engine&quot; (alternatively Infinity Plus Engine or Infinity Bless Engine).

The was the successor to the Infinity Engine, featuring full 3D environments, real-time lighting and shadows, and surround sound. BioWare used the Aurora Engine to produce their 2002 &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, as well as two expansion packs. The game included the Aurora toolset, a collection of tools allowing users to create their own digital adventure modules to be played either in single-player or in online multiplayer. The toolset enjoyed great popularity among the modding community, with over a thousand fan-made modules produced in it within half a year after the release. Obsidian Entertainment (successor to Black Isle Studios) used an updated version of BioWare&#x27;s Aurora, titled &quot;Electron Engine&quot;, to produce &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; (2006) and its three expansion packs (2007–2009). Like the original, the Electron toolset was released with the game. The Polish studio CD Projekt Red used the Aurora Engine to develop &quot;The Witcher&quot;, the 2007 video game adaptation of the Polish fantasy novel series, although the rendering module was rewritten from scratch.

BioWare used an updated version of the Aurora, titled the Odyssey Engine, to produce &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; in 2003 and their first original intellectual property role-playing game &quot;Jade Empire&quot; in 2005. The Odyssey Engine was the first BioWare engine to allow developing for video game consoles, with both &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and &quot;Jade Empire&quot; originally released for the Xbox before being ported to the PC platform. Obsidian Entertainment used the Odyssey Engine to develop &quot;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot; (2004), a sequel to the original &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. BioWare maintained limited oversight on Obsidian&#x27;s development of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;, as well as &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;.

The succeeded the Odyssey Engine and, among other things, supported PhysX hardware acceleration. It was used to produce &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot; (2009) and its expansion pack &quot;Awakening&quot; (2010). Like &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, &quot;Origins&quot; was released with a toolset to allow the players to run their own adventure modules on the Eclipse Engine. An upgraded version of the Eclipse Engine, internally known as the Lycium Engine, was used to produce &quot;Dragon Age II&quot; (2011).

In September 2004, BioWare acquired a license to use Unreal Engine 3 from developer Epic Games. Unreal Engine 3 would ultimately be used to develop the original &quot;Mass Effect&quot; trilogy (2007–2012), as well as the remastered &quot;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&quot; in 2021.

In 2013, EA confirmed that all future games developed by BioWare will be made on DICE&#x27;s Frostbite engine. All of BioWare&#x27;s games since the confirmation (&quot;Dragon Age: Inquisition&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect: Andromeda, Anthem&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&quot;) were developed using Frostbite 3 as part of the general move towards a unified technology foundation across all of Electronic Arts&#x27; development studios.

<text>Guido of Arezzo (; – after 1033) was an Italian music theorist and pedagogue of High medieval music. A Benedictine monk, he is regarded as the inventor—or by some, developer—of the modern staff notation that had a massive influence on the development of Western musical notation and practice. Perhaps the most significant European writer on music between Boethius and Johannes Tinctoris, after the former&#x27;s &quot;De institutione musica&quot;, Guido&#x27;s &quot;Micrologus&quot; was the most widely distributed medieval treatise on music.

Biographical information on Guido is only available from two contemporary documents; though they give limited background, a basic understanding of his life can be unravelled. By around 1013 he began teaching at Pomposa Abbey, but his antiphonary &quot;Prologus in antiphonarium&quot; and novel teaching methods based on staff notation brought considerable resentment from his colleagues. He thus moved to Arezzo in 1025 and under the patronage of Bishop Tedald of Arezzo he taught singers at the Arezzo Cathedral. Using staff notation, he was able to teach large amounts of music quickly and he wrote the multifaceted &quot;Micrologus&quot;, attracting attention from around Italy. Interested in his innovations, Pope John XIX called him to Rome. After arriving and beginning to explain his methods to the clergy, sickness sent him away in the summer. The rest of his life is largely unknown, but he settled in a monastery near Arezzo, probably one of the Avellana of the Camaldolese order.

==Context and sources==
Information on Guido&#x27;s life is scarce; the music historian Charles Burney asserted that the paucity of records was because Guido was a monk. Burney furthered that, in the words of musicologist Samuel D. Miller, &quot;Guido&#x27;s modesty, selfless abandon from material gain life, and obedience to authority tended to obscure his moves, work, and motivations&quot;. The scholarly outline of Guido&#x27;s life has been subject to much mythologization and misunderstandings. These dubious claims include that he spent much of life in France (recorded as early as Johannes Trithemius&#x27;s 1494 &quot;De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis&quot;); that he trained in the Saint-Maur-des-Fossés near Paris; and unsupported rumours that he was imprisoned because of plots from those hostile to his innovations.

The primary surviving documents associated with Guido are two undated letters; a dedicatory letter to Bishop Tedald of Arezzo and a letter to his colleague Michael of Pomposa, known as the &quot;Epistola ad Michaelem&quot;. These letters provide enough information and context to map the main events and chronology of Guido&#x27;s life, though Miller notes that they do &quot;not permit a detailed, authoritative sketch&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Guido was born sometime between 990 and 999. This birthdate range was conjectured from a now lost and undated manuscript of the &quot;Micrologus&quot;, where he stated that he was age 34 while John XIX was pope (1024–1033). Swiss musicologist dating of the manuscript to 1025–1026 is agreed by scholars Claude V. Palisca, Dolores Pesce and Angelo Mafucci, with Mafucci noting that it is &quot;now unanimously accepted&quot;. This would suggest a birthdate of .

Guido&#x27;s birthplace is even less certain, and has been the subject of much disagreement between scholars, with music historian Cesarino Ruini noting that due to Guido&#x27;s pivotal significance &quot;It is understandable that several locations in Italy claim the honor of having given birth to G[uido]&quot;. There are two principal candidates: Arezzo, Tuscany or the Pomposa Abbey on the Adriatic coast near Ferrara. Musicologist asserted that he was born in Pomposa due to his strong connection with the Abbey from ; according to Van Waesberghe, Guido&#x27;s epitaph &#x27;of Arezzo&#x27; is because of his stay of about a dozen years there later in life. Disagreeing with Van Waesberghe&#x27;s conclusions, Mafucci argued that were Guido born in Pomposa, he would have spent nearly 35 years there and would thus more likely be known as &#x27;of Pomposa&#x27;. Mafucci cites the account of the near-contemporary historian Sigebert of Gembloux (–1112) who referred to Guido as &quot;Guido Aretinus&quot; (Guido of Arezzo), suggesting that the early use of such a designation means Guido&#x27;s birthplace was Arezzo. Citing recently unearthed documents in 2003, Mafucci identified Guido with a &quot;Guido clerico filius Roze&quot; of the Arezzo Cathedral. If Mafucci is correct, Guido would have received early musical education at the Arezzo Cathedral from a deacon named Sigizo and was ordained as a subdeacon and active as a cantor.

===Pomposa===

Around 1013 Guido went to the Pomposa Abbey, one of the most famous Benedictine monasteries of the time, to complete his education. Becoming a noted monk, he started to develop the novel principles of staff notation (music being written and read from an organized visual system).

Likely drawing from the writings of , Guido began to draft his system in the antiphonary &quot;Regulae rhythmicae&quot;, which he probably worked on with his colleague Michael of Pomposa. In the prologue to the antiphonary, Guido expressed his frustration with the large amount of time singers spent to memorize music. The system, he explained, would prevent the need for memorization and thus permit the singers extra time to diversify their studies into other prayers and religious texts. He began to instruct his singers along these lines and obtained a reputation for being able to teach substantial amounts of music quickly. Though his ideas brought interest from around Italy, they inspired considerable jealousy and resistance from his fellow monks, who felt threatened by his innovations. Among those disapproving was the Abbot . In light of these objections, Guido left Pomposa in around 1025 and moved to—or &#x27;returned to&#x27;, if following the Arezzo birthplace hypothesis—Arezzo.

===Arezzo, Rome and later life===

Arezzo was without a monastery; Bishop Tedald of Arezzo (Bishop from 1023 to 1036) appointed Guido to oversee the training of singers for the Arezzo Cathedral. It was at this time that Guido began work on the &quot;Micrologus&quot;, or in full &quot;Micrologus de disciplina artis musicae&quot;. The work was both commissioned by and dedicated to Tedald. It was primarily a musical manual for singers and discussed a wide variety of topics, including chant, polyphonic music, the monochord, melody, syllables, modes, organum, neumes and many of his teaching methods. Resuming the same teaching approach as before, Guido lessened the standard 10-year training for the ideal cantor to only one or two years. Italy-wide attention returned to Guido, and Pope John XIX called him to Rome, having either seen or heard of both his &quot;Regulae rhythmicae&quot; and innovative staff notation teaching techniques. Theobald may have helped arranged the visit, and in around 1028, Guido traveled there with the Canon Dom Peter of Arezzo as well as the Abbot Grimaldus of Arezzo. His presentation incited much interest from the clergy and the details of his visit are included in the &quot;Epistola ad Michaelem&quot;.

While in Rome, Guido became sick and the hot summer forced him to leave, with the assurance that he would visit again and give further explanation of his theories. In the &quot;Epistola ad Michaelem&quot;, Guido mentions that before leaving, he was approached by the Abbot Guido of Pomposa who regretted his part in Guido&#x27;s leave from Arezzo and thus invited him to return to the Abbey. Guido of Pomposa&#x27;s rationale was that he should avoid the cities, as most of their churchmen were accused of simony, though it remains unknown if Guido chose the Pomposa Abbey as his destination. It seems more likely that around 1029, Guido settled in a monastery of the Avellana of the Camaldolese order near Arezzo, as many of the oldest manuscripts with Guidonian notation are Camaldolese. The last document pertaining to Guido places him in Arezzo on 20 May 1033; his death is only known to have been sometime after that date.

==Music theory and innovations==
===Works===

Four works are securely attributed to Guido: the &quot;Micrologus&quot;, the &quot;Prologus in antiphonarium&quot;, the &quot;Regulae rhythmicae&quot; and the &quot;Epistola ad Michaelem&quot;.

The &quot;Epistola ad Michaelem&quot; is the only one not a formal musical treatise; it was written directly after Guido&#x27;s trip to Rome, perhaps in 1028, but no later than 1033. All three musical treatises were written before the &quot;Epistola ad Michaelem&quot;, as Guido mentions each of them in it. More specifically, the &quot;Micrologus&quot; can be dated to after 1026, as in the preliminary dedicatory letter to Tebald, Guido congratulates him for his 1026 plans for the new St Donatus church. Though the &quot;Prologus in antiphonarium&quot; was begun in Pomposa (1013–1025), it seems to have not been completed until 1030.

===Solmization===

Guido developed new techniques for teaching, such as staff notation and the use of the &quot;ut–re–mi–fa–sol–la&quot; (do–re–mi–fa–so–la) mnemonic (solmization). The syllables ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la (do-re-mi-fa-sol-la) are taken from the six half-lines of the first stanza of the hymn Ut queant laxis, the notes of which are successively raised by one step, and the text of which is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar Paulus Deacon (although the musical line either shares a common ancestor with the earlier setting of Horace&#x27;s Ode to Phyllis (Odes 4.11) recorded in Montpellier manuscript H425, or may have been taken from there) Giovanni Battista Doni is known for having changed the name of note &quot;Ut&quot; (C), renaming it &quot;Do&quot; (in the &quot;Do Re Mi ...&quot; sequence known as solfège). A seventh note, &quot;Si&quot; (from the initials for &quot;Sancte Iohannes,&quot; Latin for Saint John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale. In anglophone countries, &quot;Si&quot; was changed to &quot;Ti&quot; by Sarah Glover in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might begin with a different letter (this also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp). &quot;Ti&quot; is used in tonic sol-fa and in the song &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;.

===The Guidonian hand===
Guido is somewhat erroneously credited with the invention of the Guidonian hand, a widely used mnemonic system where note names are mapped to parts of the human hand. Only a rudimentary form of the Guidonian hand is actually described by Guido, and the fully elaborated system of natural, hard, and soft hexachords cannot be securely attributed to him.

In the 12th century, a development in teaching and learning music in a more efficient manner arose. Guido of Arezzo&#x27;s alleged development of the Guidonian hand, more than a hundred years after his death, allowed musicians to label a specific joint or fingertip with the gamut (also referred to as the hexachord in the modern era). Using specific joints of the hand and fingertips transformed the way one would learn and memorize solmization syllables. Not only did the Guidonian hand become a standard use in preparing music in the 12th century, its popularity grew more widespread well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The knowledge and use of the Guidonian hand would allow a musician to simply transpose, identify intervals, and aid in the use of notation and the creation of new music. Musicians were able to sing and memorize longer sections of music and counterpoint during performances and the amount of time spent diminished dramatically.

==Legacy==

Almost immediately after his death commentaries were written on Guido&#x27;s work, particularly the &quot;Micrologus&quot;. One of the most noted is the &quot;De musica&quot; of Johannes Cotto (), whose influential treatise was largely a commentary that expanded and revised the &quot;Micrologus&quot;. Aribo () also dedicated a substantial part of his &quot;De musica&quot; as a commentary on chapter 15 of the &quot;Micrologus&quot;. Other significant commentaries are anonymous, including the &quot;Liber argumentorum&quot; and &quot;Liber specierum&quot; (both Italian, 1050–1100); the &quot;Commentarius anonymus in Micrologum&quot; (Belgian or Bavarian, ); and the &quot;Metrologus&quot; (English, 13th century).

Guido of Arezzo and his work are frequent namesakes. The controversial mass &quot;Missa Scala Aretina&quot; (1702) by Francisco Valls takes its name from Guido&#x27;s hexachord. Lorenzo Nencini sculpted a statue of Guido in 1847 that is included in the Loggiato of the Uffizi, Florence. A statue to him was erected 1882 in his native Arezzo; it was sculpted by Salvino Salvini. Modern namesakes include the computer music notation system GUIDO music notation, as well as the &quot;Concorso Polifónico Guido d&#x27;Arezzo&quot; (International Guido d&#x27;Arezzo Polyphonic Contest) hosted by the Fondazione Guido D&#x27;Arezzo in Arezzo. A street in Milan, Via Guido D&#x27;Arezzo, is named after him.

In 1950, the &quot;Comitato Nazionale per le Onoranze a Guido Monaco&quot; (National Committee for Honors to Guido Monaco) held various events for the ninth centenary of Guido&#x27;s death. Among these was a monograph competition; Jos Smits van Waesberghe won with the Latin work &quot;De musico-paedagogico et theoretico Guidone Aretino eiusque vita et moribus&quot; (&quot;The Musical-Pedagogy of Theoretician Guido of Arezzo Both His Life and Morals&quot;).
