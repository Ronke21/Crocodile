<text>Toxicodendron is a genus of flowering plants in the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. It contains trees, shrubs and woody vines, including poison ivy, poison oak, and the lacquer tree. All members of the genus produce the skin-irritating oil urushiol, which can cause a severe allergic reaction. The generic name is derived from the Greek words (&quot;toxikos&quot;), meaning &quot;poison,&quot; and (&quot;dendron&quot;), meaning &quot;tree&quot;. The best-known members of the genus in North America are eastern poison ivy &quot;(T. radicans)&quot; and western poison oak (&quot;T. diversilobum&quot;), both ubiquitous throughout much of their respective region.

The resins of certain species native to Japan, China and other Asian countries, such as lacquer tree (&quot;T. vernicifluum&quot;) and wax tree (&quot;T. succedaneum&quot;), are used to make lacquer, and, as a byproduct of lacquer manufacture, their berries are used to make japan wax.

== Description ==
Plants in the genus have pinnately compound, alternate leaves and whitish or grayish drupes. They are quite variable in appearance. The leaves may have smooth, toothed, or lobed edges, and all three types of leaf edges may be present in a single plant. The plants grow as creeping vines, climbing vines, shrubs, or, in the case of lacquer tree (&quot;T. vernicifluum&quot;) and poison sumac (&quot;T. vernix)&quot;, as trees. While leaves of poison ivy and poison oaks usually have three leaflets, sometimes there are five or, occasionally, even seven leaflets. Leaves of poison sumac have 7–13 leaflets, and of Lacquer Tree, 7–19 leaflets.

== Taxonomy ==
It was published by Philip Miller in 1754. The lectotype species is &quot;Toxicodendron pubescens&quot; The genus is a member of the &quot;Rhus complex&quot;, and has at various times been categorized as being either its own genus or a sub-genus of &quot;Rhus.&quot; There is evidence which points to keeping &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; as a separate monophyletic genus, but researchers have stated that the &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; and &quot;Rhus&quot; groups are complex and require more study to be fully understood.

The common names come from similar appearances to other species that are not closely related and to the allergic response to the urushiol. Poison oak is not an oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;, family Fagaceae), but this common name comes from the leaves&#x27; resemblance to white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;) leaves, while poison ivy is not an ivy (&quot;Hedera&quot;, family Araliaceae), but has a superficially similar growth form. Technically, the plants do not contain a poison; they contain a potent allergen.

=== Species ===
29 species are accepted.
* &quot;Toxicodendron acuminatum&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus acuminata&quot;) – China, Bhutan, India and Nepal.
* &quot;Toxicodendron bimannii&quot; – Assam
* &quot;Toxicodendron borneense&quot; – Borneo
* &quot;Toxicodendron calcicola&quot; – endemic to China
* &quot;Toxicodendron delavayi&quot; – southwestern Sichuan and northwestern and central Yunnan in south-central China
* &quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus diversiloba&quot;) – Western poison oak is found throughout much of western North America, ranging from the Pacific coast into the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges between southern British Columbia and southward into Baja California. It is extremely common in that region, where it is the predominant species of the genus. Indeed, it is California&#x27;s most prevalent woody shrub. Extremely variable, it grows as a dense shrub in open sunlight, or as a climbing vine in shaded areas. It propagates by creeping rhizomes or by seed. The compound leaves are divided into three leaflets, 35–100 mm long, with scalloped, toothed, or lobed edges. The leaves may be red, yellow, green, or some combination of those colors, depending on various factors, such as the time of year.
* &quot;Toxicodendron fulvum&quot; – southern Yunnan and northern Thailand
* &quot;Toxicodendron grandiflorum&quot; – Yunnan and southwestern Sichuan in south-central China
* &quot;Toxicodendron griffithii&quot; – eastern Himalayas to Yunnan and southwestern Guizhou in south-central China
* &quot;Toxicodendron hirtellum&quot; – southern Sichuan
* &quot;Toxicodendron hookeri&quot; – eastern Nepal to Assam
* &quot;Toxicodendron khasianum&quot; – Assam and Bangladesh
* &quot;Toxicodendron × lobadioides&quot; (&quot;T. diversilobum&quot; × &quot;T. rydbergii&quot;) – Washington in the northwestern United States
* &quot;Toxicodendron nodosum&quot; – western Malesia and southwestern Sulawesi
* &quot;Toxicodendron oligophyllum&quot; – Fujian in southeastern China
* &quot;Toxicodendron orientale&quot; (synonyms &quot;Rhus orientale&quot; and &quot;R. ambigua&quot;) – Asian poison ivy is very similar to the American poison ivy, and replaces it throughout east Asia (so similar that some texts treat it as just a variety of the American species).
* &quot;Toxicodendron pubescens&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus toxicarium&quot;) – Atlantic poison oak grows mostly in sandy soils in eastern parts of the United States. Growing as a shrub, its leaves are in groups of three. Leaves are typically rounded or lobed and are densely-haired. Although it is often confused with the more common poison ivy, even in the scientific literature, Atlantic poison oak has small clumps of hair on the veins on the underside of the leaves, while poison ivy does not.
* &quot;Toxicodendron quinquefoliolatum&quot; – Guizhou in south-central China
* &quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus radicans&quot;) – Poison ivy is extremely common in some areas of North America. In the United States, it grows in all states east of the Rockies. It also grows in Central America. Appearing as a creeping vine, a climbing vine, or a shrub, it reproduces both by creeping rootstocks and by seeds. The appearance varies. Leaves, arranged in an alternate pattern, usually in groups of three, are from 20 to 50 mm long, pointed at the tip, and can be toothed, smooth, or lobed, but never serrated. Leaves may be shiny or dull, and the color varies with the season. Vines grow almost straight up rather than wrapping around their support and can grow to 8–10 m in height. In some cases, Poison ivy may entirely engulf the supporting structure, and vines may extend outward like limbs so that it appears to be a Poison ivy &quot;tree&quot;.
* &quot;Toxicodendron rhetsoides&quot; – Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam
* &quot;Toxicodendron rostratum&quot; – southern Yunnan
* &quot;Toxicodendron rydbergii&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus rydbergii&quot;) – Western poison ivy is found in northern parts of the eastern United States. It also exists in the western United States and Canada but is much less common than poison oak. It may grow as a vine or a shrub. It was once considered a subspecies of poison ivy. It does sometimes hybridize with the climbing species. Western poison ivy is found in much of western and central United States and Canada, although not on the West Coast. In the eastern United States, it is rarely found south of New England.
* &quot;Toxicodendron striatum&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus striata&quot;) – Manzanillo is a South American poisonous tree growing in the tropical rain forests on low elevation slopes. The name should not be confused with the unrelated Manchineel, a poisonous tree that is not a member of the Anacardiaceae.
* &quot;Toxicodendron succedaneum&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus succedanea&quot;) – Wax tree is native of Asia, although it has been planted elsewhere, most notably in Australia and New Zealand. It is a large shrub or tree, up to 8 m tall, somewhat similar to a sumac tree. Because of its beautiful autumn foliage, it has been planted outside of Asia as an ornamental plant, often by gardeners who were apparently unaware of the dangers of allergic reactions. It is now officially classified as a noxious weed in Australia and New Zealand. The fatty-acid methyl ester of the kernel oil meets all of the major biodiesel requirements in the USA (ASTM D 6751-02, ASTM PS 121-99), Germany (DIN V 51606) and European Union (EN 14214).
* &quot;Toxicodendron sylvestre&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus sylvestris&quot;) – native to China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
* &quot;Toxicodendron trichocarpum&quot; – southern China, Korea, Japan, and Kuril Islands
* &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus verniciflua&quot;) – Lacquer tree or varnish tree grows in Asia, especially China and Japan. Growing up to 20 m tall, its sap produces an extremely durable lacquer. The leaves have 7–19 leaflets (most often 11–13). The sap contains the allergenic oil, urushiol. Urushiol gets its name from this species which in Japanese is called &quot;Urushi&quot;. Other names for this species include Japanese lacquer tree, Japanese Varnish Tree, and Japanese Sumac (Note: the term &quot;varnish tree&quot; is also occasionally applied to the Candlenut, &quot;Aleurites moluccana&quot;, a southeast Asian tree unrelated to &quot;Toxicodendron&quot;).
* &quot;Toxicodendron vernix&quot; (synonym &quot;Rhus vernix&quot;) – Poison sumac is a tall shrub or a small tree, from 2–7 m tall. It is found in swampy, open areas and reproduces by seeds. The leaves have between 7–13 untoothed leaflets, in a feather-compound arrangement. In terms of its potential to cause urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, poison sumac is far more virulent than other &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; species, even more virulent than poison ivy and poison oak. According to some botanists, &quot;T. vernix&quot; is the most toxic plant species in the United States (Frankel, 1991).
* &quot;Toxicodendron wallichii&quot; – Himalayas, southern Tibet, southern China, Vietnam, and northern Thailand
* &quot;Toxicodendron yunnanense&quot; – Yunnan

===Formerly placed here===
* &quot;Searsia parviflora&quot; (as &quot;Toxicodendron parviflorum&quot; ) – Small-flowered poison sumac grows in the Himalayas between Kumaun, India and Bhutan

==Toxicity==
==Uses==
In East Asia, in particular in Japan, traditional candle fuel was produced from &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; and &quot;Toxicodendron succedaneum&quot;, among other sumac plants in the genus &quot;Toxicodendron&quot;, rather than beeswax or animal fats. The sumac wax was a byproduct of traditional Japanese lacquer manufacture. The conical rousoku candles produced from sumac wax burn with smokeless flame and were favored in many respects over candles made from lard or beeswax during the Tokugawa shogunate. Japan wax is not a true wax but a solid fat that contains 10-15% palmitin, stearin, and olein with about 1% japanic acid (1,21-heneicosanedioic acid). It is still used in many tropical and subtropical countries in the production of wax match sticks.

<text>The South American economic crisis is the economic disturbances which have developed in 2002 in the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. 

The Argentinian economy was suffering from sustained deficit spending and an extremely high debt overhang, and one of its attempted reforms included fixing its exchange rates to the US dollar. When Brazil, as its largest neighbor and trading partner, devalued its own currency in 1999, the Argentinian peg to the US dollar prevented it from matching any of that devaluation, leaving its tradeable goods to be less competitive with Brazilian exports. 

Along with a trade imbalance and balance of payment problem, the need for credit to finance its budget deficits made Argentina&#x27;s economy vulnerable to economic crisis and instability. In 1999, the economy of Argentina shrank by 3.4%. GDP continued to decline: 0.8% in 2000, 4.4% in 2001, and 10.9% in 2002. One year before, in Brazil, low water level in hydroelectric plants, combined with a lack of long-term investment in energy security, forced the country to do an energy rationing program, which negatively affected the national economy.

<doc id="69228" wikidata="Q976765" url="?curid=69228" title="Sisera">
<text>Sisera ( &quot;Sīsərāʾ&quot;) was commander of the Canaanite army of King Jabin of Hazor, who is mentioned in of the Hebrew Bible. After being defeated by the forces of the Israelite tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali under the command of Barak and Deborah, Sisera was killed by Jael, who hammered a tent peg into his temple while he slept.

==Biblical account==
According to the biblical book of Judges, Jabin, King of Hazor, oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. His general was Sisera, who commanded nine hundred iron chariots from Harosheth Haggoyim, a fortified cavalry base. After the prophetess Deborah persuaded Barak to face Sisera in battle, they, with an Israelite force of ten thousand, defeated him at the Battle of Mount Tabor at Jezreel Valley. Judges 5:20 says that &quot;the stars in their courses fought against Sisera&quot;, and the following verse implies that the army was swept away by the Kishon River. Following the battle, there was peace for forty years.

After the battle, Sisera fled on foot until he came to the campsite of Heber the Kenite in the plain of Zaanaim, where he was received by Jael, Heber&#x27;s wife. Jael brought him into her tent with apparent hospitality and gave him milk. Jael promised to hide Sisera and covered him with a rug, but after he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg through his temple with a mallet, her blow being so forceful that the peg pinned his head to the ground.

Later, during his farewell address, the prophet Samuel referred to the Israelites&#x27; subjection to Sisera as a consequence of their &quot;forgetting the Lord their God&quot;.

==Archaeological information==
The etymology of Sisera&#x27;s name is unclear. Sisera&#x27;s name has been variously identified as Philistine, Hittite, Hurrian, or Egyptian (Ses-Ra, &quot;servant of Ra&quot;). The Israeli scholar and archaeologist Adam Zertal identifies Sisera with the sea people called Sherden, arguing that Sisera came from the island of Sardinia.

Zertal and Oren Cohen proposed that the excavation at Ahwat between Harish and the Wadi Ara is the site of Harosheth Haggoyim, Sisera&#x27;s military base. However, consensus has not been reached regarding the site of Harosheth Haggoyim. Niditch suggests that its association with the term &quot;haroset&quot; might indicate its placement at any number of wooded places.
==Sisera in later Jewish tradition==
The Jewish Encyclopedia reports that possibly his father was Shamgar. According to Jewish legend, because Sisera&#x27;s mother cried a hundred cries when he did not return home, a hundred blasts are blown on the shofar on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. The Talmud states that the descendants of Sisera studied Torah in Jerusalem and even taught children there. A direct descendant of Sisera was Rabbi Akiva.

According to the Talmud, Jael engaged in sexual intercourse with Sisera seven times, but because she was attempting to exhaust him in order to kill him, her sin was for Heaven&#x27;s sake and therefore praiseworthy. The significance of that exact number of coituses and the meaning of the multicoital nature of Jael and Sisera&#x27;s encounter has been discussed in the scholarship, along with an alternate view in rabbinic literature that asserts to the contrary that Jael never engaged in sex with Sisera.

Also according to the Midrash, Sisera had previously conquered every country against which he had fought. His voice was so strong that, when he called loudly, the most solid wall would shake and the wildest animal would fall dead. Deborah was the only one who could withstand his voice and not be stirred from her place. Sisera caught enough fish in his beard when bathing in the Kishon to provision his whole army, and thirty-one kings followed Sisera merely for the opportunity of drinking, or otherwise using, the waters of Israel.

==Sisera in artistic works==

Sisera&#x27;s murder by Jael was frequently depicted in historical European art. Lucas van Leyden, a Dutch engraver and painter during the Renaissance period, created a woodcut of the scene.

Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi (1728–1804) wrote an oratorio, &quot;Debora e Sisera&quot;, for the Lenten season of 1788 at the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples, which was said to have been &quot;almost universally regarded as one of the most sublime works of the late 18th century.&quot;

German composer Simon Mayr wrote an oratorio (1793) on the story of Sisera for the church of San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti in Venice.

In Geoffrey Household&#x27;s 1939 spy thriller &quot;Rogue Male&quot;, the protagonist muses: &quot;Behold, Sisera lay dead and the nail was in his temples.&quot;

In a half-hour radio drama, &quot;Butter in a Lordly Dish&quot; (1948), Agatha Christie has her protagonist drug a lawyer&#x27;s coffee; after revealing her true identity, she hammers a nail into his head.

The central image of Aritha van Herk&#x27;s novel &#x27;The Tent Peg&#x27; refers to Sisera.

In Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;, artist Conway Dalrymple paints the heiress Clara Van Siever as Jael driving a nail through the head of Sisera.

The story of Jael and Sisera has been the subject of many paintings, including those by Artemisia Gentileschi, Gregorio Lazzarini, James Northcote, Gustave Doré and James Tissot.

In Shelby Foote&#x27;s &quot;Stars in Their Courses&quot; (1994), about the Battle of Gettysburg, the author reflects on the defeat of General Robert E. Lee.

&quot;The Stars in Their Courses&quot; is the title of a chapter about the Battle of Gettysburg in the novel &quot;Lone Star Preacher&quot; (1941) by John Thomason. The quotation from Judges 5:20 appears at the end of the chapter.

In the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Pro Se&quot;, the schizophrenic James Smith suffers from the delusion that (among other things) he is General Sisera and various women are trying to poison him.

In Waking the Dead s4ep1 &quot;In Sight of The Lord&quot; a series of murders are committed with a large nail through the head fixing the victim to the floor. The biblical meaning of the act is explored in the process of solving the murders.

<doc id="69229" wikidata="Q7218532" url="?curid=69229" title="Toxicodendron radicans">
<text>Toxicodendron radicans, commonly known as eastern poison ivy or poison ivy, is a species of allergenic flowering plant. It has numerous subtaxons and forms both vines and shrubs. Despite its common name, it is not a true ivy, but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family Anacardiaceae. It is different from western poison ivy, &quot;Toxicodendron rydbergii&quot;, and resembles a number of species.

The species is found in North America. Although commonly eaten by animals, with birds consuming the seeds, &quot;T. radicans&quot; is considered a noxious weed. As a poison ivy, if causes urushiol-induced contact dermatitis in most people who touch it, producing an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash.

== Description ==
Numerous subspecies and/or varieties of &quot;T.Toxicodendron rydbergii radicans&quot; are known. They can be found growing in any of the following forms, all having woody stems:

* as a climbing vine that grows on trees or some other support
* as a shrub up to tall
* as a trailing vine that is tall

The deciduous leaves of &quot;T. radicans&quot; are trifoliate with three almond-shaped leaflets. Leaf color ranges from light green (usually the younger leaves) to dark green (mature leaves), turning bright red in fall; though other sources say leaves are reddish when expanding, turn green through maturity, then back to red, orange, or yellow in the fall. The leaflets of mature leaves are somewhat shiny. The leaflets are long, rarely up to . Each leaflet has a few or no teeth along its edge, and the leaf surface is smooth. Leaflet clusters are alternate on the vine, and the plant has no thorns. Vines growing on the trunk of a tree become firmly attached through numerous aerial rootlets. The vines develop adventitious roots, or the plant can spread from rhizomes or root crowns. The milky sap of poison ivy darkens after exposure to the air.

&quot;T. radicans&quot; spreads either vegetatively or sexually. It is dioecious; flowering occurs from May to July. The yellowish- or greenish-white flowers are typically inconspicuous and are located in clusters up to above the leaves. The berry-like fruit, a drupe, mature by August to November with a grayish-white colour.

=== Identification ===
These four characteristics are sufficient to identify poison ivy in most situations: (a) clusters of three leaflets, (b) alternate leaf arrangement, (c) lack of thorns, and (d) each group of three leaflets grows on its own stem, which connects to the main vine, the middle stem is longer. The appearance of poison ivy can vary greatly among environments, and even within a large area. Identification by experienced people is often made difficult by leaf damage, the plant&#x27;s leafless condition during winter, and unusual growth forms due to environmental or genetic factors. Various mnemonic rhymes describe the characteristic appearance of poison ivy:

# &quot;Leaves of three, let it be&quot; is the best known and most useful cautionary rhyme. It applies to poison oak, as well as to poison ivy. However, some other innocuous plants have similar leaves.
# &quot;Hairy vine, no friend of mine&quot;
# &quot;Berries white, run in fright&quot; and &quot;Berries white, danger in sight&quot;

==== Similar-looking plants ====
* Box elder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;) saplings have leaves that can look very similar to those of poison ivy, although the symmetry of the plant itself is very different. While box elders often have five or seven leaflets, three leaflets are also common, especially on smaller saplings. The two can be differentiated by observing the placement of the leaves where the leaf stalk meets the main branch (where the three leaflets are attached). Poison ivy has alternate leaves, which means the three-leaflet leaves alternate along the main branch. Boxelder has opposite leaves; another leaf stalk directly on the opposite side is characteristic of box elder.
* Virgin&#x27;s bower (&quot;Clematis virginiana&quot;) is a vine of the buttercup family native to eastern North America. This vine can climb up to tall. It grows on the edges of the woods, moist slopes, and fence rows, and in thickets and streambanks. It produces white, fragrant flowers about in diameter between July and September.
* Virginia creeper (&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot;) vines can look like poison ivy. The younger leaves can consist of three leaflets but have a few more serrations along the leaf edge, and the leaf surface is somewhat wrinkled. However, most Virginia creeper leaves have five leaflets. Virginia creeper and poison ivy very often grow together, even on the same tree. Even those who do not get an allergic reaction to poison ivy may be allergic to the oxalate crystals in Virginia creeper sap.
* Western poison oak (&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot;) leaflets also grow in threes on the end of a stem, but each leaflet is shaped somewhat like an oak leaf. Western poison oak grows only in western North America, although many people refer to poison ivy as poison oak, because poison ivy grows in either the ivy-like form or the brushy oak-like form depending on the moisture and brightness of its environment. The ivy form likes shady areas with only a little sun, tends to climb the trunks of trees, and can spread rapidly along the ground.
*Poison sumac (&quot;Toxicodendron vernix&quot;) has compound leaves with 7–15 leaflets. Poison sumac never has only three leaflets.
* Kudzu (&quot;Pueraria lobata&quot;) is a nontoxic edible vine that scrambles extensively over lower vegetation or grows high into trees. Kudzu is an invasive species in the southern United States. Like poison ivy, it has three leaflets, but the leaflets are bigger than those of poison ivy and are pubescent underneath with hairy margins.
* Blackberries and raspberries (&quot;Rubus&quot; spp.) can resemble poison ivy, with which they may share territory; however, blackberries and raspberries almost always have thorns on their stems, whereas poison ivy stems are smooth. Also, the three-leaflet pattern of some blackberry and raspberry leaves changes as the plant grows: Leaves produced later in the season have five leaflets rather than three. Blackberries and raspberries have many fine teeth along the leaf edge, the top surface of their leaves is very wrinkled where the veins are, and the bottom of the leaves is light minty-greenish white. Poison ivy is all green. The stem of poison ivy is brown and cylindrical, while blackberry and raspberry stems can be green, can be squared in cross-section, and can have prickles. Raspberries and blackberries are never truly vines; they do not attach to trees to support their stems.
* Strawberries (&quot;Fragaria&quot;), wild or cultivated, have trifoliate leaves and a red vine, and can be found in similar ecosystems. However, strawberry leaflets are serrated and have same-length petiolules. The stems also have small trichomes, which poison ivy lacks.
* The thick vines of riverbank grape (&quot;Vitis riparia&quot;), with no rootlets visible, differ from the vines of poison ivy, which have so many rootlets that the stem going up a tree looks furry. Riverbank grapevines are purplish in color, tend to hang away from their support trees, and have shreddy bark; poison ivy vines are brown, attached to their support trees, and do not have shreddy bark.
* Fragrant sumac (&quot;Rhus aromatica&quot;) has a very similar appearance to poison ivy. While both species have three leaflets, the center leaflet of poison ivy is on a long stalk, while the center leaflet of fragrant sumac does not have an obvious stalk. When crushed, fragrant sumac leaves have a fragrance similar to citrus, while poison ivy has little or no distinct fragrance. Fragrant sumac produces flowers before the leaves in spring, while poison ivy produces flowers after the leaves emerge. Flowers and fruits of fragrant sumac are at the end of the stem but occur along the middle of the stem of poison ivy. Fragrant sumac fruit ripens to a deep reddish color and is covered with tiny hairs, while poison ivy fruit is smooth and ripens to a whitish color.
* Hoptree (&quot;Ptelea trifoliata&quot;) has leaves that are remarkably similar. It is, however, a much larger plant, so confusion is unlikely for any but the smallest specimens. The flowers and seeds are also easily distinguished from those of poison ivy.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;T. radicans&quot; grows throughout much of North America, including the Canadian Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario, and all US states east of the Rocky Mountains, as well as in the mountainous areas of Mexico up to around . It is normally found in wooded areas, especially along edge areas where the tree line breaks and allows sunshine to filter through. It also grows in exposed rocky areas, open fields, and disturbed areas.

It may grow as a forest understory plant, although it is only somewhat shade-tolerant. The plant is extremely common in suburban and exurban areas of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeastern United States. The similar species &quot;T. diversilobum&quot; (western poison oak) and &quot;T. rydbergii&quot; (western poison ivy) are found in western North America, and &quot;T. orientale&quot; in Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Sakhalin.

&quot;T. radicans&quot; rarely grows at altitudes above , although the altitude limit varies in different locations. The plants can grow as a shrub up to about tall, as a groundcover high, or as a climbing vine on various supports. Older vines on substantial supports send out lateral branches that may be mistaken for tree limbs at first glance.

It grows in a wide variety of soil types, and soil pH from 6.0 (acidic) to 7.9 (moderately alkaline). It is not particularly sensitive to soil moisture, although it does not grow in desert or arid conditions. It can grow in areas subject to seasonal flooding or brackish water.

It is more common now than when Europeans first arrived in North America. The development of real estate adjacent to wild, undeveloped land has engendered &quot;edge effects&quot;, enabling poison ivy to form vast, lush colonies in these areas. It is listed as a noxious weed in the US states of Minnesota and Michigan and in the Canadian province of Ontario.

Poison ivy is particularly sensitive to carbon dioxide levels, greatly benefiting from higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Higher carbon dioxide levels increase the rate of plant growth, and cause them to produce more unsaturated urushiol, which causes stronger reactions in humans. Poison ivy&#x27;s growth and potency has already doubled since the 1960s, and it could double again once carbon dioxide levels reach 560 ppm.
== Ecology ==
The fruits are a favorite winter food of some birds and other animals, including wild turkeys. Seeds are spread mainly by animals and remain viable after passing through the digestive tract. Birds may spread the seeds by regurgitation.

== Toxicity ==

Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is the allergic reaction caused by poison ivy. In extreme cases, a reaction can progress to anaphylaxis. Around 15 to 25 percent of people have no allergic reaction to urushiol, but most people have a greater reaction with repeated or more concentrated exposure. Typically, the rash from the urushiol oil lasts about five to twelve days, but in extreme cases, it can last a month or more.

Over 350,000 people are affected by urushiol annually in the United States.

The pentadecyl catechols of the oleoresin within the sap of poison ivy and related plants causes the allergic reaction; the plants produce a mixture of pentadecylcatechols, which collectively is called urushiol. After injury, the sap leaks to the surface of the plant where the urushiol becomes a blackish lacquer after contact with oxygen.

Urushiol binds to the skin on contact, where it causes severe itching that develops into reddish inflammation or uncoloured bumps, and then blistering. These lesions may be treated with Calamine lotion, Burow&#x27;s solution compresses, dedicated commercial poison ivy itch creams, or baths to relieve discomfort, though recent studies have shown some traditional medicines to be ineffective. Over-the-counter products to ease itching—or simply oatmeal baths and baking soda—are now recommended by dermatologists for the treatment of poison ivy.

A plant-based remedy cited to counter urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is jewelweed, though jewelweed extracts had no positive effect in clinical studies. Others argue that prevention of lesions is easy if one practices effective washing, using plain soap, scrubbing with a washcloth, and rinsing three times within 2–8 hours of exposure.

The oozing fluids released by scratching blisters do not spread the poison. The fluid in the blisters is produced by the body and it is not urushiol itself. The appearance of a spreading rash indicates that some areas received more of the poison and reacted sooner than other areas or that contamination is still occurring from contact with objects to which the original poison was spread. Those affected can unknowingly spread the urushiol inside the house, on phones, doorknobs, couches, counters, desks, and so on, thus in fact repeatedly coming into contact with poison ivy and extending the length of time of the rash. If this has happened, wipe down the surfaces with bleach or a commercial urushiol removal agent. The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less. If plant material with urushiol is burned and the smoke then inhaled, this rash will appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty. If poison ivy is eaten, the mucous lining of the mouth and digestive tract can be damaged. An urushiol rash usually develops within a week of exposure and can last 1–4 weeks, depending on severity and treatment. In rare cases, urushiol reactions may require hospitalization.

Urushiol oil can remain active for several years, so handling dead leaves or vines can cause a reaction. In addition, oil transferred from the plant to other objects (such as pet fur) can cause the rash if it comes into contact with the skin. Clothing, tools, and other objects that have been exposed to oil should be washed to prevent further reactions.

People who are sensitive to urushiol can also experience a similar rash from mangoes. Mangoes are in the same family (Anacardiaceae) as poison ivy; the sap of the mango tree and skin of mangoes has a chemical compound similar to urushiol. A related allergenic compound is present in the raw shells of cashews. Similar reactions have been reported occasionally from contact with the related Fragrant Sumac (&quot;Rhus aromatica&quot;) and Japanese lacquer tree. These other plants are also in the family Anacardiaceae.

=== Treatment ===
Immediate washing with soap and cold water or rubbing alcohol may help prevent a reaction. During a reaction, Calamine lotion or diphenhydramine may help mitigate symptoms. Corticosteroids, either applied to the skin or taken by mouth, may be appropriate in extreme cases. An astringent containing aluminum acetate (such as Burow&#x27;s solution) may also provide relief and soothe the uncomfortable symptoms of the rash.

<doc id="69232" wikidata="Q157649" url="?curid=69232" title="Sumac">
<text>Sumac or sumach ( , )—not to be confused with poison sumac—is any of the roughly 35 species of flowering plants in the genus Rhus (and related genera) of the cashew and mango tree family, Anacardiaceae. However, it is &quot;Rhus coriaria&quot; that is most commonly used for culinary purposes. Sumac is prized as a spice—especially in Kurd, Arab, Iranian, Lebanese, and other Middle Eastern cuisines—and used as a dye and holistic remedy. The plants grow in subtropical and temperate regions, on nearly every continent except Antarctica and South America. 

==Description==
Sumacs are dioecious shrubs and small trees in the family Anacardiaceae that can reach a height of . The leaves are usually pinnately compound, though some species have trifoliate or simple leaves. The flowers are in dense panicles or spikes long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The fruits are reddish, thin-fleshed drupes covered in varying levels of hairs at maturity and form dense clusters at branch tips, sometimes called sumac bobs.

Sumacs propagate both by seed (spread by birds and other animals through their droppings), and by new shoots from rhizomes, forming large clonal colonies.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of &quot;Rhus&quot; has a long history, with de Candolle proposing a subgeneric classification with 5 sections in 1825. At its largest circumscription, &quot;Rhus&quot;, with over 250 species, has been the largest genus in the family Anacardiaceae.

Other authors used subgenera and placed some species in separate genera, hence the use of &quot;Rhus&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; and &quot;Rhus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;s.s.&quot;). One classification uses two subgenera, &quot;Rhus&quot; (about 10 spp.) and &quot;Lobadium&quot; (about 25 spp.), while at the same time &quot;Cotinus&quot;, &quot;Duckera&quot;, &quot;Malosma&quot;, &quot;Metopium&quot;, &quot;Searsia&quot; and &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; segregated to create &quot;Rhus&quot; &quot;s.s.&quot;. Other genera that have been segregated include &quot;Actinocheita&quot; and &quot;Baronia&quot;. As defined, &quot;Rhus&quot; &quot;s.s.&quot; appears monophyletic by molecular phylogeny research. However, the subgenera do not appear to be monophyletic. The larger subgenus, &quot;Lobadium&quot;, has been divided further into sections, &quot;Lobadium&quot;, &quot;Terebinthifolia&quot;, and &quot;Styphonia&quot; (two subsections).

* &quot;Searsia mysorensis&quot; (as &quot;Rhus mysorensis&quot; ) – Mysore sumac

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sumac&quot; traces its etymology from Old French &quot;sumac&quot; (13th century), from Mediaeval Latin &quot;sumach&quot;, from Arabic &#x27; (), from Syriac &#x27; ()- meaning &quot;red&quot;. The generic name &quot;Rhus&quot; derives from Ancient Greek ῥοῦς (&quot;rhous&quot;), meaning &quot;sumac&quot;, of unknown etymology; the suggestion that it is connected with the verb ῥέω (&quot;rheō&quot;), &quot;to flow&quot;, is now rejected by scholars.

==Cultivation and uses==

Species including the fragrant sumac (&quot;R. aromatica&quot;), the littleleaf sumac (&quot;R. microphylla&quot;), the smooth sumac (&quot;R. glabra&quot;), and the staghorn sumac (&quot;R. typhina&quot;) are grown for ornament, either as the wild types or as cultivars.

===In food===
The dried fruits of some species are ground to produce a tangy, crimson spice popular in many countries. Fruits are also used to make a traditional &quot;pink lemonade&quot; beverage by steeping them in water, straining to remove the hairs that may irritate the mouth or throat, sometimes adding sweeteners such as honey or sugar. Sumac&#x27;s tart flavor comes from high amounts of malic acid.

The fruits (drupes) of &quot;Rhus coriaria&quot; are ground into a reddish-purple powder used as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine to add a tart, lemony taste to salads or meat. In Arab cuisine, it is used as a garnish on &quot;meze&quot; dishes such as hummus and &quot;tashi&quot;, it is also commonly added to falafel. Syria uses the spice also, it is one of the main ingredients of Kubah Sumakieh in Aleppo of Syria, it is added to salads in the Levant, as well as being one of the main ingredients in the Palestinian dish &quot;musakhan&quot;. In Afghan, Armenian, Iraqi, Iranian and Mizrahi cuisines, sumac is added to rice or &quot;kebab&quot;. In Armenian, Azerbaijani, Central Asian, Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish and Kurdish cuisines, it is added to salads, &quot;kebab&quot; and &quot;lahmajoun&quot;. &quot;Rhus coriaria&quot; is used in the spice mixture &quot;za&#x27;atar&quot;.

During medieval times, primarily from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, sumac appeared in cookbooks frequently used by the affluent in Western Europe. One dish in particular called &quot;sumāqiyya&quot;, a stew made from sumac, was frequently rendered as &quot;somacchia&quot; by Europeans.

In North America, the smooth sumac (&quot;R. glabra&quot;), three-leaf sumac (&quot;R. trilobata&quot;), and staghorn sumac (&quot;R. typhina&quot;) are sometimes used to make a beverage termed &quot;sumac-ade&quot;, &quot;Indian lemonade&quot;, or &quot;rhus juice&quot;. This drink is made by soaking the drupes in cool water, rubbing them to extract the essence, straining the liquid through a cotton cloth, and sweetening it. Native Americans also use the leaves and drupes of these sumacs combined with tobacco in traditional smoking mixtures.

===Dye and tanning agent===
The leaves and bark of most sumac species contain high levels of tannins and have been used in the manufacturing of leather by many cultures around the world. The Hebrew name &quot;og ha-bursaka&#x27;im&quot; means &quot;tanner&#x27;s sumac&quot;, as does the Latin name of &quot;R. coriaria&quot;. The leaves of certain sumacs yield tannin (mostly pyrogallol-type), a substance used in vegetable tanning. Notable sources include the leaves of &quot;R. coriaria&quot;, Chinese gall on &quot;R. chinensis&quot;, and wood and roots of &quot;R. pentaphylla&quot;. Leather tanned with sumac is flexible, light in weight, and light in color. One type of leather made with sumac tannins is morocco leather.

The dyeing property of sumac needed to be considered when it was shipped as a fine floury substance in sacks as a light cargo accompanying heavy cargoes such as marble. Sumac was especially dangerous to marble: &quot;When sumac dust settles on white marble, the result is not immediately apparent, but if it once becomes wet, or even damp, it becomes a powerful purple dye, which penetrates the marble to an extraordinary depth.&quot;

Ibn Badis describes a formula for making red ink out of leeched sumac mixed with gum.

 was used only for the outerwear of the Emperor of Japan, thus being one of the forbidden сolors.

===Traditional medicinal use===
Sumac was used as a treatment for several different ailments in medieval medicine, primarily in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries (where sumac was more readily available than in Europe). An 11th-century shipwreck off the coast of Rhodes, excavated by archeologists in the 1970s, contained commercial quantities of sumac drupes. These could have been intended for use as medicine, as a culinary spice, or as a dye. A clinical study showed that dietary sumac decreases the blood pressure in patients with hypertension and can be used as adjunctive treatment.

===Other uses===
Some beekeepers use dried sumac bobs as a source of fuel for their smokers.

Sumac stems also have a soft pith in the center that is easily removed to make them useful in traditional Native American pipemaking. They were commonly used as pipe stems in the northern United States.

Dried sumac wood fluoresces under long-wave ultraviolet radiation.

==Toxicity and control==
Some species formerly recognized in &quot;Rhus&quot;, such as poison ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;, syn. &quot;Rhus toxicodendron&quot;), poison oak (&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot;, syn. &quot;Rhus diversiloba&quot;), and poison sumac (&quot;Toxicodendron vernix&quot;, syn. &quot;Rhus vernix&quot;), produce the allergen urushiol and can cause severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Poison sumac may be identified by its white drupes, which are quite different from the red drupes of true &quot;Rhus&quot; species.
Mowing of sumac is not a good control measure, since the wood is springy, resulting in jagged, sharp-pointed stumps when mown. The plant will quickly recover with new growth after mowing. Goats have long been considered an efficient and quick removal method, as they eat the bark, which helps prevent new shoots. Sumac propagates by rhizome. Small shoots will be found growing near a more mature sumac tree via a shallow running root quite some distance from the primary tree. Thus, root pruning is a means of control without eliminating the plants altogether.

<text>A sin offering (, &quot;korban ḥatat&quot;, , lit: &quot;purification offering&quot;) is a sacrificial offering described and commanded in the Torah (Lev. 4.1-35); it could be fine flour or a proper animal. A sin offering also occurs in 2 Chronicles 29:21 where seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats were sacrificed on the command of King Hezekiah for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. 
Like all types of sacrifices offered on the altar, the flour had to be unscented and the animal had to be completely unblemished. This offered sacrifice accompanied the important required core means of atonement for the committing of an &quot;unintentional&quot; transgression of a prohibition, that either has brought guilt upon the &#x27;community of Israel&#x27; or the individual. This offering is brought during or after atonement for those transgressions that had been committed inadvertently, or in ignorance: intentional transgressions could only be absolved by other forms of atonement, or in severe cases kareth. It was distinct from the biblical guilt offering.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew noun &quot;ḥatat&quot; (&quot;sin&quot;) comes from the verb ḥata (חָטָא) basically meaning &quot;to miss the mark, to err&quot;. The first use is in the sentence &quot;(..) Sin couches at the door; Its urge is toward you, Yet you can be its master&quot; to Cain in Genesis 4:7. The noun &quot;ḥatat&quot; can mean &quot;sin,&quot; or also by metonymy in phrases such as &quot;the bullock ... it is sin,&quot; or &quot;a bullock for a sin, for atonement&quot;: it can also stand for purification offering. The high priest was instructed to &quot;...lay his hand upon the head of the purification offering [&quot;rosh ha-ḥatat&quot; רֹאשׁ הַֽחַטָּאת], and the purification offering shall be slaughtered at the place of the burnt offering&quot; (Leviticus 4:29). To avoid confusion, the more explanatory term &quot;korban ḥatat&quot; (&quot;a sacrifice of sin&quot;; Hebrew: קרבן חטאת) is found in rabbinical commentaries.

==In the Jewish Bible==
Chapters 4.1-5.13 of the Book of Leviticus presents the first of three speeches of God to Moses that outlines laws concerning the &quot;ḥata&#x27;t&quot; or purification offering. Besides other types of offerings, it appears in the 24th (weekly) parsha Vayikra, a section of the Torah in the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Jewish Bible) A sin offering also occurs in 2 Chronicles 29:21 where seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats were sacrificed on the command of King Hezekiah for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah.

The end of the 37th weekly Torah portion Shlach Lecha (Num. 15.22-31) again, deals with sacrifices for inadvertent violations: they are applicable for all laws, apply to both Israelites and alien residents, but exclude expiation of defiant, willful violations of ritual law (cf. &quot;Kareth&quot;).

==In the Greek Old Testament==
In the Greek Old Testament, the Hebrew term for &quot;sin&quot; (&quot;ḥatat&quot;) is sometimes directly translated as &quot;sin&quot; - either by the Greek feminine noun &quot;hamartia&quot; (&quot;sin&quot; ἁμαρτία), or less commonly by the neuter noun &quot;hamartemata&quot; (&quot;result of sin,&quot; &quot;sinful thing&quot; ἁμάρτημα) thereby duplicating the metonymy in the Hebrew text. More often the Greek paraphrases the Hebrew with expressions such as &quot;that which is for sin&quot; (&quot;peri hamartias&quot; περὶ ἁμαρτίας) or &quot;for sins&quot; (&quot;hyper hamartion&quot; ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν) - since the Greek noun &quot;hamartia&quot; does not have the double meaning of the noun &quot;ḥatat&quot; in Hebrew.

Chapter 4 of the Book of Leviticus in the Old Testament of Christian biblical canons provides Moses&#x27; instructions from God regarding the purification offering and chapter 15 of the Book of Numbers partially repeats them.

==Choice of sacrifice==
The sacrificial animal required for a &quot;sin offering&quot; depended on the status of the sinner offering the sacrifice; 
*for a high priest or for the entire community, a young bullock;
*for a king or nasi, a young male goat;
*for other individuals, a female kid or lamb;
*for poor individuals unable to afford these, two turtle doves or young pigeons could be substituted, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering;
*for the very poorest individuals, a tenth of an ephah of unscented fine flour could be offered instead of an animal.
Like all types of sacrifices offered on the altar, the animal had to be completely unblemished.

Apart from such general offerings for an unintended sin, these offerings were made:
*on Yom Kippur, a bull as the high priest&#x27;s offering, and a young male goat on behalf of the community;
*on the appointment of a priest, a calf as the priest&#x27;s offering, and a small young goat on behalf of the community;
*on the termination of a Nazirite&#x27;s vow, a yearling ewe as the Nazirite&#x27;s offering;
*after recovery from tzaraat (skin disease), a ewe as the former sufferer&#x27;s offering;
*shortly after childbirth, a dove as the woman&#x27;s offering;
*after niddah (temporary marital separation due to menstruation) or recovery from zavah (abnormal bodily discharges), a dove or young pigeon.

==Ritual==
The ritual of the purification offering began with the offerer confessing his/her unintentional transgression while placing his/her hands and pushing his/her full weight over the head of the animal. In the case of community offerings the elders performed this function, in the case of Yom Kippur, the high priest performed this task. The animal would then be slaughtered by a Shochet (&quot;ritual butcher&quot;), the blood carefully collected by the Kohen (&quot;priest&quot;) in an earthen vessel and sprayed/thrown on the two outer corners of the Mizbeach (&quot;altar&quot;), while the fat, liver, kidneys, and caul, were burnt on the roof of the altar.

On Yom Kippur—the Day of Atonement—some of the blood would be sprinkled in front of the veil covering the entrance to the Holy of Holies when the blood would be sprinkled in front of the mercy seat; this was done seven times. The remainder of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar, and the earthen vessel that had contained it would be smashed.

The remaining flesh of the animal (in later rabbinical interpretation as one of the twenty-four kohanic gifts) was later consumed by the Kohen and his family, except when the priest himself was the offerer (such as in community offerings, and in the case of the Day of Atonement), when it would be burnt at a ritually clean location outside the Temple sanctuary. Leviticus 6:26 stipulates that &quot;the priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of meeting&quot;, a point repeated at Leviticus 7:7, whereas Leviticus 6:29 allows that &quot;all the males among the priests may eat it&quot;, suggesting that the proceeds of sin offerings could be shared within the kohanic community. The sharing of grain offerings within the kohanic community was more clearly endorsed by Leviticus 7:10 - &quot;Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other&quot;.

When the sacrificial animal was a bird, the ritual was quite different. The bird was slaughtered by a thumb being pushed into its neck, and the head being wrung off. A second bird would then be burnt on the altar as a &quot;whole sacrifice&quot;, completely immolated by fire.

==Textual criticism==
According to 19th century textual scholars, these rules originate from two different layers in the priestly source, thought by scholars to be one of the source texts of the Torah; the priestly code within the priestly source is believed to be a series of additions to the text, from Aaronid editors, over a long period. The earlier source is thought to be the one referring to the flesh being consumed by the priests, the latter part of Leviticus 6 falls into this source, while the later source, which Leviticus 4 falls within, reflects a development where the flesh from sin offerings was seen as insufficiently holy and thus needing to be disposed of elsewhere. In the Book of Hosea, a reference to the earlier form (Hosea 4:7-8) suggests a possible reason for the change - the priests were accused of rejoicing in the people&#x27;s wickedness as they were living off the &quot;sin offerings&quot;. Although known as &quot;sin offerings&quot;, it is more likely that such offerings began as offerings made for unintentionally breaking a taboo (here meaning something which is seen as sacred but simultaneously prohibited).

# The offerings for recovery from discharges and childbirth being for the breaking of a taboo about contact with blood - pus potentially containing blood, menstruation obviously containing it, and in the case of childbirth blood comes with the placenta. Textual scholars believe that the biblical regulation specifying the offering for childbirth in Leviticus 12 originally fell among those concerning bodily discharges in Leviticus 15 (due to various textual features), and hence that childbirth was treated as a form of abnormal &quot;discharge&quot;, for which a period of recovery was required.
# The Nazarite&#x27;s offering being due to the breaking of the Nazarite&#x27;s own taboo nature, due to consecration to the deity, when the Nazarite vow was terminated.
# Tzaraas was seen as a disease inflicted by God, as punishment for transgression of mitzvot, specifically slander and hence people becoming inflicted with Tzaraas themselves being seen as taboo (thus being temporarily expelled from society as a result); the &quot;sin offering&quot; for recovery from Tzaaras, for which the same sacrificial animal as the Nazarite&#x27;s &quot;sin offering&quot; is proscribed, being due to the breaking of this taboo state by the act of recovering.
#The Yom Kippur sin offering is considered to have developed slightly later; the biblical text seems to explain this offering as being for the purpose of protecting the high priest from death (&quot;...so that he does not die&quot;) when he approached the mercy seat, an action which was taboo (as the mercy seat was seen as sacred, but approach to it was prohibited). The passage in which this is explained as being about atonement for real sin, Leviticus 16:16 rather than just breach of this taboo, being considered by textual scholars to be a later gloss added to the text. The &quot;sin offering&quot; required when a priest had sinned, for which there is a similar sacrificial animal as the Yom Kippur offering, is considered by scholars to be a much later development, and only added to the text of Leviticus in the latest stages of its compilation, after &quot;sin offerings&quot; had begun to be seen as being about atonement for actual sin rather than relatively immediate breaches of taboos.

The other sin offerings are considered by scholars to be gradual developments; from being offered after contact with unclean animals, which is more of a taboo, to being offered for ritual uncleanliness in general, and finally to being offered for arbitrary sins. The gradations, according to which the type of sacrificial animal depends on the social status of the sinner, are considered by textual scholars to also be a later development.

<text>Sihon was an Amorite king mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, king of Ashtaroth, who refused to let the Israelites pass through his country. Chronicled in Numbers, he was defeated by Moses and the Israelites at the battle of Jahaz. He and Og were said to be the two kings Moses defeated on the east side of the Jordan river.

==Biblical accounts==

The Book of Numbers recounts that as the Israelites making their Exodus journey came to the country east of the Jordan, near Heshbon, King Siḥon of the Amorites refused to let them pass through his land:

:&quot;But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. Then Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the people of Ammon ...&quot; ()

Moses allocated the land of Sihon, the king of Heshbon, to the Tribe of Gad in the allocation of land to the Israelite tribes ().

In a similar way, the Israelites took the country of Og, and these two victories gave them possession of continuous land east of the Jordan, from the Arnon to the foot of Mount Hermon. These victories, among the earliest successful campaigns of the Israelites, became legendary among them, and are referred to numerous times in the Hebrew Bible as prototypical examples of God-given victory—for example in and .

==Analysis==
Biblical historian Joel S. Baden has discussed the similarities between the encounter with Sihon and the earlier encounter with the king of Edom (), as well as a later parallel passage ().

<text>Shunem or Shunaam ( &quot;Šūnēm&quot;; in LXX ) was a small village mentioned in the Bible in the possession of the Tribe of Issachar. It was located near the Jezreel Valley, north of Mount Gilboa ().

Shunaam is where the Philistines camped when they fought Saul, the first king of Israel (). It was the hometown of Abishag, King David&#x27;s companion in his old age (). The prophet Elisha was hospitably entertained there by a wealthy woman whose deceased son Elisha brought back to life. (2 Kings 4:8)

Shunaam is listed as a town conquered by the pharaohs of Egypt Thutmose III and Shoshenk I.

Shunaam may have been located at the site of the modern village of Sulam.

<doc id="69236" wikidata="Q332400" url="?curid=69236" title="Oswald Mosley">
<text>Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet (16 November 1896 – 3 December 1980), was a British aristocrat and politician who rose to fame during the 1920s and 1930s when, having become disillusioned with mainstream politics, he turned to fascism. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Harrow from 1918 to 1924 and for Smethwick from 1926 to 1931. He founded the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932 and led it until its forced disbandment in 1940.

After military service during the First World War, Mosley was one of the youngest members of Parliament, representing Harrow from 1918, first as a Conservative, then an independent, and finally joining the Labour Party. At the 1924 general election he stood in Birmingham Ladywood against the future prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, coming within 100 votes of defeating him. Mosley returned to parliament as Labour MP for Smethwick at a by-election in 1926 and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Labour government of 1929–1931. In 1928, he succeeded his father as the sixth Mosley baronet, a title in his family for over a century. Some considered Mosley a rising star and possible future prime minister. He resigned in 1930 over discord with the government&#x27;s unemployment policies. He chose not to defend his Smethwick constituency at the 1931 general election, instead unsuccessfully standing in Stoke-on-Trent.

Mosley&#x27;s New Party became the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932. As leader, he publicly espoused antisemitism and sought alliances with other fascist leaders such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Fascist violence under Mosley&#x27;s leadership culminated in the 1936 Battle of Cable Street, during which anti-fascist demonstrators including trade unionists, liberals, socialists, communists, anarchists, and British Jews prevented the BUF from marching through London&#x27;s East End. Mosley subsequently held a series of rallies around London, and the BUF increased its membership there.

In May 1940, after the outbreak of the Second World War, Mosley was imprisoned and the BUF was banned. He was released in 1943 and, politically disgraced by his association with fascism, moved abroad in 1951, spending most of the remainder of his life in Paris and two residences in Ireland. He stood for Parliament during the post-war era but received very little support. During this period he was an advocate of Pan-European nationalism, developing the Europe a Nation ideology, and was an early proponent of Holocaust denial conspiracy theories.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and education ===
Mosley was born on 16 November 1896 at 47 Hill Street, Mayfair, London. He was the eldest of the three sons of Sir Oswald Mosley, 5th Baronet (1873–1928), and Katharine Maud Edwards-Heathcote (1873–1948), daughter of Captain Justinian Edwards-Heathcote, of Apedale Hall, Staffordshire. He had two younger brothers: Edward Heathcote Mosley (1899–1980) and John Arthur Noel Mosley (1901–1973). His father was a third cousin to the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, father of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

The progenitor, and earliest-attested ancestor, of the Mosley family was Ernald de Mosley ( 12th century), Lord of the Manor of Moseley, Staffordshire, during the reign of King John. The family were prominent landholders in Staffordshire and seated at Rolleston Hall, near Burton upon Trent. Three baronetcies were created, two of which are now extinct (see Mosley baronets for further history of the family); a barony was created for Tonman Mosley, brother of the 4th baronet, but also became extinct.

After Mosley&#x27;s parents separated, he was raised by his mother, who went to live at Betton Hall near Market Drayton, and his paternal grandfather, Sir Oswald Mosley, 4th Baronet. Within the family and among intimate friends, he was always called &quot;Tom&quot;. He lived for many years at his grandparents&#x27; stately home, Apedale Hall in Staffordshire, and was educated at West Downs School and Winchester College.

Mosley was a fencing champion in his school days; he won titles in both foil and sabre, and retained an enthusiasm for the sport throughout his life.

=== Military service ===
In January 1914, Mosley entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, but was expelled in June for a &quot;riotous act of retaliation&quot; against a fellow student. During the First World War, he was commissioned into the British cavalry unit the 16th The Queen&#x27;s Lancers and fought in France on the Western Front. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as a pilot and air observer, but while demonstrating in front of his mother and sister he crashed, which left him with a permanent limp, as well as a reputation for being brave and somewhat reckless. He returned to the Lancers, but was invalided out with an injured leg. He spent the remainder of the war at desk jobs in the Ministry of Munitions and in the Foreign Office.

=== Marriage to Lady Cynthia Curzon ===
On 11 May 1920, he married Lady Cynthia &quot;Cimmie&quot; Curzon (1898–1933), second daughter of the 1st Earl Curzon of Kedleston (1859–1925), Viceroy of India 1899–1905, Foreign Secretary 1919–1924, and Lord Curzon&#x27;s first wife, the U.S. mercantile heiress Mary Leiter.

Lord Curzon had to be persuaded that Mosley was a suitable husband, as he suspected Mosley was largely motivated by social advancement in Conservative Party politics and Cynthia&#x27;s inheritance. The 1920 wedding took place in the Chapel Royal in St James&#x27;s Palace in London. The hundreds of guests included King George V and Queen Mary, as well as foreign royalty such as the Duke and Duchess of Brabant (later King Leopold III and Queen Astrid of Belgium).

During this marriage, he began an extended affair with his wife&#x27;s younger sister, Lady Alexandra Metcalfe, and a separate affair with their stepmother, Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston, the American-born second wife and widow of Lord Curzon of Kedleston. He succeeded to the Mosley baronetcy of Ancoats upon his father&#x27;s death in 1928.

=== India and Gandhi ===
Among his many travels, Mosley travelled to British India accompanied by Lady Cynthia in 1924. His father-in-law&#x27;s past as Viceroy of India allowed for the acquaintance of various personalities along the journey. They travelled by ship and stopped briefly in Cairo.

Having initially arrived in Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), the journey then continued through mainland India. They spent these initial days in the government house of Ceylon, followed by Madras and then Calcutta, where the governor at the time was Lord Lytton.

Mosley met Mahatma Gandhi through C. F. Andrews, a clergyman and an intimate friend of the &quot;Indian Saint&quot;, as Mosley described him. They met in Kadda, where Gandhi was quick to invite him to a private conference in which Gandhi was chairman. Mosley later called Gandhi a &quot;sympathetic personality of subtle intelligence&quot;.

=== Marriage to Diana Mitford ===
Cynthia died of peritonitis in 1933, after which Mosley married his mistress Diana Guinness, &quot;née&quot; Mitford (1910–2003). They married in secret in Nazi Germany on 6 October 1936 in the Berlin home of Germany&#x27;s Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Adolf Hitler was their guest of honour.

Mosley spent large amounts of his private fortune on the British Union of Fascists (BUF) and tried to establish it on a firm financial footing by various means including an attempt to negotiate, through Diana, with Hitler for permission to broadcast commercial radio to Britain from Germany. Mosley reportedly made a deal in 1937 with Francis Beaumont, heir to the Seigneurage of Sark, to set up a privately owned radio station on Sark.

== Member of parliament ==
By the end of the First World War, Mosley had decided to go into politics as a Conservative member of parliament, as he had no university education or practical experience because of the war. He was 21 years old. He was driven by, and in parliament spoke of, a passionate conviction to avoid any future war, and this seemingly motivated his career. Largely because of his family background and war service, local Conservative and Labour associations preferred Mosley in several constituencies—a vacancy near the family estates seemed to be the best prospect. He was unexpectedly selected for Harrow first. In the general election of 1918 he faced no serious opposition and was elected easily.

He was the youngest member of the House of Commons to take his seat, although Joseph Sweeney, an abstentionist Sinn Féin member, was younger. He soon distinguished himself as an orator and political player, one marked by extreme self-confidence, and made a point of speaking in the House of Commons without notes.

Mosley was an early supporter of the economist John Maynard Keynes. The economic historian Robert Skidelsky described Mosley as &quot;a disciple of Keynes in the 1920s&quot;.

== Crossing the floor ==

Mosley was at this time falling out with the Conservatives over their Irish policy, and condemned the operations of the Black and Tans against civilians during the Irish War of Independence. He was secretary of the Peace with Ireland Council. As secretary of the council, he proposed sending a commission to Ireland to examine on-the-spot reprisals by the Black and Tans.

In late 1920, he crossed the floor to sit as an independent MP on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Having built up a following in his constituency, he retained it against a Conservative challenge in the 1922 and 1923 general elections.

According to Lady Mosley&#x27;s autobiography,

By 1924, he was growing increasingly attracted to the Labour Party, which had just formed a government, and in March he joined it. He immediately joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) as well and allied himself with the left.

When the government fell in October, Mosley had to choose a new seat, as he believed that Harrow would not re-elect him as a Labour candidate. He therefore decided to oppose Neville Chamberlain in Birmingham Ladywood. Mosley campaigned aggressively in Ladywood, and accused Chamberlain of being a &quot;landlords&#x27; hireling&quot;. The outraged Chamberlain demanded that Mosley retract the claim &quot;as a gentleman&quot;. Mosley, whom Stanley Baldwin described as &quot;a cad and a wrong &#x27;un&quot;, refused to withdraw the allegation. Mosley was noted for bringing excitement and energy to the campaign. Leslie Hore-Belisha, then a Liberal Party politician who later became a senior Conservative, recorded his impressions of Mosley as a platform orator at this time, claiming that his &quot;dark, aquiline, flashing: tall, thin, assured; defiance in his eye, contempt in his forward chin&quot;. Together, Oswald and Cynthia Mosley proved an alluring couple, and many members of the working class in Birmingham succumbed to their charm for, as the historian Martin Pugh described, &quot;a link with powerful, wealthy and glamorous men and women appealed strongly to those who endured humdrum and deprived lives&quot;. It took several re-counts before Chamberlain was declared the winner by 77 votes and Mosley blamed poor weather for the result. His period outside Parliament was used to develop a new economic policy for the ILP, which eventually became known as the Birmingham Proposals; they continued to form the basis of Mosley&#x27;s economics until the end of his political career.

Mosley was critical of Winston Churchill&#x27;s policy as Chancellor of the Exchequer. After Churchill returned Britain to the Gold Standard, Mosley claimed that &quot;faced with the alternative of saying goodbye to the gold standard, and therefore to his own employment, and goodbye to other people&#x27;s employment, Mr. Churchill characteristically selected the latter course&quot;.

In 1926, the Labour-held seat of Smethwick fell vacant, and Mosley returned to parliament after winning the resulting by-election on 21 December. Mosley felt the campaign was dominated by Conservative attacks on him for being too rich, including claims that he was covering up his wealth.

In 1927, he mocked the British Fascists as &quot;black-shirted buffoons, making a cheap imitation of ice-cream sellers&quot;. The ILP elected him to Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

Mosley and Cynthia were committed Fabians in the 1920s and at the start of the 1930s. Mosley appears in a list of names of Fabians from &quot;Fabian News&quot; and the &quot;Fabian Society Annual Report 1929–31&quot;. He was Kingsway Hall lecturer in 1924 and Livingstone Hall lecturer in 1931.

== Office ==

===Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster===
Mosley then made a bold bid for political advancement within the Labour Party. He was close to Ramsay MacDonald and hoped for one of the Great Offices of State, but when Labour won the 1929 general election he was appointed only to the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a position without portfolio and outside the Cabinet. He was given responsibility for solving the unemployment problem, but found that his radical proposals were blocked either by Lord Privy Seal James Henry Thomas or by the cabinet.

===Mosley Memorandum===
Realising the economic uncertainty that was facing the nation because of the death of its domestic industry, Mosley put forward a scheme in the &quot;Mosley Memorandum&quot; that called for high tariffs to protect British industries from international finance and transform the British Empire into an autarkic trading bloc, for state nationalisation of main industries, for higher school-leaving ages and pensions to reduce the labour surplus, and for a programme of public works to solve interwar poverty and unemployment. Furthermore, the memorandum laid out the foundations of the corporate state which intended to combine businesses, workers and the government into one body as a way to &quot;Obliterate class conflict and make the British economy healthy again&quot;.

Mosley published this memorandum because of his dissatisfaction with the laissez-faire attitudes held by both Labour and the Conservative party, and their passivity towards the ever-increasing globalisation of the world, and thus looked to a modern solution to fix a modern problem. But it was rejected by the Cabinet and by the Parliamentary Labour Party, and in May 1930 Mosley resigned from his ministerial position. At the time, according to Lady Mosley&#x27;s autobiography, the weekly Liberal-leaning paper &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot; wrote: &quot;The resignation of Sir Oswald Mosley is an event of capital importance in domestic politics... We feel that Sir Oswald has acted rightly—as he has certainly acted courageously—in declining to share any longer in the responsibility for inertia.&quot; In October he attempted to persuade the Labour Party Conference to accept the Memorandum, but was defeated again.

The Mosley Memorandum won the support of the economist John Maynard Keynes, who stated that &quot;it was a very able document and illuminating&quot;. Keynes also wrote, &quot;I like the spirit which informs the document. A scheme of national economic planning to achieve a right, or at least a better, balance of our industries between the old and the new, between agriculture and manufacture, between home development and foreign investment; and wide executive powers to carry out the details of such a scheme. That is what it amounts to. ... [The] manifesto offers us a starting point for thought and action. ... It will shock—it must do so—the many good citizens of this country...who have laissez-faire in their craniums, their consciences, and their bones ... But how anyone professing and calling himself a socialist can keep away from the manifesto is a more obscure matter.&quot;

According to Lady Mosley&#x27;s autobiography, thirty years later, in 1961, Richard Crossman wrote: &quot;this brilliant memorandum was a whole generation ahead of Labour thinking.&quot; As his book, &quot;The Greater Britain&quot;, focused on the issues of free trade, the criticisms against globalisation that he formulated can be found in critiques of contemporary globalisation. He warns nations that buying cheaper goods from other nations may seem appealing but ultimately ravage domestic industry and lead to large unemployment, as seen in the 1930s. He argues that trying to &quot;challenge the 50-year-old system of free trade ... exposes industry in the home market to the chaos of world conditions, such as price fluctuation, dumping, and the competition of sweated labour, which result in the lowering of wages and industrial decay.&quot;

In a newspaper feature, Mosley was described as &quot;a strange blend of J.M. Keynes and Major Douglas of credit fame&quot;. From July 1930, he began to demand that government must be turned from a &quot;talk-shop&quot; into a &quot;workshop.&quot;

In 1992, the then UK prime minister, John Major, examined Mosley&#x27;s ideas in order to find an unorthodox solution to the aftermath of the 1990–91 economic recession.

== New Party ==
Dissatisfied with the Labour Party, Mosley and six other Labour MPs (two of whom resigned after one day) founded the New Party.

Its early parliamentary contests, in the 1931 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election and subsequent by-elections, arguably had a spoiler effect in splitting the left-wing vote and allowing Conservative candidates to win. Despite this, the organisation gained support among many Labour and Conservative politicians who agreed with his corporatist economic policy, and among these were Aneurin Bevan and Harold Macmillan. Mosley&#x27;s corporatism was complemented by Keynesianism, with Robert Skidelsky stating, &quot;Keynesianism was his great contribution to fascism.&quot; It also gained the endorsement of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper, headed at the time by Harold Harmsworth (later created 1st Viscount Rothermere).

The New Party increasingly inclined to fascist policies, but Mosley was denied the opportunity to get his party established when during the Great Depression the 1931 general election was suddenly called—the party&#x27;s candidates, including Mosley himself running in Stoke which had been held by his wife, lost the seats they held and won none. As the New Party gradually became more radical and authoritarian, many previous supporters defected from it. According to Lady Mosley&#x27;s autobiography, shortly after the 1931 election Mosley was described by &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;:

When Sir Oswald Mosley sat down after his Free Trade Hall speech in Manchester and the audience, stirred as an audience rarely is, rose and swept a storm of applause towards the platform—who could doubt that here was one of those root-and-branch men who have been thrown up from time to time in the religious, political and business story of England. First that gripping audience is arrested, then stirred and finally, as we have said, swept off its feet by a tornado of yelled at the defiant high pitch of a tremendous voice.

== Fascism ==


After his election failure in 1931, Mosley went on a study tour of the &quot;new movements&quot; of Italy&#x27;s &quot;Duce&quot; Benito Mussolini and other fascists, and returned convinced, particularly by Fascist Italy&#x27;s economic programme, that it was the way forward for Britain. He was determined to unite the existing fascist movements and created the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932. The BUF was protectionist, strongly anti-communist and nationalistic to the point of advocating authoritarianism. He claimed that the UK Labour Party was pursuing policies of &quot;international socialism&quot;, while fascism&#x27;s aim was &quot;national socialism&quot;. It claimed membership as high as 50,000, and had the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; among its earliest supporters. The &quot;Mirror&quot; piece was a guest article by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; owner Viscount Rothermere and an apparent one-off; despite these briefly warm words for the BUF, the paper was so vitriolic in its condemnation of European fascism that Nazi Germany added the paper&#x27;s directors to a hit list in the event of a successful Operation Sea Lion. The &quot;Mail&quot; continued to support the BUF until the Olympia rally in June 1934.

John Gunther described Mosley in 1940 as &quot;strikingly handsome. He is probably the best orator in England. His personal magnetism is very great&quot;. Among Mosley&#x27;s supporters at this time included John Strachey, the novelist Henry Williamson, military theorist J. F. C. Fuller, and the future &quot;Lord Haw Haw&quot;, William Joyce.

Mosley had found problems with disruption of New Party meetings, and instituted a corps of black-uniformed paramilitary stewards, the Fascist Defence Force, nicknamed &quot;Blackshirts&quot;, like the Italian fascist Voluntary Militia for National Security they were emulating. The party was frequently involved in violent confrontations and riots, particularly with communist and Jewish groups and especially in London. At a large Mosley rally at Olympia on 7 June 1934, his bodyguards&#x27; violence caused bad publicity. This and the Night of the Long Knives in Germany led to the loss of most of the BUF&#x27;s mass support. Nevertheless, Mosley continued espousing anti-Semitism. At one of his New Party meetings in Leicester in April 1935, he said, &quot;For the first time I openly and publicly challenge the Jewish interests of this country, commanding commerce, commanding the Press, commanding the cinema, dominating the City of London, killing industry with their sweat-shops. These great interests are not intimidating, and will not intimidate, the Fascist movement of the modern age.&quot; The party was unable to fight the 1935 general election.

In October 1936, Mosley and the BUF tried to march through an area with a high proportion of Jewish residents. Violence, now called the Battle of Cable Street, resulted between protesters trying to block the march and police trying to force it through. Sir Philip Game, the police commissioner, stopped the march from proceeding and the BUF abandoned it.

Mosley continued to organise marches policed by the Blackshirts, and the government was sufficiently concerned to pass the Public Order Act 1936, which, amongst other things, banned political uniforms and quasi-military style organisations and came into effect on 1 January 1937. In the London County Council elections in 1937, the BUF stood in three wards in East London (some former New Party seats), its strongest areas, polling up to a quarter of the vote. Mosley made most of the Blackshirt employees redundant, some of whom then defected from the party with William Joyce.

In October 1937 in Liverpool, he was knocked unconscious by two stones thrown by crowd members after he delivered a fascist salute to 8,000 people from the top of a van in Walton.

As the European situation moved towards war, the BUF began to nominate parliamentary by-election candidates and launched campaigns on the theme of &quot;Mind Britain&#x27;s Business&quot;. Mosley remained popular as late as summer 1939. His Britain First rally at the Earls Court Exhibition Hall on 16 July 1939 was the biggest indoor political rally in British history, with a reported 30,000 attendees.

After the outbreak of war, Mosley led the campaign for a negotiated peace, but after the Fall of France and the commencement of aerial bombardment during the Battle of Britain overall public opinion of him became hostile. In mid-May 1940, he was nearly wounded by an assault.

== Internment ==
Unbeknown to Mosley, MI5 and the Special Branch had deeply penetrated the BUF and were also monitoring him through listening devices. Beginning in 1934, they were increasingly worried that Mosley&#x27;s noted oratory skills would convince the public to provide financial support to the BUF, enabling it to challenge the political establishment. His agitation was officially tolerated until the events of the Battle of France in May 1940 made the government consider him too dangerous. Mosley, who at that time was focused on pleading for the British to accept Hitler&#x27;s peace offer of October 1939, was detained on 23 May 1940, less than a fortnight after Winston Churchill became prime minister. Mosley was interrogated for 16 hours by Lord Birkett but never formally charged with a crime, and was instead interned under Defence Regulation 18B. Most other active fascists in Britain met the same fate, resulting in the BUF&#x27;s practical removal at an organised level from the United Kingdom&#x27;s political stage. Mosley&#x27;s wife, Diana, was also interned in June, shortly after the birth of their son (Max Mosley); the Mosleys lived together for most of the war in a house in the grounds of Holloway prison. The BUF was proscribed by the British government later that year.

Mosley used the time in confinement to read extensively in classics, particularly regarding politics and war, with a focus upon key historical figures. He refused visits from most BUF members, but on 18 March 1943, Dudley and Norah Elam (who had been released by then) accompanied Unity Mitford to see her sister Diana. Mosley agreed to be present because he mistakenly believed that it was Lady Redesdale, Diana and Unity&#x27;s mother, who was accompanying Unity. The internment, particularly that of Lady Mosley, resulted in significant public debate in the press, although most of the public supported the government&#x27;s actions. Others demanded a trial, either in the hope it would end the detention or in the hope of a conviction. During his internment he developed what would become a lifelong friendship with fellow prisoner Cahir Healy, a Catholic Irish nationalist MP for the Northern Irish Parliament.

In November 1943, the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, ordered the release of the Mosleys. After a fierce debate in the House of Commons, Morrison&#x27;s action was upheld by a vote of 327–26. Mosley, who was suffering with phlebitis, spent the rest of the war confined under house arrest and police supervision. On his release from prison, he first stayed with his sister-in-law Pamela Mitford, followed shortly by a stay at the Shaven Crown Hotel in Shipton-under-Wychwood. He then purchased Crux Easton House, near Newbury, with Diana. He and his wife remained the subject of much press attention.

==Post-war politics==
After the Second World War, Mosley was contacted by former supporters and persuaded to return to participation in politics. In 1948 he formed the Union Movement, which called for a single nation-state to cover the continent of Europe (known as Europe a Nation) and in 1962 attempted to launch a National Party of Europe to this end. He had connections with the Italian neo-fascist political party, Movimento Sociale Italiano, and contributed to a weekly Roman magazine, (Ace of Clubs, published from 1948 to 1957), which was supported by his Europe a Nation. &quot;The New European&quot; has described Mosley as an &quot;avowed Europhile&quot;. The Union Movement&#x27;s meetings were often physically disrupted, as Mosley&#x27;s meetings had been before the war, and largely by the same opponents. This may have contributed to his decision, in 1951, to leave Britain and live in Ireland. He responded to criticism of his abandoning his supporters in a hostile Britain for a life abroad by saying, &quot;You don&#x27;t clear up a dungheap from underneath it.&quot; In the 1950s Mosley advocated that Africa be divided into black and white areas, but the decolonisation of the 1960s put an end to this proposal.

Mosley was a key pioneer in the emergence of Holocaust denial. While not denying the existence of Nazi concentration camps, he claimed that they were a necessity to hold &quot;a considerable disaffected population&quot;, where problems were caused by lack of supplies due to &quot;incessant bombing&quot; by the Allies, with bodies burned in gas chambers due to typhus outbreaks, rather than being created by the Nazis to exterminate people. He sought to discredit pictures taken in places like Buchenwald and Belsen. He also claimed that the Holocaust was to be blamed on the Jews and that Adolf Hitler knew nothing about it. He criticised the Nuremberg trials as &quot;a zoo and a peep show&quot;.

In the wake of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, Mosley briefly returned to Britain to stand in the 1959 general election at Kensington North. He led his campaign stridently on an anti-immigration platform, calling for forced repatriation of Caribbean immigrants as well as a prohibition upon mixed marriages. Mosley&#x27;s final share of the vote, within the Kensington North constituency, was just 8.1%. Shortly after his failed election campaign, Mosley permanently moved to Orsay, outside Paris.

In 1961, he took part in a debate at University College London about Commonwealth immigration, seconded by a young David Irving. He returned to politics one last time, contesting the 1966 general election at Shoreditch and Finsbury, and received 4.6% of the vote. After this, he retired and moved back to France, where he wrote his autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot; (1968). In 1968 he remarked in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;I am not, and never have been, a man of the right. My position was on the left and is now in the centre of politics.&quot;

In 1977, Mosley was nominated as a candidate for Rector of the University of Glasgow. He polled over 100 votes, but finished last.

Mosley&#x27;s political thought is believed to have influence on the organic farming movement in Great Britain. Henry Williamson, the agricultural writer and ruralist, put the theories of &quot;blood and soil&quot; into practice, which, in effect, acted as a demonstration farm for Mosley&#x27;s ideas for the BUF. In &quot;The Story of a Norfolk Farm&quot; (1941) Williamson recounts the physical and philosophical journey he undertook in turning the farm&#x27;s worn-out soil back into fertile land. The tone contained in this text is more politically overt than in his nature works. Throughout the book, Williamson makes references to regular meetings he had held with his &quot;Leader&quot; (Mosley) and a group of like-minded agrarian thinkers. Lady Eve Balfour, a founder of the Soil Association, supported Mosley&#x27;s proposals to abolish Church of England tithes on agricultural land (Mosley&#x27;s blackshirts &quot;protected&quot; a number of East Anglian farms in the 1930s from the bailiffs authorised to extract payments to the Church). Jorian Jenks, another early member of the Soil Association, was active within the Blackshirts and served as Mosley&#x27;s agricultural adviser.

== Personal life ==

Mosley had three children with his first wife Lady Cynthia Curzon.
* Vivien Elisabeth Mosley (1921–2002); she married Desmond Francis Forbes Adam (1926–1958) on 15 January 1949. Adam had been educated at Eton College and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. The couple had two daughters, Cynthia and Arabella, and a son, Rupert.
* Nicholas Mosley (1923–2017) (later 3rd Baron Ravensdale, a title inherited from his mother&#x27;s family), and 7th Baronet of Ancoats; he was a novelist and wrote a biography of his father and edited his memoirs for publication.
* Michael Mosley (1932–2012), unmarried and without issue.
In 1924, Lady Cynthia joined the Labour Party, and was elected as the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent in 1929. She later joined Oswald&#x27;s New Party and lost the 1931 election in Stoke. She died in 1933 at 34 after an operation for peritonitis following acute appendicitis, in London.

Mosley had two children with his second wife, Diana Mitford (1910–2003):
* (Oswald) Alexander Mosley (1938–2005)
* Max Mosley (1940–2021), who was president of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) for 16 years

In later life he developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Death and funeral ==
Mosley died on 3 December 1980 at Orsay. His body was cremated in a ceremony held at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were scattered on the pond at Orsay. His son Alexander stated that they had received many messages of condolence but no abusive words. &quot;All that was a very long time ago,&quot; he said.

==Coat of arms==
== Electoral record ==

























Chamberlayne was nominated by the non-party Harrow Electors League.

== Archive and residences ==
Mosley&#x27;s personal papers are held at the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Special Collections Archive.

Mosley&#x27;s ancestral family residence, Rolleston Hall in Staffordshire, was demolished in 1928. Mosley and his first wife, Cynthia, also lived at Savay Farm, Denham. Immediately following his release in 1943, Mosley lived with his second wife, Diana, at Crux Easton, Hampshire In 1945, he moved to Crowood Farm, located near Marlborough, Wiltshire, which he ran. In November 1945, Mosley was summoned to court for allegedly causing unnecessary suffering to be caused to pigs by failing to provide adequate feeding and accommodation for them. When the decision of the court was announced, Mosley, who had pleaded not guilty, and summoned his own defence, was responsible for an outburst. The hearing lasted for five hours and the charge was dismissed.

Mosley&#x27;s residence in Fermoy, Co. Cork, Ireland, known as Ileclash House, was put up for sale in 2011, and again in 2016, 2018 and 2020. A Georgian style house, it was built in the 18th century and by 2011 was accompanied by 12 acres. It had fallen into a state of disrepair until it was purchased and restored by Mosley in the 1950s. In the same decade, he bought and restored Clonfert Palace, also in Ireland.

== In popular culture ==

===Alternative history fiction===
* In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; comic &quot;&quot;, Mosley becomes prime minister after the defeat of the Martian invasion of 1938.
* In Terrance Dicks&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; New Adventures novel &quot;&quot;, Prime Minister Mosley is shown addressing Britain&#x27;s first National Socialist parliament.
* In Kim Newman&#x27;s &quot;The Bloody Red Baron&quot;, Mosley is shot down and killed in 1918 by Erich von Stalhein (from the Biggles series by W. E. Johns) and a character later comments that &quot;a career has been ended before it was begun&quot;.
* In Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, a secret pact between Charles Lindbergh who has become president of the United States and Hitler includes an agreement to impose Mosley as the ruler of a German-occupied Britain with America&#x27;s blessing after a ruse in which Lindbergh convinces Churchill to negotiate peace with Hitler, which deliberately fails—mirroring the dishonesty and repudiation of key Hitler-signed treaties, the Munich Conference Accord and Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.
* In C. J. Sansom&#x27;s novel &quot;Dominion&quot;, the Second World War ends in June 1940, when the British government, under the leadership of prime minister Lord Halifax, signs a peace treaty with Nazi Germany in Berlin. By November 1952, Mosley is the home secretary in the cabinet of Lord Beaverbrook, who leads a coalition government consisting of the pro-treaty factions of the Conservatives and Labour as well as the BUF. The government works closely and sympathises with the Nazi regime in Germany. Under Mosley&#x27;s leadership, the police have become a feared force and an &quot;Auxiliary Police&quot; consisting mainly of British Union of Fascists thugs that has been set up to deal with political crime.
* In Lavie Tidhar&#x27;s &quot;A Man Lies Dreaming&quot; (2014), Mosley is running for (and eventually becomes) prime minister, in a world where the Communist Party of Germany, rather than the Nazis, successfully overthrew the Weimar Republic in 1933.
* Mosley appears more than once in the works of Harry Turtledove.
** The &quot;Colonization trilogy&quot; sees Mosley, still an MP in 1963, spearheading an effort to pass legislation revoking the citizenship of all Jews; the plan fails in the short term.
** &quot;In the Presence of Mine Enemies&quot; (2003) empowers Mosley as British leader in a scenario in which Nazi Germany won the Second World War.
** In the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series, Mosley is the minister of war under prime minister Winston Churchill in an authoritarian and revanchist Britain after the Entente lose the First Great War. Taking power around 1932, the Churchill/Mosley government joins the Kingdom of France and the Russian Empire in attacking the German Empire and the Central Powers in the Second Great War from 1941 to 1944 with disastrous results.
* In Guy Walters&#x27; &quot;The Leader&quot;, Mosley has taken power as &quot;The Leader&quot; of Great Britain in 1937. King Edward VIII is still on the throne after his marriage, Winston Churchill is a prisoner on the Isle of Man, and prime minister Mosley is conspiring with Adolf Hitler about the fate of Britain&#x27;s Jewish population.
* In the sixth book in Jacqueline Winspear&#x27;s Maisie Dobbs series, &quot;Among the Mad&quot;, Maisie&#x27;s investigation takes her to a meeting of Oswald Mosley followers where violence ensues.
* In the 1944 World War II novel &quot;Kaputt&quot; by Curzio Malaparte, Mosley appears in an important dream sequence. This happens in chapter IV of the book that is based on the writer&#x27;s experiences in Moldavia, just before he recounts his first hand experiences of the Iași pogrom.
* In Roy Carter&#x27;s alternative history novel, &quot;The Man Who Prevented WW2&quot;, Mosley wins the 1935 election, allies Britain with the Axis Powers, abolishes the monarchy and declares war on Ireland and France.
* In the mockumentary &quot;It Happened Here&quot; (1964), showing a Nazi-occupied Britain in the mid-1940s, Mosley is never mentioned by name. A British fascist leader resembling him is, however, shown in &quot;documentary&quot; footage from the 1930s. Mosley&#x27;s portrait can be seen alongside Hitler&#x27;s in government offices. The film&#x27;s fictional Immediate Action Organisation seems to be inspired by Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, with members referred to as &quot;blackshirts&quot; and the symbol of the BUF appearing on their uniforms.

=== Historical and modern-day fiction ===
Film
* In &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; (2017), Churchill, played by Gary Oldman, discusses with his Outer Cabinet the possibility of Britain becoming a slave state of Nazi Germany under Mosley if the decision is made to pursue peace talks right before his &quot;We Shall Never Surrender&quot; speech.
* In the film &quot;Pink Floyd: The Wall&quot; (1982), during the &quot;In the Flesh&quot; segment, the character Pink (at this stage in the story, a modern Fascist leader) is dressed in a fashion similar to that of Mosley&#x27;s.
* In the film &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), the character Sir Geoffrey Wren is based loosely on Sir Oswald Mosley.

Literature
* Amanda K. Hale&#x27;s novel &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; (2019) features Mosley as her father James Larratt Battersby&#x27;s leader in the BUF.
* Aldous Huxley&#x27;s novel &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; (1928) features Everard Webley, a character who is similar to Mosley in the 1920s, before Mosley left the Labour Party.
* In H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The Holy Terror&quot; (1939), the Mosley-like character Lord Horatio Bohun is the leader of an organisation called the Popular Socialist Party. The character is principally motivated by vanity, and is removed from leadership and sent packing to Argentina.
* P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves short-story and novel series includes the character Sir Roderick Spode from 1938 to 1971, who is a parody of Mosley.

Music
* Originally, Elvis Costello&#x27;s song &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; (1977) was an attack on Mosley and his politics. Listeners in the United States had assumed that the &quot;Mr. Oswald&quot; in the lyrics was Lee Harvey Oswald, so Costello wrote an alternative lyric to refer to Kennedy&#x27;s assassin.
* On Mosley&#x27;s release from prison in 1943, Ewan MacColl wrote the song &quot;The Leader&#x27;s a Bleeder&quot;, set to the tune of the Irish song &quot;The Old Orange Flute&quot;. The song suggests that Mosley had been treated relatively well in prison owing to his aristocratic background.

Periodicals
* In 2006, &quot;BBC History&quot; magazine selected Mosley as the 20th century&#x27;s worst Briton.

Television
* The Channel 4 biographical miniseries &quot;Mosley&quot; (1997) starred Jonathan Cake.
* The satirical television programme &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; lampooned the British media&#x27;s favourable 1980 obituaries of Mosley in a comedic music video, &quot;Baronet Oswald Ernald Mosley&quot;. The actors, dressed as Nazi punks, performed a punk rock eulogy to Mosley, interweaving some of the positive remarks by newspapers from all sides of the political spectrum, including &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
* The BBC Wales-produced 2010 revival of &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot;, set in 1936, included a storyline involving Mosley, the BUF and the Battle of Cable Street.
* Mosley, played by Sam Claflin, is the primary antagonist in the fifth and sixth series of the BBC crime drama &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;.
* Mosley was played by Jonathan McGuinness in the first series of the BBC war drama &quot;World on Fire&quot;.

<text>Shittah tree () or the plural &quot;shittim&quot; was used in the Tanakh to refer to trees belonging to the genera &quot;Vachellia&quot; and &quot;Faidherbia&quot; (both formerly classed in &quot;Acacia&quot;). &quot;Faidherbia albida&quot;, &quot;Vachellia seyal&quot;, &quot;Vachellia tortilis&quot;, and &quot;Vachellia gerrardii&quot; can be found growing wild in the Sinai Desert and the Jordan River Valley.

In the Exodus, the ancient Israelites were commanded to use &quot;shittah wood&quot; to make various parts of the Tabernacle and of the Ark of the Covenant. This was most likely &quot;Vachellia seyal&quot; or &quot;Vachellia tortilis&quot;.

&quot;The wild acacia (&quot;Vachellia nilotica&quot;), under the name of &quot;sunt&quot;, everywhere represents the &quot;seneh&quot;, or &quot;senna&quot;, of the burning bush. A slightly different form of the tree, equally common under the name of &quot;seyal&quot;, is the ancient &quot;shittah&quot;, or, as more usually expressed in the plural form, the &quot;shittim&quot;, of which the Tabernacle was made.&quot;

<text>Mordechai Anielewicz (; 1919 – 8 May 1943) was the leader of the Jewish Combat Organization (, ŻOB) during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising; the largest Jewish resistance movement during the Second World War. Anielewicz inspired further rebellions in both ghettos and extermination camps with his leadership. His character was engraved as a symbol of courage and sacrifice, and was a major figure of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust.

==Biography==
Mordechai () Anielewicz was born to a Polish-Jewish family of Abraham (Avraham) and Cyryl (Cirel) née Zaltman, in the town of Wyszków near Warsaw where they met during the reconstitution of sovereign Poland. Shortly after Mordechai&#x27;s birth, his family moved to Warsaw. Mordechai had a brother and two sisters: Pinchas, Hava and Frida. He finished Tarbut elementary with Hebrew instructions in 1933, at the age of 14. Mordechai was a member of the Betar youth movement from 1933 until 1935. He completed the private Jewish Laor Gimnazjum (also La Or, approved by the Ministry of Education). He later switched over to the left-leaning Hashomer Hatzair. At the age of 18 he went to a pre-military Polish training camp.

===Fleeing Occupied Poland===
On 7 September 1939, a week after the German invasion of Poland, Anielewicz traveled with a group from Warsaw to the east of the country in the hopes that the Polish Army would slow down the German advance. When the Soviet Red Army invaded and then occupied Eastern Poland in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Anielewicz heard that Jewish refugees, other youth movement members and political groups had flocked to Wilno, which was then under Soviet control.

Anielewicz travelled to Wilno and attempted to convince his colleagues to send people back to other Polish occupied territories to continue the fight against the Germans. He then attempted to cross the Romanian border to open a route for young Jews to get to the Mandate of Palestine, but was caught and thrown into the Soviet jail. He was released a short time later and returned to Warsaw in January 1940 with his girlfriend, Mira Fuchrer. While there Anielewicz saw his father for the last time, who was pressed into forced labor.

====Initial resistance====
After returning to Warsaw, Anielewicz organized groups, meetings, seminars, secretly attended resistance groups in other cities, and founded the underground newspaper &quot;Neged ha-zerem&quot; (, literally &quot;Counter-current&quot;). At the beginning of April 1940, the construction of the Warsaw Ghetto began. It stretched over an area of 3.4 km2, and gradually a 3 m high wall with barbed wire was built around it. In mid-October, it was officially established, and by mid-November, the Germans had driven the Jews from the rest of Warsaw and its surroundings. An estimated 400,000 Jews, representing about 30% of the city&#x27;s population, were pushed into an area which took up approximately 2.4% of the city&#x27;s area. On top of extreme overcrowding, inadequate food supply and disease caused tens of thousands of deaths before deportation even began. In October 1941, the German occupation administration in Poland issued a decree that every Jew, captured outside the ghetto without a valid permit, would be executed.

After the first reports of the mass murder of the Jews spread at the end of 1941, Anielewicz began immediately to organize defensive Jewish groups in the Warsaw Ghetto. His first attempt to join the Polish resistance, subject to the Polish exile government in London, ended in failure. In March 1942, Anielewicz was among the founders of the anti-fascist group. Even it did not have a long duration and eventually, it was dissolved.

In the summer of 1942, he visited the southwest region of Polandannexed to Germanyattempting to organize armed resistance. At the same time, German authorities launched an operation which aimed at the liquidation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto into extermination camps. It was announced that 6,000 Jews were to be dispatched each day, irrespective of gender or age, to leave for labor camps to the east in the resettlement program. The first one set off on 22 July 1942, the eve of the Jewish holiday of Tisha B&#x27;Av, which is the saddest day of Jewish history. By 12 September 1942, German authorities from the Warsaw Ghetto deported 300,000 Jews. A total of 265,000 of them went to Treblinka where they were murdered. More than 10,000 Jews were murdered by the Germans during deportations and 11,850 Jews were sent by authorities to forced labor camps. After the first wave of deportations in mid-September 1942, roughly 55 to 60 thousand Jews remained in the ghetto.

====Warsaw Ghetto uprising====
In October 1942, the Jewish resistance managed to establish contact with the Polish Home Army, which was able to smuggle a small number of weapons and explosives into the ghetto. Since the end of September 1942, the Jews started building fortified bunkers and shelters in the Warsaw Ghetto, and there were 600 by January 1943. Each fighter had a gun and several hand grenades (many of them home-made) or Molotov cocktails. There was however a lack of ammunition and heavier weaponsonly a few rifles, ground mines, and one machine gun were available.

On 18 January 1943, the Germans resumed deportation. Anielewicz, together with other members of ŻOB and ŻZW, decided to act. Twelve of them joined a group of evacuated Jews and attacked the German soldiers on the contracted signal. In the subsequent confusion, part of the deported Jews managed to escape. Most of the resistance in the attack died. Anielewicz&#x27;s life was saved by Yitzhak Suknik, who threw two grenades at the Germans who were chasing him, and as a consequence he managed to escape. This first case of armed resistance was of great importance. Among other things, it led to the greater willingness of the Polish underground to provide weapons to the Jewish resistance. Not all weapons, however, came from underground groups. Some of them ŻOB bought from arms dealers. The beginning of the revolt was a prelude to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising that began on 19 April. During these three months, Anielewicz&#x27;s leadership underwent intensive preparations for the further clashes with the Germans. He decided to use the guerrilla way of fighting with a vast network of tunnels, bunkers, roofs and surprise moments. He believed that enough Jews could withstand the ghetto for months. A day after the Germans suspended deportations, he wrote an open letter to the people of the ghetto under the name of the Jewish Battle Organization:

To the Jewish Masses in the Ghetto &lt;br&gt;On January 22, 1943, six months will have passed since the deportations from Warsaw began. We all remember well the days of terror during which 300,000 of our brothers and sisters were cruelly put to death in the death camp of Treblinka. Six months have passed of life in constant fear of death, not knowing what the next day may bring. We have received information from all sides about the destruction of the Jews in the Government-General, in Germany, in the occupied territories. When we listen to this bitter news we wait for our own hour to come, every day and every moment. Today we must understand that the Nazi murderers have let us live only because they want to make use of our capacity to work to our last drop of blood and sweat, to our last breath. We are slaves, and when slaves are no longer profitable, they are killed. Everyone among us must understand that, and everyone among us must remember it always.
The final destruction of the ghetto and deportation of the remaining Jews began on 19 April, at 6 am, the day before Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday and Passover. SS functionary Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg sent 850 soldiers (German and Ukrainian) to Warsaw with sixteen officers who accompanied a light tank and two armored cars. Members of Jewish resistance groups attacked groups of German soldiers with pistols, grenades, and Molotov cocktails from roofs, balconies, windows, doors and adjoining courtyards. Although the Germans had military superiority, they were not prepared whatsoever for the guerrilla way of fighting they had encountered. On the contrary, Jews had a perfect knowledge of the environment, relied on a number of hiding places, and were difficult to target because of the interconnection of individual houses. After two hours of intense fighting, the Germans withdrew. 
At 11:00 the next morning, soldiers under the command of SS General Jürgen Stroop entered the ghetto, where again they encountered hard resistance from approximately 750 Jewish defenders. Stroop set up artillery and sent soldiers to look for the hiding Jews. In the afternoon of the same day, there was a symbolic event where two Jewish boys climbed to the roof of one of the houses where they put Polish and Jewish flags. Both of them were in the eye of not only to Stroop, but also Himmler. On the evening of the first day, Stroop withdrew his men.

During the following days, the Germans broke the tough resistance with the use of artillery and flame throwers. The smoke and heat from the fire forced a number of Jews to leave their shelters, and some chose to commit suicide by jumping from the windows of burning houses, or they escaped through the sewage lines that were still connected to the Gentile part of the city after the construction of the ghetto. On the third day of the collision, Stroop changed tactics and tried to avoid direct confrontation to reduce the number of German losses. After over four days of fighting, the Jewish headquarters in Muranów fell. Most of the defenders were dead or wounded, and many escaped outside the ghetto.

On 23 April, a bunker was built under the house on Miła Street. Until 25 April, the Germans captured 25,500 Jews. At the end of the month, many bunkers and hiding places were exposed and most homes were burned to the ground. On 7 May, a group led by Zivia Lubetkin set out from the Command Bunkhouse under the Miła Street through a complex sewer system to find an escape route from the ghetto. The same day, however, the bunker was discovered by the Germansat that time, there were two hundred people, including Anielewicz and his girlfriend. On 7 May Stroop reported the discovery of the bunker of inner &#x27;party leadership&#x27; to Krüger, and the following day, he reported to the high command that Nazi forces had breached the bunker and the &quot;deputy head of the Jewish military organization ZWZ&quot; (presumably Anielewicz) had successfully been &quot;captured and liquidated&quot;. With no surviving eyewitnesses to confirm Stroop&#x27;s claims, the fate of Anielewicz is unknown; it is assumed that he died on 8 May 1943, alongside his girlfriend and advisors, at the surrounded ŻOB command post at 18 Miła Street. His body was never found and it is believed that it was buried in the ruins of the bunker (covered by the debris of Mila Street) – a site memorialized today as a gravesite – or carried off to nearby crematoria among the dead. The Germans had fired into the fortified headquarters with gas hoses to expel the hiding Jewish fighters to the surface. Countless had fought to their last breaths amid pure chaos, many succumbing to poison gas or taking their own lives to avoid capture. From the bunker, only a handful of them managed to penetrate the sewer network.
Several days before the final suppression of the rebellion and shortly after the destruction of the Command Bunker, a rescue operation was carried out, during which about eighty Jewish fighters were transferred to a so-called Aryan section of the city and taken to safety. The event was organized by Yitzhak Zuckerman and Simcha Rotem. Although the Germans planned to destroy the ghetto within three days, the struggles lasted for four weeks and they didn&#x27;t suppress them definitively until 16 May 1943, when Operation Commander Jürgen Stroop symbolically ended the explosion of the Great Synagogue in Warsaw. Yet, after many months, the remaining surviving Jews were attacking German patrols. Most of those who managed to escape from the ghetto became guerrillas but were often shot or committed suicide to avoid capture. Many of them later fought alongside the Poles during the Warsaw uprising in 1944. According to an official German report, written by Stroop, the German army captured 56,065 Jews and destroyed 631 bunkers. He estimated that 7,000 Jews died during the rebellion, and another 7,000 German authorities deported to Treblinka. The remaining Jews, around 42,000, were deported to Majdanek, Poniatowa, Trawniki, Budzyń, and Kraśnik camps. With the exception of several thousand prisoners in the Budzyń and Krasnik camps, the remaining Warsaw Jews from other camps were murdered in November 1943, during Aktion Erntefest.

<text>Pope Pius VII (; born Barnaba Niccolò Maria Luigi Chiaramonti; 14 August 1742 – 20 August 1823) was head of the Catholic Church from 14 March 1800 to his death in August 1823. He ruled the Papal States from June 1800 to 17 May 1809 and again from 1814 to his death. Chiaramonti was also a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict in addition to being a well-known theologian and bishop.

Chiaramonti was made Bishop of Tivoli in 1782, and resigned that position upon his appointment as Bishop of Imola in 1785. That same year, he was made a cardinal. In 1789, the French Revolution took place, and as a result a series of anti-clerical governments came into power in the country. In 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops under Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded Rome and captured Pope Pius VI, taking him as a prisoner to France, where he died in 1799. The following year, after a &quot;sede vacante&quot; period lasting approximately six months, Chiaramonti was elected to the papacy, taking the name Pius VII.

Pius at first attempted to take a cautious approach in dealing with Napoleon. With him he signed the Concordat of 1801, through which he succeeded in guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics living in France, and was present at his coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804. In 1809, however, during the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon once again invaded the Papal States, resulting in his excommunication through the papal bull &quot;Quum memoranda&quot;. Pius VII was taken prisoner and transported to France. He remained there until 1814 when, after the French were defeated, he was permitted to return to Italy, where he was greeted warmly as a hero and defender of the faith.

Pius lived the remainder of his life in relative peace. His papacy saw a significant growth of the Catholic Church in the United States, where Pius established several new dioceses. Pius VII died in 1823 at age 81.

In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI began the process towards canonizing him as a saint, and he was granted the title Servant of God.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Barnaba Niccolò Maria Luigi Chiaramonti was born in Cesena in 1742, the youngest son of Count Scipione Chiaramonti (30 April 1698 – 13 September 1750). His mother, Giovanna Coronata (? - 22 November 1777), was the daughter of the Marquess Ghini. Though his family was of noble status, they were not wealthy but rather, were of middle-class stock.
Barnaba attended the Collegio dei Nobili in Ravenna but decided to join the Order of Saint Benedict at the age of 14 on 2 October 1756 as a novice at the Abbey of Santa Maria del Monte in Cesena. Two years after this on 20 August 1758, he became a professed member and assumed the name of &quot;Gregorio&quot;. He taught at Benedictine colleges in Parma and Rome, and was ordained a priest on 21 September 1765.

===Episcopate and cardinalate===
A series of promotions resulted after his relative, Giovanni Angelo Braschi, was elected Pope Pius VI (1775–99). A few years before this election occurred, in 1773, Chiaramonti became the personal confessor to Braschi. In 1776, Pius VI appointed the 34-year-old Dom Gregory, who had been teaching at the Monastery of Sant&#x27;Anselmo in Rome, as honorary abbot &quot;in commendam&quot; of his monastery. Although this was an ancient practice, it drew complaints from the monks of the community, as monastic communities generally felt it was not in keeping with the Rule of St. Benedict. He served as librarian at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.

In December 1782, the pope appointed Dom Gregory as the Bishop of Tivoli, near Rome. Pius VI soon named him, in February 1785, the Cardinal-Priest of San Callisto, and as the Bishop of Imola, an office he held until 1816.

When the French Revolutionary Army invaded Italy in 1797, Cardinal Chiaramonti counseled temperance and submission to the newly created Cisalpine Republic. In a letter that he addressed to the people of his diocese, Chiaramonti asked them to comply &quot;... in the current circumstances of change of government (...)&quot; to the authority of the victorious general Commander-in-Chief of the French army. In his Christmas homily that year, he asserted that there was no opposition between a democratic form of government and being a good Catholic: &quot;Christian virtue makes men good democrats... Equality is not an idea of philosophers but of Christ...and do not believe that the Catholic religion is against democracy.&quot;

==Papacy==
===Election===
Following the death of Pope Pius VI, by then virtually France&#x27;s prisoner, at Valence in 1799, the conclave to elect his successor met on 30 November 1799 in the Benedictine San Giorgio Monastery in Venice. There were three main candidates, two of whom proved to be unacceptable to the Habsburgs, whose candidate, Alessandro Mattei, could not secure sufficient votes. However, Carlo Bellisomi also was a candidate, though not favoured by Austrian cardinals; a &quot;virtual veto&quot; was imposed against him in the name of Francis II and carried out by Cardinal Franziskus Herzan von Harras.

After several months of stalemate, Jean-Sifrein Maury proposed Chiaramonti as a compromise candidate. On 14 March 1800, Chiaramonti was elected pope, certainly not the choice of die-hard opponents of the French Revolution, and took as his pontifical name Pius VII in honour of his immediate predecessor. He was crowned on 21 March, in the adjacent monastery church, by means of a rather unusual ceremony, wearing a papier-mâché papal tiara. The French had seized the tiaras held by the Holy See when occupying Rome and forcing Pius VI into exile. The new pope then left for Rome, sailing on a barely seaworthy Austrian ship, the &quot;Bellona&quot;, which lacked even a galley. The twelve-day voyage ended at Pesaro and he proceeded to Rome.

===Concordat of 1801===
One of Pius VII&#x27;s first acts was appointing the minor cleric Ercole Consalvi, who had performed so ably as secretary to the recent conclave, to the College of Cardinals and to the office of Cardinal Secretary of State. Consalvi immediately left for France, where he was able to negotiate the Concordat of 1801 with the First Consul Napoleon. While not effecting a return to the old Christian order, the treaty did provide certain civil guarantees to the Church, acknowledging &quot;the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion&quot; as that of the &quot;majority of French citizens&quot;.

The main terms of the concordat between France and the pope included:
* A proclamation that &quot;Catholicism was the religion of the great majority of the French&quot; but was not the official religion, maintaining religious freedom, in particular with respect to Protestants.
* The Pope had the right to depose bishops.
* The state would pay clerical salaries and the clergy swore an oath of allegiance to the state.
* The church gave up all claims to church lands that were taken after 1790.
* Sunday was reestablished as a &quot;festival&quot;, effective Easter Sunday, 18 April 1802.

As pope, he followed a policy of cooperation with the French Republic and subsequently Empire. He was present at the coronation of Napoleon in 1804.

===Exile===
Due to a reluctance to align the Papal States join the Continental System, France occupied and annexed the Papal States in 1809 and exiled Pius VII to Savona. On 15 November 1809 Pius VII consecrated the church at La Voglina, Valenza, Piedmont with the intention of the Villa La Voglina becoming his spiritual base whilst in exile. Unfortunately his residency was short lived once Napoleon became aware of his intentions of establishing a permanent base and he was soon exiled to France. Despite this, the pope continued to refer to Napoleon as &quot;my dear son&quot; but added that he was &quot;a somewhat stubborn son, but a son still&quot;.

This exile ended only when Pius VII signed the Concordat of Fontainebleau in 1813. One result of this new treaty was the release of the exiled cardinals, including Consalvi, who, upon re-joining the papal retinue, persuaded Pius VII to revoke the concessions he had made in it. This Pius VII began to do in March 1814, which led the French authorities to re-arrest many of the opposing prelates. Their confinement, however, lasted only a matter of weeks, as Napoleon abdicated on 11 April of that year. As soon as Pius VII returned to Rome, he immediately revived the Inquisition and the Index of Condemned Books.

Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca, who was kidnapped along with Pope Pius VII, took the office of Pro-Secretary of State in 1808 and maintained his memoirs during his exile. His memoirs, written originally in Italian, have been translated into English (two volumes) and describe the ups and down of their exile and the triumphant return to Rome in 1814.

Pius VII&#x27;s imprisonment did in fact come with one bright side for him. It gave him an aura that recognized him as a living martyr, so that when he arrived back in Rome in May 1814, he was greeted most warmly by the Italians as a hero.

===Relationship with Napoleon I===
From the time of his election as pope to the fall of Napoleon in 1815, Pius VII&#x27;s reign was completely taken up in dealing with France.
He and the Emperor were continually in conflict, often involving the French military leader&#x27;s wishes for concessions to his demands. Pius VII wanted his own release from exile as well as the return of the Papal States, and, later on, the release of the 13 &quot;Black Cardinals&quot;, i.e., the cardinals, including Consalvi, who had snubbed the marriage of Napoleon to Marie Louise, believing that his previous marriage was still valid, and had been exiled and impoverished in consequence of their stand, along with several exiled or imprisoned prelates, priests, monks, nuns and other various supporters.
===Restoration of the Jesuits===

On 7 March 1801, Pius VII issued the brief &quot;Catholicae fidei&quot; that approved the existence of the Society of Jesus in the Russian Empire and appointed its first superior general as Franciszek Kareu. This was the first step in the restoration of the order. On 31 July 1814, he signed the papal bull &quot;Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum&quot; which universally restored the Society of Jesus to its previous provinces, and the Jesuits began to resume their work in those countries. He appointed Tadeusz Brzozowski as the Superior General of the order.

===Opposition to slavery===
Pius VII joined the declaration of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, represented by Cardinal Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi, and urged the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade. This pertained particularly to places such as Spain and Portugal where slavery was economically very important. The pope wrote a letter to King Louis XVIII of France dated 20 September 1814 and to King John VI of Portugal in 1823 to urge the end of slavery. He condemned the slave trade and defined the sale of people as an injustice to the dignity of the human person. In his letter to the king of Portugal, he wrote: &quot;the pope regrets that this trade in blacks, that he believed having ceased, is still exercised in some regions and even more cruel way. He begs and begs the King of Portugal that it implement all its authority and wisdom to extirpate this unholy and abominable shame.&quot;

===Reinstitution of Jewish Ghetto===
Under Napoleonic rule, the Jewish Roman Ghetto had been abolished and Jews were free to live and move where they would. Following the restoration of Papal rule, Pius VII re-instituted the confinement of Jews to the Ghetto, having the doors closed at nighttime.

===Other activities===

Pius VII issued an encyclical &quot;Diu satis&quot; in order to advocate a return to the values of the Gospel and universalized the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows for 15 September. He condemned Freemasonry and the movement of the Carbonari in the papal bull &quot;Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo&quot; in 1821. Pius VII asserted that Freemasons must be excommunicated and it linked them with the Carbonari, an anti-clerical revolutionary group in Italy. All members of the Carbonari were also excommunicated.

His concerns about the work of non-Catholic bible societies were acknowledged by Pope Gregory XVI in the latter&#x27;s 1844 encyclical letter &quot;Inter Praecipuas&quot;.

Pius VII was multilingual and had the ability to speak Italian, French, English and Latin.

===Cultural innovations===
Pius VII was a man of culture and attempted to reinvigorate Rome with archaeological excavations in Ostia which revealed ruins and icons from ancient times. He also had walls and other buildings rebuilt and restored the Arch of Titus. He ordered the construction of fountains and piazzas and erected the obelisk on the Pincian Hill.

The pope also made sure Rome was a place for artists and the leading artists of the time like Antonio Canova and Peter von Cornelius. He also enriched the Vatican Library with numerous manuscripts and books. It was Pius VII who adopted the yellow and white flag of the Holy See as a response to the Napoleonic invasion of 1809.

===Canonizations and beatifications===
Throughout his pontificate, Pius VII canonized a total of five saints. On 24 May 1807, Pius VII canonized Angela Merici, Benedict the Moor, Colette Boylet, Francis Caracciolo and Hyacintha Mariscotti. He beatified a total of 27 individuals including Joseph Oriol, Berardo dei Marsi, Giuseppe Maria Tomasi and Crispin of Viterbo.

===Consistories===

Pius VII created 99 cardinals in nineteen consistories including notable ecclesial figures of that time such as Ercole Consalvi, Bartolomeo Pacca, and Carlo Odescalchi. The Pope also named his two immediate successors as cardinals: Annibale della Genga and Francesco Saverio Castiglioni (the latter of whom it is said Pius VII and his successor would refer to as &quot;Pius VIII&quot;).

In addition, Pius VII named 12 cardinals whom he reserved &quot;in pectore&quot;. One died before his nomination could ever be published (he was originally nominated in the 1804 consistory), Marino Carafa di Belvedere resigned his cardinalate on 24 August 1807 upon citing a lack of family descendance, and Carlo Odescalchi resigned the cardinalate on 21 November 1838 to enter the Society of Jesus.

In 1801, according to Remigius Ritzler, Pius VII nominated Paolo Luigi Silva as a cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot;, however, he died before his name could be published. As a result, Pius VII added the Archbishop of Palermo Domenico Pignatelli di Belmonte in his place. In the March 1816 consistory, the former bishop of Saint-Malo Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny was among the cardinals created &quot;in pectore&quot; in the consistory, though he declined the promotion. Similarly, Giovanni Alliata declined the pope&#x27;s offer for elevation in the same consistory. According to Niccolò del Re, the Vice-Camerlengo Tiberio Pacca would have been created a cardinal either in the March 1823 consistory, or a future one held by the pope. However, he suggests that a series of controversies beginning in 1820 prevented the pope from naming him to the Sacred College.

===The possible miracle of Pius VII===
On 15 August 1811 - the Feast of the Assumption - it is recorded that the pope celebrated Mass and was said to have entered a trance and began to levitate in a manner that drew him to the altar. This particular episode aroused great wonder and awe among attendants which included the French soldiers guarding him who were in disbelief of what had occurred.

===Relationship with the United States===

On the United States&#x27; undertaking of the First Barbary War to suppress the Muslim Barbary pirates along the southern Mediterranean coast, ending their kidnapping of Europeans for ransom and slavery, Pius VII declared that the United States &quot;had done more for the cause of Christianity than the most powerful nations of Christendom have done for ages.&quot;

For the United States, he established several new dioceses in 1808 for Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Bardstown. In 1821, he also established the dioceses of Charleston, Richmond and Cincinnati.

===Condemnation of heresy===
On 3 June 1816, Pius VII condemned the works of Melkite bishop Germanos Adam. Adam&#x27;s writings supported conciliarism, the view that the authority of ecumenical councils was greater than that of the papacy.

===Death and burial===
In 1822, Pius VII reached his 80th birthday and his health was visibly declining. On 6 July 1823, he fractured his hip in a fall in the papal apartments and was bedridden from that point onward. In his final weeks he would often lose consciousness and would mutter the names of the cities that he had been ferried away to by the French forces. With the Cardinal Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi at his side, Pius VII died on 20 August at 5 a.m.

He was briefly interred in the Vatican Grottoes but was later buried in a monument in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica after his funeral on 25 August.

==Beatification process==

An application to commence beatification proceedings were lodged to the Holy See on 10 July 2006 and received the approval of Cardinal Camillo Ruini (the Vicar of Rome) who transferred the request to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The Congregation - on 24 February 2007 - approved the opening of the cause responding to the call of the Ligurian bishops.

On 15 August 2007, the Holy See contacted the diocese of Savona-Noli with the news that Pope Benedict XVI had declared &quot;nihil obstat&quot; (nothing stands against) the cause of beatification of the late pontiff, thus opening the diocesan process for this pope&#x27;s beatification. He now has the title of Servant of God. The official text declaring the opening of the cause was: &quot;Summus Pontifex Benedictus XVI declarat, ex parte Sanctae Sedis, nihil obstare quominus in Causa Beatificationis et Canonizationis Servi Dei Pii Barnabae Gregorii VII Chiaramonti&quot;. Work on the cause commenced the following month in gathering documentation on the late pope.

He has since been elected as the patron of the Diocese of Savona and the patron of prisoners.

In late 2018 the Bishop of Savona announced that the cause for Pius VII would continue following the completion of initial preparation and investigation. The bishop named a new postulator and a diocesan tribunal which would begin work into the cause. The formal introduction to the cause (a diocesan investigation into the late pontiff&#x27;s life) was held at a Mass celebrated in the Savona diocese on 31 October 2021.

The first postulator for the cause was Father Giovanni Farris (2007–18) and the current postulator since 2018 is Fr. Giovanni Margara.

==Monuments==
Pope Pius VII&#x27;s monument (1831) in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, adorning his tomb, was created by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.

<text>Sheshach (), whose king is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in Jeremiah 25:26, is supposed to be equivalent to Babel (Babylon), according to a secret mode of writing practiced among the Jews of unknown antiquity, which consisted in substituting the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet for the first, the next to last one for the second, and so on. Thus the letters sh, sh, ch become b, b, l (forming the word &quot;Babel&quot;). This code is called the Atbash Cipher and was utilized to decrypt. 

The city &quot;Sheshach&quot; does not appear on any map nor in any other documents, save the book of Jeremiah. The Atbash Cipher was applied and out of &quot;Sheshach&quot; came the word &quot;Babel&quot;. This is supposed to be confirmed by a reference to Jeremiah 51:41, where Sheshach and Babylon are in parallel clauses. There seems to be no reason to doubt that Babylon is here intended by this name.

A similar instance of this Hebrew cryptographic method occurs in Jeremiah 51:1, where &quot;Leb Kamai&quot; is code for Chaldea.

<text>Protected areas of Australia include Commonwealth and off-shore protected areas managed by the Australian government, as well as protected areas within each of the six states of Australia and two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, which are managed by the eight state and territory governments.

Commonwealth and off-shore protected areas in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, the Christmas Island Territory, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Territory, the Norfolk Island Territory and the Australian Antarctic Territory are managed by Director of National Parks, an agency within the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, with the exception of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a separate body within the department.

 protected areas cover of Australia&#x27;s land area, or about 19.75% of the total land area. The Australian Capital Territory has the highest level of protection at nearly 56% of its territory, followed by Tasmania with 42% and South Australia with 30%. The lowest level of protection is in Queensland and New South Wales with 8.71% and 9.61% respectively. Of all protected areas, two-thirds are considered strictly protected (IUCN categories I to IV), and the rest is mostly managed resources protected area (IUCN category VI). Over 43% of the protected area in Australia is publicly owned and managed by the Australian government or state and territory governments. The second-largest component of protected areas are the Indigenous Protected Areas, at over 44% and growing .

==Protected areas managed by the Australian government==
The following list shows only the Commonwealth and off-shore protected areas that are managed by the Australian government which represents a small portion of all protected areas located in Australia. Each state and territory is responsible for the management of the protected areas under its jurisdiction with exception to protected areas such as the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the Northern Territory. The majority of Australian protected areas are managed by the state and territory governments.

===National Parks===

<doc id="69259" wikidata="Q25772" url="?curid=69259" title="In Flanders Fields">
<text>&quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; is a war poem in the form of a rondeau, written during the First World War by Canadian physician Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. He was inspired to write it on May 3, 1915, after presiding over the funeral of friend and fellow soldier Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, who died in the Second Battle of Ypres. According to legend, fellow soldiers retrieved the poem after McCrae, initially dissatisfied with his work, discarded it. &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; was first published on December 8 of that year in the London magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. Flanders Fields is a common English name of the World War I battlefields in Belgium and France.

It is one of the most quoted poems from the war. As a result of its immediate popularity, parts of the poem were used in efforts and appeals to recruit soldiers and raise money selling war bonds. Its references to the red poppies that grew over the graves of fallen soldiers resulted in the remembrance poppy becoming one of the world&#x27;s most recognized memorial symbols for soldiers who have died in conflict. The poem and poppy are prominent Remembrance Day symbols throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly in Canada, where &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; is one of the nation&#x27;s best-known literary works. The poem is also widely known in the United States, where it is associated with Veterans Day and Memorial Day.

==Background==
John McCrae was a poet and physician from Guelph, Ontario. He developed an interest in poetry at a young age and wrote throughout his life. His earliest works were published in the mid-1890s in Canadian magazines and newspapers. McCrae&#x27;s poetry often focused on death and the peace that followed.

At the age of 41, McCrae enrolled with the Canadian Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of the First World War. He had the option of joining the medical corps because of his training and age but he volunteered instead to join a fighting unit as a gunner and medical officer. It was his second tour of duty in the Canadian military; he had previously fought with a volunteer force in the Second Boer War. He considered himself a soldier first; his father was a military leader in Guelph and McCrae grew up believing in the duty of fighting for his country and empire.

McCrae fought in the Second Battle of Ypres in the Flanders region of Belgium, where the German army launched one of the first chemical attacks in the history of war. They attacked French positions north of the Canadians with chlorine gas on April 22, 1915, but were unable to break through the Canadian line, which held for over two weeks. In a letter written to his mother, McCrae described the battle as a &quot;nightmare&quot;,

Alexis Helmer, a close friend, was killed during the battle on May 2. McCrae performed the burial service himself, where he noticed how poppies quickly grew around the graves of those who died at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance at an Advanced Dressing Station outside Ypres. This place has since become known as the John McCrae Memorial Site.

==Poem==

&quot;In Flanders Fields and Other Poems&quot;, a 1919 collection of McCrae&#x27;s works, contains two versions of the poem:
a printed text as below and a handwritten copy where the first line ends with &quot;grow&quot; instead of &quot;blow&quot;, as discussed under &quot;Publication&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
 In Flanders Fields
 In Flanders fields, the poppies blow
 Between the crosses, row on row, 
 That mark our place; and in the sky
 The larks, still bravely singing, fly
 Scarce heard amid the guns below.

 We are the Dead. Short days ago 
 We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
 Loved and were loved, and now we lie,
 In Flanders fields.

 Take up our quarrel with the foe:
 To you from failing hands we throw
 The torch; be yours to hold it high.
 If ye break faith with us who die
 We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
 In Flanders fields.
&lt;/poem&gt;

As with his earlier poems, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; continues McCrae&#x27;s preoccupation with death and how it stands as the transition between the struggle of life and the peace that follows. It is written from the point of view of the dead. It speaks of their sacrifice and serves as their command to the living to press on. As with many of the most popular works of the First World War, it was written early in the conflict, before the romanticism of war turned to bitterness and disillusion for soldiers and civilians alike.

An article by Veteran&#x27;s Administration Canada provides this account of the writing of &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;:The day before he wrote his famous poem, one of McCrae&#x27;s closest friends was killed in the fighting and buried in a makeshift grave with a simple wooden cross. Wild poppies were already beginning to bloom between the crosses marking the many graves. Unable to help his friend or any of the others who had died, John McCrae gave them a voice through his poem. It was the second last poem he was to write.

==Publication==
Cyril Allinson was a sergeant major in McCrae&#x27;s unit. While delivering the brigade&#x27;s mail, he watched McCrae as he worked on the poem, noting that McCrae&#x27;s eyes periodically returned to Helmer&#x27;s grave as he wrote. When handed the notepad, Allinson read the poem and was so moved he immediately committed it to memory. He described it as being &quot;almost an exact description of the scene in front of us both&quot;. According to legend, McCrae was not satisfied with his work. It is said he crumpled the paper and threw it away. It was retrieved by a fellow member of his unit, either Edward Morrison or J. M. Elder, or Allinson. McCrae was convinced to submit the poem for publication. An early copy of the poem is found in the diary of Clare Gass, who was serving with McCrae as a battlefield nurse, in an entry dated October 30, 1915—nearly six weeks before the poem&#x27;s first publication in the magazine &quot;Punch&quot; on December 8, 1915.

Another story of the poem&#x27;s origin claimed that Helmer&#x27;s funeral was held on the morning of May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded soldiers in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to &quot;The Spectator&quot; in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to &quot;Punch&quot;, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but &quot;Punch&quot; attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.

The word that ends the first line of the poem has been disputed. According to Allinson, the poem began with &quot;In Flanders Fields the poppies grow&quot; when first written. McCrae ended the second-to-last line with &quot;grow&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot; received permission to change the wording of the opening line to end with &quot;blow&quot;. McCrae used either word when making handwritten copies for friends and family. Questions over how the first line should end have endured since publication. Most recently, the Bank of Canada was inundated with queries and complaints from those who believed the first line should end with &quot;grow&quot;, when a design for the ten-dollar bill was released in 2001, with the first stanza of &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, ending the first line with &quot;blow&quot;.

==Popularity==
According to historian Paul Fussell, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; was the most popular poem of its era. McCrae received numerous letters and telegrams praising his work when he was revealed as the author. The poem was republished throughout the world, rapidly becoming synonymous with the sacrifice of the soldiers who died in the First World War. It was translated into numerous languages, so many that McCrae himself quipped that &quot;it needs only Chinese now, surely&quot;. Its appeal was nearly universal. Soldiers took encouragement from it as a statement of their duty to those who died while people on the home front viewed it as defining the cause for which their brothers and sons were fighting.

It was often used for propaganda, particularly in Canada by the Unionist Party during the 1917 federal election amidst the Conscription Crisis. French Canadians in Quebec were strongly opposed to the possibility of conscription but English Canadians voted overwhelmingly to support Prime Minister Robert Borden and the Unionist government. &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; was said to have done more to &quot;make this Dominion persevere in the duty of fighting for the world&#x27;s ultimate peace than all the political speeches of the recent campaign&quot;. McCrae, a staunch supporter of the empire and the war effort, was pleased with the effect his poem had on the election. He stated in a letter: &quot;I hope I stabbed a [French] Canadian with my vote&quot;.

The poem was a popular motivational tool in Great Britain, where it was used to encourage soldiers fighting against Germany, and in the United States where it was reprinted across the country. It was one of the most quoted works during the war, used in many places as part of campaigns to sell war bonds, during recruiting efforts and to criticize pacifists and those who sought to profit from the war. At least 55 composers in the United States set the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; to music by 1920, including Charles Ives, Arthur Foote, and John Philip Sousa. The setting by Ives, which premiered in early 1917, is perhaps the earliest American setting. Fussell criticized the poem in his work &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (1975). He noted the distinction between the pastoral tone of the first nine lines and the &quot;recruiting-poster rhetoric&quot; of the third stanza. Describing it as &quot;vicious&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;, Fussell called the final lines a &quot;propaganda argument against a negotiated peace&quot;.

==Legacy==

McCrae was moved to the medical corps and stationed in Boulogne, France, in June 1915 where he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and placed in charge of medicine at the Number 3 Canadian General Hospital. He was promoted to the acting rank of colonel on January 13, 1918, and named Consulting Physician to the British Armies in France. The years of war had worn McCrae down; he contracted pneumonia that day and later came down with cerebral meningitis. On January 28, 1918, he died at the military hospital in Wimereux and was buried there with full military honours. A book of his works, featuring &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, was published the following year.
&quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; is very popular in Canada, where it is a staple of Remembrance Day ceremonies and may be the best-known literary piece among English Canadians. It has an official French adaptation, entitled &quot;Au champ d&#x27;honneur&quot;, written by Jean Pariseau and used by the Canadian government in French and bilingual ceremonies. With an excerpted appearance on the ten-dollar bill from 2001 to 2013, the Royal Canadian Mint has released poppy-themed quarters on several occasions. A version minted in 2004 featured a red poppy in the centre and is considered the first multi-coloured circulation coin in the world. To mark the poem&#x27;s centennial in 2015, a coloured and uncoloured poppy quarter and a &quot;toonie&quot; ($2 coin) were issued as circulation coins, as well as other collector coins. Among its uses in popular culture, the lines &quot;to you from failing hands we throw / the torch, be yours to hold it high&quot; has served as a motto for the Montreal Canadiens hockey club since 1940.

Canada Post honoured the 50th anniversary of John McCrae&#x27;s death with a stamp in 1968 and marked the centennial of his famous poem in 2015. Other Canadian stamps have featured the poppy, including ones in 1975, 2001, 2009, 2013 and 2014. Other postal authorities have employed the poppy as a symbol of remembrance, including those of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

McCrae&#x27;s birthplace in Guelph, Ontario has been converted into a museum dedicated to his life and the war. McCrae was named a National Historic Person in 1946, and his house was listed as a National Historic Site in 1966.

In Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, named after the poem and devoted to the First World War, is situated in one of Flanders&#x27; largest tourist areas. A monument commemorating the writing of the poem is located at Essex Farm Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, which is thought to have been the location of Helmer&#x27;s burial and lies within the John McCrae Memorial Site.

Despite its fame, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; is often ignored by academics teaching and discussing Canadian literature. The poem is sometimes viewed as an anachronism; it spoke of glory and honour in a war that has since become synonymous with the futility of trench warfare and the slaughter produced by 20th-century weaponry. Nancy Holmes, professor at the University of British Columbia, speculated that its patriotic nature and use as a tool for propaganda may have led literary critics to view it as a national symbol or anthem rather than a poem.

===Remembrance poppies===

The red poppies that McCrae referred to had been associated with conflict since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers. The damage done to the landscape in Flanders during the battle greatly increased the lime content in the surface soil, leaving the poppy as one of the few plants able to grow in the region.

Inspired by &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, American professor Moina Michael resolved at the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1918 to wear a red poppy year-round to honour the soldiers who had died in the war. She also wrote a poem in response called &quot;We Shall Keep the Faith&quot;. She distributed silk poppies to her peers and campaigned to have them adopted as an official symbol of remembrance by the American Legion. Madame E. Guérin attended the 1920 convention where the Legion supported Michael&#x27;s proposal and was inspired to sell poppies in her native France to raise money for the war&#x27;s orphans. In 1921, Guérin sent poppy sellers to London ahead of Armistice Day, attracting the attention of Field Marshal Douglas Haig. A co-founder of The Royal British Legion, Haig supported and encouraged the sale. The practice quickly spread throughout the British Empire. The wearing of poppies in the days leading up to Remembrance Day remains popular in many areas of the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa and in the days leading up to ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand.

<doc id="69260" wikidata="Q942141" url="?curid=69260" title="Shekhinah">
<text>Shekhinah () is the English transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning &quot;dwelling&quot; or &quot;settling&quot; and denotes the presence of God in a place. This concept is found in Judaism from Talmudic literature.

The word &quot;Shekhinah&quot; is found in the Bible only as a &quot;Shechaniah&quot;, a masculine proper name. The Hebrew root “shakan” appears in numerous conjugations, it can be found 128 times. (See Strong’s Hebrew dictionary 7931.)

It also appears in the Mishnah, the Talmud, and Midrash.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;shekhinah&quot; is first encountered in the rabbinic literature. 

The Semitic root from which &quot;shekhinah&quot; is derived, &quot;š-k-n&quot;, means &quot;to settle, inhabit, or dwell&quot;. In the verb form, it is often used to refer to the dwelling of a person or animal in a place, or to the dwelling of God. Nouns derived from the root included &quot;shachen&quot; (&quot;neighbor&quot;) and &quot;mishkan&quot; (a dwelling-place, whether a secular home or a holy site such as the Tabernacle).

==In Judaism==
In classic Jewish thought, the shekhinah refers to a dwelling or settling in a special sense, a dwelling or settling of divine presence, to the effect that, while in proximity to the shekhinah, the connection to God is more readily perceivable. While &quot;shekhinah&quot; is a feminine word in Hebrew, it primarily seemed to be featured in masculine or androgynous contexts referring to a divine manifestation of the presence of God, based especially on readings of the Talmud. Contemporary interpretations of the term &quot;shekhinah&quot; commonly see it as the divine feminine principle in Judaism.

===Manifestation===
The prophets made numerous references to visions of the presence of God, particularly in the context of the Tabernacle or Temple, with figures such as thrones or robes filling the Sanctuary.

The shekhinah is referred to as manifest in the Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem throughout rabbinic literature.

It is also reported as being present in other contexts:
* While a person (or people) study Torah, the Shekhinah is among them.
* &quot;Whenever ten are gathered for prayer, there the Shekhinah rests.&quot;
* &quot;When three sit as judges, the Shekhinah is with them.&quot;
* Cases of personal need: &quot;The Shekhinah dwells over the headside of the sick man&#x27;s bed&quot;, &quot;Wheresoever they were exiled, the Shekhinah went with them.&quot;
* &quot;A man and woman - if they merit, the Shekhinah is between them. If not, fire consumes them.&quot; According to one interpretation of this source, the Shekhinah is the highest of six types of holy fire. When a married couple is worthy of this manifestation, all other types of fire are consumed by it.

The Talmud states that &quot;the Shekhinah rests on man neither through gloom, nor through sloth, nor through frivolity, nor through levity, nor through talk, nor through idle chatter, but only through a matter of joy in connection with a mitzvah.&quot;

There is no occurrence of the word &quot;shekhinah&quot; in pre-rabbinic literature such as the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is only afterwards in the targums and rabbinic literature that the Hebrew term &quot;shekhinah&quot;, or Aramaic equivalent &quot;shekinta&quot;, is found, and then becomes extremely common. Martin McNamara (see notes) considers that the absence might lead to the conclusion that the term only originated after the destruction of the temple in 70 CE, but notes 2 Maccabees 14:35 &quot;a temple for your habitation&quot;, where the Greek text () suggests a possible parallel understanding, and where σκήνωσις &quot;skēnōsis&quot; &quot;a tent-building&quot;, a variation on an early loanword from Phoenician ( &quot;skēnē&quot; &quot;tent&quot;), is deliberately used to represent the original Hebrew or Aramaic term.

===Targum===
In the Targum the addition of the noun term shekhinah paraphrases Hebrew verb phrases such as Exodus 34:9 &quot;let the Lord go among us&quot; (a verbal expression of presence) which Targum paraphrases with God&#x27;s &quot;shekhinah&quot; (a noun form). In the post-temple era usage of the term shekhinah may provide a solution to the problem of God being omnipresent and thus not dwelling in any one place. In the Hebrew text of Exodus 33:20, as another example, Moses is told &quot;You will not be able to see my face, for no human can see Me and live.&quot; Once again, using of the term shekhinah provides a solution to the corporeal idiom, so Targum Onkelos reads: &quot;You will not be able to see the face of my shekhinah...&quot;

===Jewish prayers===
The 17th blessing of the daily &quot;Amidah&quot; prayer concludes with the line &quot;[Blessed are You, God,] who returns His Presence (&quot;shekhinato&quot;) to Zion&quot; ().

The Liberal Jewish prayer-book for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (&quot;Machzor Ruach Chadashah&quot;) contains a creative prayer based on Avinu Malkeinu, in which the feminine noun &quot;shekhinah&quot; is used in the interests of gender neutrality.

===Relationship to the Holy Spirit===
The concept of shekhinah is also associated with the concept of the Holy Spirit in Judaism (&quot;ruach ha-kodesh&quot;).

==Kabbalah==
===Sabbath Bride===
The theme of the shekhinah as the Sabbath Bride recurs in the writings and songs of 16th century Kabbalist, Isaac Luria. The &quot;Azamer Bishvachin&quot; song, written in Aramaic by Luria (his name appears as an acrostic of each line) and sung at the evening meal of Shabbat is an example of this. The song appears in particular in many siddurs in the section following Friday night prayers and in some Shabbat song books:
&lt;poem&gt;
Let us invite the Shechinah with a newly-laid table
and with a well-lit menorah that casts light on all heads.

Three preceding days to the right, three succeeding days to the left,
and amid them the Sabbath bride with adornments she goes, vessels and robes
May the Shechinah become a crown through the six loaves on each side
through the doubled-six may our table be bound with the profound Temple services
&lt;/poem&gt;

A paragraph in the Zohar starts: &quot;One must prepare a comfortable seat with several cushions and embroidered covers, from all that is found in the house, like one who prepares a canopy for a bride. For the Shabbat is a queen and a bride. This is why the masters of the Mishna used to go out on the eve of Shabbat to receive her on the road, and used to say: &quot;&#x27;Come, O bride, come, O bride!&#x27; And one must sing and rejoice at the table in her honor ... one must receive the Lady with many lighted candles, many enjoyments, beautiful clothes, and a house embellished with many fine appointments ...&quot;

The tradition of the shekhinah as the Shabbat Bride, the &quot;Shabbat Kallah&quot;, continues to this day.

===As feminine aspect===
Kabbalah associates the shekhinah with the female. According to Gershom Scholem, &quot;The introduction of this idea was one of the most important and lasting innovations of Kabbalism. ...no other element of Kabbalism won such a degree of popular approval.&quot; The &quot;feminine Jewish divine presence, the shekhinah, distinguishes Kabbalistic literature from earlier Jewish literature.&quot;
&quot;In the imagery of the Kabbalah the shekhinah is the most overtly female &quot;sefirah&quot;, the last of the ten sefirot, referred to imaginatively as &#x27;the daughter of God&#x27;. ... The harmonious relationship between the female shekhinah and the six sefirot which precede her causes the world itself to be sustained by the flow of divine energy. She is like the moon reflecting the divine light into the world.&quot;

===Nativity and life of Moses===
The &quot;Zohar&quot;, a foundation book of kabbalah, presents the shekhinah as playing an essential role in the conception and birth of Moses. Later during the Exodus on the &quot;third new moon&quot; in the desert, &quot;&quot;Shekhinah&quot; revealed Herself and rested upon him before the eyes of all.&quot;

===The Tenth &quot;Sefirah&quot;===
In Kabbalah, the shekhinah is identified with the tenth &quot;sefirah&quot; (Malkuth), and the source of life for humans on earth below the sefirotic realm. The Shekhinah is seen as the feminine divine presence of God descended to transform the world, Moses is considered to have risen to shekhinah into the sefirotic realm, and transcended the world as the bridegroom of the shekhinah.

==In Christianity==
The concept is similar to that in the Gospel of Matthew 18:20, &quot;Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in their midst.&quot; Some Christian theologians have connected the concept of shekhinah to the Greek term &quot;parousia&quot;, &quot;presence&quot; or &quot;arrival,&quot; which is used in the New Testament in a similar way for &quot;divine presence&quot;.

===Branch Davidians===
Lois Roden, whom the original Branch Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Church acknowledged as their teacher/prophet from 1978 to 1986, laid heavy emphasis on women&#x27;s spirituality and the feminine aspect of God. She published a magazine, &quot;Shekinah&quot;, often rendered &quot;SHEkinah&quot;, in which she explored the concept that the shekhinah is the Holy Spirit. Articles from &quot;Shekinah&quot; are reprinted online at the Branch Davidian website.

==In Islam==
===In the Quran===
&quot;Sakīnah&quot; () signifies the &quot;presence or peace of God&quot;. As &quot;support and reassurance&quot; it was &quot;sent by God into the hearts&quot; of Muslims and Muhammad, according to John Esposito. A modern translator of the Quran, N. J. Dawood, states that &quot;tranquility&quot; is the English word for the Arabic meaning of &quot;sakīnah&quot;, yet it could be &quot;an echo of the Hebrew &quot;shekeenah&quot; (the Holy Presence).&quot; Another scholar states that the Arabic &quot;sakīnah&quot; derives from the Hebrew/Aramaic shekhinah. In the Quran, the Sakīnah is mentioned six times, in surah &quot;al-Baqara&quot;, &quot;at-Tawba&quot; and &quot;al-Fath&quot;.
Sakīnah means &quot;tranquility&quot;, &quot;peace&quot;. &quot;calm&quot;, from the Arabic root &quot;sakana&quot;: &quot;to be quiet&quot;, &quot;to abate&quot;, &quot;to dwell&quot;. In Islam, &quot;Sakīnah&quot; &quot;designates a special peace, the &quot;Peace of God&quot;. Although related to Hebrew &quot;shekhinah&quot;, the spiritual state is not an &quot;indwelling of the Divine Presence&quot; The ordinary Arabic use of the word&#x27;s root is &quot;the sense of abiding or dwelling in a place&quot;. A story in Tafsir and Isra&#x27;iliyyat literature relates how Ibrahim and Isma&#x27;il, when looking for the spot to build the Kaaba found sakīnah. Newby writes that it was like a breeze &quot;with a face that could talk&quot;, saying &quot;build over me.&quot; &quot;Associated with piety and moments of divine inspiration, &quot;sakinah&quot; in Islamic mysticism signifies an interior spiritual illumination.&quot;

===Comments regarding Sakina===
&quot;Sakina&quot; in the Quran can refer to God&#x27;s blessing of solace and succour upon both the Children of Israel and Muhammad. Al-Qurtubi mentions in his exegesis, in explanation of the above-mentioned verse [2:248], that according to Wahb ibn Munabbih, sakinah is a spirit from God that speaks, and, in the case of the Israelites, where people disagreed on some issue, this spirit came to clarify the situation, and used to be a cause of victory for them in wars. According to Ali, &quot;Sakinah is a sweet breeze/wind, whose face is like the face of a human&quot;. Mujahid mentions that &quot;when Sakinah glanced at an enemy, they were defeated&quot;, and ibn Atiyyah mentions about the Ark of the Covenant (&quot;at-Tabut&quot;), to which the sakina was associated, that souls found therein peace, warmth, companionship and strength.

==In Gnosticism==

&quot;Shekhinah&quot;, often in plural, is also present in some gnostic writings written in Aramaic, such as the writings of the Manichaeans and the Mandaeans, as well as others. In these writings, &quot;shekinas&quot; are described as hidden aspects of God, somewhat resembling the &quot;Amahrāspandan&quot; of the Zoroastrians.

In Mandaeism, a &quot;škina&quot; () is a celestial dwelling where uthra, or benevolent celestial beings, live in the World of Light (&quot;alma d-nhūra&quot;). In Mandaean priest initiation ceremonies, a &quot;škina&quot; refers to an initiation hut where a novice and his initiator stay for seven days without sleeping. The hut is called a &quot;škina&quot; since priests are considered to be the earthly manifestations of uthras, and the initiation hut represents the abode of the uthra on earth.

==Anthropological views==
===Raphael Patai===
In the work by anthropologist Raphael Patai entitled &quot;The Hebrew Goddess&quot;, the author argues that the term &quot;shekhinah&quot; refers to a goddess by comparing and contrasting scriptural and medieval Jewish Kabbalistic source materials. Patai draws a historic distinction between the &quot;shekhinah&quot; and the Matronit. In his book Patai also discusses the Hebrew goddesses Asherah and Anat-Yahu.

===Gustav Davidson===
American poet Gustav Davidson listed shekhinah as an entry in his reference work &quot;A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels&quot; (1967), stating that she is the female incarnation of Metatron.

<text>Shebna () was the royal steward (&quot;ʾasher ʿal ha-bayith&quot;, &quot;he who is over the house&quot;; the chief or prime minister of state) in the reign of king Hezekiah of Judah, according to the Hebrew Bible.

Because of his pride he was ejected from his office, and replaced by Eliakim the son of Hilkiah as recorded in Book of Isaiah (). Shebna also appears to have been the leader of the party who favored an alliance with Egypt against Assyria.

==Biblical accounts==
Shebna may have been the same &quot;Shebna the scribe&quot; who was sent by Hezekiah to confer with the Assyrian ambassador recorded in the Books of Kings (; ; parallel accounts in , , 22; 37:2), although Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary refers to them as being different people.

==Tomb and inscription==

A royal steward&#x27;s rock-cut tomb discovered in Silwan is conjectured to be Shebna&#x27;s, although only the term &quot;-yahu&quot; remains legible on the lintel from the tomb that is now kept in the British Museum. The partially preserved inscription was deciphered to read &quot;...yahu who is over the house&quot;. The assumption is that Shebna&#x27;s name may have been pronounced &#x27;Shebna-yahu&#x27;, the missing name fitting onto the damaged portion of the inscription.

<text>An individual savings account (ISA; ) is a class of retail investment arrangement available to residents of the United Kingdom. First introduced in 1999 as an Individual Special Savings Account (ISSA), the accounts have favourable tax status. Payments into the account are made from after-tax income, then the account is exempt from income tax and capital gains tax on the investment returns, and no tax is payable on money withdrawn from the scheme. 

Cash and a broad range of investments can be held within the arrangement, and there is no restriction on when or how much money can be withdrawn. Since 2017, there have been four types of account: cash ISA, stocks &amp; shares ISA, innovative finance ISA (IFISA) and lifetime ISA (LISA). Each taxpayer has an annual investment limit (£20,000 since ) which can be split among the four types as desired. Additionally, children under 18 may hold a junior ISA, with a different annual limit.

Until the lifetime ISA was introduced in 2017, ISAs were not a specific retirement investment, but any type can be a useful tool for retirement planning alongside pensions.

==History==
===Origins===
ISAs were introduced on 6 April 1999, replacing the earlier personal equity plans (PEPs; very similar to a Stocks and Shares ISA) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (TESSAs; very similar to a Cash ISA). Other tax-advantaged savings that predate ISAs include many offered by National Savings and Investments, a state-owned institution which has in the past offered a range of other tax-free accounts, in addition to its own ISAs.

Junior ISAs, introduced in 2011, replaced the Child Trust Fund.

With a few exceptions, such as from an employee share ownership plan, all investor contributions must be in cash, not kind. Adult ISAs are available to UK residents aged over 16, provided that they have a National Insurance number, but individuals between 16 and 18 are only permitted to use the adult cash component or can use a Junior ISA.

There are four broad types of adult ISA: cash, stocks and shares, innovative finance (including peer-to-peer lending) and lifetime.

===1999 Transition from older types of ISA ===
PEPs became stocks and shares ISAs, with an exemption that allowed them to continue to hold investments that could not be held in a stocks and shares ISA, provided that the investment met the pre-2001 PEP rules.

For some time there were Mini ISAs, Maxi ISAs and TESSA-only ISAs. A Mini ISA could hold cash OR stocks, potentially many if operated by a fund house or platform, while a Maxi ISA could hold cash AND stocks. Any UK resident individual aged 18 or over could invest in one &#x27;maxi&#x27; ISA per year, with both components provided by a single financial institution. Alternatively, a person could invest in two &#x27;mini&#x27; ISAs, one for each component. The two mini ISAs could be with two different providers if the investor wished.

The TESSA-only ISA was a type of cash ISA funded from a TESSA, another predecessor of the ISA. New TESSAs could not be created after 5 April 1999, so the required five-year term of all TESSAs ended by 5 April 2004. TOISAs were created to allow the original capital (excluding interest) invested in a TESSA (up to £9,000) to be reinvested in a tax-free form.

===CAT standards 1999-2005===
In April 1999, the Government introduced a voluntary &quot;CAT&quot; standard for ISAs (standing for &quot;Charges, Access, and Terms&quot;) to make them easier for inexperienced customers to understand and with the intention that lower costs would attract more investors. The standard does not guarantee the investment performance or that investors would buy or be sold the right type of investment.

Many equity funds also meet the CAT standards, but the restriction on costs generally means that these funds are index funds, which require little management and simply follow a given index, such as the FTSE 100 Index.

CAT standards were discontinued by the Treasury on 6 April 2005 following the introduction of the stakeholder product suite, although existing CAT standard ISAs continued on the same terms and conditions.

===2007/8/9 limit changes===
In the March 2007 Budget the limits for the 2008/9 tax year were increased. From tax year 2008/2009 the distinction between a Mini and Maxi ISA was abolished.

An insurance component was available in both Maxi and Mini ISAs until the 2005/06 tax year. Collective investment funds that once qualified for this component were reclassified as qualifying for either the Cash or Stocks &amp; Shares component.

===Past subscription limits===

In the March 2010 Budget the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that in future years the limits would rise annually with inflation, rounded to the nearest £120, to ease the arithmetic for those using monthly payment schemes. From 2013 to 2014 the inflation index used was changed from RPI to CPI.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced in the March 2014 Budget that the adult ISA limit would be increased to £15,000 from 1 July 2014, and the Junior ISA limit to £4,000. From that date savers were allowed to invest the full amount as cash or stocks and shares, or a mix of both. Savers are also able to switch stocks and shares ISAs to cash ISAs.

===Restrictions removed from July 2014===
Many restrictions were significantly relaxed from 1 July 2014 and the branding &quot;New ISA&quot; was introduced for this batch of changes:

* There was a ban on transferring from S&amp;S ISA to cash ISA. Cash to S&amp;S was allowed from 2008/2009. A JISA could always go in both directions.
* Interest on cash in a S&amp;S ISA is no longer subject to a 20% charge. All cash in a S&amp;S ISA is subject to the FCA client money rules and cash ISA providers can opt in if they wish.
* Cash can now be held in a S&amp;S ISA even when not intended for investment. There was no specific time limit on how long cash could be held under the old rules, just whether the ISA manager believed the money was being held for future investment.
* The S&amp;S ISA had a five years remaining at time of purchase restriction on public debt securities such as government, corporate bonds, debentures and Eurobonds. Conditional redemption, such as that based on possible future market performance, was acceptable, as was the borrowing company or government redeeming the security early or exercising of options if there are defaults, insolvency risks or covenant breaches.
* The S&amp;S ISA had a requirement for a credible possibility of losing at least 5% of the investment, called the 5% test. Investments that failed the test had to be held in a cash ISA instead:
** A cash ISA can still hold qualifying investments that failed the 5% test for holding within a stocks and shares ISA before 1 July 2014 when the test was removed but this facility was rarely, if ever, made available by a cash ISA provider. Such investments would not be deposits and would not have the deposit FSCS protection, they may have the £50,000 investment protection instead, the provider must make the situation clear.

==Types==
===Cash ISA===
An account which enjoys tax-free status, usually deposit accounts with £85,000 Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection (but client money with £50,000 protection or unprotected money is also permitted; the providers are required to make the protection clear). These are normally offered by banks and building societies but investment firms can also offer them. It is mandatory that money held in a cash ISA be made available on request within 15 days but it is permitted to have a loss-of-interest penalty for this, and this is how term deposits are typically made available.

====Help to buy ISA====
A help to buy ISA, introduced in 2015, is a form of cash ISA that receives a government bonus if the money is used in paying the deposit on a first home purchase. The usual rule that any number of accounts can be held with the same ISA manager applies, and many providers offered the ability to hold both HTB and other cash ISA accounts with current year money in them. However, only one HTB ISA in total can be held, so if one wishes to put current year money into the HTB ISA, any other cash ISA current year money will also have to be paid into a cash ISA with the same provider.

The Lifetime ISA, announced in March 2016, replaces the HTB ISA. HTB accounts could be opened until 30 November 2019 and contributions can continue until 30 November 2029. An account holder can also have a Lifetime ISA, although the government bonus from only one of the accounts per person can be used for a purchase. Transfers from HTB to Lifetime ISA were allowed from the 2017-18 tax year, with transitional arrangements for that year only.

Help to buy ISAs have been criticised:

* Some accounts were promoted with the implication that the bonus could be put towards the deposit on a house purchase, but the bonus is only available on completion of the sale, and thus normally has the effect of reducing the size of the buyer&#x27;s mortgage.
* It was reported that the scheme – which by mid-2017 had cost taxpayers some £10 billion – had done little to increase the supply of new-build homes, and instead housebuilders had increased prices and thus their profits.

===Stocks and shares ISA===
Investors&#x27; money is invested in &#x27;qualifying investments&#x27;, which are:
*cash
*UCITS authorised funds like unit trusts and open-ended investment companies
*investment trusts that satisfy various conditions
*company shares publicly listed on one of the many recognised stock exchanges. Merely being traded is insufficient, it must be a full listing, and this excludes PLUS-quoted and PLUS-traded market segments, but PLUS itself is acceptable; shares in unquoted companies; warrants; futures and options. Since 5 August 2013, AIM shares are allowed in ISAs.
*public debt securities such as government, corporate bonds, debentures and Eurobonds
*from 1 July 2014, some core capital deferred shares issued by building societies, some types of insurance policy and other investments that were previously deemed too low in risk.

It is mandatory that money held in a stocks and shares ISA be made available on request within 30 days but it is permitted to have a loss-of-interest penalty for this.

===Innovative finance ISA===
Innovative finance ISAs (IF ISAs or IFISAs) became available from 6 April 2016. They are similar to cash and S&amp;S ISAs but designed to be used for peer-to-peer lending investments, which were not previously eligible to be held in an ISA. Only platforms with full FCA authorisation (and ISA manager status) are eligible to offer IF ISAs; at launch this barred all major existing platforms because they were awaiting authorisation, leaving just eight at the time relatively minor platforms available and 86 awaiting approval. Equity-based crowdfunding, although similar to peer-to-peer lending, is not included in the eligible products for this type of ISA.

From 1 November 2016 many transferable debentures including debt securities and bonds became eligible for inclusion provided they are issued by a company or charity. They can be included whether offered via a P2P platform or not.

The same rules with respect to subscription limits and transfers are applicable to the IF ISA as other adult ISAs, including the restrictions of current year money going to only one ISA manager, and an unrestricted number of managers for past year money.

===Lifetime ISA===
In the 2016 Budget it was announced that a lifetime ISA (LISA) would be introduced from 6 April 2017 as a more flexible way to save for both home purchase and retirement. Only those aged 18 to 40 can open an account, and at the end of the tax year (or when used for purchase) a 25% bonus on contributions of up to £4,000 a year will be paid. The £4,000 is part of the overall ISA annual allowance, not in addition to it. On reaching age 50, no more money can be added to the account and eligibility for the 25% bonus ceases, but the account will still earn interest or investment returns. The accounts have the same inheritance tax treatment as other ISAs.

Permitted investments are as for cash or S&amp;S ISAs, and as for them any number of accounts is allowed, but only one account can hold current year money. After the account has been open for at least 12 months, the money can be used for a first home purchased with a mortgage and priced up to £450,000; the money is paid to the conveyancer and can be returned to the ISA if the sale does not complete. There are restrictions in place to avoid abuse of the scheme, for instance those who purchase a home with a LISA are barred from renting the property out.

Money can also be withdrawn after reaching age 60. A person who is diagnosed with a medical condition giving a life expectancy of under one year can withdraw the full amount including bonus without penalty at any age, using the definition in the similar pension law. Any other withdrawal, including transfers to another type of ISA, incurs a 25% charge. Although the bonus and penalty are both 25%, those who withdraw funds for purposes not listed above will suffer a loss, for example:

:£1,000 paid in + government bonus at 25% = £1,250 - penalty charge at 25% = £937.50 = net loss of £62.50

However, the government have created a precedent where this penalty charge may be reduced during periods of poor economic outlook and the LISA can effectively be used as a rainy day fund. Penalty charges were reduced from 25% to 20% on withdrawals between 6 March 2020 and 5 April 2021 during the recession arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction ensured that savers making withdrawals received the full amount they had deposited.

£1.5 billion was held in LISA savings in 2022, and the 2022 cost of living crisis fuelled in part by rising inflation led to calls to introduce a temporary penalty-free period to allow access to these savings.

===Junior ISAs===
Junior ISAs were introduced on 1 November 2011 with an initial subscription limit of £3,600, which was increased to £9,000 by the time of the 2020-21 tax year. At age 18 the JISA converts to an adult ISA. Like adult ISAs, JISAs are available in both cash and stocks and shares types. Money cannot be withdrawn until age 18 unless a terminal illness claim is agreed or following closure of the account after the death of the child. A child can open their own account from age 16, otherwise a person with parental responsibility can do it. They are available to those who are:

* under age 18 and
* were born on or after 3 Jan 2011 or do not have a child trust fund, and
* are resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, or are a UK Crown servant, married to or in a civil partnership with a Crown servant, or a dependent of a Crown servant.

Unlike an adult ISA a child can only hold a total of one cash ISA and one stocks and shares ISA, including for all money from past years, but transfers of these two accounts can be carried out between providers as for adult accounts. Up to the full JISA limit can be used for any combination of cash and stocks and shares ISA subscriptions. An additional adult cash ISA can be held between 16 and 18. In the year in which a child becomes 18 the full adult and child ISA limits can both be used. Unlike adult ISAs a JISA allows transfers from the S&amp;S form to the cash form.

Each child ISA has a single registered contact, a person with parental responsibility. From age 16 a child can register to be their own contact and this registration cannot normally be reversed. Except in that case and adoptive parents registering, the previous registered contact will be contacted to obtain their consent to a change of contact.

=== British ISA ===
A British ISA was announced by the government in its Spring Budget 2024 with an annual allowance of £5,000 to be used only towards investment in UK companies. It is expected that the £5,000 annual subscription will be in addition to the current £20,000 ISA allowance. The aim of the British ISA is to encourage investment in UK companies, so a number of bespoke rules may be created which will differentiate it from current ISAs, including on transfers and holding cash. 

The government launched a consultation on how a British ISA will work, lasting until June 2024. It is not expected to be available until 2025.

==Subscription limits==
There are restrictions on investing in ISAs in each tax year (6 April to the following 5 April) which affect the type of ISA that may be opened and the cumulative amount of investment during the course of that year. The key restrictions are:

*The limits are per ISA, not per account, so you can have many accounts with current year money at one manager, all within the same overall ISA. This is sometimes called a &quot;split ISA&quot;.
*No more than the annual amount limit can be paid in and the amount that can be in cash used to be restricted in an adult ISA. Any amount not used for cash can be used in other types of ISA.
*Newly subscribed (paid in) money in the current tax year can only be held in one Individual Savings Account of each type.
**For example, current year cash ISA subscription money can be held in a help to buy account, instant access accounts, fixed rate accounts, variable rate accounts and deposit accounts with the same cash ISA manager in the same overall ISA even though this is five or more accounts. None could be held in any accounts within another cash ISA elsewhere. The introduction of the help to buy cash ISA made this flexibility within one ISA more significant because it can&#x27;t use the full cash limit.
*Provided the annual contribution limits are not exceeded significantly HMRC can be expected to forgive one transgression using too many ISA managers/accounts and merely post a letter reminding about the rules after the annual returns from ISA providers reveal the problem. This should not be relied upon, as it is at HMRC&#x27;s discretion.

These restrictions only apply to money paid in during the current tax year. For adult ISAs an unlimited number of ISA managers&#x27; accounts can hold money from past years and it can be freely moved between managers using ISA transfer requests.

==Transfer rules==
Transfers between providers are allowed. A transfer from a Cash ISA to another Cash ISA must usually be completed within 15 business days. Any other type of account transfer must usually be completed within 30 days. There are a range of restrictions and workarounds:
* The transfer must be carried out by the managers. If a saver withdraws the money from the existing manager, the subsequent reinvestment will be treated as a new ISA subscription and is subject to the current year&#x27;s subscription limit. HMRC allows a single cash ISA self-transfer by withdrawing and redepositing per year. All current year money must be removed from the source account.
* When transferring it is still necessary to comply with the rule that you can have only one cash ISA manager and one S&amp;S ISA manager in use at the same time with money paid in from the current tax year. Transfer of cash ISA money paid in during the current year must be all of the money if it is to another cash ISA manager. If the transfer is from cash to another type the transfer can be partial but must be to either the first ISA of the year of that type or to the one already used for current year money. After the transfer to the other type the money counts against its limit, not the cash limit.
* Before transferring stocks from one ISA manager/platform/provider to another it is worth checking that the new provider will accept all the stocks held in your ISA. Providers have different criteria for deciding if a particular stock can or cannot qualify for ISA status within their platform and you may have little choice but to liquidate that stock or withdraw it from the ISA wrapper.
*For current year money you can transfer from a cash ISA to a S&amp;S ISA then withdraw the money from the S&amp;S ISA and redeposit some or all the money into another cash ISA, subject to the annual contribution limit. This allows you to circumvent &quot;new money only&quot; restrictions imposed by some cash ISAs that will not accept transfers in, provided you have sufficient annual allowance available.
*Older products:
** Whether the original contributions were made to a maxi ISA or a mini ISA has no effect on transfer.
** Cash within a TOISA (TESSA-only ISA) is treated as a cash component, and can be transferred to a &quot;normal&quot; cash ISA.

==Flexible ISA Features==
The Flexible ISA Features are optional add-on feature introduced from 6 April 2016 for any adult ISA type that allow withdrawing cash and redepositing it in the same tax year. Providers are not required to implement the flexibility features and do not have to implement them all if they allow some. A person can withdraw an unlimited amount of money from an account and return up to that amount within the same tax year without it counting against the annual subscription limit. A person with £100,000 of past year money could withdraw say £90,000 on 15 April and redeposit it as desired within the tax year. If a transfer is done the firm receiving the transfer is told only the amount of current year allowance available to be used, if any.

If current year money is withdrawn, that money can be used to subscribe to a different type of ISA in the current year without having to replace it into the flexible ISA it was withdrawn from. This is particularly useful if both current and past year money were withdrawn from the same account. Otherwise all past year money would have to be replaced before any current year money would count as being replaced, due to the rules that current year money is the first withdrawn and last replaced. Past year money does have to be replaced before being transferred in the usual ISA transfer way, it must not be directly placed into the new account or it would count as a new current year subscription instead of a replacement.

==Tax treatment==
Interest on cash held in an ISA, including stocks and shares ISAs, is not subject to income tax.

Dividends are not subject to additional tax, interest on bonds is not taxed, and capital gains are not taxed (nor may capital losses be used to offset other gains).

There is no need to report interest or other income, capital gains, or trades to HMRC as it is not taxable income. This is a considerable paperwork reduction for active traders or those who may otherwise be required to report their trades because they have total sales value exceeding four times the annual CGT allowance, which outside a tax wrapper would require that all trades be reported even if there is no capital gains tax to pay.

Since the income is not taxable it did not count for age-related personal income tax allowance reduction when that extra allowance existed.

=== Death of investor ===
Cash or investments held in ISAs are ordinarily subject to Inheritance Tax when the account holder dies, if their estate is valued above the IHT nil-rate band. Since August 2013 it became possible to hold AIM-listed shares in a stocks and shares ISA, some of which qualify for business relief; in this way a stocks and shares ISA portfolio consisting of these securities can be gifted without being subject to Inheritance Tax, provided the qualifying securities have been held for at least two years upon death.

For deaths of ISA investors on or after 3 December 2014, the surviving spouse or civil partner can apply for an increased ISA allowance in the form of an Additional Permitted Subscription. This allowance is separate from the normal annual allowance, and is based on the value of the deceased&#x27;s ISA; it is available whether or not the surviving spouse or civil partner inherited the ISA assets.

== Fund supermarkets and self-select ISA providers ==
There is no legal distinction between a fund supermarket and a self-select ISA provider. These are merely marketing terms used by stocks and shares ISA providers to distinguish the type of business that they tend to seek. Firms favouring collective investment business will often call themselves fund supermarkets, while firms who focus on share dealing will often call themselves self-select ISA providers. A firm can freely offer all types of permitted investment, regardless of its name, and many do. Others choose to offer only collective investment funds. An individual may not be the provider for their own ISA.

Except for fund houses, it is usual for providers to offer the facility to hold funds managed by many different organisations.

Prior to the effect of the Retail Distribution Review it was normal for S&amp;S providers to be paid by fund managers out of their usual charges, though some may have both explicit dealing charges and collect the commission while others may make charges and refund all commission. This is now prohibited for new customers who must be charged a fee instead. In the current transition period existing customers may be able to hold a mixture of commission paying investments and the &quot;clean&quot; versions that do not pay commission, perhaps paying a platform fee only for the clean portion. Some providers have chosen to be clean only. Some commission may be rebated to customers but this is not required.

== Charges ==
The ISA cash component normally has no disclosed charges. The company can make money from the differences between its deposit and lending rates, fees, differences between wholesale and retail deposit rates or other means. For example, Hargreaves Lansdown quoted a 0.8% profit margin on cash held in its Vantage platform in spring 2014. Some providers charge a fee for transferring to another provider.

The built-in annual &quot;re-registering&quot; of an ISA may attract a fee which may be automatically extracted from an account, though this is normally done only by firms specialising in share deals, not those using funds or both funds and shares.

Stocks and shares ISA fund supermarkets often reduce some or all of the initial and annual charges made by fund houses to below the level paid when purchasing direct from the fund provider, often to zero initial charge. Some providers levy dealing charges even for fund transactions, typically firms desiring direct share investments more than fund investments. Dealing charges for shares are normal even from providers that do not charge for fund transactions. Firms that primarily focus on fund transactions tend to have higher share dealing charges than providers specialising in share transactions.

<text>Sheba, or Saba, was an ancient South Arabian kingdom in modern-day Yemen whose inhabitants were known as the &quot;Sabaeans&quot; or the tribe of Sabaʾ which, for much of the 1st millennium BCE, were indissociable from the kingdom itself. Modern historians agree that the heartland of the Sabaean civilization was located in the region around Marib and Sirwah. In some periods, they expanded to much of what is now modern-day Yemen and even parts of the Horn of Africa, in modern-day Eritrea and Ethiopia. The spoken language of the Sabaeans was Sabaic, a variety of Old South Arabian.

The Sabaeans founded the Kingdom of Saba in the late second or first millennium BCE, considered by South Arabians and the first Abyssinian kingdoms to be the birthplace of South Arabian civilization, and whose name carried prestige. The first Sabaean kingdom lasted from the 8th to the 1st centuries BCE. This kingdom can be divided into the &quot;mukarrib&quot; period, where Saba reigned supreme over South Arabia, and the kingly period, a long period of decline to the neighbouring kingdoms of Ma&#x27;in, Hadhramaut, and Qataban, ultimately ending when a newer neighbour, Himyar, annexed them. Saba was originally confined to the region of Marib (its capital) and its surroundings. At its height, it encompassed much of southwest Arabia, before eventually declining to the regions of Marib. Saba re-emerged from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. In this time, a secondary capital was founded at Sanaa, which has become the capital of Yemen today. Around 275 CE, the Saba civilization permanently came to an end after another annexation by Himyar.

Saba existed alongside several neighboring kingdoms in ancient South Arabia. To their north was the Kingdom of Ma&#x27;in, and to their east was the Kingdom of Qataban and the Kingdom of Hadhramaut. The Sabaeans, like the other Yemenite kingdoms of their time, were involved in the extremely lucrative spice trade, especially including frankincense and myrrh. They left behind many inscriptions in the monumental Ancient South Arabian script as well as numerous documents in the related cursive Zabūr script. They also interacted with the societies in the Horn of Africa where they left numerous traces, including inscriptions and temples that date back to the Sabaean colonization of Africa.

This kingdom came to play an important role in the Hebrew Bible and appears in the Quran (not to be confused with the Quranic Sabians). The story of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba has raised questions of historicity, although recent research indicates that Saba was involved in the lucrative incense trade as early in its history as the time of Solomon. Traditions about Saba particularly feature in the tradition of Orthodox Tewahedo in today&#x27;s Yemen and is also asserted as the home of the Queen of Sheba, who is left unnamed in Jewish texts but is known as &quot;Makeda&quot; in Ethiopian texts and as &quot;Bilqīs&quot; in Arabic texts. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Sheba was the home of Princess Tharbis, who is said to have been the wife of Moses before he married Zipporah. Some Islamic exegetes identified Sheba with the People of Tubba.

== Sources ==

The Sabaic language was written down in a corresponding Sabaic script, with the earliest evidence of this dating to the 11th to 10th centuries BCE. The Sabaic tradition has left behind a sizable epigraphic record. Of the 12,000 corresponding Ancient South Arabian inscriptions, 6,500 of them are in Sabaic. The region first sees a continuous record of epigraphic documentation in the 8th century BCE, which lasts until the 9th century CE, long after the fall of the Sabaean kingdom and covering a time range of about a millennium and a half and constituting the main source of information about the Sabaeans. South Arabian civilization may be the only civilization that can be reconstructed from epigraphic evidence.

External information about the Sabaeans comes first from Akkadian cuneiform texts starting in the 8th century BCE. Less important are brief reports from the Bible about correspondence between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. While the story is of debatable historicity, knowledge of the Sabaeans as merchant peoples indicates that some level of trade between the regions was underway in this time. After the campaigns of Alexander the Great, South Arabia became a hub of trade routes linking the broader geopolitical realm with India. As such, information about the region begins to appear among Greco-Roman observers and information becomes more concrete. The most important accounts about South Arabia are from Eratosthenes, Strabo, Theophrastus, Pliny the Elder, an anonymous first-century seafarming manual called the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; concerning the politics and topography of South Arabian coasts, the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; by Philostorgius, and Procopius.

== History ==
=== Formative period ===
The formative phase of the Sabaeans, or the period prior to the emergence of urban cultures in South Arabia, can be placed the latter part of the 2nd millennium BCE, and was completed by the 10th century BCE, where a fully developed script appears in combination with the technological prowess to construct complex architectural complexes and cities. There is some debate as to the degree to which the movement out of the formative phase was channeled by endogenous processes, or the transfer or technologies from other centers, perhaps via trade and immigration.

Originally, the Sabaeans were part of &quot;communities&quot; (called &quot;shaʿbs&quot;) on the edge of the Sayhad desert. Very early, at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, the political leaders of this tribal community managed to create a huge commonwealth of shaʿbs occupying most of South Arabian territory and took on the title &quot;Mukarrib of the Sabaeans&quot;.

=== Emergence ===
The origin of the Sabaean Kingdom is uncertain and is a point of disagreement among scholars, with estimates placing it around 1200 BCE, by the 10th century BCE at the latest, or a period of flourishing that only begins from the 8th century BCE onwards. Once the polity had been established, Sabaean kings referred to themselves by the title Mukarrib.

=== First Sabaean kingdom (8th — 1st centuries BCE) ===

==== Era of the &quot;mukarribs&quot; ====
The first major phase of the Sabaean civilization lasted between the 8th and 1st centuries BCE. For centuries, Saba dominated the political landscape in South Arabia. The 8th century is when the first stone inscriptions appear, and when leaders are already being called by the title Mukarrib (&quot;federator&quot;). Due to this convention, this era can also be called the &quot;Mukarrib period&quot;. The title &quot;mukarrib&quot; was more prestigious than that of &quot;mlk&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) and was used to refer to someone that extended hegemony over other tribes and kingdoms. 

Saba reached the height of its powers between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. In particular, the great conquests of Karib&#x27;il Watar extended their territory to Najran in the north, the Gulf of Aden in the southwest, and eastward from that point along the coast until the western foothills of the Hadhramaut plateau. Saba reigned supreme over South Arabia, and Karib&#x27;il established diplomatic contacts with the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib. This territorial range by a South Arabian kingdom would not be seen again until Himyar achieved it over 1,100 years later. Karib&#x27;il&#x27;s success is reflected by the dynastic succession of four rulers from his lineage, including sons, grandson, and great-grandons, a rare occurrence in the face of the rarity of dynastic succession in ancient South Arabian culture. The next time this would be seen was six centuries later in Qataban.

==== Era of the kings ====
After the 6th century BCE, Saba was unable to maintain its supremacy over South Arabia in the face of the expanding adjacent powers of Qataban and Hadhramaut militarily, and Ma&#x27;in economically, leading it contract back to its core territory around Marib and Sirwah. Sabaean leaders reverted to use of the title &quot;malik&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) instead of &quot;mukarrib&quot;. This decline began soon after the end of the reign of Karib&#x27;il Watar. While Karib&#x27;il established hegemony over the Jawf, his immediate successors only consolidated their power over some of its former city-states (including Nashq and Manhayat) whereas others (like Yathill and the towns of Wadhi Raghwan) were absorbed into Ma&#x27;in. Qataban expanded into the Southern Highlands, formerly under Sabaean rule.

Economically, the first Sabaean period was dominated by a caravan economy that had market ties with the rest of the Near East. Its first major trading partners were at Khindanu and the Middle Euphrates. Later, this moved to Gaza during the Persian period, and finally, to Petra in Hellenistic times. The South Arabian deserts gave rise to important aromatics which were exported in trade, especially frankincense and myrrh. It also acted as an intermediary for overland trade with neighbours in Africa and further off from India.

By the end of the 1st millennium BCE, several factors came together and brought about the decline of the Sabaean state and civilization. The biggest challenge came from the expansion of the Roman Republic. The Republic conquered Syria in 63 BCE and Egypt in 30 BCE, diverting Saba&#x27;s overland trade network. The Romans then attempted to conquer Saba around 26/25 BCE with an army sent out under the command of the governor Aelius Gallus, setting Marib to siege. Due to heat exhaustion, the siege had to be quickly given up. However, after conquering Egypt, the overland trade network was redirected to maritime routes, with an intermediary port chosen with Bir Ali (then called Qani). This port was part of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut, far from Sabaean territory. Greatly economically weakened, the Kingdom of Saba was soon annexed by the Himyarite Kingdom, bringing this period to a close.

=== Second Sabaean kingdom (1st – 3rd centuries CE) ===

After the disintegration of the first Himyarite Kingdom, Sabaean Kingdom reappeared and began to vigorously campaign against the Himyarites, and it flourished for another century and a half. This resurgent kingdom was different from the earlier one in many important respects. The most significant change with the earlier Sabaean period is that local power dynamics had shifted from the oasis cities on the desert margin, like Marib, to the highland tribes. The Almaqah temple at Marib returned to being a religious center. Saba inaugurated a new coinage and the remarkable Ghumdan Palace was built at Sanaa which, in this period, had its status elevated to that of a secondary capital next to Marib.

Despite liberating itself from Himyar by around 100 CE, leaders of Himyar continued calling themselves the &quot;king of Saba&quot;, as they had been doing during the period in which they ruled the region, to assert their legitimacy over the territory. The Kingdom fell after a long but sporadic civil war between several Yemenite dynasties claiming kingship, and the late Himyarite Kingdom rose as victorious. Sabaean kingdom was finally permanently conquered by the Ḥimyarites around 275 CE. Saba lost its royal status and reverted to a normal tribe, limited to the citizens of Marib, who are named in the last time in South Arabian sources in CIH 541 in requesting assistance from the king in repairing a rupture in the Marib Dam.

== Conquests ==
=== Conquests of Karib&#x27;il Watar ===
The major conquests in Saba were driven by the exploits of Karib&#x27;il Watar. Karib&#x27;il conquered all surrounding neighbours, including the Awsan, Qataban, and Hadhramaut. Karib&#x27;il&#x27;s exploits largely unified Yemen.The conquests of Karib&#x27;il are documented in two lengthy inscriptions (RES 3945–3946) discovered at the Temple of Almaqah at Sirwah. These inscriptions describe a series of eight campaigns to show how Karib&#x27;il ultimately brought South Arabia under the control of Saba. The first campaign took place in the highlands west of Marib, where Karib&#x27;il declares that he had captured 8,000 and killed 3,000 enemies. The second campaign concerned the Kingdom of Awsan, which flourished in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Up until the reign of Karib&#x27;il, it was a significant regional competitor with the Kingdom of Saba. However, Karib&#x27;il&#x27;s campaign brought about the obliteration of the Kingdom of Awsan. The tribal elite leading Awsan were slaughtered, and the palace of Murattaʿ was destroyed, as well as their temples and inscriptions. The wadi was depopulated, which is reflected in the abandonment of the wadi. Sabaean inscriptions claim that 16,000 were killed and 40,000 prisoners were taken. This may not have been a significant exaggeration, as the Awsan kingdom disappeared as a political entity from the historical record for five or six centuries. The third and fourth campaigns involve attacks against tribes living in low-lying hills that geographically face the Gulf of Aden. The fifth and sixth campaigns were against Nashshan. Nashshan was, like Awsan, one of Saba&#x27;s most powerful competitors. However, against Karib&#x27;il, combined with the destruction of several towns and buildings and the imposition of a tribute on its people. Any dissidents were killed and the cult of Almaqah was imposed onto Nashshan, with Nashshan&#x27;s leaders being required to build a temple for him. The final two campaigns were against the Tihamah coastal region and the Najran region.

=== African conquests ===
Around 800 BCE, the Sabaeans conquered parts of Eritrea and the Tigray Region of Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa, triggering a Sabaean colonization event that created the Eri-Ethio-Sabaean Kingdom of Di&#x27;amat. Sabaean populations migrated to maintain the new polity, and link it with the mother country, including through managing trade between the two (ivory might have especially been a driver of the expansion). The capital of the new kingdom was Yeha, where a great temple was built for Almaqah, the national god of Saba. Four other Almaqah temples are also known from Di&#x27;amat (including the Temple of Meqaber Gaʿewa), and other inscriptions mention the complete remainder of the known Sabaean deities. The great Yeha temple was modelled by Sabaean masons off of the Almaqah Temple at Sirwah (a major urban center of Saba). Besides religion, Sabaean culture also diffused into Di&#x27;amat through the use of objects, architectural techniques, artistic styles, institutions, paleographical styles for writings inscriptions, and the use of abstract symbols. Leaders in Di&#x27;amat used the classical South Arabian title, the &quot;mukarrib&quot;, and one particular title that is seen is the &quot;Mukarrib of Diʿamat and Saba&quot; (&quot;mkrb Dʿmt s-S1bʾ&quot;). The exact timing of the collapse of Di&#x27;amat is not known: it happened around the mid-1st millennium BCE and involved a destruction of Yeha along with a number of adjacent sites. This also happened when Saba was beginning to lose its grip on power over South Arabia. Nevertheless, Sabaeans continued migrating to Ethiopia after this collapse and Ethiopia only established a position of power for itself when the Kingdom of Aksum arose in the 1st century CE.

Military warfare continued between Saba, Ethiopia, and Himyar during the second Sabaean period, with a dynamic and shifting array of alliances. Recently discovered evidence shows that these encounters took place, not only on the peninsula, but also on Ethiopian territory during expeditions launched by the Sabaeans.

== Urban centers ==

=== Marib ===

In the Kingdom of Saba, Marib was an oasis and one of the main urban centers of the kingdom. It was by far the largest ancient city from ancient South Arabia, if not its only real city. Marib was located at the precise point that the wadi (of Wadi Dhana) emerges from the Yemeni highlands. It was located along what was called the Sayhad desert by medieval Arab geographers, but is now known as Ramlat al-Sab&#x27;atayn. The city lies 135 km east of Sanaa, which is the capital of Yemen today, found in the Wadi Dana delta, in the northwestern central Yemeni highlands. The oasis is about 10,000 hectares and the course of the wadi divides it into two: a northern and a southern half, which was already spoken of in records from the 8th century BCE, and this prominent feature may have been remembered as late as in the time of the Quran (34:15). A wall was built around Marib, and 4 km of that wall is still standing today. The wall, in some places, can be as much as 14 m thick. The wall encloses a 100-hectare area shaped like a trapezoid, and the settlement appears to have been created in the late second millennium BCE. Archaeological inquiries have uncovered a settlement plan that allocated different areas for different tasks. There is one residential division to the city. Another division containing sacred buildings but no residential development was probably a storage area for trade caravans and the shipment of goods. Immediately to the west was the great city temple Harun, dedicated to the national Sabaean god, Almaqah.
A processional road, known from inscriptions but not yet discovered, led from the Harun temple to the Temple of Awwam, 3.5 km to the southeast of Marib, which is both the main temple for the god Almaqah in the Kingdom of Saba and the largest temple complex known from South Arabia. Hundreds of inscriptions are known from the Awwam Temple, and these documents form the basis from which the political history of South Arabia thus far reconstructable from in the first few centuries of the Christian era. The enclosure was built in the 7th century BCE according to a monumental inscription from the time of Yada&#x27;il Darih. South of the temple wall is a 1.5-hectare necropolis, in which it is estimated that about 20,000 people have been buried over a time period covering about a millennium.

Shortly west of the Awwam Temple is another major temple in the southern oasis dedicated to Almaqah, which has been fully excavated and is the best studied temple to date from South Arabia: the Barran Temple. It is evident that predecessors to the Barran Temple went back to the 10th century BCE. The construction history is properly documented by inscriptions in the area. The temple was destroyed shortly before the beginning of the Christian eraddea. The exact cause is unknown, but it may have been linked to an (ultimately unsuccessful) siege of South Arabia by the Romans, under the leadership of the governor Aelius Gallus in 25/24 BCE. Inscriptions attest other temples dedicated to other gods but these have not yet been discovered archaeologically.
The Marib Dam was one of the most well-known architectural complexes from Yemen, and was even mentioned in the Quran (34:16), and this construction made it possible to irrigate the 10,000 hectares of the Marib oasis. The dam is located 10 km west of the main settlement. The dam successfully delegates and distributes water from the biannual monsoon rains into two main channels, which move away from the wadi and into fields through a highly dispersive system. This allowed the region to convert alluvial loads into fertile soils and so cultivate various crops. It took until the 6th century BCE for the full closure to be accomplished. The system required constant maintenance, and two major dam failures are reported from 454/455 and 547 CE. However, as political authority weakened over the course of the 6th century CE, maintenance efforts could not be sustained. The dam was therefore breached and the oasis was temporarily abandoned by the early seventh century.

=== Sirwah ===
The second Sabaean urban center was Sirwah. The two cities are connected by an ancient road. A wall had been built around Sirwah by the 10th century BCE. Much smaller than Marib, the city of Sirwah is 3.8 hectares in size, but it is archaeologically well-understood. The main buildings at the site are administrative and sacred buildings. Some buildings demonstrate that Sirwah acted as a transshipment point for trade goods. Legal documents show that Sirwah engaged in trade with Qataban to the southeast and the highlands around Sanaa to the west. Despite the urban area being limited, a significant portion of the space was allocated to sacred buildings. This has led some people to think that Sirwah acted as a religious center. The Great Temple of Almaqah is the most notable one, besides which, four other sacred buildings are known. One of these buildings was probably devoted to the female deity Atarsamain. Yada&#x27;il Darih, already a temple builder at the Awwam Temple in Marib, also fundamentally remodelled the Alwaqah Temple in the mid-7th century BCE. Inside the temple, in the area that is most cultically important, stands two parallel monumental inscriptions recording the lifetime achievements of two rulers: Yatha&#x27; Amar Watar and Karib&#x27;il Watar, who reigned in the late 8th and early 7th centuries BCE. The description in these records begins with comments on sacrifices made to the Sabaean deities, and then mostly delve into military campaigns in meticulous detail. At the end, the inscriptions record purchases of cities, landscapes, and fields.

=== The gods ===

Limitations in the available evidence prevent a full reconstruction of the full religious world in Ancient South Arabian kingdoms. While many of the known inscriptions speak about gods, most only hand down the name of the divinity without describing its nature, function, or cult. It is not known, for example, if these kingdoms had a god of war or a god of the underworld. Familial relationships between the gods are frequently mentioned, however.

Almaqah was the national god of Saba, whose worship was centered at the Temple of Awwam until the 4th century CE. Military victory helped spread this cult, such as when a temple to Almaqah was built in Nashshan after being conquered by Saba. The mention of Almaqah in the Jawf also indicates the political role played by Saba in that valley. The nature of the god is not entirely clear, but Almaqah has been hypothesized to be a moon god by some researchers.

Asides Almaqah, four other deities were also worshipped: Athtar, Haubas, Dhat-Himyam, and Dhat-Badan. Athtar was not limited to Saba, but was instead the common god of the South Arabian pantheon during its polytheistic era. Generally however, South Arabian deities are region-specific and lack parallel elsewhere in the Near East.

Anthropomorphic representations of the gods are lacking entirely from the Old Sabaean period, and only begin to appear with the onset of Hellenistic and Roman influences at the turn of the Christian era.

=== The king ===
Ancient South Arabian kings built great public works, had special ties with the gods legitimated through rites only they could perform, and led their armies during battle. They are represented as brave warriors, pious worshippers, and active builders. The fathers of the king is rarely attested independently. The function of the king was distinct from the role of the &quot;sheikh&quot;. The &quot;Geographica&quot; by Strabo claims that in the region, the succession of kings was not familial, a claim that is partly confirmed by inscriptions. South Arabian kings did not appeal to their genealogy or the accomplishments of their fathers to legitimate their own rule. Only late in Sabaean history, from the second half of the 2nd century CE, did a real dynastic succession from father to son appear, and it only lasted for two generations.

The Sabaean king was called the &quot;mukarrib&quot; (&quot;federator&quot;) more often than the &quot;malik&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, to indicate their hegemony over their neighbours. When Saba declined after the 6th centuries BCE and Sabaean territory contracted to what it was prior to the conquests of Karib&#x27;il Watar, the title &quot;mukarrib&quot; is replaced by that of &quot;malik&quot;.

In the early centuries of Saba, the title of the king was a combination of a name and an epithet. All titles were chosen from a combination of six possible names (Dhamar&#x27;ali, Karib&#x27;il, Sumhu&#x27;alay, Yada&quot;il, Yakrubmalik and Yitha&#x27;amar) and four possible epithets (Bayan, Dharih, Watar and Yanu). The repetitiveness of names has caused difficulties for historians trying to determine the relative succession of kings (even when they are attested) and raises questions about what the personal names were of each king. A similar practice took place in the neighbouring Kingdom of Hadhramaut. In the centuries leading up to the Christian era, this changed, kings began identifying with their real name, and reconstructions of Sabaean chronology become simpler.

Accession to the Sabaean throne required the consent of &quot;the Sabaeans, the &quot;qayls&quot; and the army&quot; in one inscription. The legislative body extended beyond the king, including other functionaries. The Sabaean monarchs did not implement taxes but derived their wealth from royal lands, war boody, and rent from clients. Military service could be compelled and financial requests could be made for the purpose of funding construction work. Any tithes on temple lands went to the temples themselves, not the monarch.

The king of Saba was not deified. The only known case of deification from ancient South Arabian cultures is from the Kingdom of Awsan during its resurgent phase.

=== The tribe ===
In the South Arabian tribal system, a fictitious shared ancestor was created and members of the tribe are referred to as the sons of the national god (in the case of Saba, they are &quot;sons of Almaqah&quot;). Allied states and tribes are called &quot;brothers&quot;. Tribes were divided into lineages and sub-lineages, reflected by the names of members. The individual proper name appears along with the patronymic, the lineage name, and the name of the tribe, with the exception of funerary inscriptions, where the individual name is attested alone. In areas closer to the desert, the family name was more privileged and commonly mentioned, with the tribal name becoming less mentioned. Personal identity only went back to the name of the father, unlike in North Arabia in the same time period or the later Islamic period where a long sequence of ancestors is used to identify a figure. Identity was also in reference to the kingdom that one belonged to (Sabaeans, Qatabanians), not to a broader geographical construct (like &quot;South Arabian&quot;).

==Culture==

=== Language ===
Sabaic was the spoken language of the Kingdom of Saba. Geographically, Sabaic was spoken in Saba, just as Qatabanic was spoken in Qataban and Hadraumitic was spoken in Hadhramaut. The only exception to this is Minaic, which is attested well-beyond the geographical territory of its corresponding kingdom, Ma&#x27;in. These four languages share and are distinguished by a number of linguistic features. The documentation for Sabaic is the best of any language of Ancient South Arabian, attested in all phases of the history of Saba.

=== Writing schools ===
The South Arabian kingdoms had writing schools with a common cultural background, although each school also had distinct practices.

== Legacy ==

=== Bible ===
Saba appears in the Hebrew Bible, also the first place that the Sabaeans are mentioned by an external source. Most famously, Saba is presented as, through its female monarch the Queen of Sheba, engaging in trade with Solomon in goods of aromatics and gold. Historians have subjected this story to questions concerning its historicity. The Hebrew Bible links the Sabaean caravan trading network with other cities including Dedan, Tayma, and Ra&#x27;mah.

=== Islamic tradition ===

The story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon story is discussed in Quran 27:15–44.

The name of Saba&#x27; is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an in Surah 5:69, Surah 27:15-44 and Surah 34:15-17. Surah 34 is named &quot;Sabaʾ&quot;. Their mention in Surah 5 refers to the area in the context of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas their mention in Surah 34 refers to the Flood of the Dam, in which the dam was ruined by flooding. There is also an epithet, &quot;Qawm Tubbaʿ&quot; or &quot;People of Tubbaʿ&quot; (Surah 44:37, Surah 50:12-14) that some exegetes have identified as a reference to the kings of Saba&#x27;.

Muslim commentators such as al-Tabari, al-Zamakhshari, al-Baydawi supplement the story at various points. The Queen&#x27;s name is given as &quot;Bilqis&quot;, probably derived from Greek παλλακίς or the Hebraised &quot;pilegesh&quot;, &quot;concubine&quot;. According to some he then married the Queen, while other traditions assert that he gave her in marriage to a tubba of Hamdan. According to the Islamic tradition as represented by al-Hamdani, the queen of Sheba was the daughter of Ilsharah Yahdib, the Himyarite king of Najran.

Although the Quran and its commentators have preserved the earliest literary reflection of the complete Bilqis legend, there is little doubt among scholars that the narrative is derived from a Jewish Midrash.

Bible stories of the Queen of Sheba and the ships of Ophir served as a basis for legends about the Israelites traveling in the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s entourage when she returned to her country to bring up her child by Solomon. There is a Muslim tradition that the first Jews arrived in Yemen at the time of King Solomon, following the politico-economic alliance between him and the Queen of Sheba.
The Ottoman scholar Mahmud al-Alusi compared the religious practices of South Arabia to Islam in his &quot;Bulugh al-&#x27;Arab fi Ahwal al-&#x27;Arab&quot;.

According to the medieval religious scholar al-Shahrastani, Sabaeans accepted both the sensible and intelligible world. They did not follow religious laws but centered their worship on spiritual entities.

=== Ethiopian and Yemenite tradition ===

In the medieval Ethiopian cultural work called the Kebra Nagast, Sheba was located in Ethiopia. Some scholars therefore point to a region in the northern Tigray and Eritrea which was once called Saba (later called Meroe), as a possible link with the biblical Sheba. Donald N. Levine links Sheba with Shewa (the province where modern Addis Ababa is located) in Ethiopia.

Traditional Yemenite genealogies also mention Saba, son of Qahtan; Early Islamic historians identified Qahtan with the Yoqtan (Joktan) son of Eber (Hūd) in the Hebrew Bible (Gen. 10:25-29). James A. Montgomery finds it difficult to believe that Qahtan was the biblical Joktan based on etymology.

<doc id="69272" wikidata="Q1516550" url="?curid=69272" title="Shamgar">
<text>Shamgar, son of Anath ( &quot;Šamgar&quot;), is the name of one or possibly two individuals named in the Book of Judges. The name occurs twice:
#at the first mention, Shamgar is identified as a man who repelled Philistine incursions into Israelite regions, and slaughtered 600 of the invaders with an ox goad (Judges 3:31);
#the other mention is within the Song of Deborah, where Shamgar is described as having been one of the prior rulers, in whose days roads were abandoned, with travelers taking winding paths, and village life collapsing (Judges 5:6).

Unlike the descriptions of Biblical Judges, the first reference to Shamgar has no introduction, conclusion, or reference to the length of reign, and it is not said that he judged Israel. The subsequent text follows on directly from the previous narrative. In several ancient manuscripts this reference to Shamgar occurs after the accounts of Samson rather than immediately after the account of Ehud, in a way that is more narratively consistent; some scholars believe that this latter position is more likely to be the passage&#x27;s original location.

The act of this Shamgar is similar to that of &quot;Shammah, son of Agee&quot;, mentioned in the &quot;appendix&quot; of the Books of Samuel as being one of &quot;The Three&quot;, a distinct group of warriors associated with King David. Scholars are not certain as to whether the same individual was originally meant, and that the passage in the book of Judges was later moved to its present location, or whether each of the two figures were different heroes. Scholars also believe that the name of the individual may originally have been &quot;Shammah&quot;, and became corrupted under the influence of the &quot;Shamgar&quot; in the Song of Deborah. The term usually translated as &quot;oxgoad&quot; is a biblical hapax legomenon, the translation into English being made on the basis of the Septuagint&#x27;s translation into Greek.

The other mention of Shamgar, that in the Song of Deborah, connects Shamgar with a low period of Israelite society.

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; suspects him of having been a foreign oppressor of the Israelites, rather than an Israelite ruler. From the form of the name, it is suspected that Shamgar may actually have been a Hittite, a similar name occurring with Sangara, a Hittite king of Carchemish; more recent scholars hold that the name is of Hurrian origin and may well be &quot;Šimig-ari&quot;.

The Bible also indicates that he was the &quot;son&quot; of &quot;Anath&quot; (the name of a Canaanite deity). In recent years, arrowheads bearing the names &quot;ben-anat&quot; and Aramaic &quot;bar anat&quot;, dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC, have been discovered. This has led several recent scholars to theorize that the expression &quot;son of Anath&quot; probably designates a warrior title.

<doc id="69273" wikidata="Q548285" url="?curid=69273" title="Philip I, Count of Savoy">
<text>Philip I (1207 – 16 August 1285) was Count of Savoy from 1268 to 1285. Before this, he was Bishop of Valence (1241–1267) and Archbishop of Lyon (1245–1267).

==Ecclesiastical career==
Philip was born in Aiguebelle, Savoy, as the eighth and last son of Count Thomas I of Savoy and Margaret of Geneva. His family prepared him for a clerical career. In 1236, his brother William was able to use his influence with Henry III of England to get Philip positions in the churches of Hillingdon, Oxney, and Geddington. In 1240, he was elected Bishop of Lausanne with the support of his brother Peter, but had to resign. Instead, he became Bishop of Valence in 1241. His brother Thomas had Philip installed as chancellor of Flanders and prévôt of St-Donatien-de-Bruges.

In 1243, while Henry was fighting in Gascony, Philip escorted his sister Beatrice of Savoy and niece Sanchia of Provence to visit Eleanor, Henry, and their new baby Beatrice. This so cheered the besieged king that he lavished further gifts on the bishop.

In 1244, Pope Innocent IV fled from Rome, and Philip convinced his brother, Count Amadeus IV of Savoy, to let the pope pass through Savoy. Philip escorted the Pope to Lyon, and then remained with him to ensure his safety. Pope Innocent ensured Philip&#x27;s election as Archbishop of Lyon in 1245.

While there, Philip continued his family&#x27;s policies of governing through trade. In 1248 he negotiated with Aymar III of Valentinois to reduce the taxes that traders would pay on foods travelling through his lands, and over the next few years, he granted charters to towns throughout the area.

==Reign==

When, against expectations, Philip became the next heir for the County of Savoy, he gave his church offices up and married Countess Adelaide of Burgundy, on 12 June 1267. He became Count of Savoy in 1268, and in 1272 he also acquired the County of Bresse. While he was at first successful in extending the power of Savoy, in 1282 he was opposed by a coalition of King Rudolph I, Charles of Anjou (who was also count of Provence), the dauphin of Viennois, and the counts of Geneva.

His will appointed his niece Queen Eleanor of Provence and her son King Edward I of England as adjudicators of his estate; they appointed his nephew, Amadeus, as his successor. Philip died childless in Roussillon in 1285.

<doc id="69274" wikidata="Q6921783" url="?curid=69274" title="Animal echolocation">
<text>Echolocation, also called bio sonar, is a biological active sonar used by several animal groups, both in the air and underwater. Echolocating animals emit calls and listen to the echoes of those calls that return from various objects near them. They use these echoes to locate and identify the objects. Echolocation is used for navigation, foraging, and hunting prey.

Echolocation calls can be frequency modulated (FM, varying in pitch during the call) or constant frequency (CF). FM offers precise range discrimination to localize the prey, at the cost of reduced operational range. CF allows both the prey&#x27;s velocity and its movements to be detected by means of the Doppler effect. FM may be best for close, cluttered environments, while CF may be better in open environments or for hunting while perched.

Echolocating animals include mammals, especially odontocetes (toothed whales) and some bat species, and, using simpler forms, species in other groups such as shrews. A few bird species in two cave-dwelling bird groups echolocate, namely cave swiftlets and the oilbird. 

Some prey animals that are hunted by echolocating bats take active countermeasures to avoid capture. These include predator avoidance, attack deflection, and the use of ultrasonic clicks, which have evolved multiple functions including aposematism, mimicry of chemically defended species, and echolocation jamming.

== Early research ==

The term &quot;echolocation&quot; was coined by 1944 by the American zoologist Donald Griffin, who, with Robert Galambos, first demonstrated the phenomenon in bats. As Griffin described in his book, the 18th century Italian scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani had, by means of a series of elaborate experiments, concluded that when bats fly at night, they rely on some sense besides vision, but he did not discover that the other sense was hearing. The Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine repeated Spallanzani&#x27;s experiments (using different species of bat), and concluded that when bats hunt at night, they rely on hearing. In 1908, Walter Louis Hahn confirmed Spallanzani&#x27;s and Jurine&#x27;s findings.

In 1912, the inventor Hiram Maxim independently proposed that bats used sound below the human auditory range to avoid obstacles. In 1920, the English physiologist Hamilton Hartridge correctly proposed instead that bats used frequencies above the range of human hearing.

Echolocation in odontocetes (toothed whales) was not properly described until two decades after Griffin and Galambos&#x27; work, by Schevill and McBride in 1956. However, in 1953, Jacques Yves Cousteau suggested in his first book, &quot;The Silent World&quot;, that porpoises had something like sonar, judging by their navigational abilities.

== Principles ==

Echolocation is active sonar, using sounds made by the animal itself. Ranging is achieved by measuring the time delay between the animal&#x27;s own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment. The relative intensity of sound received at each ear, as well as the time delay between arrival at the two ears, provide information about the horizontal angle (azimuth) from which the reflected sound waves arrive.

Unlike some human-made sonars that rely on many extremely narrow beams and many receivers to localize a target (multibeam sonar), animal echolocation has only one transmitter and two receivers (the ears) positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the ears arrive at different times and at different intensities, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to perceive distance and direction. With echolocation, the bat or other animal can tell, not only where it is going, but also how big another animal is, what kind of animal it is, and other features.

=== Acoustic features ===

Describing the diversity of echolocation calls requires examination of the frequency and temporal features of the calls. It is the variations in these aspects that produce echolocation calls suited for different acoustic environments and hunting behaviors. The calls of bats have been most intensively researched, but the principles apply to all echolocation calls.

Bat call frequencies range from as low as 11 kHz to as high as 212 kHz. Insectivorous aerial-hawking bats, those that chase prey in the open air, have a call frequency between 20 kHz and 60 kHz, because it is the frequency that gives the best range and image acuity and makes them less conspicuous to insects. However, low frequencies are adaptive for some species with different prey and environments. &quot;Euderma maculatum&quot;, a bat species that feeds on moths, uses a particularly low frequency of 12.7 kHz that cannot be heard by moths.

Echolocation calls can be composed of two different types of frequency structure: frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and constant frequency (CF) tones. A particular call can consist of one, the other, or both structures. An FM sweep is a broadband signal – that is, it contains a downward sweep through a range of frequencies. A CF tone is a narrowband signal: the sound stays constant at one frequency throughout its duration.

Echolocation calls in bats have been measured at intensities anywhere between 60 and 140 decibels. Certain bat species can modify their call intensity mid-call, lowering the intensity as they approach objects that reflect sound strongly. This prevents the returning echo from deafening the bat. High-intensity calls such as those from aerial-hawking bats (133 dB) are adaptive to hunting in open skies. Their high intensity calls are necessary to even have moderate detection of surroundings because air has a high absorption of ultrasound and because insects&#x27; size only provide a small target for sound reflection. Additionally, the so-called &quot;whispering bats&quot; have adapted low-amplitude echolocation so that their prey, moths, which are able to hear echolocation calls, are less able to detect and avoid an oncoming bat.

A single echolocation call (a call being a single continuous trace on a sound spectrogram, and a series of calls comprising a sequence or pass) can last anywhere from less than 3 to over 50 milliseconds in duration. Pulse duration is around 3 milliseconds in FM bats such as Phyllostomidae and some Vespertilionidae; between 7 and 16 milliseconds in Quasi-constant-frequency (QCF) bats such as other Vespertilionidae, Emballonuridae, and Molossidae; and between 11 milliseconds (Hipposideridae) and 52 milliseconds (Rhinolophidae) in CF bats.
Duration depends also on the stage of prey-catching behavior that the bat is engaged in, usually decreasing when the bat is in the final stages of prey capture – this enables the bat to call more rapidly without overlap of call and echo. Reducing duration comes at the cost of having less total sound available for reflecting off objects and being heard by the bat.

The time interval between subsequent echolocation calls (or pulses) determines two aspects of a bat&#x27;s perception. First, it establishes how quickly the bat&#x27;s auditory scene information is updated. For example, bats increase the repetition rate of their calls (that is, decrease the pulse interval) as they home in on a target. This allows the bat to get new information regarding the target&#x27;s location at a faster rate when it needs it most. Secondly, the pulse interval determines the maximum range that bats can detect objects. This is because bats can only keep track of the echoes from one call at a time; as soon as they make another call they stop listening for echoes from the previously made call. For example, a pulse interval of 100 ms (typical of a bat searching for insects) allows sound to travel in air roughly 34 meters so a bat can only detect objects as far away as 17 meters (the sound has to travel out and back). With a pulse interval of 5 ms (typical of a bat in the final moments of a capture attempt), the bat can only detect objects up to 85 cm away. Therefore, the bat constantly has to make a choice between getting new information updated quickly and detecting objects far away.

=== Tradeoff between FM and CF ===

==== FM signal advantages ====

The major advantage conferred by an FM signal is extremely precise range discrimination, or localization, of the target. J. A. Simmons demonstrated this effect with a series of experiments that showed how bats using FM signals could distinguish between two separate targets even when the targets were less than half a millimeter apart. This ability is due to the broadband sweep of the signal, which allows for better resolution of the time delay between the call and the returning echo, thereby improving the cross correlation of the two. If harmonic frequencies are added to the FM signal, then this localization becomes even more precise.

One possible disadvantage of the FM signal is a decreased operational range of the call. Because the energy of the call is spread out among many frequencies, the distance at which the FM-bat can detect targets is limited. This is in part because any echo returning at a particular frequency can only be evaluated for a brief fraction of a millisecond, as the fast downward sweep of the call does not remain at any one frequency for long.

==== CF signal advantages ====

The structure of a CF signal is adaptive in that it allows the CF-bat to detect both the velocity of a target, and the fluttering of a target&#x27;s wings as Doppler shifted frequencies. A Doppler shift is an alteration in sound wave frequency, and is produced in two relevant situations: when the bat and its target are moving relative to each other, and when the target&#x27;s wings are oscillating back and forth. CF-bats must compensate for Doppler shifts, lowering the frequency of their call in response to echoes of elevated frequency – this ensures that the returning echo remains at the frequency to which the ears of the bat are most finely tuned. The oscillation of a target&#x27;s wings also produces amplitude shifts, which gives a CF-bat additional help in distinguishing a flying target from a stationary one. The horseshoe bats hunt in this way.

Additionally, because the signal energy of a CF call is concentrated into a narrow frequency band, the operational range of the call is much greater than that of an FM signal. This relies on the fact that echoes returning within the narrow frequency band can be summed over the entire length of the call, which maintains a constant frequency for up to 100 milliseconds.

==== Acoustic environments of FM and CF signals ====

An FM component is excellent for hunting prey while flying in close, cluttered environments. Two aspects of the FM signal account for this fact: the precise target localization conferred by the broadband signal, and the short duration of the call. The first of these is essential because in a cluttered environment, the bats must be able to resolve their prey from large amounts of background noise. The 3D localization abilities of the broadband signal enable the bat to do exactly that, providing it with what Simmons and Stein (1980) call a &quot;clutter rejection strategy&quot;. This strategy is further improved by the use of harmonics, which, as previously stated, enhance the localization properties of the call. The short duration of the FM call is also best in close, cluttered environments because it enables the bat to emit many calls extremely rapidly without overlap. This means that the bat can get an almost continuous stream of information – essential when objects are close, because they will pass by quickly – without confusing which echo corresponds to which call.

A CF component is often used by bats hunting for prey while flying in open, clutter-free environments, or by bats that wait on perches for their prey to appear. The success of the former strategy is due to two aspects of the CF call, both of which confer excellent prey-detection abilities. First, the greater working range of the call allows bats to detect targets present at great distances – a common situation in open environments. Second, the length of the call is also suited for targets at great distances: in this case, there is a decreased chance that the long call will overlap with the returning echo. The latter strategy is made possible by the fact that the long, narrowband call allows the bat to detect Doppler shifts, which would be produced by an insect moving either towards or away from a perched bat.

== Taxonomic range ==

Echolocation occurs in a variety of mammals and birds as described below. It evolved repeatedly, an example of convergent evolution.

=== Bats ===

Echolocating bats use echolocation to navigate and forage, often in total darkness. They generally emerge from their roosts in caves, attics, or trees at dusk and hunt for insects into the night. Using echolocation, bats can determine how far away an object is, the object&#x27;s size, shape and density, and the direction (if any) that an object is moving. Their use of echolocation, along with powered flight, allows them to occupy a niche where there are often many insects (that come out at night since there are fewer predators then), less competition for food, and fewer species that may prey on the bats themselves.

Echolocating bats generate ultrasound via the larynx and emit the sound through the open mouth or, much more rarely, the nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (&quot;Rhinolophus spp.&quot;). Bat echolocation calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000 Hz, mostly beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz). Bats may estimate the elevation of targets by interpreting the interference patterns caused by the echoes reflecting from the tragus, a flap of skin in the external ear.

Individual bat species echolocate within specific frequency ranges that suit their environment and prey types. This has sometimes been used by researchers to identify bats flying in an area simply by recording their calls with ultrasonic recorders known as &quot;bat detectors&quot;. However, echolocation calls are not always species specific and some bats overlap in the type of calls they use so recordings of echolocation calls cannot be used to identify all bats. Researchers in several countries have developed &quot;bat call libraries&quot; that contain &quot;reference call&quot; recordings of local bat species to assist with identification.

When searching for prey they produce sounds at a low rate (10–20 clicks/second). During the search phase the sound emission is coupled to respiration, which is again coupled to the wingbeat. This coupling appears to dramatically conserve energy as there is little to no additional energetic cost of echolocation to flying bats. After detecting a potential prey item, echolocating bats increase the rate of pulses, ending with the terminal buzz, at rates as high as 200 clicks/second. During approach to a detected target, the duration of the sounds is gradually decreased, as is the energy of the sound.

==== Bat evolution ====

Bats evolved at the start of the Eocene epoch, around 64 mya. The Yangochiroptera appeared some 55 mya, and the Rhinolophoidea some 52 mya.

There are two hypotheses about the evolution of echolocation in bats. The first suggests that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice, or more, in Chiroptera, at least once in the Yangochiroptera and at least once in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae): 

The second proposes that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, i.e. that it was basal to the group, and was subsequently lost in the family Pteropodidae. Later, the genus &quot;Rousettus&quot; in the Pteropodidae family evolved a different mechanism of echolocation using a system of tongue-clicking:

==== Calls and ecology ====

Echolocating bats occupy a diverse set of ecological conditions; they can be found living in environments as different as Europe and Madagascar, and hunting for food sources as different as insects, frogs, nectar, fruit, and blood. The characteristics of an echolocation call are adapted to the particular environment, hunting behavior, and food source of the particular bat. The adaptation of echolocation calls to ecological factors is constrained by the phylogenetic relationship of the bats, leading to a process known as descent with modification, and resulting in the diversity of the Chiroptera today. Bats can inadvertently jam each other, and in some situations they may stop calling to avoid jamming.

Flying insects are a common source of food for echolocating bats and some insects (moths in particular) can hear the calls of predatory bats. However the evolution of hearing organs in moths predates the origins of bats, so while many moths do listen for approaching bat echolocation their ears did not originally evolve in response to selective pressures from bats. These moth adaptations provide selective pressure for bats to improve their insect-hunting systems and this cycle culminates in a moth-bat &quot;evolutionary arms race&quot;.

==== Neural mechanisms ====

Because bats use echolocation to orient themselves and to locate objects, their auditory systems are adapted for this purpose, highly specialized for sensing and interpreting the stereotyped echolocation calls characteristic of their own species. This specialization is evident from the inner ear up to the highest levels of information processing in the auditory cortex.

===== Inner ear and primary sensory neurons =====

Both CF and FM bats have specialized inner ears which allow them to hear sounds in the ultrasonic range, far outside the range of human hearing. Although in most other aspects, the bat&#x27;s auditory organs are similar to those of most other mammals, certain bats (horseshoe bats, &quot;Rhinolophus spp.&quot; and the moustached bat, &quot;Pteronotus parnelii&quot;) with a constant frequency (CF) component to their call (known as high duty cycle bats) do have a few additional adaptations for detecting the predominant frequency (and harmonics) of the CF vocalization. These include a narrow frequency &quot;tuning&quot; of the inner ear organs, with an especially large area responding to the frequency of the bat&#x27;s returning echoes.

The basilar membrane within the cochlea contains the first of these specializations for echo information processing. In bats that use CF signals, the section of the membrane that responds to the frequency of returning echoes is much larger than the region of response for any other frequency. For example, in the greater horseshoe bat, &quot;Rhinolophus ferrumequinum&quot;, there is a disproportionately lengthened and thickened section of the membrane that responds to sounds around 83 kHz, the constant frequency of the echo produced by the bat&#x27;s call. This area of high sensitivity to a specific, narrow range of frequency is known as an &quot;acoustic fovea&quot;.

Echolocating bats have cochlear hairs that are especially resistant to intense noise. Cochlear hair cells are essential for hearing sensitivity, and can be damaged by intense noise. As bats are regularly exposed to intense noise through echolocation, resistance to degradation by intense noise is necessary. 

Further along the auditory pathway, the movement of the basilar membrane results in the stimulation of primary auditory neurons. Many of these neurons are specifically &quot;tuned&quot; (respond most strongly) to the narrow frequency range of returning echoes of CF calls. Because of the large size of the acoustic fovea, the number of neurons responding to this region, and thus to the echo frequency, is especially high.

===== Inferior colliculus =====

In the Inferior colliculus, a structure in the bat&#x27;s midbrain, information from lower in the auditory processing pathway is integrated and sent on to the auditory cortex. As George Pollak and others showed in a series of papers in 1977, the interneurons in this region have a very high level of sensitivity to time differences, since the time delay between a call and the returning echo tells the bat its distance from the target object. While most neurons respond more quickly to stronger stimuli, collicular neurons maintain their timing accuracy even as signal intensity changes. These interneurons are specialized for time sensitivity in several ways. First, when activated, they generally respond with only one or two action potentials. This short duration of response allows their action potentials to give a specific indication of the moment when the stimulus arrived, and to respond accurately to stimuli that occur close in time to one another. The neurons have a very low threshold of activation – they respond quickly even to weak stimuli. Finally, for FM signals, each interneuron is tuned to a specific frequency within the sweep, as well as to that same frequency in the following echo. There is specialization for the CF component of the call at this level as well. The high proportion of neurons responding to the frequency of the acoustic fovea actually increases at this level.

===== Auditory cortex =====

The auditory cortex in bats is quite large in comparison with other mammals. Various characteristics of sound are processed by different regions of the cortex, each providing different information about the location or movement of a target object. Most of the existing studies on information processing in the auditory cortex of the bat have been done by Nobuo Suga on the mustached bat, &quot;Pteronotus parnellii&quot;. This bat&#x27;s call has both CF tone and FM sweep components.

Suga and his colleagues have shown that the cortex contains a series of &quot;maps&quot; of auditory information, each of which is organized systematically based on characteristics of sound such as frequency and amplitude. The neurons in these areas respond only to a specific combination of frequency and timing (sound-echo delay), and are known as combination-sensitive neurons.

The systematically organized maps in the auditory cortex respond to various aspects of the echo signal, such as its delay and its velocity. These regions are composed of &quot;combination sensitive&quot; neurons that require at least two specific stimuli to elicit a response. The neurons vary systematically across the maps, which are organized by acoustic features of the sound and can be two dimensional. The different features of the call and its echo are used by the bat to determine important characteristics of their prey. The maps include:

*FM-FM area: This region of the cortex contains FM-FM combination-sensitive neurons. These cells respond only to the combination of two FM sweeps: a call and its echo. The neurons in the FM-FM region are often referred to as &quot;delay-tuned&quot;, since each responds to a specific time delay between the original call and the echo, in order to find the distance from the target object (the range). Each neuron also shows specificity for one harmonic in the original call and a different harmonic in the echo. The neurons within the FM-FM area of the cortex of &quot;Pteronotus&quot; are organized into columns, in which the delay time is constant vertically but increases across the horizontal plane. The result is that range is encoded by location on the cortex, and increases systematically across the FM-FM area.
*CF-CF area: Another kind of combination-sensitive neuron is the CF-CF neuron. These respond best to the combination of a CF call containing two given frequencies – a call at 30 kHz (CF1) and one of its additional harmonics around 60 or 90 kHz (CF2 or CF3) – and the corresponding echoes. Thus, within the CF-CF region, the changes in echo frequency caused by the Doppler shift can be compared to the frequency of the original call to calculate the bat&#x27;s velocity relative to its target object. As in the FM-FM area, information is encoded by its location within the map-like organization of the region. The CF-CF area is first split into the distinct CF1-CF2 and CF1-CF3 areas. Within each area, the CF1 frequency is organized on an axis, perpendicular to the CF2 or CF3 frequency axis. In the resulting grid, each neuron codes for a certain combination of frequencies that is indicative of a specific velocity
*Doppler shifted constant frequency (DSCF) area: This large section of the cortex is a map of the acoustic fovea, organized by frequency and by amplitude. Neurons in this region respond to CF signals that have been Doppler shifted (in other words, echoes only) and are within the same narrow frequency range to which the acoustic fovea responds. For &quot;Pteronotus&quot;, this is around 61 kHz. This area is organized into columns, which are arranged radially based on frequency. Within a column, each neuron responds to a specific combination of frequency and amplitude. This brain region is necessary for frequency discrimination.

=== Whales ===

Biosonar is valuable to both toothed whales (suborder Odontoceti), including dolphins, porpoises, river dolphins, killer whales and sperm whales, and baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti), including right, bowhead, pygmy right, and gray whales and rorquals, because they live in an underwater habitat that has favourable acoustic characteristics and where vision is often extremely limited in range due to absorption or turbidity. Odontocetes are generally able to hear sounds at ultrasonic frequencies while mysticetes hear sounds within the infrasonic frequency regime.

==== Whale evolution ====

Cetacean evolution consisted of three main radiations. Throughout the middle and late Eocene periods (49-31.5 million years ago), archaeocetes, primitive toothed Cetacea that arose from terrestrial mammals, were the only cetaceans. They did not echolocate, but had slightly adapted underwater hearing. By the late middle Eocene, acoustically isolated ear bones had evolved to give basilosaurid archaeocetes directional underwater hearing at low to mid frequencies. With the extinction of archaeocetes at the onset of the Oligocene (33.9–23 million years ago), two new lineages evolved in a second radiation. Early mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes appeared in the middle Oligocene in New Zealand. Extant odontocetes are monophyletic (a single evolutionary group), but echolocation evolved twice, convergently: once in &quot;Xenorophus&quot;, an Oligocene stem odontocete, and once in the crown odontocetes. 

Physical restructuring of the oceans has played a role in the evolution of echolocation. Global cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary caused a change from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. Tectonic openings created the Southern Ocean with a free flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These events encouraged selection for the ability to locate and capture prey in turbid river waters, which enabled the odontocetes to invade and feed at depths below the photic zone. In particular, echolocation below the photic zone could have been a predation adaptation to diel migrating cephalopods. The family Delphinidae (dolphins) diversified in the Neogene (23–2.6 million years ago), evolving extremely specialized echolocation.

Four proteins play a major role in toothed whale echolocation. Prestin, a motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea, is associated with hearing sensitivity. It has undergone two clear episodes of accelerated evolution in cetaceans. The first is connected to odontocete divergence, when echolocation first developed, and the second with the increase in echolocation frequency among dolphins. Tmc1 and Pjvk are proteins related to hearing sensitivity: Tmc1 is associated with hair cell development and high-frequency hearing, and Pjvk with hair cell function. Molecular evolution of Tmc1 and Pjvk indicates positive selection for echolocation in odontocetes. Cldn14, a member of the tight junction proteins which form barriers between inner ear cells, shows the same evolutionary pattern as Prestin. The two events of protein evolution, for Prestin and Cldn14, occurred at the same times as the tectonic opening of the Drake Passage (34–31 Ma) and Antarctic ice growth at the Middle Miocene climate transition (14 Ma), with the divergence of odontocetes and mysticetes occurring with the former, and the speciation of Delphinidae with the latter.

The evolution of two cranial structures may be linked to echolocation. Cranial telescoping (overlap between frontal and maxillary bones, and rearwards displacement of the nostrils) developed first in xenorophids. It evolved further in stem odontocetes, arriving at full cranial telescoping in the crown odontocetes. Movement of the nostrils may have allowed for a larger nasal apparatus and melon for echolocation. This change occurred after the divergence of the neocetes from the basilosaurids. The first shift towards cranial asymmetry occurred in the Early Oligocene, prior to the xenorophids. A xenorophid fossil (&quot;Cotylocara macei&quot;) has cranial asymmetry, and shows other indicators of echolocation. However, basal xenorophids lack cranial asymmetry, indicating that this likely evolved twice. Extant odontocetes have asymmetric nasofacial regions; generally, the median plane is shifted to the left and structures on the right are larger. Both cranial telescoping and asymmetry likely relate to sound production for echolocation.

==== Mechanism ====

Thirteen species of extant odontocetes convergently evolved narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation in four separate events. These species include the families Kogiidae (pygmy sperm whales) and Phocoenidae (porpoises), as well as some species of the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;, all of &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;, and the La Plata dolphin. NBHF is thought to have evolved as a means of predator evasion; NBHF-producing species are small relative to other odontocetes, making them viable prey to large species such as the orca. However, because three of the groups developed NBHF prior to the emergence of the orca, predation by other ancient raptorial odontocetes must have been the driving force for the development of NBHF, not predation by the orca. Orcas, and, presumably ancient raptorial odontocetes such as &quot;Acrophyseter&quot;, are unable to hear frequencies above 100 kHz.

Another reason for variation in echolocation is habitat. For all sonar systems, the limiting factor deciding whether a returning echo is detected is the echo-to-noise ratio (ENR). The ENR is given by the emitted source level (SL) plus the target strength, minus the two-way transmission loss (absorption and spreading) and the received noise. Animals will adapt either to maximize range under noise-limited conditions (increase source level) or to reduce noise clutter in a shallow and/or littered habitat (decrease source level). In cluttered habitats, such as coastal areas, prey ranges are smaller, and species such as Commerson&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Cephalorhynchus commersonii&quot;) have lowered source levels to better suit their environment.

Toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the melon. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities. Most toothed whales use clicks in a series, or click train, for echolocation, while the sperm whale may produce clicks individually. Toothed whale whistles do not appear to be used in echolocation. Different rates of click production in a click train give rise to the familiar barks, squeals and growls of the bottlenose dolphin. A click train with a repetition rate over 600 per second is called a burst pulse. In bottlenose dolphins, the auditory brain response resolves individual clicks up to 600 per second, but yields a graded response for higher repetition rates.

It has been suggested that the arrangement of the teeth of some smaller toothed whales may be an adaptation for echolocation. The teeth of a bottlenose dolphin, for example, are not arranged symmetrically when seen from a vertical plane. This asymmetry could possibly be an aid in sensing if echoes from its biosonar are coming from one side or the other; but this has not been tested experimentally.

Echoes are received using complex fatty structures around the lower jaw as the primary reception path, from where they are transmitted to the middle ear via a continuous fat body. Lateral sound may be received through fatty lobes surrounding the ears with a similar density to water. Some researchers believe that when they approach the object of interest, they protect themselves against the louder echo by quietening the emitted sound. In bats this is known to happen, but here the hearing sensitivity is also reduced close to a target.

=== Oilbirds and swiftlets ===

Oilbirds and some species of swiftlet are known to use a relatively crude form of echolocation compared to that of bats and dolphins. These nocturnal birds emit calls while flying and use the calls to navigate through trees and caves where they live.

=== Terrestrial mammals ===

Terrestrial mammals other than bats known or thought to echolocate include shrews, the tenrecs of Madagascar, Chinese pygmy dormice, and solenodons. Shrew sounds, unlike those of bats, are low amplitude, broadband, multi-harmonic and frequency modulated. They contain no echolocation clicks with reverberations, and appear to be used for simple, close range spatial orientation. In contrast to bats, shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitat rather than to pinpoint food. There is evidence that blinded laboratory rats can use echolocation to navigate mazes.

== Countermeasures ==

Some insects that are predated by bats have anti-predator adaptations, including predator avoidance, attack deflection, and ultrasonic clicks which appear to function as warnings rather than echolocation jamming.

Tiger moths (Arctiidae) of different species (two thirds of the species tested) respond to simulated attack by echolocating bats by producing an accelerating series of clicks. The species &quot;Bertholdia trigona&quot; has been shown to jam bat echolocation: when pit against naïve big brown bats, ultrasound was immediately and consistently effective at preventing bat attack. Bats came in contact with silent control moths 400% more often than with &quot;B. trigona&quot;. 

Moth ultrasound can also function to startle the bat (a bluffing tactic), warn the bat that the moth is distasteful (honest signalling, aposematism), or mimic chemically defended species. Both aposematism and mimicry have been shown to confer a survival advantage against bat attack.

The greater wax moth (&quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;) takes predator avoidance actions such as dropping, looping, and freezing when it detects ultrasound waves, indicating that it can both detect and differentiate between ultrasound frequencies used by predators and signals from other members of their species. Some members of the &quot;Saturniidae&quot; moth family, which includes giant silk moths, have long tails on the hindwings, especially those in the Attacini and Arsenurinae subgroups. The tails oscillate in flight, creating echoes which deflect the hunting bat&#x27;s attack from the moth&#x27;s body to the tails. The species &quot;Argema mimosae&quot; (the African moon moth), which has especially long tails, was the most likely to evade capture.

<text>Shalman ( &quot;Šalman&quot;) is an individual, presumably a king, that is mentioned in Hosea 10:14 as having sacked the city of Beth-Arbel. He is usually identified with the Assyrian kings Shalmaneser II (by Archibald Sayce) or IV (by François Lenormant).

Eberhard Schrader argued that rather than Shalmaneser, Shalman was probably Salmanu, a king of Moab mentioned in an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III.

<text>Angioplasty, also known as balloon angioplasty and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, is a minimally invasive endovascular procedure used to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins, typically to treat arterial atherosclerosis.

A deflated balloon attached to a catheter (a balloon catheter) is passed over a guide-wire into the narrowed vessel and then inflated to a fixed size. The balloon forces expansion of the blood vessel and the surrounding muscular wall, allowing an improved blood flow. A stent may be inserted at the time of ballooning to ensure the vessel remains open, and the balloon is then deflated and withdrawn. Angioplasty has come to include all manner of vascular interventions that are typically performed percutaneously.

== Uses and indications ==

=== Coronary angioplasty ===

A coronary angioplasty is a therapeutic procedure to treat the stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease. These stenotic segments of the coronary arteries arise due to the buildup of cholesterol-laden plaques that form in a condition known as atherosclerosis. A percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary angioplasty with stenting, is a non-surgical procedure used to improve the blood flow to the heart.

Coronary angioplasty is indicated for coronary artery diseases such as unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI and spontaneous coronary artery perforation. Percutaneous coronary intervention for stable coronary disease has been shown to significantly relieve symptoms such as angina, or chest pain, thereby improving functional limitations and quality of life.

=== Peripheral angioplasty ===

Peripheral angioplasty refers to the use of a balloon to open a blood vessel outside the coronary arteries. It is most commonly done to treat atherosclerotic narrowings of the abdomen, leg and renal arteries caused by peripheral artery disease. Often, peripheral angioplasty is used in conjunction with guide wire, peripheral stenting and an atherectomy.

===Chronic limb-threatening ischemia===

Angioplasty can be used to treat advanced peripheral artery disease to relieve the claudication, or leg pain, that is classically associated with the condition.

The bypass versus angioplasty in a study of severe ischemia of the leg investigated infrainguinal bypass surgery first compared to angioplasty first in select patients with severe lower limb ischemia who were candidates for either procedure. In this study, angioplasty was associated with less short term morbidity compared with bypass surgery; however, long term outcomes favor bypass surgery.

Based on this study, the ACCF/AHA guidelines recommend balloon angioplasty only for patients with a life expectancy of 2 years or less or those who do not have an autogenous vein available. For patients with a life expectancy greater than 2 of years life, or who have an autogenous vein, a bypass surgery could be performed first.

=== Renal artery angioplasty ===
Renal artery stenosis is associated with hypertension and loss of renal function. Atherosclerotic obstruction of the renal artery can be treated with angioplasty with or without stenting of the renal artery. There is a weak recommendation for renal artery angioplasty in patients with renal artery stenosis and flash edema or congestive heart failure.

=== Carotid angioplasty ===
Carotid artery stenosis can be treated with angioplasty and carotid stenting for patients at high risk for undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Although carotid endarterectomy is typically preferred over carotid artery stenting, stenting is indicated in select patients with radiation-induced stenosis or a carotid lesion not suitable for surgery.

=== Venous angioplasty ===

Angioplasty is used to treat venous stenosis affecting dialysis access, with drug-coated balloon angioplasty proving to have better 6 month and 12 month patency than conventional balloon angioplasty. Angioplasty is occasionally used to treat residual subclavian vein stenosis following decompression surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. There is a weak recommendation for deep venous stenting to treat obstructive chronic venous disease.

== Contraindications ==

Angioplasty requires an access vessel, typically the femoral or radial artery or femoral vein, to permit access to the vascular system for the wires and catheters used. If no access vessel of sufficient size and quality is available, angioplasty is contraindicated. A small vessel diameter, the presence of posterior calcification, occlusion, hematoma, or an earlier placement of a bypass origin, may make access to the vascular system too difficult.

Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is contraindicated in patients with left main coronary artery disease, due to the risk of spasm of the left main coronary artery during the procedure. It is also not recommended if there is less than 70% stenosis of the coronary arteries, as stenosis is not hemodynamically significant below this level.

== Technique ==



Access to the vascular system is typically gained percutaneously (through the skin, without a large surgical incision). An introducer sheath is inserted into the blood vessel via the Seldinger technique. Fluoroscopic guidance uses magnetic resonance or X-ray fluoroscopy and radiopaque contrast dye to guide angled wires and catheters to the region of the body to be treated in real time. Tapered guidewire is chosen for small occlusion, followed by intermediate type guidewires for tortuous arteries and difficulty passing through extremely narrow channels, and stiff wires for hard, dense, and blunt occlusions.

To treat a narrowing in a blood vessel, a wire is passed through the stenosis in the vessel and a balloon on a catheter is passed over the wire and into the desired position. The positioning is verified by fluoroscopy and the balloon is inflated using water mixed with contrast dye to 75 to 500 times normal blood pressure (6 to 20 atmospheres), with most coronary angioplasties requiring less than 10 atmospheres. A stent may or may not also be placed.

At the conclusion of the procedure, the balloons, wires and catheters are removed and the vessel puncture site is treated either with direct pressure or a vascular closure device.

Transradial artery access and transfemoral artery access are two techniques for percutaneous coronary intervention. Transradial artery access is the technique of choice for management of acute coronary syndrome as it has significantly lower incidence of bleeding and vascular complications compared with the transfemoral artery approach. It also has a mortality benefit for high risk patients with acute coronary syndrome and who are at high risk of bleeding. Transradial artery access was also found to yield improved quality of life, as well as decreased healthcare costs and resources.

== Risks and complications ==
Relative to surgery, angioplasty is a lower-risk option for the treatment of the conditions for which it is used, but there are unique and potentially dangerous risks and complications associated with angioplasty:
* Embolization, or the launching of debris into the bloodstream
* Bleeding from over-inflation of a balloon catheter or the use of an inappropriately large or stiff balloon, or the presence of a calcified target vessel.
* Hematoma or pseudoaneurysm formation at the access site
* Radiation-induced injuries (burns) from the X-rays used
* Contrast-induced renal injury
* Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome leading to stroke is a serious complication of carotid artery angioplasty with stenting.

Angioplasty may also provide a less durable treatment for atherosclerosis and be more prone to restenosis relative to vascular bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting. Drug-eluting balloon angioplasty has significantly less restenosis, late lumen loss and target lesion revascularization at both short term and midterm follow-up compared to uncoated balloon angioplasty for femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease. Although angioplasty of the femoropopliteal artery with paclitaxel-coated stents and balloons significantly reduces rates of vessel restenosis and target lesion revascularization, it was also found to have increased risk of death.

== Adjunctive therapy ==
Rotational Atherectomy, or &quot;rotablation&quot;, is a technique used to treat heavily calcified coronary artery lesions by ablating plaque with a diamond-encrusted burr rotating at high speeds. It improve vessel lumens for balloon dilation and stent implantation. While effective for complex cases like calcification of nodules and tortuous vessels, its use is limited by procedural complexity, lack of training, and a need for specialized equipment. High procedural success rates are reported, especially with skilled operators, but careful patient selection is crucial to minimize complications. Studies show RA&#x27;s efficacy in comparison to alternative techniques, particularly for challenging lesions.

Atherectomy is an adjunctive therapy used for lesion preparation of calcified plaque before percutaneous coronary intervention. The goal of lesion preparation with atherectomy is to modify calcified plaque, which changes the lesion compliance and allows for adequate balloon and stent expansion in segments with heavily calcified lesions.

=== Atherectomy techniques ===
====Rotational Atherectomy====

Rotational atherectomy modifies plaque through rotational ablation using a diamond-tipped burr that spins concentrically on the wire. This technique is particularly useful for heavily calcified lesions that are resistant to balloon angioplasty.

==== Orbital Atherectomy ====
Orbital atherectomy employs an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown that orbits within the vessel, sanding down calcified deposits. This method has a reduced risk of burr entrapment compared to rotational atherectomy.

====Excimer Laser Coronary Angioplasty====

Excimer laser coronary angioplasty uses pulsatile ultraviolet laser energy to precisely ablate plaque tissue. It is effective in modifying undilatable and uncrossable lesions, facilitating subsequent balloon angioplasty and stent deployment.

Atherectomy is a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with coronary artery disease, particularly those with severely calcified lesions where traditional balloon angioplasty and stenting may be insufficient. Its success depends on the selection of appropriate devices and the operator’s expertise in managing the technical nuances to minimize complications. Studies have demonstrated that atherectomy can enhance procedural success rates and long-term outcomes in complex cases. However, further research and standardized protocols are needed to address challenges and expand its clinical applications effectively.

== Recovery ==

After angioplasty, most patients are monitored overnight in the hospital, but if there are no complications, patients are sent home the following day.

The catheter site is checked for bleeding and swelling and the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored to detect late rupture and hemorrhage. Post-procedure protocol also involves monitoring urinary output, cardiac symptoms, pain and other signs of systemic problems. Usually, patients receive medication that will relax them to protect the arteries against spasms. Patients are typically able to walk within two to six hours following the procedure and return to their normal routine by the following week.

Angioplasty recovery consists of avoiding physical activity for several days after the procedure. Patients are advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a week. Patients will need to avoid physical stress or prolonged sport activities for a maximum of two weeks after a delicate balloon angioplasty.

After the initial two week recovery phase, most angioplasty patients can begin to safely return to low-level exercise. A graduated exercise program is recommended whereby patients initially perform several short bouts of exercise each day, progressively increasing to one or two longer bouts of exercise. As a precaution, all structured exercise should be cleared by a cardiologist before commencing. Exercise-based rehabilitation following percutaneous coronary intervention has shown improvement in recurrent angina, total exercise time, ST-segment decline, and maximum exercise tolerance.

Patients who experience swelling, bleeding or pain at the insertion site, develop fever, feel faint or weak, notice a change in temperature or color in the arm or leg that was used or have shortness of breath or chest pain should immediately seek medical advice.

Patients with stents are usually prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy which consists of a P2Y12 inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, which is taken at the same time as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended for 1 month following bare metal stent placement, for 3 months following a second generation drug-eluting stent placement, and for 6–12 months following a first generation drug-eluting stent placement. Dual antiplatelet therapy&#x27;s properties are intended to prevent blood clots; however, they increase the risk of bleeding, so it is important to consider each patient&#x27;s preferences, cardiac conditions, and bleeding risk when determining the duration of its treatment. Another important consideration is that concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors following coronary angiography is associated with significantly higher adverse cardiovascular complications such as major adverse cardiovascular events, stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction.

== History ==

Angioplasty was first described by the US interventional radiologist Charles Dotter in 1964. Dotter pioneered modern medicine with the invention of angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent, which were first used to treat peripheral arterial disease. On January 16, 1964, Dotter percutaneously dilated a tight, localized stenosis of the subsartorial artery in an 82-year-old woman with painful leg ischemia and gangrene who refused leg amputation. After successful dilation of the stenosis with a guide wire and coaxial Teflon catheters, the circulation returned to her leg. The dilated artery stayed open until her death from pneumonia two and a half years later. Charles Dotter is commonly known as the &quot;Father of Interventional Radiology&quot; and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1978.

The first percutaneous coronary angioplasty on an awake patient was performed in Zurich by the German cardiologist Andreas Gruentzig on September 16, 1977.

The first percutaneous coronary angioplasties in the United States were performed on the same day (March 1, 1978) by Simon H. Stertzer at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and Richard K. Myler at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in San Francisco. During the previous year, also at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in San Francisco, Myler and Gruentzig had performed dilatations in the setting of bypass surgery to test the catheter concept before Gruentzig performed the first percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in his catheterization lab in Zurich.

The initial form of angioplasty was &#x27;plain old balloon angioplasty&#x27; without stenting, until the invention of bare metal stents in the mid-1980s to prevent the abrupt closure that sometimes occurred plain old balloon angioplasty.

Bare metal stents were found to cause in-stent restenosis as a result of neointimal hyperplasia and stent thrombosis, which led to the invention of drug-eluting stents with anti-proliferative drugs to combat in-stent restenosis.

The first coronary angioplasty with a drug delivery stent system was performed by Stertzer and Luis de la Fuente, at the Instituto Argentino de Diagnóstico y Tratamiento (English: Argentina Institute of Diagnosis and Treatment) in Buenos Aires, in 1999.

Ingemar Henry Lundquist invented the over-the-wire balloon catheter that is now used in the majority of angioplasty procedures in the world.

A subset of angioplasty, known as excimer laser coronary angioplasty, uses excimer lasers to remove small amounts of tissue, including undilatable and uncrossable lesions, in the artery in order to allow the balloon to more effectively compress plaque into the artery walls. Such work was first developed in 1984 following earlier work in 1980–1983, when Rangaswamy Srinivasan, Samuel Blum and James J. Wynne at IBM&#x27;s T. J. Watson Research Center observed the effect of the ultraviolet excimer laser on biological materials. Intrigued, they investigated further, finding that the laser made clean, precise cuts that would be ideal for delicate surgeries. This resulted in a fundamental patent and Srinivasan, Blum and Wynne were elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2012, the team members were honored with National Medal of Technology and Innovation by the President Barack Obama for their work related to the excimer laser. Robert Ginsburg deployed the first used of excimer laser coronary angioplasty in 1984 on a patient with severe stenosis of the deep femoral artery and a threatened limb.

<doc id="69284" wikidata="Q2566388" url="?curid=69284" title="Sergius Paulus">
<text>Lucius Sergius Paulus or Paullus was a Proconsul of Cyprus under Claudius (1st century AD). He appears in Acts 13:6-12, where in Paphos, Paul, accompanied by Barnabas and John Mark, overcame the attempts of Bar-Jesus (Elymas) &quot;to turn the proconsul away from the faith&quot; and converted Sergius to Christianity.

==Archaeology==
A boundary stone of Claudius mentioning Sergius was discovered at Rome in 1887. It records the appointment (AD 47) of the Curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber, one of whom was Sergius. Since Paul&#x27;s journey to Cyprus is usually dated to the first half of the 40s (and some scholars date his visit even earlier), it is thought Sergius may have first served three years as Proconsul at Cyprus, then returned to Rome, where he was appointed curator of the Tiber. Another inscription was discovered in 1887 at Soli, Cyprus, by Luigi Palma di Cesnola which mentions a proconsul Paulus. This inscription was dated to the middle of the 1st century by D. G. Hogarth. Terence Mitford noted that based on epigraphic grounds the inscription cannot be dated earlier than this and is probably considerably later. As he is not greeted in Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans, it is possible he died before it was written.

==Context==
Writing in the 4th century, Jerome speculated that Saul of Tarsus had been renamed Paul (&quot;Paulus&quot;) because he had converted Sergius Paulus to Christianity: 

Some medieval legends misidentified Sergius Paullus as Paul of Narbonne.

Sergius Paulus may have been the first of several successive senators named Lucius Sergius Paullus, of Antioch, Pisidia, including one who was consul suffectus c. 70, and another who was twice consul, Lucius Sergius Paullus, the father of Sergia Paulla, who married Quintus Anicius Faustus, Legate of Numidia in 198, and had Quintus Anicius Faustus Paulinus, governor of Moesia Inferior between 229 and 232.

<text>Amadeus V (1249 – 16 October 1323), also known as Amadeus the Great, was the Count of Savoy from 1285 until his death in 1323. He was a significant medieval ruler who played a crucial role in the expansion and consolidation of the House of Savoy’s influence in the regions that are now part of modern-day France, Italy, and Switzerland. 
==Life==
Amadeus was the son of Thomas II of Savoy and Beatrice Fieschi. Through his mother he was a grandnephew of Pope Innocent IV. Following his marriage to Sybille of Bâgé in 1272, Amadeus began life in the service of his cousin, King Edward I of England, as a household knight, serving in the First Welsh War of 1277. During the Second Welsh War of 1282, he was in command of Edward&#x27;s forces at Chester that relieved the siege of Rhuddlan Castle.

His childless paternal uncle, Count Philip I of Savoy, died in 1285. Meanwhile, earlier, in 1282, his elder brother, Thomas III of Piedmont, had accidentally died in 1282. Philip&#x27;s will charged his niece Eleanor of Provence and her son Edward I of England with the inheritance of Savoy. Amadeus was awarded the County of Savoy, and in order to diminish family rivalry, his younger brother Louis was awarded the new Barony of Vaud becoming Louis I of Vaud.

Through his marriage to Sybilla, Countess of Bugey and Bresse, he was able to incorporate these Burgundian districts into his states. Later expansion saw his dominions further increased. On 1 October 1285, Amadeus was declared protector of Geneva after negotiations with the Bishop of Geneva. The hereditary title belonged to Amadeus II, Count of Geneva who was in conflict with the Bishop.

In 1287 Amadeus besieged the castle of Ile in the Rhône near Geneva and captured it after fourteen weeks. In 1295, Amadeus acquired the fortress at Chambéry from its previous owner Hugh of La Rochette. He brought Georges de Aquila, a student of Giotto from Florence, to his court. Georges decorated the castle with paintings, carved wood, and frescoes. He worked there for the Savoyards until he died in 1348.

Military victories over the Amadeus II of Geneva and Humbert I Dauphin of Viennois, leading to the occupation of the city of Geneva in June 1287, led to the Treaty of Annemasse signed on 18 November 1287, whereby they submitted themselves as his vassals. During the 1294–1303 Gascon War, he acted as an agent of King EdwardI of England in the negotiations that led to the 1299 Treaty of Montreuil and the 1303 Treaty of Paris; separately, he arranged for the marriage of EdwardI with Margaret of France. In 1301, Amadeus also settled his dispute over control of Valais with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion. His reign, however, also saw friction between the County of Savoy and the Duchy of Austria. He pursued an alliance with the Kingdom of France and received Maulévrier in Normandy as a result of initial good relations.

The eventual recovery of Lyon by the kings of France alerted Amadeus to their expansionistic tendencies towards the regions by the Alps. He sought a powerful ally against potential hostility in the German king Henry VII, who was married to Margaret of Brabant, the sister-in-law of Amadeus. Amadeus accompanied Henry in his Italian campaign of 1310–1313, which culminated in Henry&#x27;s coronation as Holy Roman Emperor on 29 June 1312. As a reward for his service, Amadeus received the title of Imperial Count, imperial vicar of Lombardy, and the lordships of Asti and Ivrea. Henry also elevated Aosta and Chablais to duchies, though they remained a part of the realm of Savoy.

In 1315, Amadeus assisted the Knights Hospitaller in the defense of Rhodes against the Turks. He died in Avignon on 16 October 1323.

==Family and children==
He first married Sybille de Baugé, daughter of Guy I Damas de Baugé, Baron of Couzan (c.1230–1269) and Dauphine de Lavieu, and had eight children by her:

# Bonne of Savoy, married twice: 1) John I of Viennois, Dauphin of Viennois, 2) Hugh of Burgundy, Lord of Montbauson, the son of Hugh III, Count of Burgundy.
# John of Savoy (*1284–?)
# Beatrice of Savoy (*1291–1294), in 1291 fiancée promises to marriage count William III of Geneva, eventually contract annulled, William married her younger sister Agnes.
# Edward of Savoy (d. 1329), succeeded his father, and married Blanche of Burgundy, daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy.
# Eleonor of Savoy (d. after 1317), married three times: 1) William of Chalon, Count of Auxerre and Tonnerre, 2) Dreux IV of Mello, and 3) John I, Count of Forez. Her daughter Marguerite de Mello married John II of Chalon-Arlay.
# Margaret of Savoy (d. 1349), married John I of Montferrat.
# Agnes of Savoy (d. 1322), married William III of Geneva. Their son was Amadeus III of Geneva.
# Aymon of Savoy (d. 1343), succeeded his brother Edward as Count of Savoy, and married Yolande of Montferrat, the daughter of Theodore I, Marquess of Montferrat.

In 1297, he married, secondly, Marie of Brabant, who was a daughter of John I, Duke of Brabant and Margaret of Flanders. Her maternal grandparents were Guy of Dampierre and his first wife, Matilda of Bethune. They had 4 children:

# Maria of Savoy, married Hugh, Baron of Faucigny, the son of Humbert I of Viennois.
# Catherine of Savoy (d. 1336), married Leopold I, Duke of Austria and Styria.
# Anna of Savoy (d. 1359), married Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos.

<text>Edward (1284–1329), surnamed the Liberal, was Count of Savoy from 1323 to 1329. He was the son of Amadeus V and his first wife Sybille of Bâgé.

Edward was born in Baugé. He was married to Blanche, daughter of Duke Robert II of Burgundy and Agnes of France. They had a daughter, Joan, who married Duke John III of Brittany.

In 1325, Edward was attacked at Varey by Guigues VIII of Viennois and Amadeus III of Geneva as he was besieging Varey castle. Guigues won the battle and Edward barely escaped.

In 1327, the residents of Maurienne revolted against their bishop-prince. The bishop asked Edward for help, and Edward agreed, provided that he gain the administrative control of the diocese. The bishop consented, and was restored. That same year, the bishop of Sion refused to pay him homage, which had been the custom since the time of Peter II, Count of Savoy. From then on, the bishop and the count paid each other homage on the bridge of Morge.

In 1328, he had wooden aqueducts built to bring fresh water directly into the courtyard of the castle at Chambéry. His death in 1329 was unexpected and left the county to his brother, Aymon.

<text>Aymon, Count of Savoy (1291–1343), also known as Aymon the Peaceful, was a nobleman who ruled the County of Savoy from 1329 until his death in 1343. He was a member of the House of Savoy, a prominent European noble family.

==Early life==
Aymon was born in Chambéry. His father was Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, and he was the younger brother of Edward, Count of Savoy.

==Career==
In 1321, Aymon oversaw the siege engines at the siege of Corbières. On the death of Amadeus V in 1323, Aymon was lord of Bresse under Edward.

As a younger son of a noble family, Aymon had planned on a life in the church. When Edward died in 1329, Aymon was in Avignon at the court of Pope John XXII.

In 1329, shortly after becoming count, Aymon established a committee to settle the territorial disputes with his cousin, Amadeus III of Geneva. These disputes had been an ongoing feud between the families for generations, but they were able to resolve them through years of negotiations without resorting back to war. This was how Aymon earned his nickname of &#x27;The Peaceful&#x27;.

He contested the title Count of Savoy with his niece, Joan of Savoy since Savoy operated under Salic law and had never had a female ruler. Joan with the support of her husband, John III, Duke of Brittany defended Joan&#x27;s claim. John and Joan had no issue. Eventually, a settlement was reached whereby Aymon obtained the Countship in return for providing a monetary payment to Joan.

He spent much of his first few years as count at war with the Dauphin, Guigues VIII of Viennois, continuing a feud which went back for generations in their families. After Guigues was killed besieging La Perrière in 1333, Philip VI of France was able to broker a truce between Aymon and the new Dauphin, Humbert II of Viennois, brother of Guigues.

In August 1334, in the buildup to the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Edward III of England sent an embassy to Aymon to convince him to join the impending conflict on the side of the English. Aymon declined to commit, as he held lands both in England and in Normandy, so was technically a subject of both kings. In April 1337, Philip sent similar messages on the other side. Aymon replied that he could not go abroad to fight as he still had territorial disputes with the Dauphiné. Philip quickly settled a more lasting peace, as Humbert was trying to sell the Dauphiné. Aymon then led his forces as part of the French war effort from 1339 to 1342. He often fought alongside Amadeus III of Geneva.

In 1330, Aymon established a chancellor&#x27;s office to manage official documents. He financed the expansion of a burial chapel at the Hautecombe Abbey which was constructed from 1331 to 1342. In 1340, he set up judges to specifically handle appeals at a level between the castellans and himself, to ease his workload in such cases.

==Marriage and Children==
Prior to his marriage, Aymon also fathered several illegitimate children, who were raised in his household, even after his marriage. These included:
* Humbert, who worked for his father, and later his brother the count.
* Ogier, who worked for his father
* Amadeus (d. May 1346)
* Benoît
* Jean la Mitre (d. Aug 1348), lord of Cuine and castellan of Tarentaise and Entremont
* Jean, canon at Lausanne
* Marie
* Donata, a nun
* Huguette, a nun

In 1330, Aymon married Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrato granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and had 5 children, only 2 lived to adulthood:
# Amadeus VI (Amadeo VI) (1334–1383) the Green Count
# Bianca (1336–1388), married in 1350 to Galeazzo II Visconti, Lord of Milan.
# John (1338–1348), died of Black Death
# Catherine (1341), died young
# Louis (b. 24 December 1342), died young

Yolande died on 24 December 1342, in childbirth. Aymon became ill in the following months and died on 22 June 1343. He was buried alongside his wife in a chapel of Hautecombe Abbey.

<doc id="69295" wikidata="Q17015707" url="?curid=69295" title="Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel">
<text>The use of rock-cut cave tombs in the region began in the early Canaanite period, from 3100–2900 BCE. The custom lapsed a millennium, however, before re-emerging in the earliest Israelite tombs, dating to the 9th century BCE in Jerusalem. The use of rock-cut tombs reached its peak in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, before rapidly declining and eventually falling out of use in the 6th century BCE in some regions. It reappeared during the Second Temple period and continued into the Late Roman and Byzantine periods.

Use of the tombs has been recorded as recently as the late Roman period around the 3rd century CE.

Rock-cut tombs were a form of burial and interment chamber used in ancient Israel. Cut into the landscapes surrounding ancient Judean cities, their design ranges from single chambered, with simple square or rectangular layouts, to multi-chambered with more complex designs. Almost all burial chambers contain a platform for primary burial and an ossuary or other receptacle for secondary burial. There is debate on if these tombs were originally intended for secondary burials, or if that practice arose later.

The use of such tombs was generally reserved for the middle- and upper-classes, and each typically belonged to a single nuclear or extended family.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
===Genesis===
A number of rock-cut tombs are mentioned in the Bible. Possibly the first, called &quot;Cave of Machpelah&quot;, was purchased by Abraham for Sarah from Ephron the Hittite (). Traditionally, this tomb, which may have been either a rock-cut or a natural cave, is identified with the Cave of the Patriarchs in modern Hebron. According to very old traditions, Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were also buried there (). The New Testament reaffirms this tradition: &quot;Their (Jacob and his family) bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money&quot; ().

===Judges through Kings===
Rock-cut tombs are also mentioned in the Book of Judges (), the Second Book of Samuel (), and the Second Books of Kings ().

== Bronze Age precursors: Early Canaanite tombs ==
Early Canaanite I (3100–2900 BCE) period tombs are the earliest rock-cut tombs yet discovered in Israel; several have been found beneath the Ophel in Jerusalem. The custom had lapsed by the second millennium.

== Iron Age: First Temple period ==

=== Jerusalem ===
Rock-cut tombs from the late First Temple period have been discovered in several locations in Jerusalem, the capital city of the Kingdom of Judah. These include the Silwan necropolis, Ketef Hinnom, the Garden Tomb, and St. Etienne.

==== Silwan Necropolis ====
The Silwan necropolis, the most important cemetery of the First Temple period, is located in the Kidron Valley across from the City of David, in the lower part of the ridge where the village of Silwan now stands. Assumed to have been used by the highest-ranking officials residing in Jerusalem, its tombs were cut between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE.

David Ussishkin wrote that the architecture of the tombs and the manner of burial is different &quot;from anything known from contemporary Palestine. Elements such as entrances located high above the surface, gabled ceilings, straight ceilings with a cornice, trough-shaped resting-places with pillows, above-ground tombs, and inscriptions engraved on the facade appear only here.&quot; The stone benches on which bodies were laid out and the small square entrance doors are similar to those found elsewhere in Judah. Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the Phoenician cities validates the Biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms.

There are three different types of tombs in the Silwan necropolis, each type concentrated in one specific area. Seven of the tombs feature gabled ceilings and extremely fine stonework. Ussishkin described them as &quot;among the most beautifully rock-cut tombs known in the Jerusalem area even when compared with tombs of later periods.&quot; In contrast with the extensive family tombs of later periods, these are for single or double burials, with only one of the seven having room for three bodies. Later destruction has effaced the original doorways. A second tomb type described by Ussishkin has flat ceilings and one, two, or three chambers of well-dressed stone carefully squared into spacious rooms. One features a rear chamber of especially &quot;impressive&quot; scale and quality. There are tombs combining characteristics of the two described here above. The third type consists of just three &quot;magnificent&quot; monolith tombs, now located in the northern part of the village. These have been carved out of the cliff to create free-standing buildings above the underground burial chambers. Hebrew inscriptions survive on these three tombs; these are the only ancient inscriptions that survive in Silwan.

== Second Temple period ==
Rock-cut tombs, which had been absent from Judea since the First Temple period, made a comeback during the Hasmonean era of the Second Temple period, but they were only used by the elites.

=== Primary burials ===
At the beginning of the Hasmonean period, under the influence of Hellenistic burial customs from Marisa, members of the elite were buried in wooden coffins inside shafts known in Latin as &quot;loculi&quot; and in Hebrew as &quot;kokhim&quot;. Later, in the area of Jerusalem, primary burials took place either in &quot;kokhim&quot;, or in arched niches known in Latin as &quot;arcosolia&quot;.

However, the regular type of burial during the Early Roman period (c. 63 BCE – 70 CE), used by the non-elite population, was done in trenches. Trench burials were quite varied, with one or two bodies, either in primary or secondary burial, with even a case of an infant buried in a jar coming to light. If such a simple grave was hewn into the rock, archaeologists speak of a cist tomb (Keddie 2019, p. 227).

Some support the theory that in the Galilee, rock-cut tombs only had a comeback after the destruction of Jerusalem and the influx of refugees from Judaea after 70 CE (Keddie 2019, p. 237).

=== Secondary burials ===
Elite burials happened in two phases, the second burial consisting in collecting the bones after the decomposition of the body and placing them in specific places within the tomb – a procedure known as &quot;ossilegium&quot;. During the early Hasmonean period at Jericho, the bones were placed back in the primary burial niches or on benches. Around 20–15 BCE, Judaean elites started using ossuaries made of limestone, a custom that continued in the Jerusalem area until little after 70 CE (Keddie 2019, p. 230). The very large, monumental tombs of elite families from the Late Hellenistic period, often capped by pyramids or accompanied by impressive markers known as &quot;nefesh&quot;, are giving way in the Early Roman period to such enhanced by elaborate and refined facade relief decorations (Keddie 2019, p. 229).

=== Jerusalem ===
During the Second Temple period, Jerusalem was encircled by a belt of rock-cut tombs, which were built outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem in every direction, but predominantly to the north and south of the city. The tombs extend as far as 7 km from the city walls, with the more prestigious tombs located close to the city. This necropolis was established during the Hellenistic period but underwent significant growth during the Herodian period. Poor people&#x27;s graves, which were likely just simple graves excavated in the dirt, have not been preserved, and the roughly 800 tombs that have been preserved to this day belonged to aristocratic and middle-class families.

The most elaborate group of tombs was in the Kidron Valley across from the Temple Mount. These include the Tomb of Benei Hezir, that belonged to a priestly family also known from the Hebrew Bible, with the adjacent so-called Tomb of Zechariah monument (actually not a tomb), and the Tomb of Absalom along with the Cave of Jehoshaphat located behind it.

Among the notable tombs are the Jason&#x27;s Tomb, a large, elaborate, family tomb with multiple chambers and inscriptions in both Hebrew and Greek and the impressive sepulcher monument popularly known as the Tombs of the Kings, which is actually the tomb of Queen Helena of Adiabene and her relatives. Constructed circa 50 CE, this is the only funeral monument that can be positively recognized which was recorded by ancient writers, such as Josephus, Pausanias, Eusebius, and Jerome.

The elaborate Tombs of the Sanhedrin lie to the north of the city. They were so called by later generations because the largest of them contains 70 chambers with burial benches, and the Sanhedrin had seventy members. Each of the three tombs would actually have contained the burials of a single, multi-generational, wealthy family. They were constructed between the reign of Herod and 70 CE.

The cruciform, 5-chamber, so-called &quot;Herod&#x27;s Family Tomb&quot;, a burial cave complex located behind King David Hotel on King David Street in a park in the general area of Yemin Moshe, is built of perfectly cut and joined Herodian-type ashlars and was found to still contain two &quot;in situ&quot; decorated sarcophagi, all dated to the first century BCE. Its popular name stuck in spite of another tomb near the Damascus Gate being long considered as the actual funerary tower of Herod&#x27;s family, which again was contradicted by the finds at Herodium.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre contains remains of at least seven 2nd Temple-period tombs, including the one considered by Christian tradition to be that of Jesus, and a relatively well-preserved kochim tomb opening from the western apse of the Constantinian Rotunda.

=== Samaria and the Hebron Hills ===
Elaborate rock-cut tombs with designs resembling those found in Jerusalem of the late Second Temple period were discovered in multiple sites in Western Samaria, including Khirbet Kurkush, Deir ed-Darb and Mokata &#x27;Aboud, and in the Western Hebron Hills, including Khirbat al-Simia, Rujm el-Fihjeh and Khirbet el Jof. The great similarity between these tombs and the Jerusalem tombs, and the lack of a local Hellenistic prototype, have led the researchers to the assumption that the decorated tombs in western Samaria and western Hebron Hills are not the result of an internal development of the burial system there but rather the result of a deliberate copying of the Jerusalem tombs, at the special request of local, affluent families.

Most researchers concur that these tombs date from the same period as the Jerusalem tombs that were served as a model for replication, however, Magen thinks otherwise: in his opinion, the visible difference in the quality of the design and carving between the tombs indicates a chronological gap between them, and therefore he suggests dating the tombs of West Samaria and the Western Hebron Hills later than the Jerusalem tombs, at the end of the first century or the beginning of the second century. Magen also raised the possibility that their hewing is connected to the flight of Jewish craftsmen to Samaria and the Hebron Hills with the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem and perhaps even a little earlier, when the construction enterprises in the city began to dwindle and many quarrymen were left without employment.

Peleg-Barkat distincts between the rock-cut tombs of western Samaria and those of the western Hebron Hills. She asserts that while the tombs in western Samaria mimic the Jerusalem style, the tombs in the Hebron Hills show both Judean and Nabataean influences at once and do not attempt to copy the facade decorations of the Jerusalem tombs. She dates the tombs to the period before the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, although it&#x27;s possible that the practice of construction in the Jerusalem style continued after that. The occurrence suggests that the elaborate tombs of the elite in Jerusalem had an effect on the local elites in the towns and rural villages of early Roman Judaea.

=== Tomb of Jesus: Gospels and archaeology ===

The Gospel of Matthew mentions the newly rock-cut tomb of Joseph of Arimathea ().

Proposed candidates for the tomb include the rock-cut chamber inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Talpiot Tomb, and the Garden Tomb.

== Late Roman and Byzantine periods ==

=== Beit She&#x27;arim ===
The ruins of Beit She&#x27;arim (Sheikh Abrekh in Arabic) in the Galilee preserve a vast necropolis with catacombs containing a large number of rock-cut Jewish tombs from the late 2nd to 6th centuries CE. The ancient city of Besara, today known as Beit She&#x27;arim, was located near what is now the modern town of Tiv&#x27;on. According to various sources, it was one of the most highly desired burial places for Jews in the ancient world, second only to the Mount of Olives in its desirability. This prestige is attributed to Beit She&#x27;arim being named as the burial place of Yehuda HaNasi (Judah the Prince).

==Layout==
===Second Temple through Late Roman periods===
Tombs included a &quot;dromos&quot;, or entry-way, through which the tomb was accessed via a descending staircase. Some tombs possess elaborate facades, with the tombs of Be&#x27;it She&#x27;arim being well known for this feature. Others, such as those outside of Jericho, had simple exteriors with a rectangular blocking stone or mudbrick. The simplest tombs feature a single, square chamber with a recess in the center with benches along its edges to allow space for visitors to stand. Into the surrounding walls, save for the side of the &quot;dromos&quot;, were carved &quot;loculi&quot; approximately 2 meters in length. In more complex tombs, an interment room followed the entrance, in which the deceased&#x27;s remains were laid on stone benches to decompose. A repository served as an ossuary and secondary burial site to house the remains of the newly deceased with those of ancestors past. The repository also served to receive offerings to the deceased. The chambers of common rock-tombs were about 2.5 m × 3 m and laid out sequentially; however some had a more complex architecture of clustered and adjoining chambers – with the level of complexity relating to social status.

<text>Sepharvaim () was a city mentioned in the Bible as being captured by the Assyrians. It was taken by a king of Assyria, probably Sargon II, cited in the Hebrew Bible in 2 Kings 17:24, 31; 18:34; 19:13; and Isaiah 37:13). It was a double city, and received the common name Sepharvaim, i.e., &quot;the two Sipparas&quot;, or &quot;the two booktowns&quot;.

The Sippar on the east bank of the Euphrates is now called Abu-Habba; that on the other bank was Akkad, the old capital of Sargon I, where he established a great library. The recent discovery of cuneiform inscriptions at Amarna in Egypt, consisting of official despatches to Pharaoh Amenophis IV. and his predecessor from their agents in Canaan, leads some Egyptologists to conclude that an active literary intercourse was carried on between these nations, and that the medium of the correspondence was the Akkadian language language and script. (See Kirjath Sepher.)

Sepharvaim was the center of the worship of the god Adrammelech. They also worshipped the god Anammelech. After the deportation of the Israelites to Assyria, at least some of the residents of this city were brought to Samaria to repopulate it with other Gentile settlers.

<doc id="69297" wikidata="Q451995" url="?curid=69297" title="Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy">
<text>Amadeus VI (4 January 1334 – 1 March 1383), nicknamed the Green Count () was Count of Savoy from 1343 to 1383. He was the eldest son of Aymon, Count of Savoy, and Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrat. Though he started under a regency, he showed himself to be a forceful leader, continuing Savoy&#x27;s emergence as a power in Europe politically and militarily. He participated in a crusade against the Turks who were moving into Europe.

==Early years==
When his father died in 1343, Amadeus inherited the County of Savoy. Since he was only nine years old, his father&#x27;s will left two cousins as co-regents: Amadeus III of Geneva and Louis II of Vaud. The two agreed to a document limiting their power as regents. Neither could make any significant decision without the other, and the decisions of both were subject to review by the resident council of nobles representing all bailis in the county.

Shortly after Amadeus took the county, his cousin Joan of Savoy renewed her claim on the county of Savoy, that she was descended from Amadeus&#x27;s uncle Edward, Count of Savoy, though her claim had previously been denied under Savoy&#x27;s Semi-Salic tradition. Though she died the following year, in her will she left the county to Philip, Duke of Orléans to spite her cousins. In 1345, he negotiated a similar settlement to the one Joan reached with Aymon, yielding the claim in exchange for 5000 livres annually.
Amadeus was educated both physically and mentally. He enjoyed learning to fight and ride. His education included classic works such as De Re Militari and more modern texts including De Regimine Principum. He also showed religious devotion, requesting a portable altar and the right for his chaplain to say mass for him every morning wherever he may be. He took vows to fast more often than was healthy for him, and then asked Pope Clement VI to release him from these vows. The pope agreed, asking him instead to feed twelve of the poor weekly.

When the young Angevin queen Joanna I of Naples took the throne, several in northern Italy sought to take advantage of her inexperience and seize her lands there. John II, Marquess of Montferrat led the first attacks, while James of Piedmont, a cousin and vassal of Amadeus, backed the queen. After her first army was defeated in 1345, the attackers moved next into the territory ruled by James. In 1347, James asked Amadeus for help, and Amadeus sent an army. That army swept the attackers back through July of that year, with Amadeus joining the fighting in the last few weeks. John then recruited the help of Humbert II, Dauphin of Viennois, an old enemy of the Savoyards, and Thomas II, Marquess of Saluzzo. Together, they conquered the Angevin lands. Pope Clement VI spent 1348 negotiating a truce to end the fighting, which none of the combatants were satisfied with.

From 1348 through 1351, the Black Death ravaged the lands of Savoy, halving the population in some villages. In 1348, many of the peasants thought that it was caused by Jews poisoning wells and fountains. Though the castellans in some places tried to protect them, quite a few were killed. In Chambéry, the Jews were locked in the castle for their protection, but a mob broke in and killed several. Court officers were then pressured into finding the remainder guilty of poisoning, executing eleven and charging the remainder a fine of 160 florins per month for the next six years.

In 1349, Amadeus agreed to a treaty between himself, Amadeus of Geneva, James of Piedmont, and the House of Visconti, rulers of Milan, for mutual defence and assistance. This treaty included provisions for Galeazzo II Visconti to marry Bianca of Savoy, sister of the count. To honour the marriage in 1350, Amadeus created the Order of the Black Swan.

In 1349 Humbert II de La Tour du Pin, Dauphin de Viennois, the last Dauphin de Viennois, surrendered his title and principality to the future Charles V of France. At the time the new Dauphin was grandson of the current King Philip VI of France and son to his heir apparent, the later John II of France. Humbert II retired into a Dominican monastery.

==Count of Savoy==
In 1350, Guichard Tavel, the bishop of Sion and an ally of Savoy attempted to take the rights of some nobles in Valais, a frontier of Savoy. When he and his followers were attacked in August 1351 Pope Clement VI excommunicated the rebels, and Amadeus sent in thirty knights. Eight thousand peasants rose up in response and captured a couple of castles. A further one hundred knights were sent in and pushed the rebels back. In March 1352, Amadeus assembled an army, including Amadeus of Geneva and John of Montferrat, and the count swept through the valley in April. The rebels yielded quickly, and Amadeus re-established the authority over Sion that his uncle Edward had lost.

In the summer of 1352, Hugh of Geneva, uncle of Amadeus of Geneva and a noble within the Dauphiné re-ignited the long-standing feud with Savoy. The count of Savoy insulted Amadeus of Geneva&#x27;s honour related to the treaty he had negotiated between Savoy and the Dauphiné, and so Amadeus of Geneva left the council, and challenged one of the others, William de la Baume, who had replaced Louis of Vaud on the council. On 6 June 1352, the count of Savoy made an alliance with Albert II, Duke of Austria for mutual aid in conflict. Amadeus of Savoy gathered an army from his Italian lands to bring to war. As they were crossing the Alps, the rebellion in Valais and Sion broke out anew. Amadeus turned his army there first, and on 3 November defeated the rebels soundly. On the morning of the fourth, his advisor William knighted him. He then had part of the wall of Sion torn down, and his army pillaged the city. He also fined the citizens heavily.

He earned the nickname &quot;the Green Count&quot; when, in celebration of his 19th birthday in 1353, he appeared in a series of tournaments dressed with green plumes upon his helm, a green silk tabard over his armour, and his horse bearing green caparisons. He entered with an escort of eleven knights dressed in green, each led by a lady also dressed in green, leading her knight&#x27;s steed with a green cord. From then on, green was the favourite colour for his clothes and for his court.

In the spring of 1353, Amadeus prepared his army to attack into the Dauphiné. John II of France intervened and settled a truce in July, as he was hoping to use both armies in Gascony against the English, continuing the Hundred Years&#x27; War. However, Hugh immediately broke the truce. Amadeus besieged Hugh&#x27;s forces in Gex from 26 October through 11 November, when Amadeus defeated and burned the city. Pope Innocent VI and John both sent delegations to negotiate a truce, but Amadeus and Hugh continued their fight until April 1354. The fighting ended then when Amadeus destroyed Hugh&#x27;s army near Les Abrets.

In a treaty concluded in Paris in 1355, Amadeus agreed to exchange territory in Dauphiné beyond the rivers Rhone and Guiers, in exchange for recognition as the undisputed sovereign of Faucigny and the county of Gex, as well as becoming the suzerain lord over the Counts of Genevois, all of whose titles had been the subject of earlier contention between the Counts of Savoy and the Dauphins of Viennois. Amadeus also forced the Marquess of Saluzzo to pay him tribute, thus extending his rule to the Italian side of the Alps.

Amadeus was appointed Imperial vicar of Arelat by Emperor Charles IV in 1365 in an attempt, which did not succeed, to revive the imperial hold on the Kingdom of Arles (Arelat). The following year Charles IV ceded his rights to the crown of Arles to Louis I of Anjou after, however, transferring the County of Savoy to jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Germany.

==Crusade, 1366==

Amadeus initiated a minor crusade (with 15 ships and 1,700 men) in 1366 against Murad I of the Ottoman Empire to aid his cousin, John V Palaiologos, the Byzantine Emperor, son of the Dowager Empress, Anne of Savoy. In this campaign, Amadeus joined forces with Francesco I of Lesbos, and the Hungarian king Louis the Great, and they drove the Turks from Gallipoli. (This victory was short-lived, though, for they lost Gallipoli to the Turkish Sultan Murad I a few years later.) At this time John V was held captive by the Bulgarians. Amadeus turned his forces against Bulgaria and captured the Black Sea ports of Mesembria and Sozopolis. He then laid siege to Varna and sent Tsar Ivan Alexander an ultimatum to release John V or suffer further defeat. Ivan Alexander released John V and Amadeus returned to spend the winter in Mesembria, arriving there with John V before Christmas.

==Later years==
From 1372 to 1373 he fought alongside Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy in Italy as a part of the Papal forces against the Visconti family.

In 1377, he ordered the installation of the first public mechanical clock in the region, and established an officer to maintain it. He created a system of state-supported poor relief, one of the first of its kind in the late medieval world.

In 1381 at Turin, he mediated between Genoa and Venice and sponsored the peace treaty which brought an end to the War of Chioggia and the larger Venetian-Genoese War. The Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice had for long argued over the ownership of the island of Tenedos in the Aegean Sea near the Dardanelles. Eventually, it was agreed under the Treaty of Turin that as a compromise the island, after being depopulated and demilitarised, should be formally entrusted to Amadeus, Count of Savoy, a cousin to the Palaiologos imperial family.

Later Amadeus would be persuaded by Antipope Clement VII (Avignon Obedience) to accompany Louis I, Duke of Anjou, on an expedition to Naples. Here in 1382 the Count would share with Louis in the successful conquests of Abruzzi and Apulia. He died near Castropignano on 27 February 1383 and was interred at Hautecombe Abbey on 15 June 1383.

Amadeus was credited with purchasing the territory of the mountain pass, the Col de Largentièes, today Maddalena Pass on the border of France and Italy. This purchase took place in 1388, after his death, for the sum of 60,000 ecus.

==Marriage and children==
Throughout his youth, negotiations took place for him to marry a royal bride. In 1338, he was engaged to Margaret of Bohemia, three-year-old daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. From 1340 to 1344, he was betrothed to Joanna of Bourbon, niece of Philip VI of France. This marriage would have come with a dowry of fifty thousand florins. In 1347, he renounced that engagement, and became engaged instead to Joan of Burgundy, daughter of Philip of Burgundy and Joan I, Countess of Auvergne. This would have placed Amadeus as heir to her brother, Philip I, Duke of Burgundy. The three-year-old heiress was brought to the court of Savoy to be raised. In the summer of 1351, Amadeus sent to Edward III of England, seeking to marry his daughter, Isabella. This petition was protested by Amadeus of Geneva. Joan remained at the court until 18 April 1355, when she was sent to a convent in Poissy to live out her life.

He was married in 1355 in Paris to Bonne of Bourbon, the sister-in-law of Charles V of France. They had three children:
*daughter, born 1358 died after a few weeks
*Amadeus VII (March 1360 – 1 November 1391). He married Bonne of Berry (1365–1435), daughter of Duke John of Berry and a niece of Bonne of Bourbon.
*Louis of Savoy, born late 1364, died before the end of the year

==In literature==
Amadeus is one of the main characters in the New Weird novel &quot;La luce di Orione&quot; (2007) by Valerio Evangelisti. He is also a supporting character in the &quot;Chivalry&quot; series by Christian Cameron, with his epithet providing the title of the third novel, &quot;The Green Count&quot; (2017).

<doc id="69300" wikidata="Q1942003" url="?curid=69300" title="Jeremy Paxman">
<text>Jeremy Dickson Paxman (born 11 May 1950) is an English former broadcaster, journalist and author. 

Born in Leeds, Paxman was educated at Malvern College and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he edited the undergraduate newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot;. At Cambridge, he was a member of a Labour Party club and described himself as a socialist, in later life describing himself as a one-nation conservative. He joined the BBC in 1972, initially at BBC Radio Brighton, relocating to London in 1977. In following years, he worked on &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Panorama&quot;, becoming a newsreader for the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and later a presenter on &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; and &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

In 1989, he became a presenter for the BBC Two programme &quot;Newsnight&quot;, interviewing many political figures. Paxman became known for his forthright interviewing style, particularly when interrogating politicians. These appearances were sometimes criticised as aggressive, intimidating and condescending, yet also applauded as tough and incisive. In 2014, Paxman left &quot;Newsnight&quot; after 25 years as its presenter. Since then, he has done occasional work for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. From its revival in 1994 up until he stepped down from the show in 2023, he presented &quot;University Challenge&quot; and its Christmas spin-off from 2011 to 2022. In 2022, he announced he was standing down, as he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Early life and education==

Paxman was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of steel company employee and former Royal Navy lieutenant and typewriter salesman (Arthur) Keith Paxman, who left the family and settled in Australia, and Joan McKay ( Dickson; 1920–2009). Keith Paxman&#x27;s father was a worsted spinner, who became sufficiently prosperous as a travelling sales representative to send his son to public school in Bradford. The Dickson family were wealthier, with Keith&#x27;s father-in-law, a self-made success, paying the Paxman children&#x27;s school fees.

Paxman is the eldest of four children: one of his brothers, Giles Paxman, was the British Ambassador to Spain (having previously been ambassador to Mexico), and the other, James, is chief executive of the Dartmoor Preservation Association. His sister, Jenny, is a producer at BBC Radio.

Paxman was brought up in Hampshire, Bromsgrove, and Peopleton near Pershore in Worcestershire. He went to Malvern College in 1964, and later read English at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he edited the university student newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot;. While at Cambridge, Paxman was briefly a member of the Cambridge Universities Labour Club. He has since been made an honorary fellow of the College.

In January 2006, Paxman was the subject of an episode of the BBC genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman to impress the electorate ( being Latin for &#x27;peace&#x27;). Paxman&#x27;s maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with tears in his eyes on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay&#x27;s poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Paxman joined the BBC&#x27;s graduate trainee programme in 1972. He started in local radio, at BBC Radio Brighton. He moved to Belfast, where he reported on the Troubles. He moved to London in 1977. Two years later he transferred from the &quot;Tonight&quot; programme to &quot;Panorama&quot;. After five years reporting from places such as Beirut, Uganda and Central America, he read the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; for two years, before moving to BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; programme.

===&quot;Newsnight&quot;===
Paxman became a presenter of &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 1989.

On 13 May 1997 he interviewed Michael Howard, who had been Home Secretary until 13 days earlier after he had held a meeting with Derek Lewis, head of Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service, about the possible dismissal of the governor of Parkhurst Prison, John Marriott. Howard was asked by Paxman the same question &quot;Did you threaten to overrule him [Lewis]?&quot; a total of twelve times in succession (fourteen, if the first two inquiries worded somewhat differently and some time before the succession of twelve are included).

During a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 2000, Paxman told Howard that he had simply been trying to prolong the interview because the next item in the running order was not ready: &quot;By the time I&#x27;d asked the question five or six times... it was clear... that you [Howard] weren&#x27;t going to answer it... at which point a voice came in my ear and said &#x27;The next piece of tape isn&#x27;t cut, you&#x27;d better carry on with this for a while&#x27; and I&#x27;m afraid I couldn&#x27;t think of anything else to ask you.&quot;

In 1998, Denis Halliday, a United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator, resigned his post in Iraq, describing the effects of his own organisation&#x27;s sanctions as genocide. Paxman asked Halliday in a &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you just an apologist for Saddam Hussein?&quot;

In February 2003, Paxman was criticised by the Broadcasting Standards Commission over a &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview in which he questioned the then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy about his drinking. The commission said that the questioning was &quot;overly intrusive in nature and tone and had exceeded acceptable boundaries for broadcast&quot;.

In 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair opted to make the case for the invasion of Iraq via questions from a TV studio audience, mediated by Paxman. The programme is chiefly remembered for the fact that Paxman asked Blair if he and U.S. President Bush prayed together. Blair replied, &quot;No, Jeremy. We don&#x27;t pray together.&quot; To which Paxman replied, &quot;But why not?&quot;

During the 2005 general election, some viewers complained to the BBC that Paxman&#x27;s questioning of party leaders had been rude and aggressive. He was criticised for his 5 am interview with George Galloway after his election as the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow by the just defeated Oona King. Paxman asked Galloway more than once whether he was proud of having got rid of &quot;one of the very few black women in Parliament.&quot; Galloway cut the interview short. King later said she &quot;did not wish to be defined, by either [her] ethnicity or religious background.&quot;

On 11 April 2012, Paxman interviewed Russell Brand about Brand&#x27;s political views and the article he wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. The interview went viral as Brand stated that it was &quot;futile&quot; to vote and that a &quot;political revolution&quot; was needed. After this interview, Paxman revealed that he had not voted either in some previous elections.

On 26 June 2012, he interviewed the Economic Secretary to the Treasury Chloe Smith about Chancellor George Osborne&#x27;s decision that day to delay plans to increase fuel duty. Paxman questioned the apparent change in her views on fuel duty. Senior politicians, including John Prescott, questioned Osborne&#x27;s judgement for sending a junior minister onto the programme in place of himself.

The BBC announced Paxman&#x27;s departure from &quot;Newsnight&quot; at the end of April 2014. He had told Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the director-general of the BBC, and James Harding, the BBC head of news, that he wished to leave in July 2013, but agreed to stay on &quot;Newsnight&quot; for another year after the programme had been damaged by the Savile and Lord McAlpine scandals. In his statement Paxman commented: &quot;After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.&quot;

Paxman&#x27;s brusque manner is not restricted to political interviews. When around 2005 &quot;Newsnight&quot;″s editor decided to broadcast brief weather forecasts instead of financial reports Paxman openly ridiculed the decision: &quot;The forecast: it&#x27;s April, what do you expect?&quot; The financial reports were re-introduced after a few weeks.

Paxman presented his last &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 18 June 2014 in an edition which included an interview with Lord Mandelson and one with London Mayor Boris Johnson, while they both rode a tandem bicycle, as well as a brief reappearance of Michael Howard who, following on from his 1997 interview, was simply asked: &quot;Did you?&quot;. The closing theme was replaced with &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot; by The New Seekers. The programme ended with a brief post-credits scene with Paxman standing in front of a weather map exclaiming &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s weather: more of the same! I don&#x27;t know why they make such a fuss about it&quot; in reference to the 2005 weather forecasts.

===Other TV work===
Paxman has presented the weekly TV programme review &quot;Did You See...?&quot; and &quot;You Decide&quot;. From 1994 to 2023, he was the quizmaster for &quot;University Challenge&quot;, bringing him the distinction of &quot;longest-serving current quizmaster on British TV.&quot; In 2013, the BBC received 44 complaints after Paxman&#x27;s &quot;acerbic&quot; remarks caused a 20-year-old contestant to repeatedly apologise for answering a question wrong. In October 2022, an ITV documentary, &quot;Paxman: Putting Up With Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;, revealed how the disease has impacted him and revealed that Paxman recorded his very last episode of &quot;University Challenge&quot; on 15 October 2022, which aired on 29 May 2023. He presented a weekly compilation of highlights from the domestic edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; from February 2008 until shortly after the 2008 U.S. election on BBC America and BBC World, when the American programme was cancelled. The programme is still aired on BBC World.

In April 2006, &quot;The Sun&quot; claimed that Paxman earned £800,000 for his &quot;Newsnight&quot; job and £240,000 for presenting &quot;University Challenge&quot;, bringing his TV earnings to a yearly total of £1,040,000. This was one of a series of BBC salary leaks in the tabloid press that prompted an internal BBC investigation.

Paxman appeared as himself in an episode of BBC comedy &quot;The Thick of It&quot; that aired in January 2007. He is seen grilling Junior Minister Ben Swain (played by Justin Edwards) in a disastrous &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview.

Beginning on 15 February 2009, Paxman&#x27;s four-part documentary &quot;The Victorians&quot; was transmitted on BBC One. The series explores Victorian art and culture. From 27 February until 26 March 2012, BBC One broadcast his series &quot;Empire&quot;, examining the history and legacy of the British Empire.

In 2014, Paxman presented &quot;Britain&#x27;s Great War&quot;, an accompaniment to his 2013 book &quot;Great Britain&#x27;s Great War&quot;.

On 26 March 2015, Paxman co-presented, with Kay Burley, &quot;David Cameron and Ed Miliband Live: The Battle for Number 10&quot;, in which he interviewed both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Opposition Leader Ed Miliband regarding their track record in politics and their plans if elected Prime Minister in the general election set for May of that year. He also hosted Channel 4&#x27;s Alternative Election Night with David Mitchell. He then later co-presented a similar programme with Faisal Islam, interviewing Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May before the 2017 general election on 29 May, &quot;May v Corbyn Live: The Battle for Number 10&quot;.

===Books===

Paxman&#x27;s first book, &quot;A Higher Form of Killing&quot; (1982), written with then BBC colleague and friend Robert Harris, arose out of an edition of the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme they had made together on biological and chemical warfare. In a revised 2002 version they asserted that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons. In 1985, Paxman published &quot;Through the Volcanoes: A Central American Journey&quot;, an eyewitness account of people, places and politics. &quot;Friends in High Places: Who Runs Britain?&quot; (1991) was the result of numerous detailed interviews with the powerful or highly influential, what used to be called The Establishment. 1999 saw the publication of his &quot;The English: A Portrait of a People&quot;. &quot;The Political Animal: An Anatomy&quot; (2003), again based on extensive interviews, examines the motivations and methods of those who constitute the author&#x27;s professional prey: Westminster politicians.

The otherwise-republican Paxman&#x27;s &quot;On Royalty&quot;, which entailed the cooperation of Britain&#x27;s Royal Family, became by the time it was published in 2006 a defence of the country&#x27;s constitutional monarchy. His recent books have been big sellers. His history book, &quot;The Victorians: Britain through the Paintings of the Age&quot;, published in 2009, was accompanied by a BBC documentary series. In his introduction, Paxman acknowledged that the Irish writer Neil Hegarty had played a significant role in editing the book and bringing it to completion. Paxman stated that since all television is a &quot;collaborative exercise&quot;, it was &quot;rather silly for this book – which accompanies a television series – to appear with only one name on the cover.&quot; Paxman&#x27;s most recent book is a study of the British Empire, &quot;Empire: What Ruling the World Did to the British&quot;.

Paxman kept a detached tone while writing his memoir, &quot;A Life in Questions&quot;, which was published in October 2016.

===Radio===
Paxman presented the flagship BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Start the Week&quot; from 1998 to 2002.

===Podcast===
Since March 2023 Paxman has contributed to a podcast &#x27;Movers and Shakers&#x27; which is &quot;about life with Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;. Recordings are made in a Notting Hill pub and presenters (Rory Cellan-Jones, Gillian Lacey-Solymar, Mark Mardell, Paul Mayhew-Archer, Sir Nicholas Mostyn and Jeremy Paxman) discuss &quot;the highs and lows, trials and tribulations, of living with the condition&quot;. In March 2024 The UK Broadcasting Press Guild made &#x27;Movers and Shakers&#x27; its &#x27;UK Podcast of the Year&#x27;.

=== Other positions ===
Paxman is a Vice-President of The London Library.

==Paxman and the BBC==
During John Birt&#x27;s tenure as director-general of the BBC, the British press occasionally reported Paxman&#x27;s criticism of Birt. Birt was suspected at first to be an outsider brought in by a hostile government to supervise the BBC&#x27;s break-up and ultimate sell-off. Birt then publicly questioned the confrontational approach of certain TV and radio interviewers. This was seen at the time as coded criticism of Paxman himself and of his BBC colleague John Humphrys.

On 24 August 2007, Paxman delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. In it he was critical of much of contemporary television in Britain. He expressed concern that as a consequence of recent production scandals the medium was &quot;rapidly losing public trust&quot;. Speaking of prime minister Tony Blair&#x27;s criticism of the mass media at the time he left office, Paxman asserted that, though often, press and broadcasting may be &quot;oppositional&quot; in relation to the government of the day, this &quot;could only benefit democracy&quot;. &quot;Those Reithian goals, to &#x27;inform, educate and entertain,&#x27; still remained valid&quot;. Paxman took the opportunity to dismiss as &quot;inaccurate&quot; the attribution to him, which was in fact, Louis Heren, of the oft-quoted &quot;Why is this lying bastard lying to me?&quot; as the supposed dominant thought in his mind when interviewing senior politicians. He called on the television industry to &quot;rediscover a sense of purpose&quot;.

In November 2012, Paxman publicly defended George Entwistle following his resignation as director-general of the BBC in connection with a &quot;Newsnight&quot; report which falsely implicated Lord McAlpine in the North Wales child abuse scandal. Paxman claimed Entwistle had been &quot;brought low by cowards and incompetents&quot; and criticised appointments of &quot;biddable people&quot; to the BBC in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, as well as cuts to BBC programme budgets and &quot;bloated&quot; BBC management.

In August 2013, Paxman appeared on &quot;Newsnight&quot; with a beard, causing a Twitter trend when he accused the BBC of having an aversion to beards.

==Awards and honours==
In 1996 Paxman received BAFTA&#x27;s Richard Dimbleby Award for &quot;outstanding presenter in the factual arena.&quot; Two years later he won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Interviewer of the Year Award for his &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview (see above) with Michael Howard, as well as the Broadcasting Press Guild&#x27;s award for best &quot;non-acting&quot; performer. He gained another Richard Dimbleby Award in 2000 and was nominated for the award in 2001 and 2002. In total, Paxman has won five Royal Television Society awards. He won the award for International Current Affairs in 1985, and TV journalism interviewer/presenter of the year four times (1997, 1998, 2001 and 2008).

Paxman was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Leeds in the summer of 1999 and in December that year received an honorary degree from the University of Bradford. In 2006 he received an honorary doctorate from the Open University. Among those at the ceremony were three members of the Open University&#x27;s 1999 &quot;University Challenge&quot; team. Paxman is a Fellow by special election of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and an Honorary Fellow of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, St. Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In July 2016, Paxman was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Exeter for achievements in the field of broadcasting and journalism.

==Personal life==

Paxman formerly lived with television producer Elizabeth Clough in Stonor, southeast Oxfordshire. They have three children. The couple, who did not marry, amicably separated in 2016 after 35 years together. He prefers to keep his private life &quot;out of the spotlight&quot; and says he is not interested in the private lives of others. He has a flat in Kensington, London.

Paxman supports Leeds United and enjoys fly fishing. He is vice-chairman of the Wild Trout Trust conservation charity. He is also a patron of the charity Sustrans and east London homeless charity Caritas Anchor House.

In his twenties, Paxman unsuccessfully applied for the vacant editorship of the Labour-supporting weekly, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;; he said that in his youth he considered himself a socialist. He had previously stood as a communist candidate in his school elections. More recently, he has been described as &quot;the archetypal floating voter&quot;, and Jon Snow once said that Paxman&#x27;s greatest strength was being &quot;not very political&quot;. In 2014, Paxman described himself as a one-nation conservative. Elsewhere, Paxman has stated that he has no dominant political ideology:

In June 2014, Paxman, speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival about his new book, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Great War&quot;, said that &quot;Newsnight&quot; was made by &quot;idealistic 13-year-olds&quot; who &quot;foolishly thought they could change the world&quot;. &quot;Look, &quot;Newsnight&quot; is made by 13-year-olds. It&#x27;s perfectly normal when you&#x27;re young that you want to change the world,&quot; Paxman said. &quot;The older you get, the more you realise what a fools&#x27; errand much of that is and that the thing to do is to manage the best you can to the advantage of as many people as possible.&quot; Speaking about his political views in general, he said he was &quot;in favour of governments getting out of people&#x27;s lives – particularly foreign government&quot;, saying Europe had been &quot;nothing but trouble for us&quot;. He also joked that Belgium was a &quot;pointless little country&quot;. &quot;The closer you can take decision-making to the people affected by those decisions, the better.&quot;
In 2019, in an interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on Australia&#x27;s Nine Network, Paxman said he voted remain in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (initially intending to vote leave), but believed the result had to be respected:

Paxman became a focus of media attention in October 2000 when a German Enigma machine, which had been stolen from Bletchley Park Museum, was inexplicably sent to him in the post. He returned it to the museum.

In an interview with Emily Dean on a Times Radio podcast, Paxman described his experience with depression. He said that he takes psychiatric medication and has undergone Cognitive behavioural therapy. He stated that he regularly walks his dog, Derek, which &quot;helps as he meets people&quot;, and that his dog &quot;makes him laugh&quot;.

In September 2021, whilst promoting his book &quot;Black Gold: The History of How Coal Made Britain&quot;, Paxman revealed his support for Scottish independence. Talking to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, he said, &quot;My view about the Union is that if there is to be a referendum then the English should be allowed a vote as well. We are supposedly a nation of equals, so we should be equally entitled to a vote. And although I am a quarter Scottish I would vote to separate, I think. Because I can&#x27;t see what is gained by persistently giving the Jocks an excuse. We&#x27;re always going to be friends.&quot;

Paxman revealed in May 2021 that he is receiving treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, describing his symptoms as &quot;mild&quot;. Shan Nicholas of Parkinson&#x27;s UK said, &quot;Previously, Jeremy pledged to donate his brain to the Parkinson&#x27;s UK Brain Bank which will, one day, help scientists uncover the discoveries that will lead to better treatments and a cure for Parkinson&#x27;s.&quot;

In October 2022 an ITV documentary, &quot;Paxman: Putting Up With Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;, revealed how the disease has impacted him – the programme showed him attending a ballet class, learning to play bowls, meeting experts and observing a brain dissection. He met Sharon Osbourne, the wife of fellow Parkinson&#x27;s sufferer Ozzy Osbourne, to discuss the role of a partner or family carer; he agreed to her suggestion to one day try cannabidiol oil to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s. The programme revealed that Paxman recorded his last episode of &quot;University Challenge&quot; on 15 October 2022.

In April 2024 Paxman delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street with recommendations concerning NHS treatment of patients with Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, which he commented &quot;may not kill you but it will make you wish you hadn&#x27;t been born.&quot;

==Controversies==
While presenting a &quot;Newsnight&quot; segment in 2005, Paxman referred to Secretary of State for Health John Reid as an &quot;attack dog&quot;. In response, Reid accused Paxman of criticising him due to Reid&#x27;s Glaswegian accent. Paxman responded to Reid&#x27;s comment by stating that he admired his &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;strength of character&quot;, but could not understand why Reid went &quot;doolally&quot; over Paxman&#x27;s criticism of him, further claiming that it was &quot;extremely bizarre&quot; that certain Scottish people had a &quot;chip on their shoulder&quot; over their nationality. He went on to state that &quot;I mean down here we live under a sort of Scottish Raj... I don&#x27;t see why there is any reason for them to feel chippy. Do we complain about it? No we don&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s absurd. I don&#x27;t understand wherein lies this angst.&quot; In reaction to Paxman&#x27;s statements on Scotland, twenty Scottish MPs, including Jim Sheridan, Iain Luke and Brian Donohoe, signed a House of Commons motion criticising the statements as &quot;insulting, irresponsible, divisive and snobbish&quot;. 

In 2008, Paxman&#x27;s employment of domestic workers became the subject of public attention after the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper published an article about two Romanian nationals who had been employed by Paxman. The article contained testimonies from the two workers, who criticised Paxman for treating them &quot;like a common serving girl&quot; and paying wages of only £200 per week, which was under the British minimum wage (though as the two were live-in workers the minimum wage did not apply to them). They also criticised Paxman for not giving them an official employment contract or paid time off. In the same year, Paxman was the subject of further controversy when he described the work of Scottish poet Robert Burns as &quot;sentimental doggerel&quot; in the introduction of the 2008 edition of &quot;Chambers Dictionary&quot;. 

On a &quot;Newsnight&quot; segment aired on 31 May 2012, Paxman, discussing the possibility of a Greek withdrawal from the eurozone, stated that Greece, &quot;like a bad kebab&quot;, faced the possibility of being &quot;vomited out of the single currency&quot;. This statement was criticised in the same segment by the Greek Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change Giorgos Papakonstantinou, who told Paxman during an interview that &quot;Can I take issue with your &#x27;bad kebab’ analogy, which I find offensive. The Greek economy is in a crisis and the Greek people are going through a lot, and deserve some respect, and I really did not find that very appropriate.&quot; While appearing on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; in 2013, Paxman referred to British Prime Minister David Cameron as a &quot;complete idiot&quot; for his role in Britain&#x27;s First World War centenary commemorations. In response, MP Rob Wilson wrote to the director-general of the BBC, Lord Hall, to demand an apology from Paxman. In an interview conducted in the same year with Russell Brand, Paxman revealed that he had not voted at a recent election due to finding the available candidates &quot;unappetising&quot;, which led to criticism from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

John Pilger has raised Paxman&#x27;s membership of the British-American Project in the context of political biases of mainstream media.

Paxman was criticised for his presentation of the BBC documentary &quot;Britain&#x27;s Great War&quot;. While describing how British conscientious objectors were jailed and threatened with the death penalty because killing was against their beliefs, Paxman ventured his own opinion that it was the objectors themselves who were at fault, and that they were &quot;extreme&quot;. The conscientious objectors, Paxman said, &quot;have always struck me as cranks&quot;.

In 2017, Paxman&#x27;s interviews of Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May for the upcoming general election were described by journalist Michael Deacon as &quot;embarrassing&quot;. Deacon opined that Paxman&#x27;s pugnacious style of questioning had become tired, claiming that he had been &quot;doing an impression of himself&quot;.

<text>The Illinois River () is a principal tributary of the Mississippi River at approximately in length. Located in the U.S. state of Illinois, the river has a drainage basin of . The Illinois River begins with the confluence of the Des Plaines and Kankakee rivers in the Chicago metropolitan area, and it generally flows to the southwest across Illinois, until it empties into the Mississippi near Grafton, Illinois. Its drainage basin extends into southeastern Wisconsin, northwestern Indiana, and a very small area of southwestern Michigan in addition to central Illinois. Along its banks are several river ports, including the largest, Peoria, Illinois. Historic and recreation areas on the river include Starved Rock, and the internationally important wetlands of the Emiquon Complex and Dixon Waterfowl Refuge.

The river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The French colonial settlements along these rivers formed the heart of the area known as the Illinois Country in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal in the 19th century, the role of the river as link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi was extended into the era of modern industrial shipping. The Illinois now forms the basis for the Illinois Waterway, extending the river&#x27;s capabilities for navigation and commercial shipping.

==Hydrography==

The Illinois River is formed by the confluence of the Kankakee River and the Des Plaines River in eastern Grundy County, approximately southwest of Joliet. Its other major tributaries include the Fox, Vermilion, Macoupin, Mackinaw, Spoon, Sangamon, and La Moine. This river flows west across northern Illinois, passing Morris and Ottawa, where it is joined by the Mazon River and Fox River respectively. At LaSalle, the Illinois River is joined by the Vermilion River, and then it flows west past Peru and Spring Valley. In southeastern Bureau County it turns south at an area known as the &quot;Great Bend&quot;, flowing southwest across western Illinois, past Lacon, Henry and downtown Peoria, the chief city on the river.

South of Peoria, the Illinois River goes by East Peoria and Creve Coeur and then Pekin in Tazewell County. It is then joined by the Mackinaw River, and then passes through the Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge. Across from Havana, the Illinois is joined by the Spoon River coming from Fulton County, and across from Browning, it is joined by the Sangamon River, which passes through the state capital, Springfield, Illinois. The La Moine River flows into it approximately southwest of Beardstown, which is south of Peoria and Pekin and northwest of Lincoln and Springfield.

Near the confluence of the Illinois with the La Moine River, it turns south, flowing roughly parallel to the Mississippi across western Illinois. Macoupin Creek joins the Illinois on the border between Greene and Jersey counties, approximately upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River.

For the last of its course, the Illinois is separated from the Mississippi River by only about , by a peninsula of land that makes up Calhoun County. The Illinois joins the Mississippi near Grafton, approximately northwest of downtown St. Louis and about upstream from the confluence of the Missouri River and the Mississippi.

==Geology==
South of Hennepin, the Illinois River follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi River. The Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years ago, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, diverting it into its present channel. After the glacier melted, the Illinois River flowed into the ancient channel. The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi upstream of Rock Island.

The modern channel of the Illinois River was shaped in a matter of days by the Kankakee Torrent. During the melting of the Wisconsin Glacier about 10,000 years ago, a lake formed in present-day Indiana, comparable to one of the modern Great Lakes. The lake formed behind the terminal moraine of a substage of that glacier. Melting ice to the north eventually raised the level of the lake so that it overflowed the moraine. The dam burst, and the entire volume of the lake was released in a very short time, perhaps a few days.

Because of the manner of its formation, the Illinois River runs through a deep canyon with many rock formations. It has an &quot;underutilized channel&quot;, one far larger than would be needed to contain any conceivable flow of the modern river.

==History==
The Illinois River valley has long been an important transportation route for civilizations. The portages between the Des Plaines and Chicago Rivers and the Kankakee and St. Joseph rivers allowed Native Americans, Europeans, and later Americans access between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin. The first European presence in the area was the Jesuit mission founded in 1675 by Father Jacques Marquette on the banks of the Illinois across from Starved Rock at the Grand Village of the Illinois, near present-day Utica. The Illinois Confederation were the primary inhabitants of the valley. Marquette wrote of the river, &quot;We have seen nothing like this river that we enter, as regards its fertility of soil, its prairies and woods; its cattle, elk, deer, wildcats, bustards, swans, ducks, parroquets, and even beaver. There are many small lakes and rivers. That on which we sailed is wide, deep, and still, for 65 leagues.&quot;

In 1680, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle built the first fort in Illinois, Ft. St. Louis, at Starved Rock to facilitate the fur trade and defend the Illinois against the Iroquois. Later the fort was relocated to the present site of Creve Coeur, near Peoria. The French retained a presence in the area, with small trading posts.

Prior to the construction of the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal, completed in 1845, Peoria was the only large settlement on the River. The river&#x27;s trade flowed downstream to be dominated by St. Louis. After the I&amp;M Canal was built, a string of cities, such as LaSalle, Peru, and Ottawa grew along the river, extending Chicago&#x27;s influence into the Mississippi Valley. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the residents of the river towns were deeply involved in harvesting the river&#x27;s fish, waterfowl, mussels, and ice. They were economically and culturally dependent on the river, building up industries such as tourism related to duck hunting and sport fishing, commercial fishing, musseling for the button factories, and ice cutting for early attempts at refrigeration for domestic and commercial use.

With the construction of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in the late 19th century, Chicago&#x27;s sewage was pushed down the river rather than into Lake Michigan.

As the canal declined by the early 1900s, it was eventually replaced by the Illinois Waterway in 1933, which is still in use today.

===Interpretation===
The Peoria Riverfront Museum contains a gallery, &quot;Illinois River Encounter,&quot; that offers an interpretation of the river through an aquarium tank, and displays of the river&#x27;s geology, ecology, social history, engineering, and commercial use. The Starved Rock Lock and Dam Visitor Center features exhibits on the Illinois River with a viewing area of the working lock in a site frequented by bald eagles.

===Modern use===
From 1905 to 1915, more freshwater fish were harvested from the Illinois River than from any other river in the United States except for the Columbia River. The Illinois River was once a major source of mussels for the shell button industry. Overfishing, habitat loss from heavy siltation, and water pollution have eliminated most commercial fishing except for a small mussel harvest to provide shells to seed pearl oysters overseas. It is commercially fished downstream of the Rt. 89 bridge at Spring Valley. However, an infestation of invasive Asian carp has crowded out many game fish in the river. The Illinois River is still an important sports fishing waterway with a good sauger fishery.
The Illinois forms part of a modern waterway that connects the Great Lakes at Chicago to the Mississippi River. The waterway was originally established by the building of the Illinois and Michigan Canal that connected the Illinois River to the Chicago River. When the Sanitary District of Chicago later reversed the flow of the Chicago River, the pollution and sewage of the city of Chicago flowed down into the Illinois River. The Illinois and Michigan Canal has since been replaced by the Illinois Waterway, including the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. River traffic and flood control is managed by eight locks and dams operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. As of 2011, all locks and dams on this waterway are closed to visitors for security reasons, except the Starved Rock Visitor Center, which offers an excellent interpretation of the entire system. The waterway is heavily used by barges transporting bulk goods such as grain and oil. It is used in the summer and early fall by tourists in pleasure boats cruising the Great Loop. The Illinois River is an important part of the Great Loop, the circumnavigation of Eastern North America by water.

The City of Peoria is developing a long-term plan to reduce combined sewer overflows to the Illinois River, as required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. During dry weather, sewage flows safely through the city&#x27;s sewers to the Greater Peoria Sanitation District wastewater treatment plant. However, about 28 times a year, melting snow or rainwater can overwhelm the sewers, causing untreated sewage to overflow into the Illinois River. Peoria was required to examine the sewer overflows and prepare a long-term control plan to meet Clean Water Act requirements and protect the Illinois River. The city had to submit its plan by December 2008 to U.S. EPA and Illinois EPA. The issue was still under discussion as recently as 2016.

The John Hartford song &quot;Long Hot Summer Day&quot; is written from the perspective of a barge worker on the Illinois River. It references the Illinois towns of Pekin, Beardstown, and Alton.

<text>Sela (, &quot;Selaʿ&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;; , &quot;es-Sela‛&quot;; , &#x27;Petra&#x27;; ) is a geographical name encountered several times in the Hebrew Bible, and applicable to a variety of locations.

One site by this name is placed by the Second Book of Kings in Edom. It has been widely identified with the archaeological site of es-Sela&#x27; or as-Sila&#x27; in Jordan&#x27;s Tafilah Governorate.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Book of Judges===
In the Book of Judges there is a mention of a place called Sela, &quot;the rock&quot;, on the southern border of the lands still inhabited by the Amorites after the partial conquest of Canaan by the Israelites ().

===Second Book of Kings===
2 Kings sets &quot;Sela&quot; in the great valley extending from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea (). It was near Mount Hor, close by the desert of Zin.

In the story of King Amaziah of Judah, a place called Sela is mentioned. Amaziah is described as throwing 10,000 Edomites to their death from the heights of Sela (; ). When Amaziah took Sela he called it Joktheel (also spelled Jokteel (JPS) and Jectehel (DRB)) (q.v.) (, Yoqtĕ-’Ēl, &quot;the blessedness of God&quot; or &quot;subdued by God&quot;; ) or Kathoel () in the Septuagint.

===Isaiah and Obadiah===
Places called Sela are mentioned by the prophets Isaiah and Obadiah (15:1, 16:1; ) as to cry in joy in glory of the Lord.

==Archaeological site==
Sela in Edom is widely identified with the ruins of Sela, east of Tafileh (identified as biblical Tophel) and near Bozrah, both Edomite cities in the mountains of Edom, in modern-day Jordan.

As of 2012 Sela, or as-Sila‛ or es-Sela in Arabic, had not yet been excavated, but surveys of the plateau have produced surface finds from the Early Bronze Age through to the Nabataean period, but mainly from the time of the Edomites of the Hebrew Bible: the early to mid-first millennium BCE. This is the period when Sela was most extensively inhabited.

Archaeologists have found on a rock face at es-Sila&#x27; the so-called &quot;Nabonidus Inscription&quot;, named after the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (ruled c. 556–539 BCE).

==Confusion with Petra==
Sela appears in later history and in the Vulgate under the name of &#x27;Petra&#x27;, the Greek translation of the Semitic word &#x27;Sela&#x27;, meaning &#x27;rock&#x27;. This led to Sela being confused with the Nabataean city of Rekem, known to the Hellenistic world as Petra.

<text>Lord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others, acting as a master, chief, or ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles. The collective &quot;Lords&quot; can refer to a group or body of peers.

==Etymology==

According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the etymology of the word can be traced back to the Old English word &quot;hlāford&quot; which originated from &quot;hlāfweard&quot; meaning &quot;loaf-ward&quot; or &quot;bread-keeper&quot;, reflecting the Germanic tribal custom of a chieftain providing food for his followers. The appellation &quot;lord&quot; is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation &quot;lady&quot; is used. This is no longer universal: the Lord of Mann, a title previously held by the Queen of the United Kingdom, and female Lords Mayor are examples of women who are styled as &quot;Lord&quot;.

==Historical usage==

===Feudalism===

Under the feudal system, &quot;lord&quot; had a wide, loose and varied meaning. An overlord was a person from whom a landholding or a manor was held by a mesne lord or vassal under various forms of feudal land tenure. The modern term &quot;landlord&quot; is a vestigial survival of this function. A liege lord was a person to whom a vassal owed sworn allegiance. Neither of these terms were titular dignities, but rather factual appellations, which described the relationship between two or more persons within the highly stratified feudal social system. For example, a man might be lord of the manor to his own tenants but also a vassal of his own overlord, who in turn was a vassal of the King. Where a knight was a lord of the manor, he was referred to in contemporary documents as &quot;John (Surname), knight, lord of (manor name)&quot;. A feudal baron was a true titular dignity, with the right to attend Parliament, but a feudal baron, Lord of the Manor of many manors, was a vassal of the King.

===Manors===

The substantive title of &quot;lord of the manor&quot; came into use in the English medieval system of feudalism after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The title &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot; was a titular feudal dignity which derived its force from the existence and operation of a manorial court or court baron at which he or his steward presided, thus he was the lord of the manorial court which determined the rules and laws which were to govern all the inhabitants and property covered by the jurisdiction of the court. To the tenants of a certain class of manor known in Saxon times as &quot;Infangenthef&quot; their lord was a man who had the power of exercising capital punishment over them. The term invariably used in contemporary mediaeval documents is simply &quot;lord of X&quot;, X being the name of the manor. The term &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot; is a recent usage of historians to distinguish such lords from feudal barons and other powerful persons referred to in ancient documents variously as &quot;Sire&quot; (mediaeval French), &quot;Dominus&quot; (Latin), &quot;Lord&quot; etc.

===Laird===

The Scottish title Laird is a shortened form of &#x27;laverd&#x27; which is an old Scottish word deriving from an Anglo-Saxon term meaning &#x27;Lord&#x27; and is also derived from the middle English word &#x27;Lard&#x27; also meaning &#x27;Lord&#x27;. The word is generally used to refer to any owner of a landed estate and has no meaning in heraldic terms and its use is not controlled by the Lord Lyon.

==Modern usage==

===Substantive title===
Lord is occasionally used as part of a substantive British noble title in its own right: 

In the Peerage of Scotland, the members of the lowest level of the peerage have the substantive title &quot;Lord of Parliament&quot; rather than Baron. 

The heir to the throne in Scotland holds the title Lord of the Isles. 

In England, the title Lord of the Isle of Wight used to exist but fell out of use before the creation of the modern peerage system. 

The British sovereign is also accorded the title Lord of Mann as head of state of the Isle of Mann.

The feudal title of &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot; is still recognised by the British Government for any such title registered at His Majesty&#x27;s Land Registry before 13 October 2003 (the commencement date of the Land Registration Act 2002) but after that date titles can no longer be registered, and any such titles voluntarily de-registered by the holder cannot later be re-registered. However any transfer of ownership of registered manors will continue to be recorded in the register, on the appropriate notification. Thus in effect the register is closed for new registrations. Such titles are legally classified as &quot;incorporeal hereditaments&quot; as they have no physical existence, and usually have no intrinsic value. However a lucrative market arose in the 20th century for such titles, often for purposes of vanity, which was assisted by the existence of an official register, giving the purchaser the impression of a physical existence. Whether a title of &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot; is registered or unregistered has no effect on its legal validity or existence, which is a matter of law to be determined by the courts. Modern legal cases have been won by persons claiming rights as lords of the manor over village greens. The heads of many ancient English land-owning families have continued to be lords of the manor of lands they have inherited. The UK Identity and Passport Service will include such titles on a British passport as an &quot;observation&quot; (e.g., &#x27;The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of X&#x27;), provided the holder can provide documentary evidence of ownership. The United States forbids the use of all titles on passports. Australia forbids the use of titles on passports if those titles have not been awarded by the Crown (in reference to the Australian Monarchy) or the Commonwealth (in reference to the Australian Government).

===Peers and children of peers===

&quot;Lord&quot; is used as a generic term to denote members of the peerage. Five ranks of peer exist in the United Kingdom: in descending order these are duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. The appellation &quot;Lord&quot; is used most often by barons, who are rarely addressed by their formal and legal title of &quot;Baron&quot;. The most formal style is &quot;The Lord (X)&quot;: for example, Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, can be referred to as &quot;The Lord Tennyson&quot;, although the most common appellation is &quot;Lord Tennyson&quot;. Marquesses, earls and viscounts are commonly also addressed as Lord. Dukes use the style &quot;The Duke of (X)&quot;, and are not correctly referred to as &quot;Lord (X)&quot;. Dukes are formally addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;, rather than &quot;My Lord&quot;. 

&quot;Lord&quot; is also used as a courtesy title for younger sons of a British prince, duke, or marquesses, in the style &quot;Lord (first name) (surname)&quot;. The eldest son of a peer would be entitled to use one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles (if any). For example, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent holds the subsidiary title of Earl of St Andrews, which is used by his elder son George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, while his younger son is styled Lord Nicholas Windsor. However, if the father has no subsidiary title, the older son will assume a courtesy title of &quot;Lord (last name)&quot;, such as in the case of the Earl of Devon. As these forms of address are merely courtesy titles, the holder is not actually a member of the peerage and is not entitled to use the definite article &quot;The&quot; as part of the title.

===House of Lords===

The upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is the House of Lords, which is an abbreviation of the full title, &quot;The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled&quot;. The Lords Temporal are the people who are entitled to receive writs of summons to attend the House of Lords in right of a peerage. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Winchester and Durham, and the twenty-one longest-serving bishops of the Church of England from among the other bishops (plus some female bishops of shorter service in consequence of the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015), who are all entitled to receive writs of summons in right of their bishoprics or archbishoprics.

The Lords Temporal greatly outnumber the Lords Spiritual, there being nearly 800 of the former and only 26 of the latter. As of December 2016, 92 Lords Temporal sit in the House in right of hereditary peerages (that being the maximum number allowed under the House of Lords Act 1999) and 19 sit in right of judicial life peerages under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The rest are life peers under the Life Peerages Act 1958.

===Judiciary===
Until the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009), certain judges sat in the House of Lords by virtue of holding life peerages. Most of them (those who were members of the Appellate Committee) were known collectively as the Law Lords. All judges, including former Law Lords, lost the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, despite retaining their life peerages, upon creation of the Supreme Court. The appellation &quot;Lord&quot;, though not the style, is also used to refer to some judges in certain Commonwealth legal systems, who are not peers. Some such judges, for instance judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, are called &quot;Lord Justice&quot;. Other Commonwealth judges, for example judges of Canadian provincial supreme courts, are known only as Justices but are addressed with deference in court as &#x27;My Lord&#x27;, &#x27;My Lady&#x27;, &#x27;Your Lordship&#x27; or &#x27;Your Ladyship&#x27;.

Examples of judges who use the appellation &quot;lord&quot; include:
* Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom not holding peerages, who are addressed as if they were life peers by Royal Warrant. Wives of male justices who are not peers are addressed as if they were wives of peers. These forms of address are applicable both in court and in social contexts.
* Judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, known as &#x27;Lords Justices of Appeal&#x27;.
* Judges of the Scottish Court of Session, known as &#x27;Lords of Council and Session&#x27;.
* Justices of the Canadian provincial Supreme Courts, addressed in Court as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot; and referred to in legal literature as &quot;Lordships&quot; or &quot;Ladyships&quot;.
* Judges of the Supreme Court of India and the High Courts of India, who are addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; and &quot;Your Lordship&quot; in court. The Bar Council of India called upon lawyers to give up this practice of addressing judges as &#x27;lords&#x27; in 2006 but in practice, this was ignored.

===Naval===
The Board of Admiralty (1628–1964) was established in 1628 when Charles I put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission. The title Naval Lord to the Board of Admiralty was first used around the 1600s. These were a body of Senior Admirals, first called Naval Lord Commissioners, then Naval Lords then Professional Naval Lords then Sea Lords. The President of the Board was known as the First Lord of the Admiralty (with the other five Naval appointments being the Second Sea Lord, Third Sea Lord, etc. sequentially), or sometimes First Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty. With the abolition of the Board of Admiralty and its merger into the Ministry of Defence in 1964, formal control of the Navy was taken over by the Admiralty Board of the Defence Council of the United Kingdom, with the day-to-day running of the Navy taken over by the Navy Board. The office of Lord High Admiral was vested in the Crown (i.e. in the person of the current British monarch) and that of First Lord of the Admiralty ceased to exist, but the First, Second and Third Sea Lords retained their titles, despite ceasing to be Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. To this day (2023) the first two senior officers of the Royal Navy are still known as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, and Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff.

The Lords Commissioners were entitled collectively to be known as &quot;The Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty&quot;, and were commonly referred to collectively as &quot;Their Lordships&quot; or &quot;My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty&quot;, though individual members were not entitled to these styles. More informally, they were known in short as &quot;The Lords of the Admiralty&quot;. The Lords of the Admiralty are not peers.

===Ecclesiastical===
In Great Britain and Ireland, and in most countries that are members or former members of the Commonwealth, bishops may be addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lord Bishop&quot; or &quot;Your Lordship&quot;, particularly on formal occasions. This usage is not restricted to those bishops who sit in the House of Lords. Indeed, by custom, it is not restricted to bishops of the Church of England but applies to bishops of the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church, and may be applied (though less commonly) to bishops of other Christian denominations. It has become more common to use simply the one word &quot;Bishop&quot;.

In the United States, bishops are addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot;.

===Other High Offices of State===
Various other high offices of state in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland are prefixed with the deferential appellation of &quot;lord&quot;. 

These include: 
* Great Officers of State (United Kingdom) such as Lord Chancellor, Lord Privy Seal, and Lord President of the Council
* Council officials such as Lord Mayor in England or Lord provost in Scotland.
* Royal representatives, such as the Lord-lieutenant and Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland
* Heraldic officials such as the Lord Lyon King of Arms

Holders of these offices are not &quot;ex officio&quot; peers, although the holders of some of the offices were in the past always peers.

==Non-English equivalents==
In most cultures in Europe an equivalent appellation denoting deference exists. The French term &quot;Mon Seigneur&quot; (&quot;My Lord&quot;), shortened to the modern French &quot;Monsieur&quot;, derives directly from the Latin &quot;seniorem&quot;, meaning &quot;elder, senior&quot;. From this Latin source derived directly also the Italian &quot;Signore&quot;, the Spanish &quot;Señor&quot;, the Portuguese &quot;Senhor&quot;.

Non-Romance languages have their own equivalents. Of the Germanic family there is the Dutch &quot;Meneer/Mijnheer/De Heer&quot; (as in: &quot;aan de heer Joren Jansen&quot;), German &quot;Herr&quot;, and Danish &quot;Herre&quot;. All three of these stem from a Germanic title of respect (in this case, from the Proto-Germanic root &quot;&quot;, &quot;hoary, venerable, grey&quot;, likely a loan translation of Latin &quot;seniorem&quot;). 
In other European languages there is Welsh &quot;Arglwydd&quot;, Hungarian &quot;Úr&quot;, Greek &quot;Kyrie&quot;, Polish &quot;Pan&quot;, Czech &quot;pán&quot;, Breton &quot;Aotrou&quot;, and Albanian &quot;Zoti&quot;.

In several Indian languages there are the Hindi &quot;Swami&quot;, &quot;Prabhu&quot;, &quot;Thakur&quot;, &quot;Samprabhu&quot; (Overlord) and also words like &quot;Saheb&quot; or &quot;Laat Saheb&quot; from &quot;Lord Saheb&quot; were once used but have changed in meaning now, Telugu &quot;Prabhuvu&quot;, Tamil &quot;Koman&quot;, Kannada &quot;Dore&quot;, Bengali &quot;Probhu&quot;, Gujarati &quot;Swami&quot;, Punjabi &quot;Su&#x27;āmī&quot;, Nepali &quot;Prabhu&quot;. Words like &quot;Swami&quot; and &quot;Prabhu&quot; are Sanskrit-origin words, common in many Indian languages.

Philippine languages have different words for &quot;lord&quot;, some of which are cognates. Tagalog has &quot;Panginoón&quot; for &quot;lord&quot; in both the noble and the religious senses. Its root, &quot;ginoo&quot;, is also found in Visayan languages like Cebuano as the term for &quot;lord&quot;. &quot;Ginoo&quot; is also the Tagalog root for &quot;Ginoóng&quot;, the modern equivalent of the English term &quot;Mister&quot; (akin to how Romance language terms like &quot;señor&quot; may be glossed as either &quot;lord&quot;, &quot;mister&quot;, or &quot;sir&quot;). Ilocano meanwhile employs &quot;Apo&quot; for &quot;Lord&quot; in religious contexts; it is a particle that generally accords respect to an addressee of higher status than the speaker.

In the Yoruba language of West Africa, the words &quot;Olu&quot; and &quot;Oluwa&quot; are used in much the same way as the English term. Olodumare, the Yoruba conception of God Almighty, is often referred to using either of these two words. In the Yoruba chieftaincy system, meanwhile, the Oluwo of Iwo&#x27;s royal title translates to &quot;Lord of Iwo&quot;. In Lagos, the Oluwa of Lagos is one of that kingdom&#x27;s most powerful chiefs.

== Religion ==
English-speakers use the word &quot;Lord&quot; (generally with an initial upper-case letter) as a title of deference for various gods or deities. The earliest recorded use of &quot;Lord&quot; in the English language in a religious context
occurred in the work of English writers such as Bede ( – 735). However, Bede wrote in Latin
(Michael Lapidge describes him as &quot;without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon He used an Anglo-Saxon phrase that indicated a noble, prince, ruler or lord to refer to God; however, he applied this as a gloss to the Latin text that he was producing, and not as a clear translation of the term itself. &quot;Lord&quot;, as a gloss to Old English ,
meant &quot;royal&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, &quot;prince&quot;, or &quot;noble&quot;, and did not indicate a deity. After the 11th-century Norman invasion of England and the influx of Norman-French-speaking clerics, this semantic field began to appear in religious texts as well, but that occurred during the later Middle Ages and not in Bede&#x27;s early medieval period. The word &quot;Lord&quot; appears frequently in the King James Bible of the early 17th century. See also the article Jesus is Lord.
* English-language Old Testament translations such as the King James Version usually render the Hebrew name &quot;YHWH&quot; (the Tetragrammaton) as &quot;the &quot; with small caps. This usage follows the Jewish practice of substituting the spoken Hebrew word &quot;Adonai&quot; (&quot;My Lords&quot;) for appearances of &quot;YHWH&quot;.
* In Christianity, New Testament translations into English often refer to Jesus as &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;the Lord&quot;, translating Greek κύριος.
* In Aramaic, the title Mar, which means &quot;Lord&quot;, is used for saints, ecclesiastical figures, and Jesus.
* Semitic religions gave other deities appellations corresponding to &quot;Lord&quot; including:
** Baʿal (&quot;Lord&quot;), as used by the Canaanites both as a generic term of address to various local deities and as the spoken name for the storm god Baʿal Haddu once the form &quot;Hadad&quot; became too sacred for any but his high priest to utter.
** Similarly, Tammuz came to be addressed as &quot;Adoni&quot; (&quot;My Lord&quot;).
* In the non-Semitic Sumerian culture, &quot;En&quot; means &quot;Lord&quot;, as in the names of Sumerian deities such as Enki and Enlil.
* In Buddhism, Gautama Buddha is often called &quot;Lord Buddha&quot;.
* In Jainism, &quot;Lord&quot; refers to the Mahavira.
* In Ancient Greece, the name &quot;Adonis&quot; was a form of the Semitic &quot;Adoni&quot;.
* In Old Norse, the names Freyr and Freya may have the etymological meaning &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Lady&quot; respectively.
* The Wiccan God is often referred to as &quot;The Lord&quot; and the Wiccan Goddess as &quot;The Lady&quot;, or in the combination &quot;Lord and Lady&quot; (in this form, the definite article &quot;the&quot; is usually omitted), usually in reference to a mythological pairing such as Cernunos and Cerridwen.
* Believers in Mormonism regard Jesus as the YHVH (Jehovah) of the Old Testament in his pre-mortal existence, and since that name is translated as &quot;the Lord&quot; in the King James Bible, in Mormonism &quot;the Lord&quot; refers to Jesus. Elohim, seen as a separate individual who is the father of Jesus, is generally referred to by Mormons as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Heavenly Father&quot;. (See Mormon cosmology for references.)
* In Hindu theology, the &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot; may refer to the concept of the Absolute representation of the monotheistic God.

<text>Amadeus VII (24 February 1360 – 1 November 1391), known as the Red Count, was Count of Savoy from 1383 to 1391.

==Biography==

Amadeus was born in Chambéry on 24 February 1360, the son of Count Amadeus VI of Savoy and Bonne of Bourbon. After his father&#x27;s death in 1383, his mother and grandmother fought over the regency. In 1384, in order to suppress a revolt against his relative Edward of Savoy, Bishop of Sion, Amadeus led an army that attacked and pillaged Sion. In 1388, he acquired territories in eastern Provence and the port city of Nice, thus giving the County of Savoy control of an important Alpine pass and access to the Mediterranean Sea. Nice became part of the domains of the House of Savoy on 28 September 1388, when Amadeus VII, taking advantage of the internal struggles in Provence, negotiated the transfer with Giovanni Grimaldi, baron of Boglio (governor of Nice and the Eastern Provence) of Nice and the Ubaye Valley to the Savoy domains, with the name of &quot;Terre Nuove di Provenza&quot;. Amadeus&#x27; father, Amadeus VI, the Green Count, was credited with purchasing the territory of the mountain pass, the Col de Largentièes, today Maddalena Pass on the border of France and Italy, for the sum of 60,000 ecus, but this took place in 1388 after his death. The Col de Largentière was of great strategic and commercial importance because it linked Lyon with Italy; it offered an easy route between Piedmont and the outlying valley of Barcelonnette, which came into Savoyard possession when Amadeus VII, or his father, transferred it from the County of Provence to the County of Nice. 

On 1 November 1391, Amadeus died from tetanus, as a result of a hunting accident. Upon his death, controversy arose because of his will. Amadeus left the important role of guardian of his son and heir, Amadeus VIII, to his own mother, a sister of the powerful Duke de Bourbon, instead of following the tradition of appointing the child&#x27;s mother, who was a daughter of the equally powerful Duke de Berry. Due to the dispute between his mother and his wife, rumours that Amadeus had been poisoned emerged soon after his death. It took three months of negotiations to restore peace in the family.

Amadeus was known for his hospitality, for he would entertain people of all stations and never turned a person from his table without a meal.

==Marriage and children==
Amadeus married Bonne of Berry, daughter of John, Duke of Berry, who was the younger brother of King Charles V of France. They had: 
*Amadeus VIII, later known as Antipope Felix V, married Mary of Burgundy (1386–1422), daughter of Philip the Bold.
*Bonne (d. 1432), married Louis of Piedmont, the final of the Savoy-Achaea Branch.
*Joan (d. 1460), married John Jacob, Marquis of Montferrat

<doc id="69308" wikidata="Q728428" url="?curid=69308" title="Second Temple">
<text>The Second Temple ( , ) was the reconstructed Temple in Jerusalem, in use between and its destruction in 70 CE. In its last phase it was enhanced by Herod the Great, the result being later called Herod&#x27;s Temple. Defining the Second Temple period, it stood as a pivotal symbol of Jewish identity and was central to Second Temple Judaism; it was the chief place of worship, ritual sacrifice (&quot;korban&quot;), and communal gathering for Jews. As such, it attracted Jewish pilgrims from distant lands during the Three Pilgrimage Festivals: Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot.

Construction on the Second Temple began in the aftermath of the Persian conquest of Babylon; the Second Temple&#x27;s predecessor, known as Solomon&#x27;s Temple, had been destroyed alongside the Kingdom of Judah as a whole by the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem around 587 BCE. After the Neo-Babylonian Empire was annexed by the Achaemenid Empire, the Persian king Cyrus the Great issued the so-called Edict of Cyrus, which is described in the Hebrew Bible as having authorized and encouraged the return to Zion—a biblical event in which the Jewish people returned to the former Kingdom of Judah, which the Persians had recently restructured as the self-governing Jewish province of Yehud Medinata. The completion of the Second Temple at the time of the Persian king Darius I signified a period of renewed Jewish hope and religious revival. According to biblical sources, the Second Temple was originally a relatively modest structure built under the authority of the Persian-appointed Jewish governor Zerubbabel, the grandson of Jeconiah, the penultimate king of Judah.

In the 1st century BCE, the Second Temple was refurbished and expanded under the reign of Herod the Great, hence the alternative eponymous name for the structure. Herod&#x27;s transformation efforts resulted in a grand and imposing structure and courtyard, including the large edifices and façades shown in modern models, such as the Holyland Model of Jerusalem in the Israel Museum. The Temple Mount, where both Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the Second Temple stood, was also significantly expanded, doubling in size to become the ancient world&#x27;s largest religious sanctuary.

In 70 CE, at the height of the First Jewish–Roman War, the Second Temple was destroyed by the Roman siege of Jerusalem, marking a cataclysmic and transformative point in Jewish history. The loss of the Second Temple prompted the development of Rabbinic Judaism, which remains the mainstream form of Jewish religious practices globally.

==Biblical narrative==

The accession of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible. Some rudimentary ritual sacrifice had continued at the site of the first temple following its destruction. According to the closing verses of the second book of Chronicles and the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem following a decree from Cyrus the Great (Ezra 1:1–4, 2 Chronicles 36:22–23), construction started at the original site of the altar of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. These events represent the final section in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.

The original core of the book of Nehemiah, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the Book of Ezra around 400 BCE. Further editing probably continued into the Hellenistic era.

Based on the biblical account, after the return from Babylonian captivity, arrangements were immediately made to reorganize the desolated Yehud Province after the demise of the Kingdom of Judah seventy years earlier. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceedings by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first concerns was to restore their ancient house of worship by rebuilding their destroyed Temple.

On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics, besides other gifts, the people poured their gifts into the sacred treasury with great enthusiasm. First they erected and dedicated the altar of God on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris that occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (535 BCE), amid great public excitement and rejoicing, the foundations of the Second Temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mixed feelings by the spectators.

The Samaritans wanted to help with this work but Zerubbabel and the elders declined such cooperation, feeling that the Jews must build the Temple unaided. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. According to Ezra 4:5, the Samaritans sought to &quot;frustrate their purpose&quot; and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.

Seven years later, Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, died, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses. On his death, the &quot;false Smerdis&quot;, an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius became king (522 BCE). In the second year of his rule the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion, under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516 BCE, more than twenty years after the return from captivity. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people, although it was evident that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power.

The Book of Haggai includes a prediction that the glory of the Second Temple would be greater than that of the first. While the Temple may well have been consecrated in 516, construction and expansion may have continued as late as 500 BCE.

Some of the original artifacts from the Temple of Solomon are not mentioned in the sources after its destruction in 586 BCE, and are presumed lost. The Second Temple lacked various holy articles, including the Ark of the Covenant containing the Tablets of Stone, before which were placed the pot of manna and Aaron&#x27;s rod, the Urim and Thummim (divination objects contained in the ), the holy oil and the sacred fire. The Second Temple also included many of the original vessels of gold that had been taken by the Babylonians but restored by Cyrus the Great.

No detailed description of the Temple&#x27;s architecture is given in the Hebrew Bible, save that it was sixty cubits in both width and height, and was constructed with stone and lumber. In the Second Temple, the Holy of Holies (&#x27;) was separated by curtains rather than a wall as in the First Temple. Still, as in the Tabernacle, the Second Temple included the Menorah (golden lamp) for the &#x27;, the Table of Showbread and the golden altar of incense, with golden censers.

==Rabbinical literature==

Traditional rabbinic literature states that the Second Temple stood for 420 years, and, based on the 2nd-century work , placed construction in 356 BCE (3824 AM), 164 years later than academic estimates, and destruction in 68 CE (3828 AM).

According to the Mishnah, the &quot;Foundation Stone&quot; stood where the Ark used to be, and the High Priest put his censer on it on Yom Kippur. The fifth order, or division, of the Mishnah, known as Kodashim, provides detailed descriptions and discussions of the religious laws connected with Temple service including the sacrifices, the Temple and its furnishings, as well as the priests who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service. Tractates of the order deal with the sacrifices of animals, birds, and meal offerings, the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple (tractate Middot), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple (tractate Tamid). According to the Babylonian Talmud, the Temple lacked the (the dwelling or settling divine presence of God) and the (holy spirit) present in the First Temple.

==Rededication by the Maccabees==
Following the conquest of Judea by Alexander the Great, it became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated Pharaoh Ptolemy V Epiphanes at the Battle of Paneion.

In 167 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He also, according to Josephus, &quot;compelled Jews to dissolve the laws of the country, to keep their infants un-circumcised, and to sacrifice swine&#x27;s flesh upon the altar; against which they all opposed themselves, and the most approved among them were put to death.&quot; Following the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid empire, the Second Temple was rededicated and became the religious pillar of the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom, as well as culturally associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.

==Hasmonean dynasty and Roman conquest==
There is some evidence from archaeology that further changes to the structure of the Temple and its surroundings were made during the Hasmonean rule. Salome Alexandra, the queen of the Hasmonean Kingdom appointed her elder son Hyrcanus II as the high priest of Judaea. Her younger son Aristobulus II was determined to have the throne, and as soon as she died he seized the throne. Hyrcanus, who was next in the succession, agreed to be content with being high priest. Antipater, the governor of Idumæa, encouraged Hyrcanus not to give up his throne. Eventually, Hyrcanus fled to Aretas III, king of the Nabateans, and returned with an army to take back the throne. He defeated Aristobulus and besieged Jerusalem. The Roman general Pompey, who was in Syria fighting against the Armenians in the Third Mithridatic War, sent his lieutenant to investigate the conflict in Judaea. Both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus appealed to him for support. Pompey was not diligent in making a decision about this, which caused Aristobulus to march off. He was pursued by Pompey and surrendered but his followers closed Jerusalem to Pompey&#x27;s forces. The Romans besieged and took the city in 63 BCE. The priests continued with the religious practices inside the Temple during the siege. The temple was not looted or harmed by the Romans. Pompey himself, perhaps inadvertently, went into the Holy of Holies and the next day ordered the priests to repurify the Temple and resume the religious practices.

==Herod&#x27;s Temple==

The writings of Flavius Josephus and the information in tractate Middot of the Mishnah had for long been used for proposing possible designs for the Temple up to 70 CE. 
The discovery of the Temple Scroll as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the 20th century provided another possible source. Lawrence Schiffman states that after studying Josephus and the Temple Scroll, he found Josephus to be historically more reliable than the Temple Scroll.

===Temenos expansion, date and duration===
Reconstruction of the temple under Herod began with a massive expansion of the Temple Mount temenos. For example, the Temple Mount complex initially measured in size, but Herod expanded it to and so doubled its area. Herod&#x27;s work on the Temple is generally dated from 20/19 BCE until 12/11 or 10 BCE. Writer Bieke Mahieu dates the work on the Temple enclosures from 25 BCE and that on the Temple building in 19 BCE, and situates the dedication of both in November 18 BCE.

Religious worship and temple rituals continued during the construction process.

===Extent and financing===
The old temple built by Zerubbabel was replaced by a magnificent edifice. Herod&#x27;s Temple was one of the larger construction projects of the 1st century BCE. Josephus records that Herod was interested in perpetuating his name through building projects, that his construction programs were extensive and paid for by heavy taxes, but that his masterpiece was the Temple of Jerusalem.

Later, the sanctuary shekel was reinstituted to support the temple as the temple tax.

===Elements===
====Platform, substructures, retaining walls====
Mt. Moriah had a plateau at the northern end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod&#x27;s plan that the entire mountain be turned into a giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be wide by broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone blocks were laid. Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, the largest measuring and weighing approximately 567–628 tons.

====Court of the Gentiles====
The Court of the Gentiles was primarily a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food. Currency was also exchanged, with Roman currency exchanged for Tyrian money, as also mentioned in the New Testament account of Jesus and the Money Changers, when Jerusalem was packed with Jewish pilgrims who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000.

Above the Huldah Gates, on top the Temple walls, was the Royal Stoa, a large basilica praised by Josephus as &quot;more worthy of mention than any other [structure] under the sun&quot;; its main part was a lengthy Hall of Columns which includes 162 columns, structured in four rows.
The Royal Stoa is widely accepted to be part of Herod&#x27;s work; however, recent archaeological finds in the Western Wall tunnels suggest that it was built in the first century during the reign of Agripas, as opposed to the 1st century BCE.

====Pinnacle====
The accounts of the temptation of Christ in the gospels of Matthew and Luke both suggest that the Second Temple had one or more &#x27;pinnacles&#x27;:
The Greek word used is (), which literally means a tower, rampart, or pinnacle. According to &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot;, it can mean little wing, or by extension anything like a wing such as a battlement or parapet. The archaeologist Benjamin Mazar thought it referred to the southeast corner of the Temple overlooking the Kidron Valley.

====Inner courts====
According to Josephus, there were ten entrances into the inner courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women to the court of the Israelites, named the Nicanor Gate. According to Josephus, Herod the Great erected a golden eagle over the great gate of the Temple.

==== Roofs ====
 states that &quot;the teams of archaeologists Nahman Avigad in 1969–1980 in the Herodian city of Jerusalem, and Yigael Shiloh in 1978–1982, in the city of David&quot; have proven that the roofs of the Second Temple had no dome. In this, they support Josephus&#x27; description of the Second Temple.

==Pilgrimages==

Jews from distant parts of the Roman Empire would arrive by boat at the port of Jaffa, where they would join a caravan for the three-day trek to the Holy City and would then find lodgings in one of the many hotels or hostelries. Then they changed some of their money from the profane standard Greek and Roman currency for Jewish and Tyrian money, the latter two considered religious.

==Destruction==


In 66 CE, the Jewish population rebelled against the Roman Empire. Four years later, on the Hebrew calendrical date of Tisha B&#x27;Av, either 4 August 70 or 30 August 70, Roman legions under Titus retook and destroyed much of Jerusalem and Herod&#x27;s Temple. Josephus, while an apologist for the Empire, claims the burning of the Temple was the impulsive act of a Roman soldier, despite Titus&#x27;s orders to preserve it, whereas later Christian sources, traced to Tacitus, suggest that Titus himself authorized the destruction, a view currently favored by modern scholars, though the debate persists.

The Arch of Titus, which was built in Rome to commemorate Titus&#x27;s victory in Judea, depicts a Roman triumph, with soldiers carrying spoils from the Temple, including the temple menorah. According to an inscription on the Colosseum, Emperor Vespasian built the Colosseum with war spoils in 79–possibly from the spoils of the Second Temple. The sects of Judaism that had their base in the Temple dwindled in importance, including the priesthood and the Sadducees.

The Temple was on the site of what today is the Dome of the Rock. The gates led close to what is now al-Aqsa Mosque, built much later. Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor Hadrian established a new Roman &quot;colonia&quot; called Aelia Capitolina. At the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred. Jews were banned from entering Jerusalem. A Roman temple was set up on the former site of Herod&#x27;s Temple for the practice of Roman religion. 

Historical accounts relate that not only the Jewish Temple was destroyed, but also the entire Lower city of Jerusalem. Even so, according to Josephus, Titus did not totally raze the towers (such as the &quot;Tower of Phasael&quot;, now erroneously called the Tower of David), keeping them as a memorial of the city&#x27;s strength. The Midrash Rabba (&quot;Eikha Rabba&quot; 1:32) recounts a similar episode related to the destruction of the city, according to which Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, during the Roman siege of Jerusalem, requested of Vespasian that he spare the westernmost gates of the city () that lead to Lydda (Lod). When the city was eventually taken, the Arab auxiliaries who had fought alongside the Romans under their general, Fanjar, also spared that westernmost wall from destruction.

Jewish eschatology includes a belief that the Second Temple will be replaced by a future Third Temple in Jerusalem.

==Archaeology of the Temple==

===Temple warning inscriptions===

In 1871, a hewn stone measuring and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau as being the Temple Warning inscription. The stone inscription outlined the prohibition extended to those who were not of the Jewish nation to proceed beyond the separating the larger Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts. The inscription read in seven lines:
Today, the stone is preserved in Istanbul&#x27;s Museum of Antiquities.

In 1935 a fragment of another similar Temple warning inscription was found.

The word &quot;foreigner&quot; has an ambiguous meaning. Some scholars believe it referred to all gentiles, regardless of ritual purity status or religion. Others argue that it referred to unconverted Gentiles since Herod wrote the inscription. Herod himself was a converted Idumean (or Edomite) and was unlikely to exclude himself or his descendants.

===Place of trumpeting===
Another ancient inscription, partially preserved on a stone discovered below the southwest corner of the Herodian Mount, contains the words &quot;to the place of trumpeting&quot;. The stone&#x27;s shape suggests that it was part of a parapet, and it has been interpreted as belonging to a spot on the Mount described by Josephus, &quot;where one of the priests to stand and to give notice, by sound of trumpet, in the afternoon of the approach, and on the following evening of the close, of every seventh day&quot; closely resembling what the Talmud says.

===Walls and gates of the Temple complex===
After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended all the way around the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions&#x27; Gate. Thus, the remaining part of the Temple Mount is not only the Western Wall. Currently, Robinson&#x27;s Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. Visitors and pilgrims also entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side that led through colonnades to the top of the platform. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archaeological digs have found numerous (ritual baths) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, and a grand stairway leading to one of the now blocked entrances.

===Underground structures===
Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon&#x27;s Stables, which still exist. Their current renovation by the is extremely controversial.

===Quarry===
On September 25, 2007, Yuval Baruch, archaeologist with the Israeli Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of a quarry compound that may have provided King Herod with the stones to build his Temple on the Temple Mount. Coins, pottery and an iron stake found proved the date of the quarrying to be about 19 BCE. Archaeologist Ehud Netzer confirmed that the large outlines of the stone cuts is evidence that it was a massive public project worked by hundreds of slaves.

===Floor tiling from courts===
More recent findings from the Temple Mount Sifting Project include floor tiling from the Second Temple period.

===Magdala stone interpretation===
The Magdala stone is thought to be a representation of the Second Temple carved before its destruction in the year 70.

==Second Temple Judaism==

The period between the construction of the Second Temple in 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE witnessed major historical upheavals and significant religious changes that would affect most subsequent Abrahamic religions. The origins of the authority of scripture, of the centrality of law and morality in religion, of the synagogue and of apocalyptic expectations for the future all developed in the Judaism of this period.

<text>RT-11 (Real-time 11) is a discontinued small, low-end, single-user real-time operating system for the full line of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 16-bit computers. RT-11 was first implemented in 1970. It was widely used for real-time computing systems, process control, and data acquisition across all PDP-11s. It was also used for low-cost general-use computing.

==Features==

===Source code===
RT-11 was written in assembly language. Heavy use of the conditional assembly and macro programming features of the MACRO-11 assembler allowed a significant degree of configurability and allowed programmers to specify high-level instructions otherwise unprovided for in machine code. RT-11 distributions included the source code of the operating system and its device drivers with all the comments removed and a program named &quot;SYSGEN&quot; which would build the operating system and drivers according to a user-specified configuration. Developer&#x27;s documentation included a kernel listing that included comments.

===Device drivers===
In RT-11, device drivers were loadable, except that prior to V4.0 the device driver for the system device (boot device) was built into the kernel at configuration time. Because RT-11 was commonly used for device control and data acquisition, it was common for developers to write or enhance device drivers. DEC encouraged such driver development by making their hardware subsystems (from bus structure to code) open, documenting the internals of the operating system, encouraging third-party hardware and software vendors, and by fostering the development of the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society.

===Multitasking===
RT-11 systems did not support preemptive multitasking, but most versions could run multiple simultaneous applications. All variants of the monitors provided a &quot;background job&quot;. The FB, XM, and ZM monitors also provided a &quot;foreground job&quot;, and six &quot;system jobs&quot; if selected via the SYSGEN system generation program. These tasks had fixed priorities, with the background job lowest and the foreground job highest. It was possible to switch between jobs from the system console user interface, and SYSGEN could generate a monitor that provided a single background job (the SB, XB and ZB variants). The terms &quot;foreground&quot; and &quot;background&quot; are counterintuitive; the background job was typically the user&#x27;s command-line interpreter; a foreground job might be doing something like non-interactive data collection.

===Human interface===

Users generally operated RT-11 via a printing terminal or a video terminal, originally via a strap-selectable current-loop (for conventional teletypes) or via an RS-232 (later RS-422 as well) interface on one of the CPU cards; DEC also supported the VT11 and VS60 graphics display devices (vector graphics terminals with a graphic character generator for displaying text, and a light pen for graphical input). A third-party favorite was the Tektronix 4010 family.

The Keyboard Monitor (KMON) interpreted commands issued by the user and would invoke various utilities with Command String Interpreter (CSI) forms of the commands. 
RT-11 command language had many features (such as commands and device names) that can be found later in the DOS line of operating systems which heavily borrowed from RT-11. The CSI form expected input and output filenames and options (&#x27;switches&#x27; on RT-11) in a precise order and syntax. The command-line switches were separated by a slash (codice_1) rather than the dash (codice_2) used in Unix-like operating systems. All commands had a full form and a short one to which they could be contracted. For example, the RENAME command could be contracted to REN.

Batch files and the batch processor could be used to issue a series of commands with some rudimentary control flow. Batch files had the extension .BAT.

In later releases of RT-11, it was possible to invoke a series of commands using a .COM command file, but they would be executed in sequence with no flow control. Even later, it was possible to execute a series of commands with great control through use of the Indirect Command File Processor (IND), which took .CMD control files as input.

Files with the extension .SAV were a sort of executable. They were known as &quot;save files&quot; because the RT-11 SAVE command could be used to save the contents of memory to a disk file which could be loaded and executed at a later time, allowing any session to be saved.

The SAVE command, along with GET, START, REENTER, EXAMINE and DEPOSIT were basic commands implemented in the KMON. Some commands and utilities were later borrowed in the DOS line of operating systems. These commands include DIR, COPY, RENAME, ASSIGN, CLS, DELETE, TYPE, HELP and others. The FORMAT command was used for physical disk formatting, although it was not capable of creating file system, for which purpose the INIT command was used (analogue of DOS command FORMAT /Q). Most commands supported using wildcards in file names.

Physical device names were specified in the form &#x27;dd{n}:&#x27; where &#x27;dd&#x27; was a two-character alphabetic device name and the optional &#x27;n&#x27; was the unit number (0–7). When the unit number was omitted, unit 0 was assumed. For example, TT: referred to the console terminal, LP: (or LP0:) referred to the parallel line printer, and DX0:, DY1:, DL4: referred to disk volumes (RX01 unit 0, RX02 unit 1, RL01 or RL02 unit 4, respectively). Logical device names consisted of 1–3 alphanumeric characters and were used in the place of a physical device name. This was accomplished using the codice_3 command. For example, one might issue codice_4 which would cause all future references to &#x27;ABC:&#x27; to map to &#x27;DL0:&#x27;. Reserved logical name DK: referred to the current default device. If a device was not included in a file specification, DK: was assumed. Reserved logical name SY: referred to the system device (the device from which the system had been booted).

Later versions of RT-11 allowed specification of up to 64 units (0–77 octal) for certain devices, but the device name was still limited to three alphanumeric characters. This feature was enabled through a SYSGEN selection, and only applied to the DU and LD device handlers. In these two cases, the device name form became &#x27;dnn:&#x27; where &#x27;d&#x27; was &#x27;D&#x27; for the DU device and &#x27;L&#x27; for the LD device, and &#x27;nn&#x27; was 00–77(octal).

===Software===
RT-11 was distributed with utilities for performing many actions. The utilities &quot;DIR&quot;, &quot;DUP&quot;, &quot;PIP&quot; and &quot;FORMAT&quot; were for managing disk volumes. TECO, &quot;EDIT&quot;, and the visual editors &quot;KED&quot; (for the DEC VT100) and &quot;K52&quot; (for the DEC VT52) were used to create and edit source and data files. &quot;MACRO&quot;, &quot;LINK&quot;, and &quot;LIBR&quot; were for building executables. ODT, &quot;VDT&quot; and the SD device were used to debug programs. DEC&#x27;s version of Runoff was for producing documents. Finally, VTCOM was used to connect with and use (or transfer files to and from) another computer system over the phone via a modem.

The system was complete enough to handle many modern personal computing tasks. Productivity software such as LEX-11, a word processing package, and a spreadsheet from Saturn Software, used under other PDP-11 operating systems, also ran on RT-11. Large amounts of free, user-contributed software for RT-11 were available from the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS) including an implementation of C. Although the tools to develop and debug assembly-language programs were provided, other languages including C, Fortran, Pascal, and several versions of BASIC were available from DEC as &quot;layered products&quot; at extra cost. Versions of these and other programming languages were also available from other, third-party, sources. It is even possible to network RT-11 machines using DECNET, the Internet and protocols developed by other, third-party sources.

===Distributions and minimal system configuration===
The RT-11 operating system could be booted from, and perform useful work on, a machine consisting of two 8-inch 250KB floppy disks and 56KB of memory, and could support 8 terminals. Other boot options include the RK05 2.5MB removable hard disk platter, or magnetic tape. Distributions were available pre-installed or on punched tape, magnetic tape, cartridge tape, or floppy disk. A minimal but complete system supporting a single real-time user could run on a single floppy disk and in 8K 16-bit words (16KB) of RAM, including user programs. This was facilitated by support for swapping and overlaying. To realize operation on such small memory system, the keyboard command user interface would be swapped out during the execution of a user&#x27;s program and then swapped into memory upon program termination. The system supported a real-time clock, printing terminal, VT11 vector graphic unit, 16 channel 100 kHz A/D converter with 2 channel D/A, 9600 baud serial port, 16 bit bidirectional boards, etc.

===File system===
RT-11 implemented a simple and fast file system employing six-character filenames with three-character extensions (6.3) encoded in RADIX-50, which packed those nine characters into only three 16-bit words (six bytes). This resulted in allowable filename characters being &#x27;A&#x27;-&#x27;Z&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;-&#x27;z&#x27; forced to upper case, &#x27;0&#x27;-&#x27;9&#x27;, &#x27;$&#x27;, &#x27;%&#x27;, &#x27;*&#x27;. Filenames could be prefixed by a device name to specify a device different to the default DK: device, also encoded in RADIX-50.

All files were contiguous, meaning that each file occupied consecutive blocks (the minimally addressable unit of disk storage, 512 bytes) on the disk. This meant that an entire file could be read (or written) very quickly. A side effect of this file system structure was that, as files were created and deleted on a volume over time, the unused disk blocks would likely not remain contiguous, which could become the limiting factor in creating large files; the remedy was to periodically “squeeze” (or &quot;squish&quot;) a disk to consolidate the unused portions.

Each volume has only one directory which was preallocated at the beginning of the volume. The directory consists of an array of entries, one per file or unallocated space. Each directory entry is 8 (or more) 16-bit words, though a sysgen option allowed extra application-specific storage.

===Compatibility with other DEC operating systems===
Many RT-11 programs (those that did not need specialized peripherals or direct access to the hardware) could be directly executed using the RT=11 RTS (Run-time system) of the RSTS/E timesharing system or under RTEM (RT Emulator) on various releases of both RSX-11 and VMS.

The implementation of DCL for RT-11 increased its compatibility with the other DEC operating systems. Although each operating system had commands and options which were unique to that operating system, there were a number of commands and command options which were common.

==Other PDP-11 operating systems==
DEC also sold RSX-11, a multiuser, multitasking operating system with realtime features, and RSTS/E (originally named RSTS-11) a multiuser time-sharing system, but RT-11 remained the operating system of choice for data acquisition systems where real time response was required. The Unix operating system also became popular, but lacked the real-time features and extremely small size of RT-11.

==Hardware==
RT-11 ran on all members of the DEC PDP-11 family, both Q-Bus- and Unibus-based. In addition, it ran on the Professional Series and the PDT-11 &quot;Programmed Data Terminal&quot; systems, also from DEC. Since the PDP-11 architecture was implemented in replacement products by other companies (E.g., the M100 and family from Mentec), or as reverse-engineered clones in other countries (E.g., the DVK from the Soviet Union), RT-11 runs on these machines as well.

==Peripherals==
Adding driver support for peripherals such as a CalComp plotter, typically involved copying files, and did not require a SYSGEN.

==Compatible operating systems==

===Fuzzball===
Fuzzball, routing software for Internet Protocols, was capable of running RT-11 programs.

===SHAREplus===
HAMMONDsoftware distributed a number of RT-11 compatible operating systems including STAReleven, an early multi-computer system and SHAREplus, a multi-process/multi-user implementation of RT-11 which borrowed some architectural concepts from the VAX/VMS operating system. RT-11 device drivers were required for operation. Transparent device access to other PDP-11s and VAX/VMS were supported with a network option. Limited RSX-11 application compatibility was also available. SHAREplus had its strongest user base in Europe.

===TSX-11===
TSX-11, developed by S&amp;H Computing, was a multi-user, multi-processing implementation of RT-11. The only thing it didn&#x27;t do was handle the boot process, so any TSX-Plus machine was required to boot RT-11 first before running TSX-Plus as a user program. Once TSX-Plus was running, it would take over complete control of the machine from RT-11. It provided true memory protection for users from other users, provided user accounts and maintained account separation on disk volumes and implemented a superset of the RT-11 EMT programmed requests.

S&amp;H wrote the original TSX because &quot;Spending $25K on a computer that could only support one user bugged [founder Harry Sanders]&quot;; the outcome was the initial four-user TSX in 1976. TSX-Plus (released in 1980) was the successor to TSX, released in 1976. The system was popular in the 1980s. RT-11 programs generally ran, unmodified, under TSX-Plus and, in fact, most of the RT-11 utilities were used as-is under TSX-Plus. Device drivers generally required only slight modifications.

Depending on which PDP-11 model and the amount of memory, the system could support a minimum of 12 users (14-18 users on a 2Mb 11/73, depending on workload). The last version of TSX-Plus had TCP/IP support.

==Versions==

===Variants===
Users could choose from variants with differing levels of support for multitasking, memory size, and separate I &amp; D (Instruction and Data) address space:
====Unmapped memory====
* RT-11SJ (Single Job) allowed only one task. This was the initial distribution.
* RT-11BL (Base-line) a stripped down version of SJ that has minimal memory residency and lacks optional features.
* RT-11FB (Foreground/Background) supported two tasks: a high-priority, non-interactive &quot;Foreground&quot; job, and a low-priority, interactive &quot;Background&quot; job.
====Mapped memory====
* RT-11XB single job, does not support I &amp; D separation.
* RT-11XM (eXtended Memory), a superset of FB, provided support for memory beyond 64kb, but required a minicomputer with memory management hardware; distributed from approx. 1975-on. Up to 8 concurrent jobs.
* RT-11ZB single job, supports I &amp; D separation.
* RT-11ZM provided support for systems with Separate Instruction and Data space (such as on the Unibus-based 11/44, 45, 55, 70, 84, and 94 and the Q-Bus-based 11/53, 73, 83, and 93.) Up to 8 concurrent jobs.

Several specialized PDP-11 systems were sold based on RT-11:

* LAB-11 provided an LPS-11 analog peripheral for the collection of laboratory data
* PEAK-11 provided further customization for use with gas chromatographs (analyzing the peaks produced by the GC); data collection ran in RT-11&#x27;s foreground process while the user&#x27;s data analysis programs ran in the background.
* GT4x systems added a VT11 vector graphics peripheral. Several very popular demo programs were provided with these systems including Lunar Lander and a version of Spacewar!.
* GT62 systems added a VS60 vector graphics peripheral (VT11-compatible) in a credenza cabinet.
* GAMMA-11 was a packaged RT-11 and PDP 11/34 system that was one of the first fully integrated Nuclear Medicine systems. It included fast analog/digital converters, 16 bit colour graphical displays, and an extensive software library for development of applications for the purpose of data collection, analysis and display from a nuclear medicine gamma camera.

===Clones in the USSR===

Several clones of RT-11 were made in the USSR:

* RAFOS (РАФОС) – SM EVM
* FOBOS (ФОБОС) – Elektronika 60
* FODOS (ФОДОС)
* RUDOS (РУДОС)
* OS DVK (ОС ДВК) – DVK
* OS BK-11 (ОС БК-11) – Elektronika BK
* MASTER-11 (МАСТЕР-11) – DVK
* NEMIGA OS (НЕМИГА) – Nemiga PK 588

<text>The Sea of Galilee (, Judeo-Aramaic: יַמּא דטבריא, גִּנֵּיסַר, ), also called Lake Tiberias, Genezareth Lake or Kinneret, is a freshwater lake in Israel. It is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second-lowest lake in the world (after the Dead Sea, a salt lake), with its elevation fluctuating between below sea level (depending on rainfall). It is approximately in circumference, about long, and wide. Its area is at its fullest, and its maximum depth is approximately . The lake is fed partly by underground springs, but its main source is the Jordan River, which flows through it from north to south with the outflow controlled by the Degania Dam.

==Geography==
The Sea of Galilee is situated in northeast Israel, between the Golan Heights and the Galilee region, in the Jordan Rift Valley, formed by the separation of the African and Arabian plates. Consequently, the area is subject to earthquakes, and in the past, volcanic activity. This is evident from the abundant basalt and other igneous rocks that define the geology of Galilee.

==Names==

The lake has been called by different names throughout its history, usually depending on the dominant settlement on its shores. With the changing fate of the towns, the lake&#x27;s name also changed.

The modern Hebrew name &quot;Kineret&quot; comes from the Hebrew Bible, where it appears as the &quot;sea of Kineret&quot; in and , and spelled כנרות &quot;Kinerot&quot; in Hebrew in . This name was also found in the scripts of Ugarit, in the Aqhat Epic. As the name of a city, &quot;Kinneret&quot; was listed among the &quot;fenced cities&quot; in . A persistent, though likely erroneous, popular etymology presumes that the name &quot;Kinneret&quot; may originate from the Hebrew word &quot;kinnor&quot; (&quot;harp&quot; or &quot;lyre&quot;), because of the shape of the lake. The scholarly consensus, however, is that the origin of the name is derived from the important Bronze and Iron Age city of Kinneret, excavated at Tell el-&#x27;Oreimeh. The city of Kinneret may have been named after the body of water rather than vice versa, and there is no evidence for the origin of the town&#x27;s name.

All Old and New Testament writers use the term &quot;sea&quot; (Hebrew יָם &quot;yam&quot;, Greek θάλασσα), with the exception of Luke, who calls it &quot;the Lake of Gennesaret&quot; (), from the Greek λίμνη Γεννησαρέτ (&quot;limnē Gennēsaret&quot;), the &quot;Grecized form of Chinnereth&quot;. The Babylonian Talmud as well as Flavius Josephus mention the sea by the name &quot;Sea of Ginosar&quot; after the small fertile plain of Ginosar that lies on its western side. Ginosar is yet another name derived from &quot;Kinneret&quot;.

The word &quot;Galilee&quot; comes from the Hebrew &quot;Haggalil&quot; (הַגָלִיל), which literally means &quot;The District&quot;, a compressed form of &quot;Gelil Haggoyim&quot; &quot;The District of Nations&quot; (Isaiah 8:23). Toward the end of the 1st century CE, the Sea of Galilee became widely known as the &quot;Sea of Tiberias&quot; after the city of Tiberias founded on its western shore in honour of the second Roman emperor, Tiberius. In the New Testament, the term &quot;sea of Galilee&quot; (, &quot;thalassan tēs Galilaias&quot;) is used in the Gospel of Matthew , the Gospel of Mark , and in the Gospel of John as &quot;the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias&quot; (θαλάσσης τῆς Γαλιλαίας τῆς Τιβεριάδος, &quot;thalassēs tēs Galilaias tēs Tiberiados&quot;), the late 1st century CE name. Sea of Tiberias is also the name mentioned in Roman texts and in the Jerusalem Talmud, and it was adopted into Arabic as (بحيرة طبريا), &quot;Lake Tiberias&quot;. Some writers use the spelling &quot;Gallilee&quot;, for example Selah Merrill in a nineteenth century journal article.

From the Umayyad through the Mamluk period, the lake was known in Arabic as &quot;Bahr al-Minya&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Minya&quot;, after the Umayyad &quot;qasr&quot; complex, whose ruins are still visible at Khirbat al-Minya. This is the name used by the medieval Persian and Arab scholars Al-Baladhuri, Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir.

==History==
===Prehistory===
In 1989, remains of a hunter-gatherer site were found under the water at the southern end. Remains of mud huts were found in Ohalo. Nahal Ein Gev, located about east of the lake, contains a village from the late Natufian period. The site is considered one of the first permanent human settlements in the world from a time predating the Neolithic Revolution.

=== Early Iron Age ===
According to Sugimoto (2015), the Iron Age IB (1150–1000 BCE) cities in the northeastern region of the Sea of Galilee likely reflect the activities of the Kingdom of Geshur, mentioned in the Bible. Also, the later Iron Age IIA–B cities here are linked with the southern expansion of the Aram-Damascus kingdom. Among these Galilean cities are Tel Dover, Tel ‘En Gev, Tel Hadar, Tel Bethsaida, and Tel Kinrot.

===Hellenistic and Roman periods===
The Sea of Galilee lies on the ancient Via Maris, which linked Egypt with the northern empires. The Greeks, Hasmoneans, and Romans founded flourishing towns and settlements on the lake including Hippos and Tiberias. Contemporary Roman–Jewish historian Flavius Josephus was so impressed by the area that he wrote, &quot;One may call this place the ambition of Nature&quot;; he also reports a thriving fishing industry at this time, with 230 boats regularly working in the lake. Archaeologists discovered one such boat, nicknamed the Jesus Boat, in 1986.
In the New Testament, much of the ministry of Jesus occurs on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. In those days, there was a continuous ribbon development of settlements and villages around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The Synoptic Gospels of Mark 1:14–20), Matthew 4:18–22), and Luke 5:1–11) describe how Jesus recruited four of his apostles from the shores of the Kinneret: the fishermen Simon and his brother Andrew and the brothers John and James. One of Jesus&#x27; famous teaching episodes, the Sermon on the Mount, is supposed to have been given on a hill overlooking the Kinneret. Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here including his walking on water, calming the storm, the disciples and the miraculous catch of fish, and his feeding five thousand people (in Tabgha). In John&#x27;s Gospel the sea provides the setting for Jesus&#x27; third post-resurrection appearance to his disciples (John 21).

In 135 CE, Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt was put down which was part of the Jewish–Roman wars. The Romans responded by banning all Jews from Jerusalem. The center of Jewish culture and learning shifted to the region of Galilee and the Kinneret, particularly Tiberias. It was in this region that the Jerusalem Talmud was compiled.

===Middle Ages===
The Sea of Galilee&#x27;s importance declined when the Byzantine Empire lost control, and the area came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate and subsequent Islamic empires. The palace of Minya was built by the lake during the reign of al-Walid I (705–715 CE). Apart from Tiberias, the major towns and cities in the area were gradually abandoned. In 1187, Sultan Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin, largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee.

The lake had little importance within the early Ottoman Empire. Tiberias did see a significant revival of its Jewish community in the 16th century but had gradually declined until the city was destroyed in 1660. In the early 18th century, Tiberias was rebuilt by Zahir al-Umar, becoming the center of his rule over Galilee, and seeing also a revival of its Jewish community.

===Early 20th century===
In 1908, Jewish pioneers established the Kinneret Farm at the same time as and next to Moshavat Kinneret in the immediate vicinity of the lake. The farm trained Jewish immigrants in modern farming. One group of youth from the training farm established Kvutzat Degania in 1909–1910, popularly considered as the first kibbutz, another group founded Kvutzat Kinneret in 1913, and yet another the first proper kibbutz, Ein Harod, in 1921, the same year when the first moshav, Nahalal, was established by a group trained at the farm. The Jewish settlements around Kinneret Farm are considered the cradle of the kibbutz culture of early Zionism; Kvutzat Kinneret is the birthplace of Naomi Shemer, buried at the Kinneret Cemetery next to Rachel—two prominent national poets.
In 1917, the British defeated Ottoman Turkish forces and took control of Palestine, while France took control of Syria. In the carve-up of the Ottoman territories between Britain and France, it was agreed that Britain would retain control of Palestine while France would control Syria. This required the allies to fix the border between the Mandatory Palestine and the French Mandate of Syria. The boundary was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920, which drew it across the middle of the lake. However, the commission established by the 1920 treaty redrew the boundary. The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to assign as many water sources as possible to Mandatory Palestine during the demarcating negotiations. The High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had sought full control of the Sea of Galilee. The negotiations led to the inclusion into the Palestine territory of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the River Jordan, Lake Hula, Dan spring, and part of the Yarmouk. The final border approved in 1923 followed a 10-meter wide strip along the lake&#x27;s northeastern shore, cutting the Mandatory Syria (State of Damascus) off from the lake.

The British and French Agreement provided that existing rights over the use of the waters of the River Jordan by the inhabitants of Syria would be maintained; the government of Syria would have the right to erect a new pier at Semakh on Lake Tiberias or jointly use the existing pier; persons or goods passing between the landing-stage on the Lake of Tiberias and Semakh would not be subject to customs regulations, and the Syrian government would have access to the said landing-stage; the inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lakes Huleh, Tiberias and River Jordan, while the government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of lakes.

===State of Israel===
On 15 May 1948, Syria invaded the newborn state of Israel, capturing territory along the Sea of Galilee. Under the 1949 armistice agreement between Israel and Syria, Syria occupied the northeast shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. The agreement stated that the armistice line was &quot;not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements.&quot; Syria remained in possession of the lake&#x27;s northeast shoreline until the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

In the 1950s, Israel formulated a plan to link the Kinneret with the rest of the country&#x27;s water infrastructure via the National Water Carrier, in order to supply the water demand of the growing country. The carrier was completed in 1964. The Israeli plan, which the Arab League opposed while endorsing its own plan to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River, sparked political and sometimes even armed confrontations over the Jordan basin.

==Geology==
The lake lies in the center of the Jordan Valley, in the northern part of the Syrian-African rift. Several directions of tectonic movements characterize the region, mirroring the patterns typical of the entire Syrian-African rift: north–south movements, which started about 20 million years ago; stretching movements in the east–west direction, which began later, at the beginning of the Pleistocene (about 1.8 million years ago), and caused the subsidence of the lake area.

As a result of horizontal shifts in the north–south direction and subsidence of the area, a lake was formed, with an asymmetrical bottom—steeper in the east and a gentler in the west. In the southern part an underwater cliff is present, covered by the lake&#x27;s sediments. The cliff is distinct in the western part and less so in the east.

The Sea of Galilee in its current form was preceded by Lake Lisan, which extended from the northern Sea of Galilee to Hatzeva in the south, more than from the present southernmost point of the lake. Lake Lisan was preceded by Lake Ovadia, a much smaller fresh water lake. Lake Kinneret was formed in its current form less than 20,000 years ago, as a result of tectonic subsidence and the shrinking up of Lake Lisan.

==Archaeology==
In 1986 the Ancient Galilee Boat, also known as the Jesus Boat, was discovered on the northwest shore during a drought when water levels receded. It is an ancient fishing boat from the 1st century AD, and although there is no evidence directly linking the boat to Jesus and his disciples, it nevertheless is an example of the kind of boat that Jesus and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, may have used.

During a routine sonar scan in 2003 (finding published in 2013), archaeologists discovered an enormous conical stone structure. The structure, which has a diameter of around , is made of boulders and stones. The ruins are estimated to be between 2,000 and 12,000 years old and are about underwater. The estimated weight of the monument is over 60,000 tons. Researchers explain that the site resembles early burial sites in Europe and was likely built in the early Bronze Age.

In February 2018, archaeologists discovered seven intact mosaics with Greek inscriptions. One inscription, at five meters one of the longest found to date in western Galilee, gives the names of donors and the names and positions of church officials, including Irenaeus, bishop of Tyre in 445. Another mosaic mentions a woman as a donor to the church&#x27;s construction. This inscription is the first in the region to mention a female donor.

==Water level==
The water level is monitored and regulated. There are three levels at which the alarm is rung:
* The upper red line, below sea level (BSL), where facilities on the shore start being flooded.
* The lower red line, BSL, where pumping should stop.
* The black (low-level) line, BSL, where irreversible damage occurs.

Daily monitoring of the Sea of Galilee&#x27;s water level began in 1969, and the lowest level recorded since then was November 2001, which today constitutes the &quot;black line&quot; of 214.87 meters below sea level (although it is believed that in the first half of the 20th century, the water level had fallen lower than the current black line at times of drought). The Israeli government monitors water levels and publishes the results daily. Increasing water demand in Israel, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as dry winters, have resulted in stress on the lake and a decreasing water line to dangerously low levels at times. The Sea of Galilee is at risk of becoming irreversibly salinized by the salt water springs under the lake, which are held in check by the weight of the freshwater on top of them.

After five years of drought up to 2018, the Sea of Galilee was expected to drop near the black line. In February 2018, the city of Tiberias requested a desalination plant to treat the water coming from the Sea of Galilee and demanded a new water source for the city. March 2018 was the lowest point in water income to the lake since 1927. In September 2018 the Israeli energy and water office announced a project to pour desalinated water from the Mediterranean Sea into the Sea of Galilee using a tunnel. The tunnel is expected to be the largest of its kind in Israel and will transfer half of the Mediterranean desalted water and will move 300 to 500 million cubic meters of water per year. The plan is said to cost five billion shekels.

Since the beginning of the 2018–19 rainy season, the Sea of Galilee has risen considerably. From being near the ecologically dangerous black line of −214.4 m, the level has risen by April 2020 to just below the upper red line, a result of strong rains and a radical decrease in pumping. During the entire 2018–19 rainy season the water level rose by a historical record of , while the 2019–20 winter brought a rise. The Water Authority dug a new canal in order to let of water flow from the lake directly into the Jordan River, bypassing the existing dams system for technical and financial reasons.

==Water use==
The National Water Carrier of Israel, completed in 1964, transports water from the lake to the population centers of Israel, and in the past supplied most of the country&#x27;s drinking water. In 2016 the lake supplied approximately 10% of Israel&#x27;s drinking water needs.

In 1964, Syria attempted construction of a Headwater Diversion Plan that would have blocked the flow of water into the Sea of Galilee, sharply reducing the water flow into the lake. This project and Israel&#x27;s attempt to block these efforts in 1965 were factors which played into regional tensions culminating in the 1967 Six-Day War. During the war, Israel captured the Golan Heights, which contain some of the sources of water for the Sea of Galilee.

Up until the mid-2010s, about of water was pumped through the National Water Carrier each year. Under the terms of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Israel also supplies of water annually from the lake to Jordan. In recent years the Israeli government has made extensive investments in water conservation, reclamation and desalination infrastructure in the country. This has allowed it to significantly reduce the amount of water pumped from the lake annually in an effort to restore and improve its ecological environment, as well as respond to some of the most extreme drought conditions in hundreds of years affecting the lake&#x27;s intake basin since 1998. Therefore, it was expected that in 2016 only about of water would be drawn from the lake for Israeli domestic consumption, a small fraction of the amount typically drawn from the lake over the previous decades.

==Tourism==

Tourism around the Sea of Galilee is an important economic segment. Historical and religious sites in the region draw both local and foreign tourists. The Sea of Galilee is an attraction for Christian pilgrims who visit Israel to see the places where Jesus performed miracles according to the New Testament. Alonzo Ketcham Parker, a 19th-century American traveler, called visiting the Sea of Galilee &quot;a &#x27;fifth gospel&#x27; which one read devoutly, his heart overflowing with quiet joy&quot;.

In April 2011, Israel unveiled a hiking trail in Galilee for Christian pilgrims, called the &quot;Jesus Trail&quot;. It includes a network of footpaths, roads and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples. It ends at Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus expounded his teachings. Another key attraction is the site where the Sea of Galilee&#x27;s water flows into the Jordan River, to which thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to be baptized every year.

Israel&#x27;s most well-known open water swim race, the Kinneret Crossing, is held every year in September, drawing thousands of open water swimmers to participate in competitive and noncompetitive events. Tourists also partake in the building of rafts on &quot;Lavnun Beach&quot;, called Rafsodia. Here many different age groups work together to build a raft with their bare hands and then sail that raft across the sea. Other economic activities include fishing in the lake and agriculture, particularly bananas, dates, mangoes, grapes and olives in the fertile belt of land surrounding it.

The Turkish Aviators Monument, erected during the Ottoman era, stands near Kibbutz Ha&#x27;on on the lakeshore, commemorating the Turkish pilots whose monoplanes crashed en route to Jerusalem.

==Ecology==
The warm waters of the Sea of Galilee support various flora and fauna, which have supported a significant commercial fishery for more than two millennia. Local flora include various reeds along most of the shoreline as well as phytoplankton. Fauna include zooplankton, benthos and a number of fish species such as &quot;Mirogrex terraesanctae&quot;. The Fishing and Agricultural Division of the Ministry of Water and Agriculture of Israel lists 10 families of fish living in the lake, with a total of 27 species – 19 native and 8 introduced species. Local fishermen talk of four types of fish: &quot;مشط musht&quot; (tilapia); sardin (the Kinneret bleak, &quot;Mirogrex terraesanctae&quot;); &quot;بني biny&quot; or Jordan barbel, &quot;Luciobarbus longiceps&quot; (barb-like); and North African sharptooth catfish (&quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot;). The tilapia species include the Galilean tilapia (&quot;Sarotherodon galilaeus&quot;), the blue tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis aureus&quot;), and the redbelly tilapia (&quot;Tilapia zillii&quot;). Fish caught commercially include &quot;Tristramella simonis&quot; and the Galilean tilapia, locally called &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s fish&quot;. In 2005, of tilapia were caught by local fishermen. This dropped to in 2009 because of overfishing. A fish species that is unique to the lake, &quot;Tristramella sacra&quot;, used to spawn in the marsh and has not been seen since the 1990s droughts. Conservationists fear this species may have become extinct.

Low water levels in drought years have stressed the lake&#x27;s ecology. This may have been aggravated by over-extraction of water for either the National Water Carrier to supply other parts of Israel or, since 1994, for the supply of water to Jordan. Droughts of the early and mid-1990s dried out the marshy northern margin of the lake. It is hoped that drastic reductions in the amount of water pumped through the National Water Carrier will help restore the lake&#x27;s ecology over the span of several years.

The lake, with its immediate surrounds, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins and non-breeding griffon vultures as well as many wintering waterbirds, including marbled teals, great crested grebes, grey herons, great white egrets, great cormorants and black-headed gulls.

<doc id="69311" wikidata="Q8356" url="?curid=69311" title="Valladolid">
<text>Valladolid () is a municipality in Spain and the primary seat of government and &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is also the capital of the province of Valladolid. It has a population of 300,618 people (2024 est.).

The city is located roughly in the centre of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s Meseta Central, at the confluence of the Pisuerga and Esgueva rivers before they join the Duero, surrounded by winegrowing areas. The area was settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic Vaccaei people, and then by Romans themselves. The settlement was purportedly founded after 1072, growing in prominence within the context of the Crown of Castile, being endowed with fairs and different institutions such as a collegiate church, University (1241), Royal Court and Chancellery and a royal mint.

Valladolid was the location of Europe&#x27;s first moral debate on the treatment of indigenous people and is the city in which Christopher Columbus died. It was briefly the capital of Habsburg Spain between 1601 and 1606. The city then declined until the arrival of the railway in the 19th century, and with its industrialisation into the 20th century.

The old town is made up of a variety of historic houses, palaces, churches, plazas, avenues and parks, and includes the National Museum of Sculpture as well as the houses of Zorrilla and Cervantes which are open as museums. Notably, the city&#x27;s Plaza Mayor was the first of its kind in Spain, dating back to the thirteenth century. It was eventually used as a model for similar plazas such as Plaza Mayor in Madrid.

Among the events that are held each year in the city are the famous Holy Week, the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships, and the Valladolid International Film Festival (Seminci). In 2019, Valladolid was recognised as a City of Film as part of UNESCO&#x27;s Creative Cities Network. Together with another 15 surrounding municipalities, it belongs to an urban community of around 404,000 inhabitants.

== Name ==
There is no direct evidence for the origin of the modern name of Valladolid.

It is mentioned as &quot;Valledolit&quot; in the &quot;Primera Crónica General&quot;; earlier documented variants include &quot;Valledolidi&quot;, &quot;Valleolide&quot; (1092) and &quot;Valleolit&quot;, &quot;Valleoleti&quot;, &quot;Valleoliti&quot; (1095).

One widely held etymological theory suggests that the modern name &quot;Valladolid&quot; derives from the Celtiberian language expression , meaning &quot;valley of waters&quot;, referring to the confluence of rivers in the area. Another theory suggests that the name derives from the Arabic expression (, ), which is the Arabic exonym currently used and means &#x27;city of al-Walid&#x27;, referring to Al-Walid I. Yet a third claims that it derives from , meaning &#x27;valley of the olives&#x27;; however, no olive trees are found in that terrain. Instead, innumerable pine trees abound in the south part of the city. The gastronomy reflects the importance of the (pine nut) as a local product, rather than olives. In texts from the Middle Ages the town is called &quot;Vallisoletum&quot;, meaning &#x27;sunny valley&#x27;, and inhabitants are still called today (male) and (female).

The city is also popularly called , a nickname whose origin is not clear, but may refer to knights in the service of Joan of Arc, known as . Another theory is that comes from the fact that Pozzolana cement was sold there, the only city in Spain that sold it.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Valladolid is located at roughly 735 metres above sea level, at the centre of the &quot;Meseta Norte&quot;, the plateau drained by the Duero river basin covering a major part of the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The primitive urban core was built &quot;ex novo&quot; in the 11th century on a small elevation near the confluence of the Esgueva with the Pisuerga, on the left-bank of the latter river. The city of Valladolid currently lies on both banks of the Pisuerga, a major right-bank tributary of the Douro.

Besides the main territory on which the city lies, the municipality also includes two exclaves: Navabuena (5,129 hectares, hosting the ) and El Rebollar (400 hectares).

=== Climate ===

The city of Valladolid experiences a continentalized hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Doak&quot;) with influences of a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;BSak&quot;). Valladolid&#x27;s climate features cool and windy winters due to altitude and the inland location of the city. Fog is very typical in the morning during winter. Winters experience occasional snow and low temperatures below freezing during cold fronts. Valladolid&#x27;s climate is influenced by the distance from the sea and its higher altitude.

Valladolid is drier than Spain&#x27;s northern coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is and the average annual relative humidity is 64%.

== History ==

=== Precedents ===
The Vaccaei were a Celtic tribe, the first people documented as a stable presence on the sector of the middle valley of the River Duero.

Remains of Celtiberian and of a Roman camp have been excavated near the city. The nucleus of the city was originally located in the area of the current San Miguel y el Rosarillo square and was surrounded by a palisade. Proofs of the existence of three ancient lines of walls have been found.

After the Muslim invasion in Spain in 711, the Christian kings moved the population of the Douro basin into more easily defended areas and deliberately created a no man&#x27;s land as a buffer zone against Muslims from the south, which barely had presence in the area. The area was reconquered by Alfonso I in the eighth century, but because of it being close to the borders it had small population until the X century, when the Douro basin was secured by the Christians after the battle of Simancas.

=== Repopulation and growth ===
In 1072 Alfonso VI of León and Castile gifted the Lordship of Valladolid to Count Pedro Ansúrez. Entrusted with the repopulation of the area, Ansúrez led the foundation of Valladolid along with his wife . By 1084 the project for the foundation of the settlement was already underway. Ansúrez built a palace (now lost) and La Antigua church. Eylo founded three hospitals and the Churches of San Sebastián and San Nicolás. Both co-founded the church of Santa María. Valladolid was repopulated by people from the lands of Carrión and Saldaña.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Valladolid grew rapidly, favoured by the commercial privileges granted by the kings Alfonso VIII and Alfonso X.

=== Early modern period ===

In 1469, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon were married in the city; by the 15th century Valladolid was the residence of the kings of Castile. In 1506, Christopher Columbus died in Valladolid &quot;still convinced that he had reached the Indies&quot; in a house that is now a museum dedicated to him.

From 1554 to 1559, Joanna of Austria, sister of Philip II, served as regent, establishing herself in Valladolid, with the latter becoming the political center of the Hispanic Monarchy by that time. She favoured the Ebolist Party, one of the two leading factions of the Court of Philip II, in competition with the &quot;albistas&quot;. The Reformation took hold in some parts of the city where Protestant circles appeared presumably around the leading figure of Augustino de Cazalla, an adviser of Joanna. Ensuing &quot;autos de fe&quot; against the Protestant sects took place in 1559 in Valladolid. A catastrophic fire in 1561 destroyed a portion of the city.

During 1550–1551 the town held the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of the indigenous people by conquerors.


Valladolid was granted the status of city in 1596, also becoming a bishopric.

In the midst of the reign of Philip III, Valladolid briefly served as the capital of the Hispanic Monarchy between 1601 and 1606 under the auspice of the Duke of Lerma, &quot;valido&quot; of Philip III. Lerma and his network had bought plots in Valladolid before in order to sell those to the Crown. Promoted by Lerma, the decision on moving the capital from Madrid to Valladolid has been portrayed as case of a (double) real estate speculative scheme, as Lerma had bought housing in Madrid as the prices plummeted when the capital was moved from the city. After a plague in Valladolid, Lerma suggested the King to go back to Madrid, earning a hefty profit when the royal court returned and prices went up again.

The city was again damaged by a flood of the rivers Pisuerga and Esgueva.

=== Contemporary history ===
From 1950 onwards Valladolid became an important industrial centre. This was the context in which companies such as ENDASA (1950), FASA (1954), TECNAUTO (1956) and SAVA (1957) were created. The city was declared as a &quot;Polo de Desarrollo Industrial&quot; (&quot;Pole for Industrial Development&quot;) in 1964. During the 1960 and early 1970s the city attracted many immigrants, chiefly coming from the province of Valladolid and neighbouring provinces. The city started to expand across the western bank of the Pisuerga in the early 1960s.

In the context of the fraught process for the creation of the autonomous community of Castile and León (completed in 1983), Valladolid vied for the condition of regional capital, competing with other cities, most notably creating a sense of &quot;antagonism&quot; with Burgos. Although the capital was not explicitly enshrined in the from 1983, Valladolid was designated in 1987 as the &quot;de jure&quot; seat of the executive and legislative institutions (the Junta of Castile and León and the Cortes of Castile and León).

25 June 2024, the church de la Vera Cruz built in 1581 broke down, causing dust to encircle the whole city. This accident was supposedly due to renovation works.

===Jewish History===
Historically, a Jewish community existed in Valladolid. There was most likely Jewish life in Valladolid during the Arab period, but the first documentation where Jews are mentioned as living in the city dates to 1221. In 1288, Sancho IV prohibited Jews from acquiring land in Valladolid and the surrounding area. In 1322, Christians were prohibited from being treated by Jewish doctors, and could not attend Jewish or Moorish weddings. Furthermore, Jews were barred from positions of public office. In the early 15th century, the Laws of Valladolid were passed, a series of anti-Jewish legislation. These laws stripped the Jews of Valladolid of their autonomy, which included the right to have their own court system. Additionally, Jews and Moors were prohibited from leaving Castille. In 1432, however, officials in Valladolid met with Don Abraham Benveniste in the Jewish quarter of the city, and agreed to restore Jewish autonomy. Converso poet Juan de Valladolid wrote poems criticizing treatment of Jews in Valladolid. Jewish life in Valladolid was nonexistent in the 16th century, after the expulsion of the Jews.

== Government and administration ==
Valladolid is a municipality, the basic local administrative division in Spain. The Ayuntamiento de Valladolid is the body charged with the municipal government and administration. The Plenary of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is formed by 27 elected municipal councillors, who in turn invest the mayor. The last municipal election took place on 26 May 2019. Since 2015, Óscar Puente (PSOE) serves as Mayor. He renewed his spell for a second mandate following the 2019 election.

== Education ==

Education management and policing in Valladolid depends on the Ministry of Education of the Government of Castile and León, the department responsible for the education at the regional level, both at the university and non-university level.

=== Universities ===

==== University of Valladolid ====

The University of Valladolid (UVA) was founded in 1241 by Alfonso VIII of Castille. It is one of the oldest universities in the world. It has four campuses around the city (Huerta del Rey, Centro, Río Esgueva and Miguel Delibes) as well as another three campuses scattered around the wider region of Castile and León (Palencia, Soria and Segovia). Spread over 25 colleges and their associated centers, about 2000 teachers give classes to more than 23,800 students enrolled in 2011.

It also features the 25 centers, a number of administrative buildings such as the Palacio de Santa Cruz, where the rector, and the Museum of the University of Valladolid (MUVa), The House of Students, featuring the other administrative services mainly related to international relations, or CTI (Center for Information Technology), both located in the basement of the University Residence Alfonso VIII, next to the old Faculty of Science.

==== Miguel de Cervantes European University ====

The Miguel de Cervantes European University (&quot;Universidad Europea Miguel de Cervantes&quot;; UEMC) is a private university with roughly 1,500 students. It is spread over three faculties: Social Sciences, Law and Economics, Health and the Polytechnic School. It has later expanded its campus with a new facility doubling the area devoted to teaching and research. It also has a dental clinic and a library.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===

Lycée Français de Castilla y León, a French international school, is near Valladolid, in Laguna de Duero. San Juán Bautista de La Salle School, a High Private College in Valladolid. Integral and Superior Education. Integrates Kindergarten, Primary School and High School.

== Architecture ==
12th century romanesque architecture is present in the belltowers of the churches of Santa María La Antigua and .

The School of San Gregorio has been highlighted as an outstanding example Late Gothic architecture (Isabelline gothic). The Gothic style is also present in the Church of San Pablo (featuring also Renaissance and plateresque elements). The late 15th century Palace of Santa Cruz (current seat of the rectorate of the University of Valladolid) has been noted as a pioneer example of Renaissance art in Spain.

The monumental Plaza Mayor, considered the first in its genre in Spain, was projected by by 1561–62, following the great fire of 1561. The porticoed plaza distinctly employs stone columns with wooden footings and lintels. The design of the façades of the &quot;plaza&quot; served as template for a number of buildings in nearby streets.

The unfinished Cathedral of Valladolid, initially projected by Juan de Herrera in the 16th century (intending to follow a Mannerist style) experienced protracted building works owing to financial problems and its main body was not opened until 1668. Decades later, in 1730, finished the work on the main front.

The Teatro Lope de Vega is a theater built in the classical style in 1861 and now very run-down. There has been recent controversy over whether the city should pay to restore it. The Campo Grande, a large public park located in the heart of the city, dates back to 1787. Architect left a key imprint in the city&#x27;s outline, authoring many housing projects in the late 19th to early 20th century, with a good number of his buildings still standing. Standout examples of Eclectic architecture from the late 19th and early 20th century in the city include the neoplateresque , the , (defaced in a revamp undergone in the 1960s), and the neobaroque new building for the university.

The Francoist dictatorship left an example of &quot;Imperial Architecture&quot; of neo-herrerian (or &quot;escurialense&quot;) style in the building for the &quot;Seminario Menor&quot;, clearly influenced by the Spanish capital&#x27;s Ministry of the Air.

The city preserves the residences of iconic city neighbors such as the Casa de Cervantes and the house of José Zorrilla. The Christopher Columbus House-Museum, by contrast, is a 1960s reconstruction. 
== Population ==
As of 2024, the population of the city of Valladolid proper was 300,618, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be 406,923. The most important municipalities of the urban area are (after Valladolid itself) Laguna de Duero and Boecillo on the south, Arroyo de la Encomienda, Zaratán, Simancas and Villanubla on the west, Cigales and Santovenia de Pisuerga on the north, and Tudela de Duero and Cistérniga on the east.

After new neighbourhoods developed in recent decades (one example would be Covaresa), the high prices in the municipality led young people to buy properties in towns around the city, so the population has fallen in Valladolid but is growing fast in other peri-urban areas (for example, Arroyo de la Encomienda or Zaratán).

== Economy ==

Valladolid is a major economic center in Spain. The automotive industry is one of the major motors of the city&#x27;s economy since the founding of FASA-Renault in 1953 for the assembling of Renault-branded vehicles, which would later become Renault España. Four years later, in 1957, Sava was founded and started producing commercial vehicles. Sava would later be absorbed by Pegaso and since 1990 by the Italian truck manufacturer Iveco. Together with the French tire manufacturer Michelin, Renault and Iveco form the most important industrial companies of the city.

Besides the automotive and automotive auxiliary industries, other important industrial sectors are food processing (with local companies like Acor and Queserías Entrepinares and facilities of multinationals like Cadbury, Lactalis or Lesaffre), metallurgy (Lingotes Especiales, Saeta die Casting...), chemical and printing. In total 22 013 people were employed in 2007 in industrial workplaces, representing 14.0% of total workers.

The main economic sector of Valladolid in terms of employment is however the service sector, which employs 111,988 people, representing 74.2% of Valladolid workers affiliated to Social Security.

The construction sector employed 15,493 people in 2007, representing 10.3% of total workers.

Finally, agriculture is a tiny sector in the city which only employs 2,355 people (1.5% of the total). The predominant crops are wheat, barley and sugar beet.

Top 10 companies by turnover in 2013 in € million were: Renault (4 596), Michelin (2 670), IVECO (1 600), the Valladolid-based supermarket chain Grupo El Árbol (849), cheese processing Queserías Entrepinares (204), sugar processing Acor (201), service group Grupo Norte (174), automobile auxiliary company Faurecia-Asientos de Castilla y León (143), Sada (129) and Hipereco (108).

== Transportation ==

=== Public transport ===

Urban transit system was based on the Valladolid tram network from 1881 to 1933. A public urban bus system started in 1928, managed by different private tenders until 1982, when the service was taken over by the municipality. Today the public company AUVASA operates the network, with 22 regular lines and 5 late night lines.

=== High-speed rail ===
Valladolid-Campo Grande railway station is integrated into the Spanish high-speed network AVE. The Madrid–Valladolid high-speed rail line was inaugurated on 22 December 2007. The line links both cities, crossing the Sierra de Guadarrama through the namesake tunnel, the fourth longest train tunnel in Europe. Valladolid will become the hub for all AVE lines connecting the north and north-west of Spain with the rest of the country. Trainsets used on this line include S-114 (max speed 250 km/h (155 mph)), S-130 (Patito, max speed 250 km/h (155 mph)) and the S102 (Pato, max speed 320 km/h or 199 mph). This line connects the city with Madrid, which can be reached in 56 minutes.

=== Roads ===

Several highways connect the city to the rest of the country.

=== Airport ===
The airport serving the city is not located within the municipal limits, but in Villanubla. The airport has connections to Barcelona, Málaga, and the Canary Islands.

== Culture ==
=== Languages ===

Spanish is the only official language throughout the city. Valladolid stands out for having been the residence of the author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Miguel de Cervantes, as well as authors such as José Zorrilla or Miguel Delibes and the thrust of its University. The province stands out for receiving a significant number of people who want to learn the Spanish language (Language tourism).

=== Easter ===

Holy Week (&quot;Semana Santa&quot; in Spanish) holds one of the best known Catholic traditions in Valladolid. The Good Friday processions are considered an exquisite and rich display of Castilian religious sculpture. On this day, in the morning, members of the brotherhoods on horseback make a poetic proclamation throughout the city. The &quot;Sermon of the Seven Words&quot; is spoken in Plaza Mayor Square. In the afternoon, thousands of people take part in the Passion Procession, comprising 31 pasos (religious statues), most of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The last statue in the procession is the Virgen de las Angustias, and her return to the church is one of the most emotional moments of the celebrations, with the Salve Popular sung in her honour.

Easter is one of the most spectacular and emotional fiestas in Valladolid. Religious devotion, art, colour and music combine in acts to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ: the processions. Members of the different Easter brotherhoods, dressed in their characteristic robes, parade through the streets carrying religious statues (pasos) to the sound of drums and music.

=== Seminci ===

The city is also host to one of the foremost (and oldest) international film festivals, the &quot;Semana Internacional de Cine de Valladolid (Seminci)&quot;, founded in 1956. Valladolid, through various loopholes in state censorship, was able to present films that would otherwise have been impossible to see in Spain. An award or an enthusiastic reception from the audience and the critics meant, on numerous occasions, that the official state bodies gave the go-ahead to certain films which Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime considered out of line with their ideology.

Even after the death of Franco in 1975, Valladolid continued to be the &quot;testing ground&quot; for films which had been banned. For example, the premiere in Spain of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; at the 1975 festival is still recalled as a landmark.

=== Local cuisine ===


Although an inland province, fish is commonly consumed, some brought from the Cantabrian Sea. Fish like red bream and hake are a major part of Valladolid&#x27;s cuisine.

The main speciality of Valladolid is, however, lechazo (suckling baby lamb). The lechazo is slowly roasted in a wood oven and served with salad.

Valladolid also offers a great assortment of wild mushrooms. Asparagus, endive and beans can also be found. Some legumes, like white beans and lentils are particularly good. Pine nuts are also produced in great quantities.

Sheep cheese from Villalón de Campos, the famous pata de mulo (mule&#x27;s foot) is usually unripened (fresh), but if it is cured the ripening process brings out such flavour that it can compete with the best sheep cheeses in Spain.

Valladolid has a bread to go with every dish, like the delicious cuadros from Medina del Campo, the muffins, the pork-scratching bread and the lechuguinos, with a pattern of concentric circles that resemble a head of lettuce.

The pastries and baked goods from the province of Valladolid are well-known, specially St. Mary&#x27;s ring-shaped pastries, St. Claire&#x27;s sponge cakes, pine nut balls and cream fritters.

Valladolid is also a producer of wines. The ones that fall under the Designation of Origin Cigales are very good. White wines from Rueda and red wines from Ribera del Duero are known for their quality.

== Sports ==

Valladolid&#x27;s main association football club is Real Valladolid, nicknamed &quot;Pucela&quot;, who play in the country&#x27;s second-tier league, LaLiga Hypermotion. Players who went on to play for the Spain national football team include Fernando Hierro, José Luis Caminero and Rubén Baraja. The municipally-owned stadium where Real Valladolid play their home matches, the Estadio Nuevo José Zorrilla, was built as a venue for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and in preparation staged the 1982 Copa del Rey Final.

CBC Valladolid is the city&#x27;s new basketball team since the dissolution of CB Valladolid in 2015. Arvydas Sabonis and Oscar Schmidt played for the latter team. Currently playing in the Liga LEB Oro, the CBC Valladolid matches are held at the Polideportivo Pisuerga.

In handball Valladolid was represented by BM Valladolid of the Liga ASOBAL. They won 2 King&#x27;s Cup, 1 ASOBAL Cup and 1 EHF Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. After the disappearance of this club, BM Atlético Valladolid was born, which also competes in the Liga ASOBAL. They play their games at the Polideportivo Huerta del Rey.

Rugby union is a very popular sport in Valladolid. VRAC and CR El Salvador, with 34 and 27 titles respectively, have dominated Spanish rugby for the last decades. They play their matches at Estadio Pepe Rojo.

The Plaza de toros de Valladolid, a bullring, opened on 29 September 1890, and it has a capacity of 11,000.
