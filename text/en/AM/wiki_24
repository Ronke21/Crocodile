<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Helios (; ; Homeric Greek: ) is the god who personifies the Sun. His name is also Latinized as Helius, and he is often given the epithets Hyperion (&quot;the one above&quot;) and Phaethon (&quot;the shining&quot;). Helios is often depicted in art with a radiant crown and driving a horse-drawn chariot through the sky. He was a guardian of oaths and also the god of sight. Though Helios was a relatively minor deity in Classical Greece, his worship grew more prominent in late antiquity thanks to his identification with several major solar divinities of the Roman period, particularly Apollo and Sol. The Roman Emperor Julian made Helios the central divinity of his short-lived revival of traditional Roman religious practices in the 4th century AD.

Helios figures prominently in several works of Greek mythology, poetry, and literature, in which he is often described as the son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia and brother of the goddesses Selene (the Moon) and Eos (the Dawn). Helios&#x27; most notable role in Greek mythology is the story of his mortal son Phaethon. In the Homeric epics, his most notable role is the one he plays in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where Odysseus&#x27; men despite his warnings impiously kill and eat Helios&#x27;s sacred cattle that the god kept at Thrinacia, his sacred island. Once informed of their misdeed, Helios in wrath asks Zeus to punish those who wronged him, and Zeus agreeing strikes their ship with a thunderbolt, killing everyone, except for Odysseus himself, the only one who had not harmed the cattle, and was allowed to live.

Due to his position as the sun, he was believed to be an all-seeing witness and thus was often invoked in oaths. He also played a significant part in ancient magic and spells. In art he is usually depicted as a beardless youth in a chiton holding a whip and driving his quadriga, accompanied by various other celestial gods such as Selene, Eos, or the stars. In ancient times he was worshipped in several places of ancient Greece, though his major cult centres were the island of Rhodes, of which he was the patron god, Corinth and the greater Corinthia region. The Colossus of Rhodes, a gigantic statue of the god, adorned the port of Rhodes until it was destroyed in an earthquake, thereupon it was not built again.

== Name ==
The Greek noun ( , , , ) (from earlier /hāwelios/) is the inherited word for the Sun from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*&quot; which is cognate with Latin &quot;sol&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;surya&quot;, Old English &quot;swegl&quot;, Old Norse sól, Welsh &quot;haul&quot;, Avestan &quot;hvar&quot;, etc. The Doric and Aeolic form of the name is , &quot;Hálios&quot;. In Homeric Greek his name is spelled , &quot;Ēélios&quot;, with the Doric spelling of that being , &quot;Aélios&quot;. In Cretan it was (&quot;Abélios&quot;) or (&quot;Awélios&quot;). The Greek view of gender was also present in their language. Ancient Greek had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), so when an object or a concept was personified as a deity, it inherited the gender of the relevant noun; &quot;helios&quot; is a masculine noun, so the god embodying it is also by necessity male. The female offspring of Helios were called Heliades, the male Heliadae.

The author of the &quot;Suda&quot; lexicon tried to etymologically connect &quot;&quot; to the word , &quot;aollízesthai&quot;, &quot;coming together&quot; during the daytime, or perhaps from , &quot;aleaínein&quot;, &quot;warming&quot;. Plato in his dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot; suggested several etymologies for the word, proposing among others a connection, via the Doric form of the word &quot;halios&quot;, to the words , &quot;halízein&quot;, meaning collecting men when he rises, or from the phrase , &quot;aeí heileín&quot;, &quot;ever turning&quot; because he always turns the earth in his course.

Doric Greek retained Proto-Greek long *ā as α, while Attic changed it in most cases, including in this word, to η.
&quot;Cratylus&quot; and the etymologies Plato gives are contradicted by modern scholarship. From &quot;helios&quot; comes the modern English prefix &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;pertaining to the Sun&quot;, used in compounds word such as &quot;heliocentrism&quot;, &quot;aphelion&quot;, &quot;heliotropium&quot;, &quot;heliophobia&quot; (fear of the sun) and &quot;heliolatry&quot; (&quot;sun-worship&quot;).

== Origins ==
Helios most likely is Proto-Indo-European in origin. Walter Burkert wrote that &quot;... Helios, the sun god, and Eos-Aurora, the goddess of the dawn, are of impeccable Indo-European lineage both in etymology and in their status as gods&quot; and might have played a role in Proto-Indo-European poetry. The imagery surrounding a chariot-driving solar deity is likely Indo-European in origin. Greek solar imagery begins with the gods Helios and Eos, who are brother and sister, and who become in the day-and-night-cycle the day (&quot;hemera&quot;) and the evening (&quot;hespera&quot;), as Eos accompanies Helios in his journey across the skies. At night, he pastures his steeds and travels east in a golden boat. In them evident is the Indo-European grouping of a sun god and his sister, as well as an association with horses.

Helen of Troy&#x27;s name is thought to share the same etymology as Helios, and she may express an early alternate personification of the sun among Hellenic peoples. Helen might have originally been considered to be a daughter of the Sun, as she hatched from an egg and was given tree worship, features associated with the Proto-Indo-European Sun Maiden; in surviving Greek tradition however Helen is never said to be Helios&#x27; daughter, instead being the daughter of Zeus.

It has been suggested that the Phoenicians brought over the cult of their patron god Baal among others (such as Astarte) to Corinth, who was then continued to be worshipped under the native name/god Helios, similarly to how Astarte was worshipped as Aphrodite, and the Phoenician Melqart was adopted as the sea-god Melicertes/Palaemon, who also had a significant cult in the isthmus of Corinth.

Helios&#x27; journey on a chariot during the day and travel with a boat in the ocean at night possibly reflects the Egyptian sun god Ra sailing across the skies in a barque to be reborn at dawn each morning anew; additionally, both gods, being associated with the sun, were seen as the &quot;Eye of Heaven&quot;.

== Description ==

Helios is the son of Hyperion and Theia, or Euryphaessa, or Basileia, and the only brother of the goddesses Eos and Selene. If the order of mention of the three siblings is meant to be taken as their birth order, then out of the four authors that give him and his sisters a birth order, two make him the oldest child, one the middle, and the other the youngest. Helios was not among the regular and more prominent deities, rather he was a more shadowy member of the Olympian circle, despite the fact that he was among the most ancient. From his lineage, Helios might be described as a second generation Titan. He is associated with harmony and order, both literally in the sense of the movement of celestial bodies and metaphorically in the sense of bringing order to society.

Helios is usually depicted as a handsome young man crowned with the shining aureole of the Sun, which traditionally had twelve rays, symbolising the twelve months of the year. Beyond his Homeric Hymn, not many texts describe his physical appearance; Euripides describes him as &quot;&quot; (khrysо̄pós) meaning &quot;golden-eyed/faced&quot; or &quot;beaming like gold&quot;, Mesomedes of Crete writes that he has golden hair, and Apollonius Rhodius that he has light-emitting, golden eyes. According to Augustan poet Ovid, he dressed in tyrian purple robes and sat on a throne of bright emeralds. In ancient artefacts (such as coins, vases, or reliefs) he is presented as a beautiful, full-faced youth with wavy hair, wearing a crown adorned with the sun&#x27;s rays.

Helios is said to drive a golden chariot drawn by four horses: Pyrois (&quot;The Fiery One&quot;, not to be confused with Pyroeis, one of the five naked-eye planets known to ancient Greek and Roman astronomers), Aeos (&quot;He of the Dawn&quot;), Aethon (&quot;Blazing&quot;), and Phlegon (&quot;Burning&quot;). In a Mithraic invocation, Helios&#x27;s appearance is given as thus:

A god is then summoned. He is described as &quot;a youth, fair to behold, with fiery hair, clothed in a white tunic and a scarlet cloak and wearing a fiery crown.&quot; He is named as &quot;Helios, lord of heaven and earth, god of gods.&quot;

As mentioned above, the imagery surrounding a chariot-driving solar deity is likely Indo-European in origin and is common to both early Greek and Near Eastern religions.

Helios is seen as both a personification of the Sun and the fundamental creative power behind it, and as a result is often worshiped as a god of life and creation. His literal &quot;light&quot; is often assorted with a metaphorical vitality, and other ancient texts give him the epithet &quot;gracious&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The comic playwright Aristophanes describes Helios as &quot;the horse-guider, who fills the plain of the earth with exceeding bright beams, a mighty deity among gods and mortals.&quot; One passage recorded in the Greek Magical Papyri says of Helios, &quot;the earth flourished when you shone forth and made the plants fruitful when you laughed and brought to life the living creatures when you permitted.&quot; He is said to have helped create animals out of primeval mud.

== Mythology ==
=== God of the Sun ===
==== Rising and Setting ====
Helios was envisioned as a god driving his chariot from east to west each day, rising from the Oceanus River and setting in the west under the earth. It is unclear as to whether this journey means that he travels through Tartarus.

Athenaeus in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; relates that, at the hour of sunset, Helios climbs into a great cup of solid gold in which he passes from the Hesperides in the farthest west to the land of the Ethiops, with whom he passes the dark hours. According to Athenaeus, Mimnermus said that in the night Helios travels eastwards with the use of a bed (also created by Hephaestus) in which he sleeps, rather than a cup, as attested in the &quot;Titanomachy&quot; in the 8th century BCE. Aeschylus describes the sunset as such:

Athenaeus adds that &quot;Helios gained a portion of toil for all his days&quot;, as there is no rest for either him or his horses.

Although the chariot is usually said to be the work of Hephaestus, Hyginus states that it was Helios himself who built it. His chariot is described as golden, or occasionally &quot;rosy&quot;, and pulled by four white horses. The Horae, goddesses of the seasons, are part of his retinue and help him yoke his chariot. His sister Eos is said to have not only opened the gates for Helios, but would often accompany him as well. In the extreme east and west were said to be people who tended to his horses, for whom summer was perpetual and fruitful.

==== Disrupted schedule ====
On several instances in mythology the normal solar schedule is disrupted; he was ordered not to rise for three days during the conception of Heracles, and made the winter days longer in order to look upon Leucothoe. Athena&#x27;s birth was a sight so impressive that Helios halted his steeds and stayed still in the sky for a long while, as heaven and earth both trembling at the newborn goddess&#x27; sight.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Hera who supports the Greeks, makes him set earlier than usual against his will during battle, and later still during the same war, after his sister Eos&#x27;s son Memnon was killed, she made him downcast, causing his light to fade, so she could be able to freely steal her son&#x27;s body undetected by the armies, as he consoled his sister in her grief over Memnon&#x27;s death.

It was said that summer days are longer due to Helios often stopping his chariot mid-air to watch from above nymphs dancing during the summer, and sometimes he is late to rise because he lingers with his consort. If the other gods wish so, Helios can be hastened on his daily course when they wish it to be night.

When Zeus desired to sleep with Alcmene, he made one night last threefold, hiding the light of the Sun, by ordering Helios not to rise for those three days. Satirical author Lucian of Samosata dramatized this myth in one of his &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;.

While Heracles was travelling to Erytheia to retrieve the cattle of Geryon for his tenth labour, he crossed the Libyan desert and was so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Almost immediately, Heracles realized his mistake and apologized profusely (Pherecydes wrote that Heracles stretched his arrow at him menacingly, but Helios ordered him to stop, and Heracles in fear desisted); In turn and equally courteous, Helios granted Heracles the golden cup which he used to sail across the sea every night, from the west to the east because he found Heracles&#x27; actions immensely bold. In the versions delivered by Apollodorus and Pherecydes, Heracles was only &quot;about to&quot; shoot Helios, but according to Panyassis, he &quot;did&quot; shoot and wounded the god.

==== Solar eclipses ====
Solar eclipses were phaenomena of fear as well as wonder in Ancient Greece, and were seen as the Sun abandoning humanity. According to a fragment of Archilochus, it is Zeus who blocks Helios and makes him disappear from the sky. In one of his paeans, the lyric poet Pindar describes a solar eclipse as the Sun&#x27;s light being hidden from the world, a bad omen of destruction and doom:

==== Horses of Helios ====
Some lists, cited by Hyginus, of the names of horses that pulled Helios&#x27; chariot, are as follows. Scholarship acknowledges that, despite differences between the lists, the names of the horses always seem to refer to fire, flame, light and other luminous qualities.
* According to Eumelus of Corinth – late 7th/ early 6th century BC: The male trace horses are Eous (by him the sky is turned) and Aethiops (as if flaming, parches the grain) and the female yoke-bearers are Bronte (&quot;Thunder&quot;) and Sterope (&quot;Lightning&quot;).
* According to Ovid — Roman, 1st century BC &quot;Phaethon&#x27;s ride&quot;: Pyrois (&quot;the fiery one&quot;), Eous (&quot;he of the dawn&quot;), Aethon (&quot;blazing&quot;), and Phlegon (&quot;burning&quot;).

Hyginus writes that according to Homer, the horses&#x27; names are Abraxas and Therbeeo; but Homer makes no mention of horses or chariot.

Alexander of Aetolia, cited in Athenaeus, related that the magical herb grew on the island Thrinacia, which was sacred to Helios, and served as a remedy against fatigue for the sun god&#x27;s horses. Aeschrion of Samos informed that it was known as the &quot;dog&#x27;s-tooth&quot; and was believed to have been sown by Cronus.

=== Awarding of Rhodes ===
According to Pindar, when the gods divided the earth among them, Helios was absent, and thus he got no lot of land. He complained to Zeus about it, who offered to do the division of portions again, but Helios refused the offer, for he had seen a new land emerging from the deep of the sea; a rich, productive land for humans and good for cattle too. Helios asked for this island to be given to him, and Zeus agreed to it, with Lachesis (one of the three Fates) raising her hands to confirm the oath. Alternatively in another tradition, it was Helios himself who made the island rise from the sea when he caused the water which had overflowed it to disappear. He named it Rhodes, after his lover Rhode (the daughter of Poseidon and Aphrodite or Amphitrite), and it became the god&#x27;s sacred island, where he was honoured above all other gods. With Rhode Helios sired seven sons, known as the Heliadae (&quot;sons of the Sun&quot;), who became the first rulers of the island, as well as one daughter, Electryone. Three of their grandsons founded the cities Ialysos, Camiros and Lindos on the island, named after themselves; thus Rhodes came to belong to him and his line, with the autochthonous peoples of Rhodes claiming descend from the Heliadae.

=== Phaethon ===


The most well known story about Helios is the one involving his son Phaethon, who asked him to drive his chariot for a single day. Although all versions agree that Phaethon convinced Helios to give him his chariot, and that he failed in his task with disastrous results, there are a great number of details that vary by version, including the identity of Phaethon&#x27;s mother, the location the story takes place, the role Phaethon&#x27;s sisters the Heliades play, the motivation behind Phaethon&#x27;s decision to ask his father for such thing, and even the exact relation between god and mortal.

Traditionally, Phaethon was Helios&#x27; son by the Oceanid nymph Clymene, or alternatively Rhode or the otherwise unknown Prote. In one version of the story, Phaethon is Helios&#x27; grandson, rather than son, through the boy&#x27;s father Clymenus. In this version, Phaethon&#x27;s mother is an Oceanid nymph named Merope.

In Euripides&#x27; lost play &quot;Phaethon&quot;, surviving only in twelve fragments, Phaethon is the product of an illicit liaison between his mother Clymene (who is now married to Merops, the king of Aethiopia) and Helios, though she claimed that her lawful husband was the father of her all her children. Clymene reveals the truth to her son, and urges him to travel east to get confirmation from his father after she informs him that Helios promised to grant their child any wish when he slept with her. Although reluctant at first, Phaethon is convinced and sets on to find his birth father. In a surviving fragment from the play, Helios accompanies his son in his ill-fated journey in the skies, trying to give him instructions on how to drive the chariot while he rides on a spare horse named Sirius, as someone, perhaps a paedagogus informs Clymene of Phaethon&#x27;s fate, who is probably accompanied by slave women:

If this messenger did witness the flight himself, it is possible there was also a passage where he described Helios taking control over the bolting horses in the same manner as Lucretius described. Phaethon inevitably dies; a fragment near the end of the play has Clymene order the slave girls hide Phaethon&#x27;s still-smouldering body from Merops, and laments Helios&#x27; role in her son&#x27;s death, saying he destroyed him and her both. Near the end of the play it seems that Merops, having found out about Clymene&#x27;s affair and Phaethon&#x27;s true parentage, tries to kill her; her eventual fate is unclear, but it has been suggested she is saved by some deus ex machina. A number of deities have been proposed for the identity of this possible deus ex machina, with Helios among them.

In Ovid&#x27;s account, Zeus&#x27; son Epaphus mocks Phaethon&#x27;s claim that he is the son of the sun god; his mother Clymene tells Phaethon to go to Helios himself, to ask for confirmation of his paternity. Helios promises him on the river Styx any gift that he might ask as a proof of paternity; Phaethon asks for the privilege to drive Helios&#x27; chariot for a single day. Although Helios warns his son of how dangerous and disastrous this would be, he is nevertheless unable to change Phaethon&#x27;s mind or revoke his promise. Phaethon takes the reins, and the earth burns when he travels too low, and freezes when he takes the chariot too high. Zeus strikes Phaethon with lightning, killing him. Helios refuses to resume his job, but he returns to his task and duty at the appeal of the other gods, as well as Zeus&#x27; threats. He then takes his anger out on his four horses, whipping them in fury for causing his son&#x27;s death.

Nonnus of Panopolis presented a slightly different version of the myth, narrated by Hermes; according to him, Helios met and fell in love with Clymene, the daughter of the Ocean, and the two soon got married with her father&#x27;s blessing. When he grows up, fascinated with his father&#x27;s job, he asks him to drive his chariot for a single day. Helios does his best to dissuade him, arguing that sons are not necessarily fit to step into their fathers&#x27; shoes. But under pressure of Phaethon and Clymene&#x27;s begging both, he eventually gives in. As per all other versions of the myth, Phaethon&#x27;s ride is catastrophic and ends in his death.

Hyginus wrote that Phaethon secretly mounted his father&#x27;s car without said father&#x27;s knowledge and leave, but with the aid of his sisters the Heliades who yoked the horses.

In all retellings, Helios recovers the reins in time, thus saving the earth. Another consistent detail across versions are that Phaethon&#x27;s sisters the Heliades mourn him by the Eridanus and are turned into black poplar trees, who shed tears of amber. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, it was Helios who turned them into trees, for their honour to Phaethon. In one version of the myth, Helios conveyed his dead son to the stars, as a constellation (the Auriga).

=== The Watchman ===
==== Persephone ====


Helios is said to have seen and stood witness to everything that happened where his light shone. When Hades abducts Persephone, Helios is the only one to witness it.

In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;, Demeter asks the stars first about Persephone&#x27;s whereabouts, and it is Helice who advises her to go ask Helios. Demeter is not slow to approach him, and Helios then tells her not to waste time, and seek out for &quot;the queen of the third world&quot;.

==== Ares and Aphrodite ====
In another myth, Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, but she cheated on him with his brother Ares, god of war. In Book Eight of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the blind singer Demodocus describes how the illicit lovers committed adultery, until one day Helios caught them in the act, and immediately informed Aphrodite&#x27;s husband Hephaestus. Upon learning that, Hephaestus forged a net so thin it could hardly be seen, in order to ensnare them. He then announced that he was leaving for Lemnos. Upon hearing that, Ares went to Aphrodite and the two lovers coupled. Once again Helios informed Hephaestus, who came into the room and trapped them in the net. He then called the other gods to witness the humiliating sight.

Much later versions add a young man to the story, a warrior named Alectryon, tasked by Ares to stand guard should anyone approach. But Alectryon fell asleep, allowing Helios to discover the two lovers and inform Hephaestus. For this, Aphrodite hated Helios and his race for all time. In some versions, she cursed his daughter Pasiphaë to fall in love with the Cretan Bull as revenge against him. Pasiphaë&#x27;s daughter Phaedra&#x27;s passion for her step-son Hippolytus was also said to have been inflicted on her by Aphrodite for this same reason.

==== Leucothoe and Clytie ====
Aphrodite aims to enact her revenge by making Helios fall for a mortal princess named Leucothoe, forgetting his previous lover the Oceanid Clytie for her sake. Helios watches her from above, even making the winter days longer so he can have more time looking at her. Taking the form of her mother Eurynome, Helios enters their palace, entering the girl&#x27;s room before revealing himself to her.

However, Clytie informs Leucothoe&#x27;s father Orchamus of this affair, and he buries Leucothoe alive in the earth. Helios comes too late to rescue her, so instead he pours nectar into the earth, and turns the dead Leucothoe into a frankincense tree. Clytie, spurned by Helios for her role in his lover&#x27;s death, strips herself naked, accepting no food or drink, and sits on a rock for nine days, pining after him, until eventually turning into a purple, sun-gazing flower, the heliotrope. This myth, it has been theorized, might have been used to explain the use of frankincense aromatic resin in Helios&#x27; worship. Leucothoe being buried alive as punishment by a male guardian, which is not too unlike Antigone&#x27;s own fate, may also indicate an ancient tradition involving human sacrifice in a vegetation cult. At first the stories of Leucothoe and Clytie might have been two distinct myths concerning Helios which were later combined along with a third story, that of Helios discovering Ares and Aphrodite&#x27;s affair and then informing Hephaestus, into a single tale either by Ovid himself or his source.

==== Other ====
In Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Ajax&quot;, Ajax the Great, minutes before committing suicide, calls upon Helios to stop his golden reins when he reaches Ajax&#x27;s native land of Salamis and inform his aging father Telamon and his mother of their son&#x27;s fate and death, and salutes him one last time before he kills himself.

=== Involvement in wars ===
Helios sides with the other gods in several battles. Surviving fragments from &quot;Titanomachy&quot; imply scenes where Helios is the only one among the Titans to have abstained from attacking the Olympian gods, and they, after the war was over, gave him a place in the sky and awarded him with his chariot.

He also takes part in the Giant wars; it was said by Pseudo-Apollodorus that during the battle of the Giants against the gods, the giant Alcyoneus stole Helios&#x27; cattle from Erytheia where the god kept them, or alternatively, that it was Alcyoneus&#x27; very theft of the cattle that started the war. Because the earth goddess Gaia, mother and ally of the Giants, learned of the prophecy that the giants would perish at the hand of a mortal, she sought to find a magical herb that would protect them and render them practically indestructible; thus Zeus ordered Helios, as well as his sisters Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn) not to shine, and harvested all of the plant for himself, denying Gaia the opportunity to make the Giants immortal, while Athena summoned the mortal Heracles to fight by their side.

At some point during the battle of gods and giants in Phlegra, Helios takes up an exhausted Hephaestus on his chariot. After the war ends, one of the giants, Picolous, flees to Aeaea, where Helios&#x27; daughter, Circe, lived. He attempted to chase Circe away from the island, only to be killed by Helios. From the blood of the slain giant that dripped on the earth a new plant was sprang, the herb moly, named thus from the battle (&quot;malos&quot; in Ancient Greek).

Helios is depicted in the Pergamon Altar, waging war against Giants next to Eos, Selene, and Theia in the southern frieze.

=== Clashes and punishments ===
==== Gods ====
A myth about the origin of Corinth goes as such: Helios and Poseidon clashed as to who would get to have the city. The Hecatoncheir Briareos was tasked to settle the dispute between the two gods; he awarded the Acrocorinth to Helios, while Poseidon was given the isthmus of Corinth.

Aelian wrote that Nerites was the son of the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. In the version where Nerites became the lover of Poseidon, it is said that Helios turned him into a shellfish, for reasons unknown. At first Aelian writes that Helios was resentful of the boy&#x27;s speed, but when trying to explain why he changed his form, he suggests that perhaps Poseidon and Helios were rivals in love.

In an Aesop fable, Helios and the north wind god Boreas argued about which one between them was the strongest god. They agreed that whoever was able to make a passing traveller remove his cloak would be declared the winner. Boreas was the one to try his luck first; but no matter how hard he blew, he could not remove the man&#x27;s cloak, instead making him wrap his cloak around him even tighter. Helios shone bright then, and the traveller, overcome with the heat, removed his cloak, giving him the victory. The moral is that persuasion is better than force.

==== Mortals ====
Relating to his nature as the Sun, Helios was presented as a god who could restore and deprive people of vision, as it was regarded that his light that made the faculty of sight and enabled visible things to be seen. In one myth, after Orion was blinded by King Oenopion, he traveled to the east, where he met Helios. Helios then healed Orion&#x27;s eyes, restoring his eyesight.

In Phineus&#x27;s story, his blinding, as reported in Apollonius Rhodius&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, was Zeus&#x27; punishment for Phineus revealing the future to mankind. According, however, to one of the alternative versions, it was Helios who had deprived Phineus of his sight. Pseudo-Oppian wrote that Helios&#x27; wrath was due to some obscure victory of the prophet; after Calais and Zetes slew the Harpies tormenting Phineus, Helios then turned him into a mole, a blind creature. In yet another version, he blinded Phineus at the request of his son Aeëtes.

In another tale, the Athenian inventor Daedalus and his young son Icarus fashioned themselves wings made of birds&#x27; feathers glued together with wax and flew away. According to scholia on Euripides, Icarus, being young and rashful, thought himself greater than Helios. Angered, Helios hurled his rays at him, melting the wax and plunging Icarus into the sea to drown. Later, it was Helios who decreed that said sea would be named after the unfortunate youth, the Icarian Sea.

Arge was a huntress who, while hunting down a particularly fast stag, claimed that fast as the Sun as it was, she would eventually catch up to it. Helios, offended by the girl&#x27;s words, changed her shape into that of a doe.

In one rare version of Smyrna&#x27;s tale, it was an angry Helios who cursed her to fall in love with her own father Cinyras because of some unspecified offence the girl committed against him; in the vast majority of other versions however, the culprit behind Smyrna&#x27;s curse is the goddess of love Aphrodite.

=== Oxen of the Sun ===


Helios is said to have kept his sheep and cattle on his sacred island of Thrinacia, or in some cases Erytheia. Each flock numbers fifty beasts, totaling 350 cows and 350 sheep—the number of days of the year in the early Ancient Greek calendar; the seven herds correspond to the week, containing seven days. The cows did not breed or die. In the &quot;Homeric Hymn 4 to Hermes&quot;, after Hermes has been brought before Zeus by an angry Apollo for stealing Apollo&#x27;s sacred cows, the young god excuses himself for his actions and says to his father that &quot;I reverence Helios greatly and the other gods&quot;.

Augeas, who in some versions is his son, safe-keeps a herd of twelve bulls sacred to the god. Moreover, it was said that Augeas&#x27; enormous herd of cattle was a gift to him by his father.

Apollonia in Illyria was another place where he kept a flock of his sheep; a man named Peithenius had been put in charge of them, but the sheep were devoured by wolves. The other Apolloniates, thinking he had been neglectful, gouged out Peithenius&#x27; eyes. Angered over the man&#x27;s treatment, Helios made the earth grow barren and ceased to bear fruit; the earth grew fruitful again only after the Apolloniates had propitiated Peithenius by craft, and by two suburbs and a house he picked out, pleasing the god. This story is also attested by Greek historian Herodotus, who calls the man Evenius.

==== Odyssey ====
During Odysseus&#x27; journey to get back home, he arrives at the island of Circe, who warns him not to touch Helios&#x27; sacred cows once he reaches Thrinacia, or the god would keep them from returning home. Though Odysseus warns his men, when supplies run short they kill and eat some of the cattle. The guardians of the island, Helios&#x27; daughters Phaethusa and Lampetia, tell their father about this. Helios then appeals to Zeus telling him to dispose of Odysseus&#x27; men, rejecting the crewmen&#x27;s compensation of a new temple in Ithaca. Zeus destroys the ship with his lightning bolt, killing all the men except for Odysseus.

=== Other works ===

Helios is featured in several of Lucian&#x27;s works beyond his &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;. In another work of Lucian&#x27;s, &quot;&quot;, Selene complains to the titular character about philosophers wanting to stir up strife between herself and Helios. Later he is seen feasting with the other gods on Olympus, and prompting Menippus to wonder how can night fall on the Heavens while he is there.

Diodorus Siculus recorded an unorthodox version of the myth, in which Basileia, who had succeeded her father Uranus to his royal throne, married her brother Hyperion, and had two children, a son Helios and a daughter Selene. Because Basileia&#x27;s other brothers envied these offspring, they put Hyperion to the sword and drowned Helios in the river Eridanus, while Selene took her own life. After the massacre, Helios appeared in a dream to his grieving mother and assured her and their murderers would be punished, and that he and his sister would now be transformed into immortal, divine natures; what was known as Mene would now be called Selene, and the &quot;holy fire&quot; in the heavens would bear his own name.

It was said that Selene, when preoccupied with her passion for the mortal Endymion, would give her moon chariot to Helios to drive it.

Claudian wrote that in his infancy, Helios was nursed by his aunt Tethys.

Pausanias writes that the people of Titane held that Titan was a brother of Helios, the first inhabitant of Titane after whom the town was named; Titan however was generally identified as Helios himself, instead of being a separate figure.

According to sixth century BC lyric poet Stesichorus, with Helios in his palace lives his mother Theia.

In the myth of the dragon Python&#x27;s slaying by Apollo, the slain serpent&#x27;s corpse is said to have rotten in the strength of the &quot;shining Hyperion&quot;.

=== Consorts and children ===
The god Helios is typically depicted as the head of a large family, and the places that venerated him the most would also typically claim both mythological and genealogical descent from him; for example, the Cretans traced the ancestry of their king Idomeneus to Helios through his daughter Pasiphaë.

Traditionally the Oceanid nymph Perse was seen as the sun god&#x27;s wife by whom he had various children, most notably Circe, Aeëtes, Minos&#x27; wife Pasiphaë, Perses, and in some versions the Corinthian king Aloeus. Ioannes Tzetzes adds Calypso, otherwise the daughter of Atlas, to the list of children Helios had by Perse, perhaps due to the similarities of the roles and personalities she and Circe display in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as hosts of Odysseus.

At some point Helios warned Aeëtes of a prophecy that stated he would suffer treachery from one of his own offspring (which Aeëtes took to mean his daughter Chalciope and her children by Phrixus). Helios also bestowed several gifts on his son, such as a chariot with swift steeds, a golden helmet with four plates, a giant&#x27;s war armor, and robes and a necklace as a pledge of fatherhood. When his daughter Medea betrays him and flees with Jason after stealing the golden fleece, Aeëtes calls upon his father and Zeus to witness their unlawful actions against him and his people.

As father of Aeëtes, Helios was also the grandfather of Medea and would play a significant role in Euripides&#x27; rendition of her fate in Corinth. When Medea offers Princess Glauce the poisoned robes and diadem, she says they were gifts to her from Helios. Later, after Medea has caused the deaths of Glauce and King Creon, as well as her own children, Helios helps her escape Corinth and her husband. In Seneca&#x27;s rendition of the story, a frustrated Medea criticizes the inaction of her grandfather, wondering why he has not darkened the sky at sight of such wickedness, and asks from him his fiery chariot so she can burn Corinth to the ground.

However, he is also stated to have married other women instead like Rhodos in the Rhodian tradition, by whom he had seven sons, the Heliadae (Ochimus, Cercaphus, Macar, Actis, Tenages, Triopas, Candalus), and the girl Electryone.

In Nonnus&#x27; account from the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Helios and the nymph Clymene met and fell in love with each other in the mythical island of Kerne and got married. Soon Clymene fell pregnant with Phaetheon. Her and Helios raised their child together, until the ill-fated day the boy asked his father for his chariot. A passage from Greek anthology mentions Helios visiting Clymene in her room.

The mortal king of Elis Augeas was said to be Helios&#x27; son, but Pausanias states that his actual father was the mortal king Eleios.

In some rare versions, Helios is the father, rather than the brother, of his sisters Selene and Eos. A scholiast on Euripides explained that Selene was said to be his daughter since she partakes of the solar light, and changes her shape based on the position of the sun.

* Anaxibia, an Indian Naiad, was lusted after by Helios according to Pseudo-Plutarch.

== Worship ==
=== Cult ===
==== Archaic and Classical Athens ====
Scholarly focus on the ancient Greek cults of Helios has generally been rather slim, partially due to how scarce both literary and archaeological sources are. L.R. Farnell assumed &quot;that sun-worship had once been prevalent and powerful among the people of the pre-Hellenic culture, but that very few of the communities of the later historic period retained it as a potent factor of the state religion&quot;. The largely Attic literary sources used by scholars present ancient Greek religion with an Athenian bias, and, according to J. Burnet, &quot;no Athenian could be expected to worship Helios or Selene, but he might think them to be gods, since Helios was the great god of Rhodes and Selene was worshiped at Elis and elsewhere&quot;.Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Peace&quot; (406–413) contrasts the worship of Helios and Selene with that of the more essentially Greek Twelve Olympians.

The tension between the mainstream traditional religious veneration of Helios, which had become enriched with ethical values, poetical symbolism, and the Ionian proto-scientific examination of the sun, clashed in the trial of Anaxagoras c. 450 BC, in which Anaxagoras asserted that the Sun was in fact a gigantic red-hot ball of metal.

==== Hellenistic period ====
Helios was not worshipped in Athens until the Hellenistic period, in post-classical times. His worship might be described as a product of the Hellenistic era, influenced perhaps by the general spread of cosmic and astral beliefs during the reign of Alexander III. A scholiast on Sophocles wrote that the Athenians did not offer wine as an offering to the Helios among other gods, making instead &quot;nephalia&quot;, or &quot;wineless&quot;, sober sacrifices; Athenaeus also reported that those who sacrificed to him did not offer wine, but brought honey instead, to the altars reasoning that the god who held the cosmos in order should not succumb to drunkenness.

Lysimachides in the first century BC or first century AD reported of a festival Skira:
that the skiron is a large sunshade under which the priestess of Athena, the priest of Poseidon, and the priest of Helios walk as it is carried from the acropolis to a place called Skiron.
During the Thargelia, a festival in honour of Apollo, the Athenians had cereal offerings for Helios and the Horae. They were honoured with a procession, due to their clear connections and relevance to agriculture. Helios and the Horae were also apparently worshipped during another Athenian festival held in honor of Apollo, the Pyanopsia, with a feast; an attested procession, independent from the one recorded at the Thargelia, might have been in their honour.

Side B of LSCG 21.B19 from the Piraeus Asclepium prescribe cake offerings to several gods, among them Helios and Mnemosyne, two gods linked to incubation through dreams, who are offered a type of honey cake called &quot;arester&quot; and a honeycomb. The cake was put on fire during the offering. A type of cake called &quot;orthostates&quot; made of wheaten and barley flour was offered to him and the Hours. Phthois, another flat cake made with cheese, honey and wheat was also offered to him among many other gods.

In many places people kept herds of red and white cattle in his honour, and white animals of several kinds, but especially white horses, were considered to be sacred to him. Ovid writes that horses were sacrificed to him because no slow animal should be offered to the swift god.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; Helios, the Sun, is the symbolic offspring of the idea of the Good.

The ancient Greeks called Sunday &quot;day of the Sun&quot; (&quot;&quot;) after him. According to Philochorus, Athenian historian and Atthidographer of the 3rd century BC, the first day of each month was sacred to Helios.

It was during the Roman period that Helios actually rose into an actual significant religious figure and was elevated in public cult.

==== Rhodes ====
The island of Rhodes was an important cult center for Helios, one of the only places where he was worshipped as a major deity in ancient Greece. One of Pindar&#x27;s most notable greatest odes is an abiding memorial of the devotion of the island of Rhodes to the cult and personality of Helios, and all evidence points that he was for the Rhodians what Olympian Zeus was for Elis or Athena for the Athenians; their local myths, especially those concerning the Heliadae, suggest that Helios in Rhodes was revered as the founder of their race and their civilization.

The worship of Helios at Rhodes included a ritual in which a quadriga, or chariot drawn by four horses, was driven over a precipice into the sea, in reenactment to the myth of Phaethon. Annual gymnastic tournaments were held in Helios&#x27; honor; according to Festus (s. v. October Equus) during the Halia each year the Rhodians would also throw quadrigas dedicated to him into the sea. Horse sacrifice was offered to him in many places, but only in Rhodes in teams of four; a team of four horses was also sacrificed to Poseidon in Illyricum, and the sea god was also worshipped in Lindos under the epithet Hippios, denoting perhaps a blending of the cults.

It was believed that if one sacrificed to the rising Sun with their day&#x27;s work ahead of them, it would be proper to offer a fresh, bright white horse.

The Colossus of Rhodes was dedicated to him. In Xenophon of Ephesus&#x27; work of fiction, &quot;Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes&quot;, the protagonist Anthia cuts and dedicates some of her hair to Helios during his festival at Rhodes. The Rhodians called shrine of Helios, Haleion ().

A colossal statue of the god, known as the Colossus of Rhodes and named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was erected in his honour and adorned the port of the city of Rhodes.
The best of these are, first, the Colossus of Helius, of which the author of the iambic verse says, &quot;seven times ten cubits in height, the work of Chares the Lindian&quot;; but it now lies on the ground, having been thrown down by an earthquake and broken at the knees. In accordance with a certain oracle, the people did not raise it again.
According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or high – approximately the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown – making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. It collapsed after an earthquake that hit Rhodes in 226 BC, and the Rhodians did not build it again, in accordance with an oracle.

In Rhodes, Helios seems to have absorbed the worship and cult of the island&#x27;s local hero and mythical founder Tlepolemus. In ancient Greek city foundation, the use of the &quot;archegetes&quot; in its double sense of both founder and progenitor of a political order, or a polis, can be seen with Rhodes; real prominence was transferred from the local hero Tlepolemus, onto the god, Helios, with an appropriate myth explaining his relative insignificance; thus games originally celebrated for Tlepolemus were now given to Helios, who was seen as both ancestor and founder of the polis. A sanctuary of Helios and the nymphs stood in Loryma near Lindos.

The priesthood of Helios was, at some point, appointed by lot, though in the great city a man and his two sons held the office of priesthood for the sun god in succession.

==== Peloponnese ====
The scattering of cults in Sicyon, Argos, Hermione, Epidaurus and Laconia seem to suggest that Helios was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared to other parts of ancient Greece. It may have been the Dorians who brought his worship to Rhodes.

Helios was an important god in Corinth and the greater Corinthia region. Pausanias in his &quot;Description of Greece&quot; describes how Helios and Poseidon vied over the city, with Poseidon getting the isthmus of Corinth and Helios being awarded with the Acrocorinth. Helios&#x27; prominence in Corinth might go as back as Mycenaean times, and predate Poseidon&#x27;s arrival, or it might be due to Oriental immigration. At Sicyon, Helios had an altar behind Hera&#x27;s sanctuary. It would seem that for the Corinthians, Helios was notable enough to even have control over thunder, which is otherwise the domain of the sky god Zeus.

Helios had a cult in Laconia as well. Taletos, a peak of Mt. Taygetus, was sacred to Helios. At Thalamae, Helios together with his daughter Pasiphaë were revered in an oracle, where the goddess revealed to the people consulting her what they needed to know in their dreams. While the predominance of Helios in Sparta is currently unclear, it seems Helen was the local solar deity. Helios (and Selene&#x27;s) worship in Gytheum, near Sparta, is attested by an inscription (&quot;C.I.G. 1392&quot;).

In Argolis, an altar was dedicated to Helios near Mycenae, and another in Troezen, where he was worshipped as the God of Freedom, seeing how the Troezenians had escaped slavery at the hands of Xerxes I. Over at Hermione stood a temple of his. He appears to have also been venerated in Epidaurus.

In Arcadia, he had a cult in Megalopolis as the Saviour, and an altar near Mantineia.

==== Elsewhere ====
Traces of Helios&#x27;s worship can also be found in Crete. In the earliest period Rhodes stood in close relations with Crete, and it is relatively safe to suggest that the name &quot;Taletos&quot; is associated with the Eteocretan word for the sun &quot;Talos&quot;, surviving in Zeus&#x27; epithet Tallaios, a solar aspect of the thunder god in Crete. Helios was also invoked in an oath of alliance between Knossos and Dreros.

In his little-attested cults in Asia Minor it seems his identification with Apollo was the strongest. It is possible that the solar elements of Apollo&#x27;s Anatolian cults were influenced by Helios&#x27; cult in Rhodes, as Rhodes lies right off the southwest coast of Asia Minor.

Archaeological evidence has proven the existence of a shrine to Helios and Hemera, the goddess of the day and daylight, at the island of Kos and excavations have revealed traces of his cult at Sinope, Pozzuoli, Ostia and elsewhere. After a plague hit the city of Cleonae, in Phocis, Central Greece, the people there sacrificed a he-goat to Helios, and were reportedly then spared from the plague.

Helios also had a cult in the region of Thessaly. Plato in his &quot;Laws&quot; mentions the state of the Magnetes making a joint offering to Helios and Apollo, indicating a close relationship between the cults of those two gods, but it is clear that they were nevertheless distinct deities in Thessaly.

Helios is also depicted on first century BC coins found at Halicarnassus, Syracuse in Sicily and at Zacynthus. From Pergamon originates a hymn to Helios in the style of Euripides.

In Apollonia he was also venerated, as evidenced from Herodotus&#x27; account where a man named Evenius was harshly punished by his fellow citizens for allowing wolves to devour the flock of sheep sacred to the god out of negligence.

The &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; names a temple of Helios in the city of Alexandria.

=== Other functions ===
==== In oath-keeping ====
Gods were often called upon by the Greeks when an oath was sworn; Helios is among the three deities to be invoked in the &quot;Iliad&quot; to witness the truce between Greeks and Trojans. He is also often appealed to in ancient drama to witness the unfolding events or take action, such as in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot;. The notion of Helios as witness to oaths and vows also led to a view of Helios as a witness of wrong-doings. He was thus seen as a guarantor of cosmic order.

Helios was invoked as a witness to several alliances such as the one between Athens and Cetriporis, Lyppeus of Paeonia and Grabus, and the oaths of the League of Corinth. In a treaty between the cities of Smyrna and Magnesia, the Magnesians swore their oath by Helios among others. The combination of Zeus, Gaia and Helios in oath-swearing is also found among the non-Greek &#x27;Royal Gods&#x27; in an agreement between Maussollus and Phaselis (360s BC) and in the Hellenistic period with the degree of Chremonides&#x27; announcing the alliance of Athens and Sparta.

==== In magic ====
He also had a role in necromancy magic. The Greek Magical Papyri contain several recipes for such, for example one which involves invoking the Sun over the skull-cup of a man who suffered a violent death; after the described ritual, Helios will then send the man&#x27;s ghost to the practitioner to tell them everything they wish to know. Helios is also associated with Hecate in cursing magic. In some parts of Asia Minor Helios was adjured not to permit any violation of the grave in tomb inscriptions and to warn potential violators not to desecrate the tomb, like one example from Elaeussa-Sebaste in Cilicia:
We adjure you by the heavenly god [Zeus] and Helios and Selene and the gods of the underworld, who receive us, that no one [. . .] will throw another corpse upon our bones.
Helios was also often invoked in funeral imprecations. Helios might have been chosen for this sort of magic because as an all-seeing god he could see everything on earth, even hidden crimes, and thus he was a very popular god to invoke in prayers for vengeance. Additionally, in ancient magic evil-averting aid and apotropaic defense were credited to Helios. Some magic rituals were associated with the engraving of images and stones, as with one such spell which asks Helios to consecrate the stone and fill with luck, honour, success and strength, thus giving the user incredible power.

Helios was also associated with love magic, much like Aphrodite, as there seems to have been another but rather poorly documented tradition of people asking him for help in such love matters, including homosexual love and magical recipes invoking him for affection spells.

==== In dreams ====
It has been suggested that in Ancient Greece people would reveal their dreams to Helios and the sky or the air in order to avert any evil foretold or presaged in them.

According to Artemidorus&#x27; &quot;Oneirocritica&quot;, the rich dreaming of transforming into a god was an auspicious sign, as long as the transformation had no deficiencies, citing the example of a man who dreamt he was Helios but wore a sun crown of just eleven rays. He wrote that the sun god was also an auspicious sign for the poor. In dreams, Helios could either appear in &#x27;sensible&#x27; form (the orb of the sun) or his &#x27;intelligible&#x27; form (the humanoid god).

=== Late antiquity ===
By Late Antiquity, Helios had accumulated a number of religious, mythological, and literary elements from other deities, particularly Apollo and the Roman sun god Sol. In 274 AD, on December 25, the Roman Emperor Aurelian instituted an official state cult to Sol Invictus (or &quot;Helios Megistos&quot;, &quot;Great Helios&quot;). This new cult drew together imagery not only associated with Helios and Sol, but also a number of syncretic elements from other deities formerly recognized as distinct. Helios in these works is frequently equated not only with deities such as Mithras and Harpocrates, but even with the monotheistic Judaeo-Christian god.

The last pagan emperor of Rome, Julian, made Helios the primary deity of his revived pagan religion, which combined elements of Mithraism with Neoplatonism. For Julian, Helios was a triunity: The One; Helios-Mithras; and the Sun. Because the primary location of Helios in this scheme was the &quot;middle&quot; realm, Julian considered him to be a mediator and unifier not just of the three realms of being, but of all things. Julian&#x27;s theological conception of Helios has been described as &quot;practically monotheistic&quot;, in contrast to earlier Neoplatonists like Iamblichus.

A mosaic found in the Vatican Necropolis (mausoleum M) depicts a figure very similar in style to Sol / Helios, crowned with solar rays and driving a solar chariot. Some scholars have interpreted this as a depiction of Christ, noting that Clement of Alexandria wrote of Christ driving his chariot across the sky. Some scholars doubt the Christian associations, or suggest that the figure is merely a non-religious representation of the sun.

=== In the Greek Magical Papyri ===
Helios figured prominently in the Greek Magical Papyri. In these mostly fragmentary texts, Helios is credited with a broad domain, being regarded as the creator of life, the lord of the heavens and the cosmos, and the god of the sea. He is said to take the form of 12 animals representing each hour of the day, a motif also connected with the 12 signs of the zodiac.

The Papyri often syncretize Helios with a variety of related deities. He is described as &quot;seated on a lotus, decorated with rays&quot;, in the manner of Harpocrates, who was often depicted seated on a lotus flower, representing the rising sun.

Helios is also assimilated with Mithras in some of the Papyri, as he was by Emperor Julian. The Mithras Liturgy combines them as Helios-Mithras, who is said to have revealed the secrets of immortality to the magician who wrote the text. Some of the texts describe Helios-Mithras navigating the Sun&#x27;s path not in a chariot but in a boat, an apparent identification with the Egyptian sun god Ra. Helios is also described as &quot;restraining the serpent&quot;, likely a reference to Apophis, the serpent god who, in Egyptian myth, is said to attack Ra&#x27;s ship during his nightly journey through the underworld.

In many of the Papyri, Helios is also strongly identified with Iao, a name derived from that of the Hebrew god Yahweh, and shares several of his titles including Sabaoth and Adonai. He is also assimilated as the Agathos Daemon, who is also identified elsewhere in the texts as &quot;the greatest god, lord Horus Harpokrates&quot;.

The Neoplatonist philosophers Proclus and Iamblichus attempted to interpret many of the syntheses found in the Greek Magical Papyri and other writings that regarded Helios as all-encompassing, with the attributes of many other divine entities. Proclus described Helios as a cosmic god consisting of many forms and traits. These are &quot;coiled up&quot; within his being, and are variously distributed to all that &quot;participate in his nature&quot;, including angels, daemons, souls, animals, herbs, and stones. All of these things were important to the Neoplatonic practice of theurgy, magical rituals intended to invoke the gods in order to ultimately achieve union with them. Iamblichus noted that theurgy often involved the use of &quot;stones, plants, animals, aromatic substances, and other such things holy and perfect and godlike.&quot; For theurgists, the elemental power of these items sacred to particular gods utilizes a kind of sympathetic magic.

=== Epithets ===
The Greek sun god had various bynames or epithets, which over time in some cases came to be considered separate deities associated with the Sun. Among these are:

Acamas (; ; , &quot;Akàmas&quot;), meaning &quot;tireless, unwearying&quot;, as he repeats his never-ending routine day after day without cease.

Apollo (; ; , &quot;Apóllōn&quot;) here understood to mean &quot;destroyer&quot;, the sun as a more destructive force.

Callilampetes (; ; , &quot;Kallilampétēs&quot;), &quot;he who glows lovely&quot;.

Elasippus (; ; , &quot;Elásippos&quot;), meaning &quot;horse-driving&quot;.

Elector (; ; , &quot;Ēléktōr&quot;) of uncertain derivation (compare &quot;Electra&quot;), often translated as &quot;beaming&quot; or &quot;radiant&quot;, especially in the combination &quot;Ēlektōr Hyperiōn&quot;.

Eleutherius (; ; , &quot;Eleuthérios) &quot;the liberator&quot;, epithet under which he was worshipped in Troezen in Argolis, also shared with Dionysus and Eros.

Hagnus (; ; , Hagnós), meaning &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;purifying.&quot;

Hecatus (; ; , &quot;Hékatos&quot;), &quot;from afar,&quot; also Hecatebolus (; ; , &quot;Hekatḗbolos&quot;) &quot;the far-shooter&quot;, i.e. the sun&#x27;s rays considered as arrows.

Horotrophus (; ; , &quot;Hо̄rotróphos&quot;), &quot;nurturer of the Seasons/Hours&quot;, in combination with &quot;kouros&quot;, &quot;youth&quot;.

Hyperion (; ; , &quot;Hyperíōn&quot;) and Hyperionides (; ; , &quot;Hyperionídēs&quot;), &quot;superus, high up&quot; and &quot;son of Hyperion&quot; respectively, the sun as the one who is above, and also the name of his father.

Isodaetes (; ; , &quot;Isodaítēs&quot;), literally &quot;he that distributes equal portions&quot;, cult epithet also shared with Dionysus.

Paean ( ; , &quot;Paiān&quot;), physician, healer, a healing god and an epithet of Apollo and Asclepius.

Panoptes (; ; , &quot;Panóptēs&quot;) &quot;all-seeing&quot; and Pantepoptes (; ; , &quot;Pantepóptēs&quot;) &quot;all-supervising&quot;, as the one who witnessed everything that happened on earth.

Pasiphaes (; ; , &quot;Pasiphaḗs&quot;), &quot;all-shining&quot;, also the name of one of his daughters.

Patrius (; ; , &quot;Pátrios&quot;) &quot;of the fathers, ancestral&quot;, related to his role as primogenitor of royal lines in several places.

Phaethon (; ; , &quot;Phaéthōn&quot;) &quot;the radiant&quot;, &quot;the shining&quot;, also the name of his son and daughter.

Phasimbrotus (; ; , &quot;Phasímbrotos&quot;) &quot;he who sheds light to the mortals&quot;, the sun.

Philonamatus (; ; , &quot;Philonámatos&quot;) &quot;water-loving&quot;, a reference to him rising from and setting in the ocean.

Phoebus ( ; , &quot;Phoîbos&quot;), literally &quot;bright&quot;, several Roman authors applied Apollo&#x27;s byname to their sun god Sol.

Sirius (; ; , &quot;Seírios&quot;) literally meaning &quot;scorching&quot;, and also the name of the Dog Star.

Soter (; ; , &quot;Sōtḗr&quot;) &quot;the saviour&quot;, epithet under which he was worshipped in Megalopolis, Arcadia.

Terpsimbrotus (; ; , &quot;Terpsímbrotos&quot;) &quot;he who gladdens mortals&quot;, with his warm, life-giving beams.

Titan (; ; , &quot;Titán&quot;), possibly connected to &quot;τιτώ&quot; meaning &quot;day&quot; and thus &quot;god of the day&quot;.

Whether Apollo&#x27;s epithets &quot;Aegletes&quot; and &quot;Asgelatas&quot; in the island of Anaphe, both connected to light, were borrowed from epithets of Helios either directly or indirectly is hard to say.

== Identification with other gods ==
=== Apollo ===
Helios is sometimes identified with Apollo: &quot;Different names may refer to the same being,&quot; Walter Burkert argues, &quot;or else they may be consciously equated, as in the case of Apollo and Helios.&quot; Apollo was associated with the Sun as early as the fifth century BC, though widespread conflation between him and the Sun god was a later phaenomenon. The earliest certain reference to Apollo being identified with Helios appears in the surviving fragments of Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Phaethon&quot; in a speech near the end.

By Hellenistic times Apollo had become closely connected with the Sun in cult and Phoebus (Greek Φοῖβος, &quot;bright&quot;), the epithet most commonly given to Apollo, was later applied by Latin poets to the Sun-god Sol.

The identification became a commonplace in philosophic and some Orphic texts. Pseudo-Eratosthenes writes about Orpheus in &quot;Placings Among the Stars&quot;, section 24:

:But having gone down into Hades because of his wife and seeing what sort of things were there, he did not continue to worship Dionysus, because of whom he was famous, but he thought Helios to be the greatest of the gods, Helios whom he also addressed as Apollo. Rousing himself each night toward dawn and climbing the mountain called Pangaion, he would await the Sun&#x27;s rising, so that he might see it first. Therefore, Dionysus, being angry with him, sent the Bassarides, as Aeschylus the tragedian says; they tore him apart and scattered the limbs.

Dionysus and Asclepius are sometimes also identified with this Apollo Helios.

Strabo wrote that Artemis and Apollo were associated with Selene and Helios respectively due to the changes those two celestial bodies caused in the temperature of the air, as the twins were gods of pestilential diseases and sudden deaths. Pausanias also linked Apollo&#x27;s association with Helios as a result of his profession as a healing god. In the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, Helios is addressed as Paean (&quot;healer&quot;) and holding a golden lyre, both common descriptions for Apollo; similarly Apollo in his own hymn is described as Titan and shedding light to the mortals, both common epithets of Helios.

According to Athenaeus, Telesilla wrote that the song sung in honour of Apollo is called the &quot;Sun-loving song&quot; (, &quot;philhēliás&quot;), that is, a song meant to make the Sun come forth from the clouds, sung by children in bad weather; but Julius Pollux describing a &quot;philhelias&quot; in greater detail makes no mention of Apollo, only Helios. Scythinus of Teos wrote that Apollo uses the bright light of the Sun (&#x27;) as his harp-quill and in a fragment of Timotheus&#x27; lyric, Helios is invoked as an archer with the invocation &#x27; (a common way of addressing the two medicine gods), though it most likely was part of esoteric doctrine, rather than a popular and widespread belief.

Classical Latin poets also used Phoebus as a byname for the Sun-god, whence come common references in later European poetry to Phoebus and his chariot as a metaphor for the Sun. Ancient Roman authors who used &quot;Phoebus&quot; for Sol as well as Apollo include Ovid, Virgil, Statius, and Seneca. Representations of Apollo with solar rays around his head in art also belong to the time of the Roman Empire, particularly under Emperor Elagabalus in 218-222 AD.

=== Usil ===
The Etruscan god of the Sun was Usil. His name appears on the bronze liver of Piacenza, next to &quot;Tiur&quot;, the Moon. He appears, rising out of the sea, with a fireball in either outstretched hand, on an engraved Etruscan bronze mirror in late Archaic style. On Etruscan mirrors in Classical style, he appears with a halo. In ancient artwork, Usil is shown in close association with Thesan, the goddess of the dawn, something almost never seen with Helios and Eos, however in the area between Cetona and Chiusi a stone obelisk is found, whose relief decorations seem to have been interpreted as referring to a solar sanctuary: what appears to be a Sun boat, the heads of Helios and Thesan, and a cock, likewise referring to the Sunrise.

=== Zeus ===
Helios is also sometimes conflated in classical literature with the highest Olympian god, Zeus. An attested cult epithet of Zeus is &quot;Aleios Zeus&quot;, or &quot;Zeus the Sun,&quot; from the Doric form of Helios&#x27; name. The inscribed base of Mammia&#x27;s dedication to Helios and Zeus Meilichios, dating from the fourth or third century BC, is a fairly and unusually early evidence of the conjoint worship of Helios and Zeus. According to Plutarch, Helios is Zeus in his material form that one can interact with, and that&#x27;s why Zeus owns the year, while the chorus in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot; also link him to Zeus when they refer to Helios as &quot;light born from Zeus&quot;. In his &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot;, Helios is addressed as &quot;immortal Zeus&quot;. In Crete, the cult of Zeus Tallaios had incorporated several solar elements into his worship; &quot;Talos&quot; was the local equivalent of Helios. Helios is referred either directly as Zeus&#x27; eye, or clearly implied to be. For instance, Hesiod effectively describes Zeus&#x27;s eye as the Sun. This perception is possibly derived from earlier Proto-Indo-European religion, in which the Sun is believed to have been envisioned as the eye of *&quot;Dyḗus Pḥatḗr&quot; (see Hvare-khshaeta). An Orphic saying, supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo, goes:

: &quot;Zeus, Hades, Helios-Dionysus, three gods in one godhead!&quot;

The Hellenistic period gave birth to Serapis, a Greco-Egyptian deity conceived by the Greeks as a chthonic aspect of Zeus, whose solar nature is indicated by the Sun crown and rays the Greeks depicted him with. Frequent joint dedications to &quot;Zeus-Serapis-Helios&quot; have been found all over the Mediterranean. There is evidence of Zeus being worshipped as a solar god in the Aegean island of Amorgos which, if correct, could mean that Sun elements in Zeus&#x27; worship could be as early as the fifth century BC.

=== Hades ===
Helios seems to have been connected to some degree with Hades, the god of the Underworld. A dedicatory inscription from Smyrna describes a 1st–2nd century sanctuary to &quot;God Himself&quot; as the most exalted of a group of six deities, including clothed statues of &quot;Plouton Helios&quot; and &quot;Koure Selene&quot;, or in other words &quot;Pluto the Sun&quot; and &quot;Kore the Moon&quot;. Roman poet Apuleius describes a rite in which the Sun appears at midnight to the initiate at the gates of Proserpina; the suggestion here is that this midnight Sun could be &quot;Plouton Helios&quot;. Pluto-Helios seems to reflect the Egyptian idea of the nocturnal Sun that penetrated the realm of the dead.

An old oracle from Claros said that the names of Zeus, Hades, Helios, Dionysus and &quot;Jao&quot; all represented the Sun at different seasons. Macrobius wrote that Iao/Jao is &quot;Hades in winter, Zeus in spring, Helios in summer, and Iao in autumn.&quot;

=== Cronus ===
Diodorus Siculus reported that the Chaldeans called Cronus (Saturnus) by the name Helios, or the Sun, and he explained that this was because Saturn was the &quot;most conspicuous&quot; of the planets.

=== Mithras ===
Helios is frequently conflated with Mithras in iconography, as well as being worshipped alongside him as Helios-Mithras. The earliest artistic representations of the &quot;chariot god&quot; come from the Parthian period (3rd century) in Persia where there is evidence of rituals being performed for the sun god by Magi, indicating an assimilation of the worship of Helios and Mithras.

== Iconography ==
=== Depiction and symbols ===
The earliest depictions of Helios in a humanoid form date from the late sixth and early fifth centuries BC in Attic black-figure vases, and typically show him frontally as a bearded man on his chariot with a sun disk. A red-figure on a polychrome bobbin by a follower of the Brygos painter already signifies a shift in the god&#x27;s depiction, painting him as a youthful, beardless figure. In later art, he is consistently drawn as beardless and young. In it, he is typically depicted with a radiant crown, with the right hand often raised, a gesture of power (which came to be a definitional feature of solar iconography), the left hand usually holding a whip or a globe.

In Rhodian coins, he was shown as a beardless god, with thick and flowing hair, surrounded by beams. He was also presented as a young man clad in tunic, with curling hair and wearing buskins. Just like Selene, who is sometimes depicted with a lunar disk rather than a crescent, Helios too has his own solar one instead of a sun crown in some depictions. It is likely that Helios&#x27; later image as a warrior-charioteer might be traced back to the Mycenaean period; the symbol of the disc of the sun is displayed in scenes of rituals from both Mycenae and Tiryns, and large amounts of chariots used by the Mycenaeans are recorded in Linear B tablets.

In archaic art, Helios rising in his chariot was a type of motive. Helios in ancient pottery is usually depicted rising from the sea in his four-horse chariot, either as a single figure or connecting to some myth, indicating that it takes place at dawn. An Attic black-figure vase shows Heracles sitting on the shores of the Ocean river, while next to him a pair of arrows protrude from Helios, crowned with a solar disk and driving his chariot.

Helios adorned the east pediment of the Parthenon, along with Selene. Helios (again with Selene) also framed the birth of Aphrodite on the base of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Judgement of Paris, and possibly the birth of Pandora on the base of the Athena Parthenos statue. They were also featured in the pedimental group of the temple at Delphi. In dynamic Hellenistic art, Helios along with other luminary deities and Rhea-Cybele, representing reason, battle the Giants (who represent irrationality).

In Elis, he was depicted with rays coming out of his head in an image made of wood with gilded clothing and marble head, hands and feet. Outside the market of the city of Corinth stood a gateway on which stood two gilded chariots; one carrying Helios&#x27; son Phaethon, the other Helios himself.

Helios appears infrequently in gold jewelry before Roman times; extant examples include a gold medallion with its bust from the Gulf of Elaia in Anatolia, where he&#x27;s depicted frontally with a head of unruly hair, and a golden medallion of the Pelinna necklace.

His iconography, used by the Ptolemies after representations of Alexander the Great as Alexander-Helios, came to symbolize power and epiphany, and was borrowed by several Egyptian deities in the Roman period. Other rulers who had their portraits done with solar features include Ptolemy III Euergetes, one of the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt, of whom a bust with holes in the fillet for the sunrays and gold coins depicting him with a radiant halo on his head like Helios and holding the aegis exist.

=== Late Roman era ===
Helios was also frequently depicted in mosaics, usually surrounded by the twelve zodiac signs and accompanied by Selene. From the third and fourth centuries CE onwards, the sun god was seen as an official imperial Roman god and thus appeared in various forms in monumental artworks. The cult of Helios/Sol had a notable function in Eretz Israel; Helios was Constantine the Great&#x27;s patron, and so that ruler came to be identified with Helios. In his new capital city, Constantinople, Constantine recycled a statue of Helios to represent himself in his portrait, as Nero had done with Sol, which was not an uncommon practice among pagans. A considerable portion if not the majority of Jewish Helios material dates from the 3rd through the 6th centuries CE, including numerous mosaics of the god in Jewish synagogues and invocation in papyri.

The sun god was depicted in mosaics in three places of the Land of Israel; at the synagogues of Hammat Tiberias, Beth Alpha and Naaran. In the mosaic of the Hammat Tiberias, Helios is wrapped in a partially gilded tunic fastened with a fibula and sporting a seven-rayed halo with his right hand uplifted, while his left holds a globe and a whip; his chariot is drawn as a frontal box with two large wheels pulled by four horses. At the Beth Alpha synagogue, Helios is at the centre of the circle of the zodiac mosaic, together with the Torah shrine between &quot;menorahs&quot;, other ritual objects, and a pair of lions, while the Seasons are in spandrels. The frontal head of Helios emerges from the chariot box, with two wheels in side view beneath, and the four heads of the horses, likewise frontal, surmounting an array of legs. In the synagogue of Naaran, the god is dressed in a white tunic embellished with gemstones on the upper body; over the tunic is a &quot;paludamentum&quot; pinned with a fibula or bulla and decorated with a star motif, as he holds in his hand a scarf, the distinctive symbol of a ruler from the fourth century onward, and much like all other mosaics he&#x27;s seated in his four-horse chariot. Temporary writings record &quot;the sun has three letters of [God&#x27;s] name written at its heart and the angels lead it&quot; and &quot;[t]he sun is riding on a chariot and rises decorated like a bridegroom&quot;. Both at Naaran and Beth Alpha the image of the sun is presented in a bust in frontal position, and a crown with nimbus and rays on his head. Helios at both Hammath Tiberias and Beth Alpha is depicted with seven rays emanating from his head, it has been argued that those two are significantly different; the Helios of Hammath Tiberias possesses all the attributes of Sol Invictus and thus the Roman emperors, those being the rayed crown, the raised right hand and the globe, all common Helios-Sol iconography of the late third and early fourth centuries AD.

Helios and Selene were also personified in the mosaic of the Monastery of Lady Mary at Beit She&#x27;an. Here he is not shown as Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, but rather as a celestial body, his red hair symbolizing the sun.

The poplar tree was considered sacred to Helios, due to the sun-like brilliance its shining leaves have. A sacred poplar in an epigram written by Antipater of Thessalonica warns the reader not to harm her because Helios cares for her.

Aelian wrote that the wolf is a beloved animal to Helios; the wolf is also Apollo&#x27;s sacred animal, and the god was often known as Apollo Lyceus, &quot;wolf Apollo&quot;.

== In post-classical art ==
=== In painting ===
Helios/Sol had little independent identity and presence during the Renaissance, where the main solar gods were Apollo, Bacchus and Hercules. In post-antiquity art, Apollo assimilates features and attributes of both classical Apollo and Helios, so that Apollo, along with his own iconography, is many times depicted as driving the four-horse chariot, representing both of them. In medieval tradition, each of the four horses had its own distinctive colour; in the Renaissance, however, all four are shown as white. In Versailles, a gilded statue depicts Apollo as the god of the sun, driving his quadriga as he sinks in the ocean; Apollo in this regard represents the king of France, &quot;le roi-soleil&quot;, &quot;the Sun King&quot;.

Additionally to the chariot, Apollo is often drawn with a solar halo around his head and depicted in scenes of Helios&#x27; mythology. Accordingly, in depictions of Phaethon meeting his father and asking him the privilege of driving the sun chariot, artists gave to Phaethon&#x27;s father the appearance and attributes of Apollo.

=== In literature ===
A love affair between the Sun god and the Nereid Amphitrite is introduced by French playwright Monléon&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amphytrite&quot; (1630); in the denouement, the Sun, scorned by the nymph, sets the land and sea ablaze, before the king of gods Jupiter intervenes and restores peace.

In Jean-Gilbert Durval&#x27;s &quot;Le Travaux d&#x27;Ulysse&quot; (1631), after his men dine on the sacred sheep, the Sun appears in &#x27;a chariot of light&#x27;, accompanied by Jupiter; like in the myth, Jupiter kills Odysseus&#x27; crewmen with his lightning bolts when they put to sea again.

French composer Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote in 1683 a &quot;tragédie en musique&quot; inspired by Ovid&#x27;s handling of the tale of Helios&#x27; son, &quot;Phaëton&quot;, in which Phaëton obtains from his father the sun chariot in order to prove his divine origins to his rival Epaphus, but loses control and is instead struck and killed by Jupiter. The luxury of the Sun and his palace was no doubt meant to connect to the Sun King, Louis XIV, who used the sun for his emblem. This Apollo-Sun was frequently used to represent Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, such as in Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Andromède&quot; (1650).

Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Helios und Phaethon&quot; omits entirely the cosmic disaster Phaethon caused in order to focus on the relationship between the divine father and his mortal son, as Phaethon tries to convince his father he is well-suited for his five steeds, while Helios tries to dissuade his ambitious child, but eventually consents and gives him his reins and steeds to drive for a single day.

In James Joyce&#x27;s book &quot;Ulysses&quot;, episode 14 is titled &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot;, after the story of Odysseus&#x27; men and the cattle of Helios in book twelve of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

In &quot;A True Story&quot;, the Sun is an inhabited place, ruled by a king named Phaethon, referencing Helios&#x27;s mythological son. The inhabitants of the Sun are at war with those of the Moon, ruled by King Endymion (Selene&#x27;s lover), over colonization of the Morning Star (Aphrodite&#x27;s planet).

== Namesakes ==
Helios is the Greek proper name for the Sun for both Ancient and Modern Greek, and additionally Helios, one of the craters of Hyperion, a moon of Saturn which bears Helios&#x27; father&#x27;s name, is named after this Greek god. Several words relating to the Sun derive from &quot;helios&quot;, including the rare adjective heliac (meaning &quot;solar&quot;), heliosphere, perihelion and aphelion among others.

The chemical element Helium, a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, first in the noble gas group in the periodic table, was named after Helios by Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland, as it was first observed in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun.

Helius is a genus of crane fly in the family Limoniidae that shares its name with the god.

A pair of probes that were launched into heliocentric orbit by NASA to study solar processes were called Helios A and Helios B.

== Modern reception ==

Helios often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of the sun.

A crime thriller named Helios, directed by Longman Leung, was released in 2015.

Helios has been portrayed in many modern works of literature such as in Gareth Hinds&#x27; 2010 version of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and in 2018&#x27;s &quot;The Burning Maze&quot; in &quot;The Trials of Apollo&quot; series by Rick Riordan.

Helios has been portrayed in many video games, such as in Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;God of War: Chains of Olympus,&quot; &quot;God of War II&quot; and &quot;God of War III&quot; where the character is a boss and plays an antagonist role against Kratos. He also appears in the Wii game Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, where the second Seed guardian is named after Helios, and as an AI in the Deus Ex series.

<text>The metre per second is the unit of both speed (a scalar quantity) and velocity (a vector quantity, which has direction and magnitude) in the International System of Units (SI), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second. According to the definition of metre, is exactly formula_1 of the speed of light.

The SI unit symbols are m/s, m·s−1, m s−1, or .

== Conversions ==
 is equivalent to:
: = 3.6 km/h (exactly)
: ≈ 3.2808 feet per second (approximately)
: ≈ 2.2369 miles per hour (approximately)
: ≈ 1.9438 knots (approximately)

1 foot per second = (exactly)

1 mile per hour = (exactly)

1 km/h = (exactly)

== Relation to other measures ==
The benz, named in honour of Karl Benz, has been proposed as a name for one metre per second. Although it has seen some support as a practical unit, primarily from German sources, it was rejected as the SI unit of velocity and has not seen widespread use or acceptance.

== History==
=== Hassenfeld Brothers ===
Three Polish-Jewish brothers, Herman, Hillel, and Henry Hassenfeld, founded Hassenfeld Brothers in Providence, Rhode Island, in late 1923, a company selling textile remnants. Over the next two decades, the company expanded to produce pencil cases and school supplies. On January 8, 1926, Hassenfeld Brothers was incorporated in Rhode Island; Hillel left for another textile business while Henry took charge of the corporation. They began making their own pencils after their pencil supplier began making pencil cases as well.

Hassenfeld Brothers produced modeling clay and then doctor and nurse kits as their first toys, and they became primarily a toy company by 1942. Hillel died in 1943 and Henry Hassenfeld became CEO, while his son Anthony Merrill became president. The company entered the plastic fields during World War II to support its toy line. The Hassenfeld brothers, immigrants from Ulanów, Poland, also spent the war years helping to rescue and employ fellow Jews from Ulanów; Jacob Klapper, a holocaust survivor born in Ulanów, recalled being told when he arrived in the United States that Hassenfeld Brothers would employ any survivor from Ulanów, no questions asked. Hassenfeld Brothers&#x27; first popular toy was Mr. Potato Head, which the company purchased from George Lerner in 1952. In 1954, the company became a Disney major licensee.

In 1960, Henry died and Merrill took over the parent company, and his older brother Harold ran the pencil-making business of Empire Pencil. Hassenfeld Brothers expanded to Canada with Hassenfeld Brothers (Canada) Ltd. in 1961. 

In 1962, Hasbro purchased the former Potter &amp; Johnston manufacturing company building on Newport Avenue in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The Pawtucket plant facilities were eventually expanded to over 300,000 square feet.

In 1963 the company introduced Flubber, but reports of sore throats and rashes from the product and knock-offs prompted an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and a voluntary recall by Hassenfeld Brothers. The company was approached in 1963 to license a toy based on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possibly short-lived television series. Instead, Hassenfeld Brothers produced the G.I. Joe toy in 1964 which they termed an &quot;action figure&quot; in order to market it to boys who wouldn&#x27;t want to play with dolls. In 1964 and 1965, G.I. Joe accounted for two-thirds of Hassenfeld&#x27;s sales.

=== Hasbro Industries ===
The company had previously sold toys under the Hasbro trade name, and it shortened its name to Hasbro Industries on July 12, 1968, and sold a minor stake in the corporation to the public. The Vietnam War was at its height in 1969, so Hasbro redesigned GI Joe to be less militaristic and more adventure-oriented. Its promotional efforts included the catchphrase &quot;Boy Oh Boy! It&#x27;s A Hasbro Toy!&quot; in television commercials and print ads. Also in 1969, Hasbro bought Burt Claster Enterprises which produced &quot;Romper Room&quot; and had just begun a Romper Room toy line. A month-long Teamsters strike and Far Eastern supplier troubles caused the company to post a $1 million loss for the year.

In 1970, Hasbro began a plan of diversification and opened the Romper Room Nursery School franchise chain to cash in on President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Family Assistance Plan which subsidized day care for working mothers. By 1975, the company had ended the nursery chain. Hasbro also entered the cookware field with the Galloping Gourmet line based on a television cooking show.

Two new 1970s toys were public relations disasters. One of the toys was named Javelin Darts which were similar to the ancient Roman &quot;plumbata&quot;. On December 19, 1988, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned lawn darts from sale in the United States due to their hazards as a flying projectile with a sharp metal point causing multiple deaths. The other toy was named The Hypo-Squirt, a hypodermic needle-shaped water gun tagged by the press as a &quot;junior junkie&quot; kit. Both were recalled. Romper Room and its toy line had continued success, although Action for Children&#x27;s Television citizens group considered the program to be an advertising channel for toys.

Merrill Hassenfeld took over as CEO in 1974, and his son Stephen D. Hassenfeld became president. The company became profitable once again but had mixed results due to cash flow problems from increasing the number of toys in the line to offset G.I. Joe&#x27;s declining sales. Hasbro ended the G.I. Joe line in 1975 because of the rising prices of plastic and crude oil. In 1977, Hasbro&#x27;s losses were $2.5 million, and the company held a large debt load. That same year, Hasbro acquired licensing rights to &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoon characters. With the financial situation poor, Hasbro&#x27;s bankers made the company temporarily stop dividend payments in early 1979. The toy division&#x27;s losses increased Harold Hassenfeld&#x27;s resentment regarding the company&#x27;s treatment of the Empire Pencil subsidiary as Empire received lower levels of capital spending relative to profits than did the toy division.

With Merrill&#x27;s death in 1979, Harold did not recognize Stephen&#x27;s authority as the successor to the chairman and CEO position. As a solution, Hasbro spun off Empire Pencil in 1980, which was the nation&#x27;s largest pencil maker, with Harold trading his Hasbro shares for those of Empire. Stephen then became both the CEO and chairman of the board. Between 1978 and 1981, Stephen reduced the Hasbro product line by one-third and its new products by one-half. Hasbro focused on simple, low-cost, longer life-cycle toys like Mr. Potato Head. Hasbro thus stayed out of the electronic games field which went bust in the early 1980s.

In 1982, Hasbro revived its G.I. Joe line with the help of Marvel Comics, as an anti-terrorist special forces team based on current events. Following an interest in Takara&#x27;s &quot;Diaclone&quot; and &quot;Micro Change&quot; toylines in the 1983 , the company licensed the toylines and subsequently launched the successful &quot;Transformers&quot; toy line along with a children&#x27;s animated TV series two years later. With the toys and TV series being popular, Stephen Hassenfeld posed with the toys for a &quot;People&quot; magazine cover photo.

In 1982, Hasbro produced the successful toy franchise &quot;My Little Pony&quot;. In 1983, they purchased GLENCO Infant Items, a manufacturer of infant products and the world&#x27;s largest bib producer, and Knickerbocker Toy Company, a struggling Warner Communications subsidiary. Hasbro paid 37% of its stock to Warner, which was paid into Hasbro&#x27;s executive-controlled voting trust, and also received a cash infusion. In 1984, Alan G. Hassenfeld took over as president from his brother Stephen, who continued as CEO and chairman. That same year, the company was the nation&#x27;s sixth best-selling toymaker, and then acquired the Milton Bradley Company, which was the nation&#x27;s fifth best-selling toymaker. This brought The Game of Life, Twister, Easy Money, and Playskool into the Hasbro fold and on September 10 transformed Hasbro into Hasbro Bradley. Stephen Hassenfeld became the merged company&#x27;s president and CEO, with Milton Bradley chief James Shea Jr. taking the chairman position. However, the executives clashed and Shea left after a few months, and Stephen and Alan returned to their previous positions.

=== Hasbro ===
==== 1985–2007 ====
On June 6, 1985, the company changed its name again to just Hasbro, Inc. The Jumpstarters toys were the subject of a lawsuit in 1985 when Hasbro sued a toy manufacturer for selling toys based on their Transformers design. Hasbro won the suit.

In the mid-1980s, Hasbro moved past Mattel to become the world&#x27;s largest toy company. Hasbro then moved to outsell Mattel&#x27;s Barbie in the fashion doll market with the 1986 introduction of Jem, a record producer/rock musician dual identity fashion doll. Jem initially posted strong sales but plummeted and was withdrawn from the market in 1987. Hasbro followed up in 1988 with Maxie, a Barbie-sized blonde doll, so that Barbie clothing and accessories would fit. Maxie lasted until 1990.

Under Alan&#x27;s initiative in the late 1980s, Hasbro moved to increase international sales by taking toys overseas that had failed in the US market and selling them for as much as four times the original price. This increased international sales from $268 million in 1985 to $433 million in 1988.

In 1988, Hasbro purchased part of Coleco Industries&#x27; indoor and outdoor children&#x27;s furniture and ride-on toy product lines for $21 million including two just closed manufacturing plants in Amsterdam, New York. In July 1989, Hasbro acquired bankrupt Coleco for $85 million. Stephen Hassenfeld died later that year with the company having gone from sales of $104 million in the year he took control to 1989 sales of over $1.4 billion.

Alan succeeded Stephen as chairman and CEO. In 1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka Corp. for $486 million, along with its units Parker Brothers, the maker of Monopoly, and Kenner Products. Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers were merged into one division. Alan moved to expand Hasbro overseas with new units in Greece, Hungary, and Mexico.

Alan saw the Far East as an important market to expand. In 1992, Hasbro purchased Nomura Toys Ltd. in Japan, and majority ownership of Palmyra, a Southeast Asian toy distributor. These increased the proportion of international sales from 22% in 1985 to 45% ($1.28 billion) in 1995. In 1993, Hasbro lost its bid for J. W. Spear &amp; Sons, a U.K.-based game maker, to Mattel.

In the US, Hasbro&#x27;s growth since 1980 was from acquisitions and the leveraging of the new assets. New product development was not as successful except for film and TV tie-in product lines with Jurassic Park and Barney. Thus, US sales were stagnant in the early 1990s, falling from 1993 to 1995. To turn domestic performance around in 1994, Hasbro merged the Hasbro Toy, Playskool, Playskool Baby, Kenner, and Kid Dimension units into the Hasbro Toy Group. Meanwhile, Mattel purchased Fisher-Price and retook the top spot in the toy industry.

Hasbro Interactive was started in 1995 and released the Monopoly game on CD-ROM. Mattel also proposed a merger that year, but was turned down by the Hasbro board in 1996 due to antitrust issues and Justice Department investigation into exclusionary policies between toy manufacturers and toy retailers, particularly Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

In 1998, Hasbro bought Avalon Hill for $6 million and Galoob for $220 million. That same year, Milton Bradley merged with Parker Bros. to form Hasbro Games. In 1999, Hasbro paid for rights to &quot;Pokémon&quot; toys. The same year, Wizards of the Coast was bought in a deal worth $325 million. Wizards of the Coast is now a subsidiary of Hasbro and has Avalon Hill as its division. In 2001 money-losing Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames, a French software concern, for $100 million. Hasbro entered the building block toy with its Built to Rule line in 2003, which did not hold together well or were too hard for the targeted age group, thus ended in 2005.

In 2004, the company entered into a deal with Paramount Home Entertainment to release its programs based on its games and toys on VHS and DVD.

==== 2008–2018 ====

In 2008, Hasbro acquired game maker Cranium, Inc. for $77.5 million. The deal was announced on January 4 and closed on January 25.

Hasbro and Universal Pictures signed an agreement in February 2008 to derive four films from seven Hasbro properties for production. In May, Bennett Schneir was hired to lead its Hasbro Films division, while Hasbro also reacquired series based on their properties from Sunbow Productions.

The year of his promotion to CEO of Hasbro, Brian Goldner was named CEO of the year by News Corporation affiliate website MarketWatch.com. Goldner became the first person not from the founding Hassenfeld family to hold the position.

In 2009, the Milton Bradley and Parker Bros. brands were retired after 25 years and eighteen years of Hasbro ownership respectively. That same year, Hasbro Studios was formed for TV development, production and distribution. On December 11, 2012, Hasbro transferred all entertainment divisions to Hasbro Studios, including their LA-based film group, and Cake Mix Studio, the company&#x27;s Rhode Island–based producer of commercials and short form content.

Hasbro collaborated with Discovery on The Hub, a cable television network targeting younger children and families, which launched on October 10, 2010. The venture found unexpected success with the revival of the &quot;My Little Pony&quot; franchise, &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, which became the network&#x27;s highest-rated program and attracted a significant cult following among teens and adults. The Hub was renamed to Hub Network in 2013, and was rebranded again as Discovery Family on October 13, 2014. In 2013, Hasbro renewed its deal to produce Marvel Comics and &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys through at least 2020.

In 2011, Greenpeace accused Hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in Indonesia. Hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy, earning the company praise from Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford, who said: &quot;The new Hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper in its toy packaging. Hasbro&#x27;s new commitments are great news for Indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them.&quot;

By April 2011, Hasbro started 360 Manufacturing Services, a contract OEM game manufacturing operating out of Hasbro&#x27;s USA plant. Having been absent from the building block market since the failure of the Built to Rule line, Hasbro re-entered the market with the Kre-O line in late 2011, starting with some &quot;Transformers&quot;-based sets.

In 2012, Hasbro received a $1.6 million tax credit from the state of Rhode Island with a promise to create 245 new jobs in the state. Instead, they laid off more than 125 workers. This was followed in 2013 with further layoffs of North American workers, amounting to 10% of its salaried employees. Meanwhile, CEO Brian Goldner signed a new five-year contract. As of fiscal year 2012, Goldner had a total calculated compensation of $9,684,285. On July 9, 2013, Backflip Studios sold a 70% stake in the company to Hasbro for $112 million in cash.

On November 6, 2012, it was rumored that the Walt Disney Company was discussing a multi-billion dollar deal to acquire Hasbro. While Hasbro declined to discuss the rumor, advisors stated there was &quot;absolutely nothing going on&quot; they knew of between the two companies. Additionally, financial analysts said the deal was illogical, as the rumor came out just a week after Disney had bought out Lucasfilm.

Hasbro was named by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, citing that the &quot;company enhanced its vacation policy by giving new employees three weeks off in their first year instead of having to wait five years.&quot;

On November 12, 2014, it was reported that Hasbro was in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation. The proposal reportedly calls for the combined company to take the name &quot;DreamWorks-Hasbro&quot; and for Jeffrey Katzenberg to become its chairman, but as a matter of policy, neither Hasbro nor DreamWorks publicly comment on mergers and acquisitions. Two days later, the talks were reported to have fallen through. The company has been owned by NBCUniversal since 2016.

On July 14, 2015, the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories, in Ireland and East Longmeadow, Massachusetts (including its 360 Manufacturing Services), to Cartamundi. The deal was set to close in sixty days. Hasbro signed a five-year deal with Cartamundi to produce their board games at the East Longmeadow plant.

With Mattel adding two competing lines, and the expiration of their Disney Princess license at the end of 2015, Disney gave Hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which led to a &quot;Descendants&quot; license. DCP was also attempting to evolve the brand from one of them less as damsels and more as heroines. In September 2014, Disney announced that Hasbro would be the doll licensee for the Disney Princess line starting on January 1, 2016.

On July 13, 2016, Hasbro acquired Dublin-based Boulder Media Limited and placed it under the control of its chief content officer. Hasbro announced that it would launch its own convention, named HasCon, and featuring &quot;all things Hasbro&quot; in 2016, with the inaugural event being held at the Rhode Island Convention Center in September 2017.

On November 15, 2017, Mattel rejected an offer from the company. At the time, Mattel&#x27;s worth was $5 billion, while Hasbro&#x27;s worth was about $11 billion. On February 27, 2018, &quot;Variety&quot; reported in a detailed article that Hasbro came close to buying Lionsgate (now Starz Entertainment), exploring options to expand its entertainment division and bolster its content production capabilities due to interest in film and television ventures, but the deal fell through.

==== 2018–present ====
On February 16, 2018, Saban Brands appointed Hasbro as the global master toy licensee for &quot;Power Rangers&quot; with a future collaboration and option to purchase the franchise. On May 1, 2018, Hasbro agreed to purchase &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and other entertainment assets from Saban Brands for $522 million in cash and stock with the licensing fee recently paid with credit. The sale, which also collaborated with &quot;My Pet Monster&quot;, &quot;Popples&quot;, &quot;Julius Jr.&quot;, &quot;Treehouse Detectives&quot; and additional properties, was expected to close in the second quarter until it was finished with Saban&#x27;s collab. On October 19, 2018, the company announced plans to cut jobs amounting to less than 10% of its 5,000-plus global workforce in response to changes in how consumers buy toys.

In 2018, Hasbro signed a number of licensing agreements for hospitality deals based on Hasbro brands. On May 1, 2018, the Monopoly Mansion hotel agreement was announced by Hasbro, with M101 Holdings overseeing construction and M101&#x27;s Sirocco Group assigned to manage the hotel when it opened in 2019. Hasbro granted Kingsmen Creatives a license to build a chain of NERF Action Xperience family entertainment centers, with the first to be opened in Singapore in fall/winter 2019. In November, the company issued a license for family entertainment centers to Kilburn Live, who were to launch a new division for the centers. That December, the company granted a license for theme parks to Imagine Resorts and Hotels, co-founded by Bruce Neviaser. Neviaser had previously co-founded Great Lakes Companies, which launched Great Wolf Resorts indoor waterpark resorts. On December 18, 2019, Hasbro and West Edmonton Mall announced that Galaxyland would get a makeover, with rides being redone and renamed to Hasbro properties. Construction was begun later that month and scheduled to wrap up in late 2020.

On August 22, 2019, Hasbro announced its purchase of Entertainment One for about US$4 billion. The deal was completed on December 30, 2019. On October 24, 2019, Hasbro announced the closing of Backflip Studios, while its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary purchased Tuque Games in October. On February 28, 2020, Hasbro announced that Campbell Arnott&#x27;s former CMO David McNeil had joined the company as the managing director for Pacific operations. On September 30, 2020, Renegade Game Studios announced they had acquired licensing for creating tabletop games for multiple Hasbro brands. Several of the games would be using the 5E role-playing system owned by Wizards of the Coast.

On February 25, 2021, during the 2021 Investor Event, Hasbro announced a company reorganization with three divisions: Consumer Products, Entertainment, and Wizards &amp; Digital. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that &quot;Hasbro&#x27;s net revenue fell 8% last year to $5.47 billion, due in part to retail shutdowns related to Covid-19,&quot; however, its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary &quot;posted revenue of $816 million last year, up 24% from 2019, fueled by what Hasbro says were record years for&quot; &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;ICv2&quot; reported, &quot;the WotC and Digital Gaming segment is over $112 million more than the operating profit for Hasbro&#x27;s entire consumer products segment&quot; and that &quot;Wizards of the Coast on its own is also more profitable than Hasbro&#x27;s consumer products segment [...]. From the outside, Hasbro looks like a toy company, but with these numbers, it&#x27;s revealed to be a geek game company with toy and entertainment divisions&quot;.

In April 2021, Hasbro agreed to sell eOne Music unit to Blackstone for $385 million, offloading part of the Entertainment One operations that it acquired in 2019. Hasbro&#x27;s longtime CEO Brian Goldner died on October 12, 2021, after a 7-year battle with cancer. Richard Stoddart served as the interim CEO of the company following Goldner&#x27;s death; Chris Cocks was named as Goldner&#x27;s successor on January 5, 2022, and became CEO on February 25, 2022. Cocks was formerly the president and chief operating officer of Wizards of the Coast, a division of Hasbro.

In June 2022, Hasbro defeated a board challenge from activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management LLC. The hedge fund company, which owns a 2.5% stake of Hasbro, had been pushing to spin out Wizards of the Coast &quot;into its own company in an attempt to create what they saw was more value by making a second publicly traded company with a more profitable line of business&quot;.
On November 17, 2022, Hasbro announced they had put Entertainment One up for sale. This includes their film and TV business but would exclude the company&#x27;s kids and family division, which would remain under Hasbro. On March 15, 2023, it was reported that Fremantle, Lionsgate and Legendary Entertainment are interested in the buyout. However, Fremantle dropped out of the bid while CVC Capital Partners and GoDigital Media Group joined in the bid for the eOne buyout. On April 20, 2023, it was reported that Hasbro was in talks with Throop on the possibility of buying the company back. On July 17, 2023, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Lionsgate was a frontrunner to acquire eOne.

On August 3, 2023, Hasbro announced that Lionsgate would acquire Entertainment One for $500 million, with the transaction closed on December 27, 2023. eOne was rebranded as Lionsgate Canada in 2024, the same year that it became a subsidiary of Lionsgate Studios. Hasbro kept eOne’s family brands and its stake in Astley Baker Davies, and created a division called Hasbro Entertainment later that month, which held Astley Baker Davies and Discovery Family; the company’s output agreement with Cartoon Network for the channel expires at the end of March 2025.

On December 12, 2023, TechCrunch reported that paperwork Hasbro filed with the SEC contained information announcing layoffs of 1,100 employees (20% of their entire workforce across all divisions) effective immediately. President and COO Eric Nyman left the company. Hasbro&#x27;s CEO, Chris Cocks, stated that this reduction is part of a broader cost-saving strategy, aimed at saving $350 million to $400 million by 2025, with a renewed focus on high-profit areas like licensing and entertainment, particularly in the Wizards of the Coast division. Hasbro also announced to have signed a deal with McFarlane Toys as part the latter&#x27;s Page Punchers line-up.

On February 13, 2024, following the completion of its sale of Entertainment One assets, Hasbro reported losses of $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.49 billion for the full year, resulting in its entire total net income from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2023 to plummet to $0. The company now plans to cut its costs by $750 million by December 31, 2024.

On July 18, 2024, Hasbro announced the appointment of two new leadership positions: Holly Barbacovi, former COO of Bungie, as Chief People Officer, and John Hight, previously the Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Warcraft Franchise at Blizzard Entertainment, as President of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming.

On November 20, 2024, Cocks announced to Bloomberg that Hasbro would stop co-financing future movies based on the company&#x27;s list of brands in order to focus on mobile games and digital entertainment, leaving film studios that hold the film rights to various Hasbro brands to exclusively finance such projects.

* &quot;Jenga&quot;

They also formerly sold:
* &quot;Brain Warp&quot; and its sister products which include &quot;Brain Shift&quot;, &quot;Brain Bash&quot;, &quot;Death Star Escape&quot;, &quot;Hyperslide&quot; and &quot;Torx&quot;. 
* &quot;Bull&#x27;s-Eye Ball&quot;

Hasbro also offers a memory game called &quot;Simon&quot; which involves memorising sequences of colors and lights.

In 1995, Hasbro began a short-lived video game development and publishing venture called Hasbro Interactive, but disbanded it in 2001 when it was bought by the now defunct Infogrames. Now Hasbro develops video games based on its brands through third-party developers and licensing strategies, notably with major American companies such as Activision, Electronic Arts, and THQ. Following the rise of smartphones and tablet PCs in the 2010s, as well as major video gaming publishers cutting back on releasing games based on licensed IPs for various reasons, such as economic slumps, several of Hasbro&#x27;s brands were licensed towards mobile game developers such as Gameloft, releasing their games under the label Hasbro Gaming.

On February 25, 2005, Hasbro announced that it would be introducing a musical toothbrush to the market. The &quot;Tooth Tunes&quot;, released in early 2007, transmits music from the jawbone to the ear when the bristles touch the teeth.

In November 2023, Hasbro signed a licensing deal with Ageless Innovation to design toys and games for people over 65. Hasbro will produce &quot;Generations&quot; versions of known games such as &quot;Scrabble&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;. The new versions will include larger fonts and game pieces as well as content that is relevant to different generations.

In January 2024, Hasbro launched a new line of &quot;Star Wars&quot; figures to join The Black Series and The Vintage Collection for the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. The line includes a Destroyer Droid that can roll. In the same month, Hasbro announced a pre-order for a new crowdfunding project; the creation of Omega Prime, a Transformer that is a combination of the iterations of Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.

In February 2024, Hasbro announced a new game, &quot;Life in Reterra,&quot; a Eurogame-style board game created by Eric M. Lang and Ken Gruhl.

== Criticism and controversy ==

In 2007, a workers&#x27; rights group investigated several of Hasbro&#x27;s Chinese suppliers and found that, in one instance, a toy factory in China&#x27;s Guangxi Province had hired 1000 junior high school students. The same group discovered other widespread labor violations, including unsafe working conditions, mandatory overtime, verbal abuse and sexual harassment of employees. Hasbro issued a statement, saying that it would &quot;act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes&quot; and had &quot;increased the intensity of [its] ongoing safety review efforts.&quot; Critics pointed out that Hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories. Hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors. These auditors make unannounced visits to the East Asian subcontractors. Reports then emerged that the factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors.

Hasbro has also been criticized for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups. For example, a letter spread widely on social media in November 2012 written by a six-year-old Irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game &quot;Guess Who?&quot; This garnered attention in the press after the girl&#x27;s mother posted the exchange on her blog. &quot;Guess Who?&quot; had previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of 24 images.

Hasbro primarily sells toys directed at either the girl or boy markets. As such, there have been criticisms that Hasbro&#x27;s toys reinforce gender stereotypes. For example, in December 2012, 13-year-old McKenna Pope started a campaign on Change.org, calling on the company to create a &quot;boy-friendly&quot; version of the popular Easy-Bake Oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials. Within a week, over 30,000 people signed her petition.

Hasbro was criticized for &quot;sexist&quot; product design when its 2015 &quot;Star Wars&quot; Monopoly board game failed to feature Rey, the female protagonist in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, while including all of the supporting male characters. Hasbro explained that Rey was left out of the Monopoly game to avoid spoilers, because the game was released months before the movies. On January 5, 2016, Hasbro announced that Rey would be included in future versions. Hasbro later stated that it struggled to distribute the updated Monopoly game that includes the Rey piece, because retailers (especially in the United States) showed &quot;insufficient interest&quot; after having already purchased stock of the first release.

On October 2, 2015, Lorraine Markham sued Hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her. She was seeking a declaration from the U.S. District Court in Providence that her husband Bill Markham was the sole creator of &quot;The Game of Life&quot;.

On August 7, 2020, Hasbro produced a DreamWorks Animation Troll doll device for pre-school age children which had an unadvertised activator on the doll&#x27;s private parts that caused the device to emit several audio recordings that were questioned by some American mothers; in particular one of them posted a Facebook video stream that went viral. In it, she questioned whether the intent was to groom children for depravity: &quot;It makes a gasping sound when you touch her privates. And to me it&#x27;s just like sexual sounds, and it&#x27;s so disturbing. This is 100% why I say that they have been GROOMING kids all along.&quot; A Hasbro senior officer for global communications quickly back-pedalled and protested that it was &quot;not intentional&quot; and the company removed the device from the marketplace. A writer for &quot;USA Today&quot; opined that &quot;We rate the claim that the doll was designed to groom children as PARTLY FALSE.&quot;

In late December 2022, continuing into 2023, Hasbro and subsidiary company Wizards of the Coast fell under a fire of backlash from Dungeons &amp; Dragons fans due to leaked information indicating the companies planned to revoke a longstanding open license and to replace it with one that imposed severe new regulations on content created under the previous license agreement. The legality of this move by Hasbro has been debated.

In 2023, subsidiary Wizards of the Coast hired several Pinkerton employees to seize the upcoming March of the Machine: The Aftermath card set for trading card game Magic: The Gathering from a YouTuber who had purchased them from a local game store and published their contents on YouTube ahead of release.

== Conventions ==
=== HasCon (2017) ===
HasCon was a fan convention created by Hasbro to promote its various licensed properties, including &quot;Transformers, G.I. Joe, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,&quot; and &quot;.&quot; It thus replaces the previous fan convention from Fun Publications, BotCon. However, Fun Publications&#x27; G. I. Joe Convention continued to be held as of 2017. It was subsequently announced that the first HasCon is scheduled for September 8–10, 2017, at the Rhode Island Convention Center. Meanwhile, Summer Hayes, LLC., which organizes My Little Pony Fair convention, has announced that their convention will not be held for 2017, and would collaborate with HasCon instead.

There was supposed to be a HasCon event in 2019 at the Rhode Island Convention Center and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, but it has since been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Hasbro Pulse Con (Since 2020) ===
Hasbro Pulse Con is a virtual convention held through the Hasbro Pulse website, following the cancelation of HasCon 2019 due the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, four yearly conventions were made at the moment.

=== Other ===
* BotCon (1994–2002, 2005–2016)
* OTFCC (Official Transformers Collectors Convention) (2003–2004)
* G.I. Joe Collectors Club (by Fun Publications, 2005–2016)

<text>Newark ( , ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New Jersey, the county seat of Essex County, and a principal city of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 311,549. The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 304,960 for 2023, making it the 66th-most populous municipality in the nation.

Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark is one of the oldest cities in the United States. Its location at the mouth of the Passaic River, where it flows into Newark Bay, has made the city&#x27;s waterfront an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey. Port Newark–Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the U.S. East Coast. Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States and has become one of the busiest.

Several companies are headquartered in Newark, including Prudential, PSEG, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Audible.com, IDT Corporation, Manischewitz, and AeroFarms. Higher education institutions in the city include the Newark campus of Rutgers University, which includes law and medical schools and the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies; University Hospital; the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and Seton Hall University&#x27;s law school. Newark is a home to numerous governmental offices, largely concentrated at Government Center and the Essex County Government Complex. Cultural venues include the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark Symphony Hall, the Prudential Center, The Newark Museum of Art, and the New Jersey Historical Society. Branch Brook Park is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation&#x27;s largest collection of cherry blossom trees, numbering over 5,000.

Newark is divided into five political wards (East, West, South, North and Central). The majority of Black residents reside in the South, Central, and West Wards of the city, while the North and East Wards are mostly populated by Latinos. Ras Baraka has served as mayor of Newark since 2014.

== History ==

Newark was settled in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert Treat from the New Haven Colony. It was conceived as a theocratic assembly of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came with different ideas. On October 31, 1693, it was organized as a New Jersey township based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a royal charter on April 27, 1713. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by the New Jersey Legislature&#x27;s Township Act of 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark&#x27;s Vailsburg.

The name of the city is thought to derive from Newark-on-Trent, England, because of the influence of the original pastor, Abraham Pierson, who came from Yorkshire but may have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire. But Pierson is also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named &quot;New Ark&quot; for &quot;New Ark of the Covenant&quot; and some of the colonists saw it as &quot;New-Work&quot;, the settlers&#x27; new work with God. Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references to the name &quot;New Ark&quot; are found in preserved letters written by historical figures such as David A. Ogden in his claim for compensation, and James McHenry, as late as 1787.

During the American Revolutionary War, British troops made several raids into the town. The city saw tremendous industrial and population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline in the second half of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots, which led to an increase in white flight, with 100,000 white residents leaving the city in the 1960s, though the exodus of white residents from the city had started after World War II as housing availability was limited in the city, while white residents were able to buy homes in the western suburbs of Essex County, where the population grew rapidly.

The city has experienced revitalization since the 1990s, with major office, arts and sports projects representing $2 billion in investment. The city&#x27;s population, which had dropped by more than a third from 1950 to its post-war low in 2000, has since rebounded, with 38,000 new residents added from 2000 to 2020.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , including of land and of water (6.72%). It has the third-smallest land area among the 100 most populous cities in the U.S., behind neighboring Jersey City and Hialeah, Florida. The city&#x27;s altitude ranges from 0 (sea level) in the east to approximately above sea level in the western section of the city for an average elevation of . Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the Passaic River, with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark&#x27;s high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest Hill, High Street, and Weequahic.

Until the 20th century, the marshes on Newark Bay were difficult to develop, as the marshes were essentially wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. During the 20th century, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was able to reclaim of the marshland for the further expansion of Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as the growth of the port lands.

Newark is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the Watchung Mountains), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial areas to the north. The city is the largest in New Jersey&#x27;s Gateway Region, which is said to have received its name from Newark&#x27;s nickname as the &quot;Gateway City&quot;.

The city borders the municipalities of Belleville, Bloomfield, East Orange, Irvington, Maplewood and South Orange in Essex County; Bayonne, East Newark, Harrison, Jersey City and Kearny in Hudson County; and Elizabeth and Hillside in Union County.

=== Neighborhoods ===
Newark is the second-most racially diverse municipality in the state, behind neighboring Jersey City. It is divided into five political wards, which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.

State law requires that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk. Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered.

Newark&#x27;s Central Ward, formerly known as the old Third Ward, contains much of the city&#x27;s history including the original squares Lincoln Park, Military Park and Harriet Tubman Square. The ward contains the University Heights, The Coast, historic Grace Episcopal Church, Government Center, Springfield/Belmont and Seventh Avenue neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only University Heights, a more recent designation for the area that was the subject of the 1968 novel &quot;Howard Street&quot; by Nathan Heard, is still in common usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue.

In the 19th century, the Central Ward was inhabited by Germans and other white Catholic and Protestant groups. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews, who were then replaced by African Americans. The increased academic footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification, with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward is the nation&#x27;s largest health sciences university, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School. It is also home to three other universities – New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University – Newark, and Essex County College. The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, four firehouses, and one branch library.

The North Ward is surrounded by Branch Brook Park. Its neighborhoods include Broadway, Mount Pleasant, Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section. Forest Hill contains the Forest Hill Historic District, which is registered on state and national historic registers, and contains many older mansions and colonial homes. A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North Ward had its own Little Italy, centered on heavily Italian Seventh Avenue and the area of St. Lucy&#x27;s Church; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically diverse.

The West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of Vailsburg, Ivy Hill, West Side, Fairmount and Lower Roseville. It is home to the historic Fairmount Cemetery. The West Ward, once a predominantly Irish-American, Polish, and Ukrainian neighborhood, is now home to neighborhoods composed primarily of Latinos, African Americans, and Caribbean Americans. Relative to other parts of the city, the West Ward has for many decades struggled with elevated rates of crime, particularly violent crime.

The South Ward comprises the Weequahic, Clinton Hill, Dayton, and South Broad Valley neighborhoods. The South Ward, once home to residents of predominantly Jewish descent, now has ethnic neighborhoods made up primarily of African Americans and Hispanics. The city&#x27;s second-largest hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, is in the South Ward, as are seventeen public schools, five daycare centers, three branch libraries, one police precinct, a mini-precinct, and three fire houses.

The East Ward consists of much of Newark&#x27;s Downtown commercial district, as well as the Ironbound neighborhood, where much of Newark&#x27;s industry was in the 19th century. Today, the Ironbound (also known as &quot;Down Neck&quot; and &quot;The Neck&quot;) is a destination for shopping, dining, and nightlife. A historically immigrant-dominated section of the city, the Ironbound in recent decades has been termed &quot;Little Portugal&quot; and &quot;Little Brazil&quot; due to its heavily Portuguese and Brazilian population, Newark being home to one of the largest Portuguese speaking communities in the United States. In addition, the East Ward has become home to various Latin Americans, especially Ecuadorians, Peruvians, and Colombians, alongside Puerto Ricans, African Americans, and commuters to Manhattan. Public education in the East Ward consists of East Side High School and six elementary schools. The ward is densely packed, with well-maintained housing and streets, primarily large apartment buildings and rowhouses.

=== Climate ===
Newark lies in the transition between a humid subtropical and humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa/Dfa&quot;), with cold winters and hot humid summers. The January daily mean is , and although temperatures below are to be expected in most years, sub- readings are rare; conversely, some days may warm up to . The average seasonal snowfall is , though variations in weather patterns may bring sparse snowfall in some years and several major nor&#x27;easters in others, with the heaviest 24-hour fall of occurring on December 26, 1947. Spring and autumn in the area are generally unstable yet mild. The July daily mean is , and highs exceed on an average 28.3 days per year, not factoring in the often higher heat index. Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year with the summer months being the wettest and fall and winter months being the driest.

The city receives precipitation ranging from per month, usually falling on 8 to 12 days per month. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on February 9, 1934, to on July 22, 2011. The January freezing isotherm that separates Newark into &quot;Dfa&quot; and &quot;Cfa&quot; zones approximates the NJ Turnpike.

== Demographics ==

Newark had a population of 311,549 in 2020. The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 305,344 for 2022, making Newark the 66th-most populous municipality in the nation. The city was ranked 67th in population in 2010 and 63rd in 2000.

From 2000 to 2010, the increase of 3,594 inhabitants (+1.3%) from the 273,546 counted in the 2000 U.S. census marked the second census in 70 years in which the city&#x27;s population had grown from the previous enumeration. This trend continued in 2020, where Newark had an increase of 34,409 (12.4%) from the 277,140 counted in the 2010 census, the largest percentage increase in 100 years.

After reaching a peak of 442,337 residents counted in the 1930 census, and a post-war population of 438,776 in 1950, the city&#x27;s population saw a decline of nearly 40% as residents moved to surrounding suburbs. White flight from Newark to the suburbs started in the 1940s and accelerated in the 1960s, due in part to the construction of the Interstate Highway System. The 1967 riots resulted in a significant population loss of the city&#x27;s middle class, many of them Jewish, which continued from the 1970s through to the 1990s. On net, the city lost about 130,000 residents between 1960 and 1990.

At the 2010 census, there were 91,414 households, and 62,239 families in Newark. There were 108,907 housing units at an average density of .

=== Race and ethnicity ===
===2020===
From the 1950s to 1967, Newark&#x27;s non-Hispanic white population shrank from 363,000 to 158,000; its black population grew from 70,000 to 220,000. The percentage of non-Hispanic whites declined from 82.8% in 1950 to 11.6% by 2010. The percentage of Latinos and Hispanics in Newark grew between 1980 and 2010, from 18.6% to 33.8% while that of Blacks and African Americans decreased from 58.2% to 52.4%.

At the American Community Survey&#x27;s 2018 estimates, non-Hispanic whites made up 8.9% of the population. Black or African Americans were 47.0% of the population, Asian Americans were 2.1%, some other race 1.6%, and multiracial Americans 1.1%. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 39.2% of the city&#x27;s population in 2018.

In 2010, 35.74% of the population was white, 58.86% African American, 3.99% Native American or Alaska Native, 2.19% Asian, .01% Pacific Islander, 10.4% from other races, and 10.95% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 33.39% of the population at the 2010 U.S. census.

The racial makeup of the city in 2000 was 53.46% (146,250) black or African American, 26.52% (72,537) white, 1.19% (3,263) Asian, 0.37% (1,005) Native American, 0.05% (135) Pacific Islander, 14.05% (38,430) from other races, and 4.36% (11,926) from two or more races. 29.47% (80,622) of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 49.2% of the city&#x27;s 80,622 residents who identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino were from Puerto Rico, while 9.4% were from Ecuador and 7.8% from the Dominican Republic. There is a significant Portuguese-speaking community concentrated in the Ironbound district. 2000 census data showed that Newark had 15,801 residents of Portuguese ancestry (5.8% of the population), while an additional 5,805 (2.1% of the total) were of Brazilian ancestry.

In advance of the 2000 census, city officials made a push to encourage residents to respond and participate in the enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates by the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.

At one time, there was an Italian American community in the Seventh Avenue neighborhood.

== Economy ==
More than 100,000 people commute to Newark each workday, making it the state&#x27;s largest employment center with many white-collar jobs in insurance, finance, import-export, healthcare, and government. Downtown Newark has more than of Class A office space and over of total office space. As a major courthouse venue including federal, state, and county facilities, it is home to more than 1,000 law firms. The city also has a significant number of college students, with nearly 50,000 attending the city&#x27;s universities and medical and law schools. Its airport, maritime port, rail facilities, and highway network make Newark the busiest transshipment hub on the U.S. East Coast in terms of volume.

Though Newark is not the industrial colossus of the past, the city does have a considerable amount of industry and light manufacturing. The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007. Grain comes into the facility by rail. The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark&#x27;s primary economy. In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.

Newark is the third-largest insurance center in the United States, behind New York City and Hartford, Connecticut. Prudential Financial, Mutual Benefit Life, Fireman&#x27;s Insurance, and American Insurance Company all originated in the city, while Prudential still has its home office in Newark. Many other companies are headquartered in the city, including IDT Corporation, NJ Transit, Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Manischewitz, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, and Edison Properties.

After the election of Cory Booker as mayor, millions of dollars of public-private partnership investment were made in Downtown development, but persistent underemployment continue to characterize many of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods. Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city&#x27;s population was impoverished.

Portions of Newark are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. The city was selected in 1983 as one of the initial group of 10 zones chosen to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the % rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in January 1986, the city&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in December 2023.

The UEZ program in Newark and four other original UEZ cities had been allowed to lapse as of January 1, 2017, after Governor Chris Christie, who called the program an &quot;abject failure&quot;, vetoed a compromise bill that would have extended the status for two years. In May 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that reinstated the program in these five cities and extended the expiration date in other zones.

Newark is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state&#x27;s Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit.

=== Technology industry ===
The technology industry in Newark has grown significantly after Audible, an online audiobook and podcast company, moved its headquarters to Newark in 2007. The company was later acquired by Amazon. Panasonic moved its North America headquarters to the city in 2013. Other technology-focus companies followed suit. In 2015, AeroFarms, a developer of an aeroponic technology for farming moved its headquarters from the Finger Lakes to Newark. By 2016, it had built the world&#x27;s largest vertical farm in a Newark warehouse. The company was recognized in 2019 by Fast Company as one of the world&#x27;s most innovative companies in data science. Broadridge Financial Solutions, a public FinTech company, announced a relocation of 1,000 jobs to Newark in 2017. In 2021, WebMD, an online publisher, announced that it will relocate and create up to 700 new jobs in the city.

In 2018, Newark was selected as one of 20 finalists for the location of Amazon HQ2, a new headquarters of Amazon. The advantages of Newark included proximity to New York City, lower land costs, tech labor force and higher education institutions, a major airport, and fiber optic networks. The extensive fiber optic networks in Newark started in the 1990s when telecommunication companies installed fiber optic network to put Newark as a strategic location for data transfer between Manhattan and the rest of the country during the dot-com boom. At the same time, the city encouraged those companies to install more than they needed. A vacant department store was converted into a telecommunication center called 165 Halsey Street. It became one of the world&#x27;s largest carrier hotels. As a result, after the dot-com bust, there were a surplus of dark fiber (unused fiber optic cables). Twenty years later, the city and other private companies began utilizing the dark fiber to create high performance networks within the city.

As a concentration of technology workforce increased and investments grew in the city, it created an ecosystem for technology startups. Newark Venture Partners, an early-stage venture capital and startup accelerator launched in 2017, invested $42 million in its first funding round in 97 portfolio companies. In 2021, its second funding round raised up to $85 million. VentureLink@NJIT, the state&#x27;s largest startup incubator, is located in New Jersey Institute of Technology campus. It has partnerships with international organizations such as National Association of Software and Services Companies of India. In 2021, HAX Accelerator, an early stage accelerator focused on hard tech startups, announced that it will create its US headquarters in Newark and build out a facility for industrial engineering, chemical engineering and systems integrators to fund industrial, healthcare, and green tech startups.

===Newark Retail Reactivation Initiative===
In the fall of 2023, in an effort to stimulate rental of empty storefronts along a parallel strip of Broad, Halsey and Washington streets, the city launched the Newark Retail Reactivation Initiative. The program makes monetary grants to certain qualifying businesses opening on Halsey and on other streets within the zone bordered by Broad Street to the east, Washington Street to the west, Washington Place to the north and William Street to the south.

On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan area and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985. Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements–larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.

The Panel system was the Bell System solution to the &quot;big city&quot; problem, where an exchange had to serve large numbers of subscribers on both manual as well as automatically switched central offices, without negatively impacting established user convenience and reliability. As originally introduced in these exchanges, subscribers&#x27; telephones had no dials and customers continued to make calls by asking an operator to ring their called party, at which point the operator keyed the telephone number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually.
Most Panel installations across the country were replaced by modern systems during the 1970s and the last Panel switch was decommissioned in the BIgelow central office in Newark in 1983.

The city is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council Plan C form of local government, which became effective as of July 1, 1954, after the voters of the city of Newark passed a referendum held on November 3, 1953. The city is one of 79 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the City Council, who are elected concurrently on a non-partisan basis to four-year terms of office at the May municipal election. The mayor is directly elected by the residents of Newark. The city council comprises nine members, with one council member from each of the city&#x27;s five wards and four council members who are elected on an at-large basis. The structure of the council was established after a 1953 referendum, in which more than 65% of voters approved a change from a five-member commission.

, the mayor of Newark is Ras Baraka, who is serving a third term of office ending on June 30, 2026. Baraka first took office as the city&#x27;s 40th mayor on July 1, 2014. Members of Newark&#x27;s Municipal Council are Council President C. Lawrence Crump (at-large), Patrick O. Council (South Ward), Carlos M. Gonzalez (at-large), Dupré L. Kelly (West Ward), Luis A. Quintana (at-large), Anibal Ramos Jr. (North Ward), Louise Scott-Rountree (at-large) and Michael J. Silva (East Ward), all serving concurrent terms of office ending June 30, 2026; the Central Ward seat is vacant.

The Central Ward seat that had been held by LaMonica McIver has been vacant since September 2024, when she took office to represent New Jersey&#x27;s 10th congressional district; as the vacancy was not filled within 30 days after her resignation, the seat will remain vacant until the November 2025 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the remainder of the term of office.

=== Federal, state, and county ===
Newark is split between the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 28th and 29th state legislative districts. Prior to the 2010 census, Newark had been split between the 10th Congressional District and the , a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections. As part of the split that took effect in 2013, 123,763 residents in two non-contiguous sections in the city&#x27;s north and northeast were placed in the 8th District and 153,377 in the southern and western portions of the city were placed in the 10th District.


=== Politics ===

On the national level, Newark leans strongly toward the Democratic Party. As of March 23, 2011, out of a 2010 census population of 277,140 in Newark, there were 136,785 registered voters (66.3% of the 2010 population ages 18 and over of 206,253, vs. 77.7% in all of Essex County of the 589,051 ages 18 and up) of which 68,393 (50.0% vs. 45.9% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 3,548 (2.6% vs. 9.9% countywide) were registered as Republicans, 64,812 (47.4% vs. 44.1% countywide) were registered as Unaffiliated and there were 30 voters registered to other parties.

In the 2024 presidential election, Republican nominee Donald Trump was the only Republican, since at least 2004, to obtain over 20.0% of the vote in Newark with 20.5%, correlating with the rightward shift of both New Jersey and the nation as a whole. At the same time, and while still winning by a wide margin, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was the only Democrat to receive under 80.0% of the vote since at least the same year, with 78.3%. Trump also received the most votes out of any Republican nominee compared to all elections since 2004, including himself in 2016 and 2020. with 13,754 votes. Overall, Newark experienced an approximate 8 point shift to the right from his performance in 2020. From 2016 to 2020, the city shifted right by about 6 points. In turn, from 2016 to 2024, Newark swung about 14 points to right.

=== Political corruption ===
Newark has been marred with political corruption throughout the years. Five of the previous seven mayors of Newark have been indicted on criminal charges, including the three mayors before Cory Booker: Hugh Addonizio, Kenneth Gibson and Sharpe James. As reported by &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;... every mayor since 1962 (except one, Cory Booker) has been indicted for crimes committed while in office&quot;.

Addonizio was mayor of Newark from 1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War II veteran, he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt and a part of the political machine of the era. In December 1969, Addonizio and nine present or former officials of the municipal administration in Newark were indicted by a Federal grand jury; five other persons were also indicted. In July 1970, the former mayor, and four other defendants, were found guilty by a Federal jury on 64 counts each, one of conspiracy and 63 of extortion. In September 1970, Addonizio was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and fined $25,000 by Federal Judge George H. Barlow for his role in a plot that involved the extortion of $1.5 million in kickbacks, a crime that the judge said &quot;tore at the very heart of our civilized society and our form of representative government&quot;.

His successor was Kenneth Gibson, the city&#x27;s first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud and bribery charges. During his tenure as mayor in 1980, Gibson was tried and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury.

Sharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by a federal grand jury sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.

== Education ==
=== Colleges and universities ===
Newark is the home of multiple institutions of higher education, including: a Berkeley College campus, the main campus of Essex County College, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), the Newark Campus of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (formerly University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey), Rutgers University–Newark, Seton Hall University School of Law, and Pillar College. Kean University is located in adjacent Union, New Jersey. Most of Newark&#x27;s academic institutions are in the city&#x27;s University Heights district. The colleges and universities have worked together to help revitalize the area, which serves more than 60,000 students and faculty.

=== Public schools ===
In the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, 13.6% of Newark residents ages 25 and over had never attended high school and 12.5% did not graduate from high school, while 74.1% had graduated from high school, including the 14.4% who had earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. The total school enrollment in Newark was 77,097 in the 2013–2017 ACS, with nursery and preschool enrollment of 7,432, elementary / high school (K–12) enrollment of 49,532 and total college / graduate school enrollment of 20,133.

The Newark Public Schools, a state-operated school district for two decades and until 2018, is the largest school system in New Jersey. The district was one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of 65 schools, had an enrollment of 40,423 students and 2,886.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.0:1.

Science Park High School, which was the 69th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 322 schools statewide, in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2010 cover story on the state&#x27;s &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot;, after being ranked 50th in 2008 out of 316 schools. Technology High School has a GreatSchools rating of 9/10 and was ranked 165th in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&#x27;s&quot; 2010 rankings. Newark high schools ranked in the bottom 10% of the &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; 2010 list include Central (274th), East Side (293rd), Newark Vocational (304th), Weequahic (310th), Barringer (311th), Malcolm X Shabazz (314th) and West Side (319th). Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg donated a challenge grant of $100 million to the district in 2010, choosing Newark because he stated he believed in Mayor Cory Booker and Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s abilities.

Charter schools in Newark include the Robert Treat Academy Charter School, a National Blue Ribbon School drawing students from all over Newark. It remains one of the top performing K–8 schools in New Jersey based on standardized test scores. University Heights Charter School is another charter school, serving children in grades K–5, recognized as a 2011 Epic Silver Gain School. Gray Charter School, like Robert Treat, also won a Blue Ribbon Award. Also, Newark Collegiate Academy (NCA) opened in August 2007 and serves 420 students in grades 9–12. It will ultimately serve over 570 students, mostly matriculating from other charter schools in the area.

=== Private schools ===
There are two Catholic high schools in Newark, both run by religious communities. Saint Benedict&#x27;s Preparatory School is a Roman Catholic school founded in 1868 and operated by the Benedictine monks of Newark Abbey, whose property encompass both sides of MLK Jr. Blvd. south of Springfield Avenue. Originally an all-boys high school, the 2020 closing of Benedictine Academy led to the decision to accept high school girls for the first time in the school&#x27;s history under a co-institutional model in which male and female students participate in activities together but are taught in separate classes. As of 2024, enrollment at Saint Benedict&#x27;s was just under a thousand students in grades K-12.

Saint Vincent Academy is an all-girls Roman Catholic high school founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and operated continuously since 1869.

Link Community School is a non-denominational coeducational day school that serves approximately 128 students in seventh and eighth grades. The Newark Boys Chorus School was founded in the 1960s. University Heights Charter School, which opened in 2006, taught 614 students in grades Pre-K–8 in 2014–2015.

== Public safety ==

=== Newark Department of Public Safety ===
In 2016, under Mayor Ras Baraka&#x27;s direction, the city consolidated the then-separate departments of Fire, Police, and Office of Emergency Management as divisions under the newly created Department Of Public Safety.

=== Fire department ===

The city is protected by more than 700 full-time, paid firefighters of the Newark Fire Division (NFD). Founded in 1863, the NFD operates out of 16 firehouses throughout the city that are organized into 4 firefighting battalions (Battalions 1,3,4, and 5), with each Battalion Chief under the command of a deputy chief/tour commander. There is also a Safety Battalion Chief, Battalion 2, and a Special Operations Battalion Chief, Battalion 6, on duty 24/7. The NFD operates 16 engine companies, 8 ladder companies, 1 rescue company, an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Collapse Rescue Unit (Rescue 2), a USAR Collapse Rescue Shoring Unit, 2 fire boats, a scuba diving unit, a mobile medical ambulance bus, an air cascade unit, a foam unit, a quick attack response vehicle (QRV 1), a mobile command unit, 3 HazMat units, and numerous special, support, and reserve units. The NFD responds to approximately 45,000 emergency calls annually. In 2006, the NFD responded to 2,681 fire and hazardous condition calls. The department is a member of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which includes nine North Jersey fire departments.

=== Law enforcement ===

The Newark Police Division is a city-operated law enforcement agency. As of January 2014, the force had 1,006 officers in its ranks. The Director of Public Safety is Brian A. O’Hara.

The Essex County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, the New Jersey Transit Police Department (headquartered in Penn Plaza East) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department are also within their jurisdiction in the city, as are the New Jersey State Police. In April 2014, it was announced that the State Police would play a more prominent role in patrolling the streets of the city under the &quot;TIDE-TAG&quot; program. The Essex County College Police Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology Police Department and Rutgers University Police Department patrol their respective college campuses in the city. Conrail and Amtrak Police patrol their respective rail yards and property.

In 2018, the Newark Police began a de-escalation training program, which they credit for the achievement of no officer firing their weapon on duty in all of 2020.

=== Emergency management ===
The city&#x27;s Office of Emergency Management (OEM) purpose is to facilitate coordination of emergency response activities and provide available emergency management resources for support of emergency response activities within the city. The OEM establishes policies, procedures, and mechanisms for the centralized coordination and emergency management of response efforts and the effective collection, processing, and dissemination of pertinent information during potential or actual emergency situations. OEM coordinates the distribution of commodities between the county and municipal agencies and ensures all emergency management capabilities are tested, evaluated, and updated for immediate implementation.

=== Emergency Medical Services ===
University Hospital EMS (UH-EMS) operates the EMS system for the city. The department operates a fleet of six BLS units staffed with two EMTs 24/7, supplemented by four 12-hour &quot;power&quot; units (operated during peak demand time hours), five ALS units staffed with two paramedics (one of which is stationed at Newark International Airport and covers the airport and Port Newark-Elizabeth, and frequently responds into the City of Elizabeth), and a critical care unit staffed by a paramedic and an RN. With distinction they also staff the only hospital based heavy rescue truck in the country, known as University EMS Rescue 1. The EMS system is one of the busiest systems per unit in the nation. On average, a BLS unit may be sent to 20–25 dispatches in a 12-hour shift. They also provide the medical staffing for Northstar and Southstar, which are the two NJ State Police medevac helicopters, staffing one flight nurse and a flight medic around the clock. The EMS system in Newark handles upwards of 125,000 requests for service annually. The Ironbound Volunteer Ambulance Squad helps by handling BLS calls in the East Ward when members are on duty and has been in operation since 1969. The Vailsburg Volunteer Rescue Squad helps by handling BLS calls in the West Ward when members are on duty and has been in operation since 2019.

=== Crime ===
In 1996, &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Newark &quot;The Most Dangerous City in the Nation.&quot; By 2007, the city recorded a total of 99 homicides for the year, representing a significant drop from the record of 161 murders set in 1981. The number of murders in 2008 dropped to 65, a decline of 30% from the previous year and the lowest in the city since 2002 when there were also 65 murders.

In 2010, Newark recorded 90 homicides. March 2010 was the first calendar month since 1966 in which the city had not recorded a homicide. Overall, there was a 6% increase in crime numbers over the previous year, including a rise in carjackings for the third straight year, with the 337 incidents raising concerns that the city was returning to its status as the &quot;car theft capital of the world&quot;. Along with the increase in crime, the Newark Police Department increased its recovery of illegally owned guns in 2011 to 696, up from 278 in 2010. The Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded 94 homicides in 2011 and 95 in 2012. In 2012, CNNMoney ranked Newark as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States, based on numbers by FBI Crime in the United States 2011 report. The city had 10 murders in 10 days during the period ending September 6, 2013, a statistic largely attributed to a reduction of the police force. In 2013 Newark recorded 111 homicides, the first year ending in triple digits in seven years and the highest tally since 1990, accounting for 27% of all murders statewide. In 2014, the total number of homicides in Newark was 93, while Essex County as a whole had 117 murders. &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; reported that there were 105 homicides in the city in 2015. The city had 72 homicides in 2017, a statistic described as a &quot;historic low&quot;, and a sharp drop from the 96 murders recorded in the city in 2016. The Newark Police reported 69 homicides for 2018. As of August 13, 2019, after a period of 50 consecutive days without a homicide, a total of 34 had been recorded. In 2022, there were 51 homicides; in 2023, there were 47.

===Water contamination===

In Newark, lead concentrations in water accumulated for several years in the 2010s as a result of inaccurate testing and poor leadership. Newark&#x27;s problem came from a negligence of officials who the city relied on to ensure clean water. The decrease in the quality of the water was due to several factors that were all somewhat interconnected. Lead service pipes that carry water were installed in Newark.

When this was recognized, the city had CDM Smith, a construction company that specializes in water systems, conduct a study to determine whether or not the water quality was safe enough to drink. The results revealed that the water was in fact safe to drink, but the results were severely skewed. This is because the city receives water from two water supplies: the Pequannock Treatment Plant and the Wanaque Treatment Plant. In some sampling rounds, only areas served by Pequannock were sampled, and in other rounds, only areas served by Wanaque were sampled, and each had different contaminant control systems in place that varied in their effectiveness. The Pequannock supply uses pH adjustments and silica for its corrosion control method, which worked for two decades before losing its effectiveness in 2016, while the Wanaque supply uses orthophosphate, a much more effective precaution.

In addition to this, the EPA requires that samples of drinking water be taken after no one has turned on a faucet for at least eight hours. Therefore, if high levels of lead do not show up in that initial sample, no further samples are required. This sample only represents the water closest to the faucet, that has not been stagnant in lead service lines, whereas the stagnant water in the lead piping may not be drawn until much later.

Top officials in Newark denied that their water system had a widespread lead problem, declaring on their website that the water was absolutely safe to drink. Even after municipal water tests revealed the severity of the problem Mayor Ras Baraka mailed a brochure to the cities residents that the water meets all federal standards. Although the city called an emergency declaration to allow them to purchase and distribute water filters for faucets but many of these were faulty. The city has received three noncompliance notices for exceeding lead levels since 2017 and continues to fight its lead problem.

In October 2024, it was announced that the company contracted to replace a portion of the lead service lines in Newark, JAS Group Enterprise, Inc. lied and falsified reports while not conducting the work they were hired to do at 1,500 Newark properties. From 2020 to 2022, the company falsified reports by submitting photographs to inspectors of copper pipes and claimed that they were the new replacement pipes they had installed. The company &quot;deliberately instructed workers to leave lead pipes in the ground&quot; and where copper pipes already existed, workers were allegedly instructed to polish and clean them to make them look like newly installed replacement lines. Mayor Baraka claimed the health of Newark residents isn&#x27;t in danger due to the orthophosphate that was added to the water to prevent lead leaching and that it is working as intended. City officials stated that they excavated 400 sites where the company claimed to have performed work and 28 of those sites still had lead pipes. The EPA stated that any lead pipes that were discovered have been replaced.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===

Newark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, making it a significant gateway into the New York metropolitan area and the Mid-Atlantic U.S.

Newark Liberty International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the New York metro area and the 15th-busiest in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic). Newark Airport was the New York City area&#x27;s first commercial airport, opened in 1928 on land reclaimed by the Port Authority.

Port Newark, on Newark Bay, is the 15th-busiest port in the world and the largest container port on the East Coast of the United States. In 2003, the port moved over $100 billion in goods.

==== Early modes of transport ====

The Morris Canal, stretching to Newark from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River, was completed in 1831 and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from Pennsylvania to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the New York metropolitan area. The canal&#x27;s completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly increasing the population for years to come. After the canal was decommissioned, its right of way was converted into the Newark City Subway, now known as the Newark Light Rail. Many of the subway stations still portray the canal in its original state, in the form of mosaic works.

As the city became increasingly congested further means of transportation were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse. The trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.

==== Roads and highways ====
, the city had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Essex County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Newark is served by numerous highways including the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Interstate 280, Interstate 78, the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 22, and Route 21. Newark is connected to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan by the Pulaski Skyway, spanning both the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, which was first constructed in 1938 and recently underwent a $900 million renovation project.

Local streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue.

In a city extensively served by mass transit, 44.2% of Newark residents did not have a car as of the 2000 Census, ranked second in the U.S. to New York City in the proportion of households without an automobile among cities with more than 250,000 people. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, the number of households without an automobile has decreased to 39.2%. The same year, the average Newark household owned .89 cars compared to a national average of 1.8 cars per household.

==== Public transportation ====

Newark Penn Station, situated just east of downtown, is the city&#x27;s major train station. It is served by the PATH&#x27;s interurban Newark–World Trade Center line to Jersey City and Manhattan, three NJ Transit Rail Operations (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak intercity rail service. It was designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark&#x27;s northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built in the bed of the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark&#x27;s downtown area. The city&#x27;s third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark.

Bus service in Newark is provided by NJ Transit. Newark is served by NJ Transit bus routes 1, 5, 11, 13, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44, 59, 62, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 79, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96, 99, 107, 108, and 109. The 109 runs in North Newark. The 107 and 108 routes run to New York City. Bus route 319 is an express route to Atlantic City.

The &quot;go bus 25&quot; and &quot;go bus 28&quot; are bus rapid transit lines through the city to Irvington, Bloomfield and Newark Liberty International Airport.

==== Modal characteristics ====
According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 53.7% of working city of Newark residents commuted by driving alone, 9.3% carpooled, 27.3% used public transportation, and 6.5% walked. About 5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 5.7% of working Newark residents worked at home.

=== Healthcare ===
Newark is home to five hospitals. University Hospital, an independent institution that is a teaching hospital of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, has been the busiest Level I trauma center in the state. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is the largest hospital in the city and is a part of Barnabas Health, the state&#x27;s largest system of hospital and health care facilities. Beth Israel is also one of the oldest hospitals in the city, dating back to 1901. This 669-bed regional facility is also home to the Children&#x27;s Hospital of New Jersey. Catholic Health East operates Saint Michael&#x27;s Medical Center. Columbus Hospital LTACH is a longterm acute care hospital designed to focus on patients with serious and complex medical conditions that require intense specialized treatment for an extended period of recovery time. Hospitals which have been closed in recent years include the Saint James Hospital, Mount Carmel Guild Hospital and the United Hospitals Medical Center.

In 2016, annual testing of the water in Newark&#x27;s public schools revealed elevated lead levels; more than 30 schools shut off their water fountains and turned to bottled water. In August 2019 the crisis over lead contamination in drinking water resurfaced because of new warnings from federal environmental officials. It is believed that the contamination was caused by aging lead pipes and changes in the water supply that makes the water more corrosive, causing lead from the pipes to be spread to the water inside. In August 2019, New Jersey began supplying water bottles to Newark residents in certain designated neighborhoods. On August 26, 2019, Newark officials announced a $120 million plan to expedite replacing the city&#x27;s lead service lines in under three years. The 29,000 families affected by the contaminated water were provided with filters and bottled water. After testing in September, it was found that the filters were successful in 97% of homes tested, though bottled water would still be made available to those who request it. Long term-plans include the replacement of lead service lines from the water supply to homes.

== International relations ==
The Consulate-General of Ecuador in New Jersey is at 400 Market Street. The Consulate-General of Portugal in Newark is at the main floor of the Newark Legal Center at One Riverfront Plaza. The Consulate-General of Colombia is at 550 Broad Street. The Vice Consulate of Italy was at 1 Gateway Center, until it was closed in 2014 for economic reasons.

Pope John Paul II visited the city in 1995, at which time he elevated the city&#x27;s cathedral to a basilica to become the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. In 2011, the Dalai Lama was guest of honor at the Newark Peace Education Summit.

<text>Yeshiva University is a private Orthodox Jewish university with four campuses in New York City. The university&#x27;s undergraduate schools—Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women, Katz School of Science and Health, and Sy Syms School of Business—offer a dual curriculum inspired by Modern–Centrist–Orthodox Judaism&#x27;s &quot;hashkafa&quot; (philosophy) of &quot;Torah Umadda&quot; (&quot;Torah and secular knowledge&quot;), combining academic education with the study of the Torah.

The majority of students at the university identify as Modern Orthodox. The undergraduate body is entirely Jewish, while most of the graduate students, especially at the Cardozo School of Law, the Sy Syms School of Business, and the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, are not Jewish.

Yeshiva University is an independent institution chartered by New York State. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==

Yeshiva University has its roots in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva founded in 1886 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a cheder-style elementary school founded by Eastern European immigrants that offered study of Talmud along with some secular education, including instruction in English. The rabbinical seminary was chartered in 1897.

When Lamm took office in 1976, Yeshiva was facing a serious financial crisis. As a result, some of the schools and programs had to be consolidated or closed. The renowned Belfer Graduate School of Science was closed in 1978. Once this was stabilized, additional divisions were added: For example, the Sy Syms School of Business, with divisions for both the undergraduate men and women was opened in 1988. At this time, many of the undergraduate students began to spend their first year (or more) studying in yeshivot and other schools in Israel], which has become an almost universal practice, and a Joint Israel Program regulating these studies was established to allow them to receive credit for this year at Yeshiva. RIETS also maintains a campus in Jerusalem, and many of the rabbinic students spend a year studying there as well. Over the course of Lamm&#x27;s tenure, enrollment grew considerably to over 2000 undergraduate students. In addition to its undergraduate schools and affiliates, Yeshiva maintains graduate schools in Jewish studies, Jewish education and administration, social work, psychology, law, and medicine. There are over fifteen schools in total. In addition, numerous joint undergraduate-graduate programs with other schools in the New York area and beyond are maintained. The Yeshiva University Museum, an affiliate of the school, is now one of the components of the Center for Jewish History, located in downtown Manhattan.

Under Joel&#x27;s leadership, Yeshiva University&#x27;s endowment was invested in high-risk investments, including the funds of Bernard Madoff. Losses of at least $110 million resulted. In early 2014, Moody&#x27;s lowered the school&#x27;s bond rating by five steps to B1, junk bond level. To raise funds and cut costs, Yeshiva University has sold off real estate, and transferred control of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to Montefiore Medical Center.

Joel created the Yeshiva University Center for the Jewish Future, folding other programs, both from within and from outside YU, into it.

In December 2012, Joel apologized over allegations that two rabbis at the college&#x27;s high school campus abused boys there in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Investigations into these allegations by &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; and a law firm hired by the university found &quot;multiple instances in which the university either failed to appropriately act to protect the safety of its students or did not respond to the allegations at all.&quot; These allegations led to a 380 million dollar lawsuit by former students. The case has since been dismissed.

In 2012 the Middle States Commission on Higher Education warned the university &quot;that its accreditation may be in jeopardy because of insufficient evidence that the institution is currently in compliance with Standard 10 (Faculty) and Standard 14 (Assessment of Student Learning).&quot; On June 26, 2014, the Middle State Commission on Higher Education, which accredits the university &quot;reaffirmed accreditation&quot;, but requested a progress report &quot;evidence that student learning assessment information is used to improve teaching and learning.&quot; This was accepted by the commission on November 17, 2016 (wherein the university met the minimum requirements for accreditation).

In January 2016, the university disclosed plans to cede almost half of its $1 billion endowment to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, as the medical college enters a separate joint venture with Montefiore Health System.

In the 2020–2021 school year, Yeshiva University enrolled approximately 2,250 undergraduate students, and 2,700 graduate students. It is also home to affiliated high schools—Yeshiva University High School for Boys and Yeshiva University High School for Girls—and the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). It conferred 1,822 degrees in 2007 and offers community service projects serving New York, Jewish communities, the United States and Canada. As of 2015, the university had run an operating deficit for seven consecutive years. In 2014, it lost $84 million, and in 2013, it suffered a loss of $64 million.

The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s 2025 &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; ranked Yeshiva University 98th (tie) in National University.

In 2023, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Yeshiva University as: No. 226 in &quot;Top colleges 2023&quot;, No. 118 in Private Colleges, No. 143 in Research Universities, and No. 82 in the Northeast. Nationally, Yeshiva was ranked 138th by the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; World University Rankings, and internationally it is ranked in the 900s by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#x27;s &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; and 369th in the world by the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;.

==Campuses==

The university&#x27;s main campus, Wilf Campus, is located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of upper Manhattan. Yeshiva University&#x27;s main office is located within the Wilf Campus, at 500 185th St. A 1928 plan to build a spacious Moorish Revival campus around several gardens and courtyards was canceled by the Great Depression of 1929 after only one building had been erected. Building continued after the Depression in modern style and by the acquisition of existing neighborhood buildings.

Since it was founded in 1886, Yeshiva University has expanded to comprise some twenty colleges, schools, affiliates, centers, and institutions, with several affiliated hospitals and healthcare institutions. It has campuses and facilities in Manhattan (Washington Heights, Murray Hill, Greenwich Village), the Bronx, Queens, and Israel.

The Yeshiva University Museum is a teaching museum and the cultural arm of Yeshiva University. Founded in 1973, Yeshiva University Museum is AAMG accredited and aims to provide a window into Jewish culture around the world and throughout history through multi-disciplinary exhibitions and publications.

The university&#x27;s building in Jerusalem, in the Bayit VeGan neighborhood, contains a branch of the rabbinical seminary and an office coordinating the S. Daniel Abraham Israel Program. Under the latter, first year students studying in selected Israeli Yeshivot are considered YU undergraduates.

==Student life==
===Student publications===
The undergraduate university newspaper is &quot;The Commentator&quot;, and the newspaper for Stern College is &quot;The Observer&quot;. Law students at Cardozo also edit and publish five law journals. There are numerous other publications on a wide range of topics, both secular and religious, produced by the various councils and academic clubs, along with many official university publications and the university press. The call letters of the student radio station are WYUR, and it is currently an Internet-only station.

===LGBTQ+ club controversy and lawsuit===

Yeshiva University has been involved in legal proceedings since April 2021 after it blocked official recognition of a Pride Alliance club for undergraduate LGBTQ+ students and their allies.

Controversy over LGBTQ-supportive undergraduate groups has been ongoing since at least 2009, when students created a &quot;Tolerance Club.&quot; Its purpose was to promote acceptance of diversity of people within the Yeshiva University community. A founding member said that the group had &quot;determined that the school’s lack of diversity has fostered significant insensitivity to those outside of the mainstream Y.U. culture&quot; and aimed to address that issue. The group&#x27;s members included undergraduates at both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s campuses. Although not organized to address LGBTQ issues specifically, the group&#x27;s promotion of tolerance for sexual and gender diversity generated controversy on the Yeshiva University campus; the student newspaper reported that the administration quashed a panel discussion because they objected to one of the speakers, a gay Orthodox rabbi. This controversy came to a head when the Tolerance Club sponsored a panel discussion entitled &quot;Being Gay in the Orthodox World&quot; in December, 2009. Several hundred people attended this panel discussion. Numerous Jewish news sources covered the panel and the conflict that enveloped the Yeshiva campus in its wake, and the Tolerance Club disbanded in May 2010.

A decade later, in 2021, undergraduate students sued the university for refusing to recognize a new LGBTQ+ student group, YU Pride Alliance. The university has retained the pro-religious practice law firm Becket Law as its counsel. A New York court ruled in June 2022 that the university must recognize the undergraduate Pride Alliance. The university appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2022, and a temporary stay was issued by Justice Sotomayor. In a 5–4 decision the full court vacated the stay without prejudice, ruling the NY appeals process was incomplete and thus SCOTUS relief premature. In response, the university put all student clubs on hold in September 2022, pending resolution of their ongoing legal challenges. This lasted for a matter of weeks until an agreement was reached between the plaintiff and defense allowing other clubs to continue operating.

YU-affiliated Cardozo School of Law and the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology have publicly supported their own students and voiced their disapproval of the university&#x27;s position and legal response. At Cardozo School of Law, there has long been an officially recognized LGBTQ+ student group, and the Graduate School of Psychology also publicly supports the LGBTQ members of their communities.

The university announced on October 24, 2022 that they approved &quot;Kol Yisrael Areivim&quot;, a new LGBTQ student group. According to the university, this new group will be the &quot;approved traditional Orthodox alternative to its current LGBTQ student group, the YU Pride Alliance&quot;. There is still a dispute with the Pride Alliance who claimed the university&#x27;s action as a stunt and distraction. Administrators later described Kol Yisrael Areivim as &quot;a framework within which we hope to eventually form a club&quot;. Kol Yisrael Areivim is not included on official club lists, and it does not have any student members. On April 10, 2023, student journalist reported that Kol Yisrael Areivim was still yet to hold a single event.

===Undergraduate clubs and activities===
Student groups include the Yeshiva University Dramatics Society (YCDS), which puts on a performance each semester. A student-run group known as the Heights Initiative sponsors several outreach programs that work with the schools and organizations of the Washington Heights community. Student Government is run through YSU, YCSA, SOY-JSC, and SYMS. Additionally, these groups run community events like the annual Hanukkah Concert and a carnival celebrating Israeli Independence Day.

The Yeshiva University Medical Ethics Society (MES) is an undergraduate student-run organization of Yeshiva University which was founded by students in the fall of 2005 with the help of the Center for the Jewish Future toward the goal of promoting education and awareness of Jewish medical ethics in the university itself and the community at large. In the first several years, the group hosted a program of on-campus lectures in the field of medical ethics and Halakha (Jewish law). They also host genetic testing events to help combat the high incidence of various genetic diseases in the Jewish community.

===Athletics===
Yeshiva University includes a number of NCAA Division III-level sports teams. The teams, nicknamed &quot;The Maccabees&quot;, include: men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, golf, volleyball, wrestling, women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, fencing, soccer, tennis, and volleyball.

Because of Yeshiva&#x27;s dual curriculum, most of the sports teams practice at night, sometimes even as late as 11:00 pm. A few of the sports teams practice or work out before classes begin at 9:00 am; for example, the men&#x27;s basketball team routinely practices at 6:00 am.

Teams have participated in weekend tournaments outside of New York City, with athletes staying with local families in the area. This took place in Boston with the basketball and fencing teams, and in Hollywood, Florida with the baseball team in 2008. Some international students have participated in NCAA sports, with as many as nine different nationalities representing the school on the sports field.

====Baseball====
Two members of the Yeshiva Maccabees Baseball team were drafted out of college by professional teams of the Israeli Baseball League. Pitcher Aryeh Rosenbaum celebrated a championship with his team in the IBL&#x27;s first year.

====Basketball====
Yeshiva&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Basketball team is an annual playoff contender. The most successful eras for Yeshiva basketball in recent history have been at the start and end of the 1990s, as well as the dawn of the 2020s. Banners hang in the Max Stern Athletic Center commemorating seasons from both eras. The 2007–08 season had particular note as Yeshiva was home to the Skyline Conference&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. In 2018, the team won the Skyline Conference title in a game against SUNY Purchase, earning its first-ever NCAA berth and considerable media coverage. The current head coach of the team is Elliot Steinmetz, who has been with the team since 2014. Steinmetz succeeded Jonathan Halpert, the longest ever tenured NCAA men&#x27;s basketball coach in New York City at 42 years. Steinmetz, a practicing lawyer, has been especially successful at attracting high caliber athletes, recognizing that Yeshiva&#x27;s status in the Orthodox Jewish world means its athletics programs have unique access to a global talent pool from which to recruit players.

In the 2019–20 season, the men&#x27;s basketball team&#x27;s only loss was in the season opener, with the Maccabees going on to win the Skyline Conference championship. This was the second time in three years that the Maccabees made the NCAA Division III Tournament. They won the first two rounds, pushing them into the Sweet Sixteen (3rd round) for the first time in school history. Before they played in the third round, the NCAA tournament was canceled due to COVID-19. After a 7–0 season in 2020–21 also abbreviated by COVID-19, the Maccabees entered the 2021–22 season on a 36-game winning streak, the longest current streak in NCAA men&#x27;s basketball in any division, and were ranked #2 in the preseason by the Division III basketball website &quot;D3hoops.com&quot;. During this streak, the team was featured by media outlets as diverse as ESPN, CNN, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. After previous #1 Randolph–Macon lost in overtime, the Maccabees, with their winning streak having reached 44 games, inherited the #1 ranking in the &quot;D3hoops.com&quot; poll released on November 29, 2021, marking the first time any Yeshiva team had topped any national poll. The Maccabees received recognition from the ESPN and NBA Twitter accounts for their 50th straight win, the longest winning streak in NCAA Men&#x27;s Division III Basketball.

As of December 29, 2021, the men&#x27;s basketball team held the then-longest active winning streak in men&#x27;s college basketball with 50 consecutive wins. On December 30, 2021, the men&#x27;s basketball team lost their winning streak.

====Fencing====
One of the most successful teams in Yeshiva University sports history is the fencing team, known as the &quot;Taubermen&quot;, named after the coach of the team, Professor Arthur Tauber, who served as the head coach of the team from 1949 through 1985. Olympic gold medalist Henry Wittenberg was at one time the coach of the wrestling team.

====Tennis====
In 2014, the Men&#x27;s Tennis team won the Skyline Conference championship, becoming the first team in school history to advance to the NCAA tournament in any sport. In 2015, the Men&#x27;s Tennis team repeated as Skyline Conference champions and went back to the NCAA National Tournament, advancing to the second round. They lost to the defending National Champions Amherst College. In 2016, the Men&#x27;s Tennis team won the Skyline Conference a third year in a row and advancing to the NCAA D3 National Tennis Tournament again. The Men&#x27;s Tennis team repeated as Skyline Conference champions in 2017 and 2018 to extend this streak of success to five consecutive NCAA National Tournament appearances.

====Other sports====
Since 2010, the Men&#x27;s Cross Country and Men&#x27;s Volleyball teams have won multiple championships. Many of the Maccabees have gained attention nationwide, like Sam Cohen won an individual championship as well as Capital One Academic honors. Other attention grabbers come from Women&#x27;s Basketball and Women&#x27;s Fencing.

<text>Bausch &amp; Lomb (since 2010 stylized as Bausch + Lomb) is an American-Canadian eye health products company based in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of contact lenses, lens care products, pharmaceuticals, intraocular lenses, and other eye surgery products. The company was founded in Rochester, New York, in 1853 by optician John Bausch and cabinet maker turned financial backer Henry Lomb. Until its sale in 2013, Bausch + Lomb was one of the oldest continually operating companies in the United States.

Bausch + Lomb was a public company listed on the NYSE, until it was acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus in 2007. In May 2013, Canadian-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals announced that it would acquire Bausch + Lomb from Warburg Pincus for $4.5 billion in cash. The deal, which was approved by shareholders, closed on August 5, 2013. On May 6, 2022, the company completed an initial public offering and again became publicly traded. As of 2022, the company employs about 12,900 people, and manufactures and markets health care products directly or indirectly in approximately 100 countries.

==Company history==

===Early years===

In 1853, John Bausch and Henry Lomb, both German immigrants, established a small but ambitious workshop producing monocles in Rochester, New York. By 1861, their operation had expanded to manufacturing vulcanite rubber eyeglass frames and other precision vision products.

===Early growth of the company===
During the American Civil War, the Union blockade caused the price of gold and European horn to rise dramatically. This resulted in a growing demand for the Bausch + Lomb spectacles made from vulcanite.

In 1876, Ernst Gundlach joined the company as it began to manufacture microscopes. Later that year, the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company won a distinction at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company also produced photographic lenses (1883), spectacle lenses (1889), microtomes (1890), binoculars and telescopes (1893). From 1892 in cooperation with Zeiss in Germany, the company produced optical lenses. In this manner, at the end of the 19th century, the product range included eyeglasses, microscopes and binoculars, as well as projectors, camera lenses and camera diaphragms.
===Expansion of production at the beginning of the 20th century===
With the growth of the US army, under President Theodore Roosevelt and the buildup of the naval fleet, Bausch &amp; Lomb received the commission, through the supplier Saegmuller, to manufacture high-precision lenses for optical measurement and founded a joint venture with Saegmuller. At the same time as this new expansion, a research department with five members was started to develop new products and improve old ones. A new alliance with the Zeiss company in Germany ensured competitive advantages for the three participants, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Saegmuller and Zeiss, in terms of patent use and opening new markets. In 1902, William Bausch, the son of the founder, developed a process to create the desired lens shape directly by casting molten glass. Previously, the glass parts for the lenses had to be separated, ground and polished in a complicated process, and this brought significant savings in time and materials.

The company produced the first optical-quality glass in America during the early to mid-1900s. By the year 1903 the company began manufacturing microscopes, binoculars, and camera shutters.

===The First and Second World Wars===
The further development of the firm was affected by political events. Because of the World Wars and the consequent need for optical instruments such as field glasses, range finders, camera lenses, binocular telescopes, searchlight mirrors, torpedo tube sights, and periscopes, the product range could be considerably broadened. Until World War I, optical glass and the instruments made from it (including many military instruments) were often imported into most European and North American countries from Germany. The same was also true of chemical products and laboratory equipment. The outbreak of the war, with Germany&#x27;s new enemy status, created a scramble to rapidly enhance the domestic industries. In 1933, Bausch + Lomb started to honor outstanding high school science students with the Bausch+Lomb Honorary Science Award. In the 1930s, military products represented 70% of total production. The Ray-Ban brand of sunglasses was developed for pilots in 1936.

===After 1945===
At a time when the cinema was being superseded by television, Bausch &amp; Lomb developed improved optics for the CinemaScope process, which popularized the film-based anamorphic format and led most cinemas to double the widths of their screens.

In 1965 Bausch &amp; Lomb acquired the patent for the hydrogel contact lenses created by Czech scientists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím. In 1971, after three years of development work, two years for the medical approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration and an investment of three million USD, Bausch + Lomb launched contact lenses made of Poly-HEMA. In contrast to the contact lenses previously available, made of glass and Lucite (acrylic glass), the new lenses were softer. They were marketed under the brand name &quot;Soflens&quot;.

In the 1970s, the company was a major producer of spectrophotometers for the dye and chemical business, such as the Spectronic 20.

A massive restructuring of the company began in the mid-1980s. What had been the core divisions, the production of lenses for various purposes, were sold off. The sunglasses division was continued as Ray-Ban and kept selling well due to effective product placement. By the planned acquisition of other firms, such as Polymer Technology Corporation and Dr. Mann Pharma, existing business areas such as contact lens production were strengthened and new ones were initiated.

In 1997, as a result of a series of company acquisitions, the division for the manufacture of surgical products was established. The Ray-Ban brand was sold in 1999 to the Italian Luxottica Group.

===Company developments in recent years===
Since then, Bausch &amp; Lomb has developed into a globally operating company which is one of the largest producers of contact lenses. As of 2022, about 12,900 employees in approximately 100 countries work for the firm.

Competitors in the international eye care products market are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Allergan, Alcon, MSD-Chibret, CooperVision, Menicon Co., Hoya Corporation, EssilorLuxottica and Carl Zeiss Meditec.

In 2023, Bausch + Lomb Corp announced it would it would buy Xiidra from Novartis for $1.75 billion and pay additional $750 million in linked to future sales for Xiidra as well as two pipeline asset.

==Business areas==

Business areas are divided into three large divisions:
* Vision Care: contact lenses and eye-care products.
* Pharmaceuticals: medicines for various eye diseases and irritations.
* Surgery: aids and implants.

In the last few years, several business areas in the Vision Care division have been developed in the framework of product diversification. The manufacturing of contact lenses still accounted for 28% of Bausch &amp; Lomb&#x27;s turnover in 2001, making it its main business activity. The &quot;SofLens One Day&quot; soft contact lens range have to be changed every day. The product assortment includes higher quality lenses, such as the &quot;SofLens Comfort&quot; or &quot;Seequence&quot; lenses which can be changed after two weeks. The &quot;SofLens66 Toric&quot; were specially designed for people with astigmatism. Lenses from the &quot;Boston&quot; range have a higher oxygen permeability and are more suited for people with sensitive or dry eyes. The newest and most advanced lens range is called &quot;PureVision&quot;. These lenses are so oxygen-permeable that they can remain in the eye up to 30 days without being taken out at night. The second largest business, at 25%, is the manufacture of lens-care products. As well as simple combination cleaning and disinfectant solutions for both soft and hard lenses, pH neutral solutions are available for people with particularly sensitive eyes.

The Pharmaceuticals division manufactures pharmaceutical eye products, which account for 21% of turnover. This range covers prescription medicines for eye irritation, allergic reactions or high eye pressure. The development of this division was speeded up by take-overs of other firms.

The Surgicals division is divided into Refractive Surgery with 8% of turnover and Cataract Vitreotinal Surgery with 18%. The latter division is concerned with products for operations on glaucoma and cataracts and on the cornea, as well as implantable, interocular lenses. The Refractive Surgery division comprises mainly medical analysis devices and lasers required for eye surgery. In order to strengthen this division, the competing companies of Storz and Chiron were acquired.

===PureVision===
Bausch + Lomb was in a lawsuit with Novartis which claimed to have patents on a Bausch + Lomb product called PureVision. On June 26, 2002, a federal judge ruled that Bausch &amp; Lomb did infringe on Ciba Vision (a subsidiary of Alcon) patents.

On July 2, 2004, the company announced that it had licensed the intellectual property of Novartis. Bausch &amp; Lomb will pay the Ciba Vision unit of Novartis a royalty on net U.S. sales of its PureVision brand contact lenses until 2014 and on net sales outside the U.S. until 2016. But as of now, the brand FreshLook comes under Bausch and Lomb and Ciba manufacturers it.

===ReNu product recalls===
On April 11, 2006, Bausch &amp; Lomb stopped shipments of its ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced there was a high correlation between use of the product and cases of suspected fungal keratitis. The Centers for Disease Control found that &quot;nearly all of the company&#x27;s ReNu with MoistureLoc eye care products were linked to severe fungal eye infections&quot;. Two class action lawsuits have been filed against Bausch &amp; Lomb in relation to the eye fungus problems.

===Diversity===
Bausch &amp; Lomb received a 100% rating on the Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign starting in 2003, the second year of the report.

== Lawsuits ==
In 1994, several states in the US, including Texas, opened an investigation against Bausch &amp; Lomb. This investigation was based on the sale of duplicate contact lenses under different names and prices. Three different versions of the same contact lens were being sold under OptimaFW, Medalist lenses, and SeeQuence2. OptimaFW, the most expensive version, was available with a lifetime of one year, The mid-priced, Medalist lenses were sold with a lifetime of three months, and SeeQuence2, the least expensive, came with a lifetime of two to three weeks. By 1996, the company ensured that all three versions carried the OptimaFW tag and tried to standardize the packaging, but the pricing was still different. In 1996, the case was settled for $68 million. In 1997, 17 states pressured Bausch &amp; Lomb to stop the sale of duplicate lenses, deceptive practice stated in the court. The settlement also demanded the company to pay $1.7 million or $100,000 to each state to cover investigative costs.

In 2009, Bausch &amp; Lomb spent $250 million to settle six hundred lawsuits filed by consumers exposed to &quot;Fusarium&quot; keratitis, a fungal infection, after using its contact solution ReNu with MoistureLoc. Between June 2005 and September 2006, one hundred eighty cases were reported, out of which seven patients required eye removal and sixty required corneal transplants.

He is best known as the male half and primary songwriter of the pop rock duo Roxette, which he formed with Marie Fredriksson in 1986 and which was disbanded after her death in 2019. The duo achieved international success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with their albums &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; (1988) and &quot;Joyride&quot; (1991), and topped the charts in the US four times, most notably with &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; which was featured in the film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. Prior to the formation of Roxette, he had a successful career in his native Sweden as the frontman for Gyllene Tider. The band released three number-one albums during the early 1980s but disbanded shortly after their fourth album, &quot;The Heartland Café&quot; (1984).

In-between periods in Roxette and Gyllene Tider reunions, Gessle recorded numerous solo albums, both in Swedish and English. After Fredriksson&#x27;s illness in 2002 he released &quot;Mazarin&quot; (2003). The album was a critical and commercial success for Gessle and started the beginning of a long-term collaboration with the backing vocalist Helena Josefsson. With Fredriksson&#x27;s continued treatment and recuperation he made three more albums, &quot;Son of a Plumber&quot; (2005), &quot;En händig man&quot; (&quot;A handy man&quot;, 2007) and &quot;Party Crasher&quot; (2008). After Roxette&#x27;s Neverending World Tour finished in 2015 he produced another set of solo efforts, &quot;En vacker natt&quot; (2017), &quot;En vacker dag&quot; (2017) and &quot;Small Town Talk&quot; (2018). In 2016 he started using the pseudonym Mono Mind, first releasing a few singles before delivering a full album, &quot;Mind Control&quot;, in 2019. Gessle was the main songwriter for both Roxette and Gyllene Tider.

==Career==

Per Gessle was a founding member of Gyllene Tider, in 1976. They quickly became a popular group in Sweden, but after their fourth album, &quot;The Heartland Café&quot; (1984), sold poorly compared to their previous albums, the group disbanded. Gessle wrote. &quot;We decided to put Gyllene Tider to rest... until further notice.&quot; In 1982, Gessle released his first solo album, &quot;Per Gessle&quot; and after Gyllene Tider split-up his second album, &quot;Scener&quot;, quickly appeared in 1985.

Gessle and Marie Fredriksson had been friends for a few years before they came together as Roxette in 1986. After the success of their first hit &quot;Neverending Love&quot;, which was written by Gessle, they quickly recorded &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; using material which was originally intended for Per&#x27;s third solo album. Roxette went on to achieve four U.S. #1&#x27;s and two #2&#x27;s, with their albums &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot; attaining platinum status in a number of countries. After Roxette&#x27;s early nineties success, Per released a demo compilation album in 1992, &quot;På väg, 1982–86&quot;. After the release of &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; and subsequent world tour, Roxette took a break.

In 1996, after a reunion and subsequent tour of Gyllene Tider, Gessle recorded his first English solo album, using Brainpool and Gyllene Tider as backing musicians. Christoffer Lundquist from Brainpool would also come to collaborate with Gessle on later releases. &quot;The World According to Gessle&quot;, released in 1997, produced three singles, &quot;Do You Wanna Be My Baby?&quot;, &quot;Kix&quot; and &quot;I Want You to Know&quot;. The videos to all three songs were directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The album was re-released in 2008, with extra bonus material and demos. In 1997 &quot;Hjärtats trakt – en samling&quot; was released as a best-of album.
After Roxette released &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; (1999) and &quot;Room Service&quot; (2001) to moderate success, Fredriksson collapsed and was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2002. While Fredriksson received treatment for her illness, Gessle continued with his solo work. The subsequent album &quot;Mazarin&quot; (2003), was a critical and commercial success in Sweden and started the beginning of a long-term collaboration with the backing vocalist Helena Josefsson. Lundquist, now Gessle&#x27;s producer was looking for a female singer and picked Josefsson. She first came to the attention of Lundquist after she and her band Sandy Mouche wanted to record at Lundquist&#x27;s Aerosol Grey Machine (AGM) studio. &quot;I remember driving a car between Lund and Lomma when Christoffer called and wondered if I was interested in starting singing with Per who wanted a girl for his solo projects.&quot;, recalled Josefsson. &quot;Mazarin&quot; topped the charts in June that year, going five times platinum in 2004. The lead single from the album &quot;Här kommer alla känslorna (på en och samma gång)&quot; (&quot;Here comes all the emotions (at the same time)&quot;), is Gessle&#x27;s most successful song in his home country, spending two months at No. 1 and was certified platinum.

Following the success of the album, Gessle won numerous awards; four Grammis awards: Best Artist, Best Male Pop Performer, Best Composer and Best Song, three Rockbjörnen awards: Best Swedish Male Artist, Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Song, and a Guldälgen (The Golden Moose) Award for Best Song.

Also in 2004, saw Gessle and Gyllene Tider reunite for a 25th-anniversary celebration that included the band&#x27;s first album in 20 years, &quot;Finn 5 fel!&quot;, and another very successful tour in Sweden. They beat the Ullevi stadium attendance record, which was later broken by fellow Swede Håkan Hellström in 2016 (70,144), and the band played to almost half a million fans. As a result, the group was honoured with four awards in Sweden.

With &quot;Son of a Plumber&quot;, he continued his association with other Swedish artists. Jens Jansson along with previous collaborators Josefsson and Lundquist, helped Gessle create his second English album. Released in November 2005, the album contains a song dedicated to Gessle&#x27;s father who was a plumber, &quot;Kurt – The Fastest Plumber in the West&quot;. The album which was certified platinum, was also released in several other European countries in April 2006. In June 2007, he released another solo album in Swedish with the name &quot;En händig man&quot;, which shipped three times platinum. A single of the same name was released; &quot;En händig man&quot;. Later on October a book of &quot;Att vara Per Gessle&quot; was published, telling some of the unknown facts about Gessle and his 30-year career.
&quot;Party Crasher&quot; his seventh solo album and third in English was released in late 2008. The first single &quot;Silly Really&quot; gave him his fourth No. 1 hit. After that, Gessle started his &quot;Party Crasher Tour&quot;, where Fredriksson joined him on stage twice, in Amsterdam and Stockholm. This was eight years after their last live performance together during Roxette&#x27;s &quot;Room Service Tour&quot; in 2001. Following Fredriksson&#x27;s guest appearance in Amsterdam, Roxette started to perform live again. Initially this was during the Night of the Proms concert series in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany in 2009, later followed by extensive concert tours in 2010, 2011 and 2012, performing over 100 shows on all 6 continents. In the summer of 2013, Gessle reunited with Gyllene Tider once more, performing some 20 shows in Sweden.

After Roxette&#x27;s Neverending World Tour finished in 2015 he produced another set of solo efforts, &quot;En vacker natt&quot; (2017), &quot;En vacker dag&quot; (2017) and &quot;Small Town Talk&quot; (2018). All three albums were recorded in Nashville after Gessle felt the need to do sessions abroad. The albums featured the use of local musicians, Dan Dugmore, Stuart Duncan and Mickey Raphael.

In 2016 he started using the pseudonym Mono Mind, first releasing a few singles before delivering a full album, &quot;Mind Control&quot;, in 2019. In June 2022, Gessle released a single called &quot;The Loneliest Girl In The World&quot; under the name PG Roxette. The single previews an album Gessle has recorded with members of Roxette&#x27;s live touring band called &quot;Pop-up Dynamo&quot;.

===Collaborations===

In 1983 Gessle wrote the song 
”Stjärnhimmel” to Elisabeth Andreassen. 

He wrote the song Kärleken är evig which Lena Philipsson competed with in Melodifestivalen 1986, where the song finished in second place with 42 points. The song charted on the 6th place on the swedish singles chart and became Philipssons big breaktrough single.

In 1990, Gessle wrote a single, &quot;The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye&quot;, for Thomas Anders (of Modern Talking fame); Roxette would release their version as the B-side of their single &quot;Spending My Time&quot;. The song was also used by Laura Branigan featuring on her &quot;Over My Heart&quot; album. He has also participated with the Swedish singer Nisse Hellberg in the project The Lonely Boys. In 1996 he worked with Belinda Carlisle and wrote two songs for her album, &quot;A Woman and a Man&quot;; &quot;Always Breaking My Heart&quot; and &quot;Love Doesn&#x27;t Live Here&quot;. The former was released as a single, becoming a UK top 10 hit.

He sung duet with Nick Lowe on the title track for the &quot;Small Town Talk&quot; album.

==Personal life==
Gessle is the youngest son of plumber Kurt Gessle (1917–1978) and Elisabeth Gessle (1925-2013). He had an older brother, Bengt (1950-2014) and older sister Gunilla (1944-2016). Gessle married his long-time girlfriend Åsa Nordin (born 1961) in 1993 at Västra Strö Church, Eslöv, Sweden. The wedding reception was held in nearby Trollenäs Castle. They have a son, Gabriel Titus, born on 5 August 1997.

Along with Björn Nordstrand he also owns Hotel Tylösand on the Swedish westcoast, known for its vast art and photo collection as well as The Joyride Car Collection, Per Gessle&#x27;s private collection of Ferrari cars.

<doc id="67244" wikidata="Q172861" url="?curid=67244" title="Ecological niche">
<text>In ecology, a niche is the match of a species to a specific environmental condition. It describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). &quot;The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts&quot;.

A Grinnellian niche is determined by the habitat in which a species lives and its accompanying behavioral adaptations. An Eltonian niche emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment, it may also change the environment and its behavior as it grows. The Hutchinsonian niche uses mathematics and statistics to try to explain how species coexist within a given community.

The concept of ecological niche is central to ecological biogeography, which focuses on spatial patterns of ecological communities. &quot;Species distributions and their dynamics over time result from properties of the species, environmental variation..., and interactions between the two—in particular the abilities of some species, especially our own, to modify their environments and alter the range dynamics of many other species.&quot; Alteration of an ecological niche by its inhabitants is the topic of niche construction.

The majority of species exist in a standard ecological niche, sharing behaviors, adaptations, and functional traits similar to the other closely related species within the same broad taxonomic class, but there are exceptions. A premier example of a non-standard niche filling species is the flightless, ground-dwelling kiwi bird of New Zealand, which feeds on worms and other ground creatures, and lives its life in a mammal-like niche. Island biogeography can help explain island species and associated unfilled niches.

==Grinnellian niche==
The ecological meaning of niche comes from the meaning of niche as a recess in a wall for a statue, which itself is probably derived from the Middle French word &quot;nicher&quot;, meaning &quot;to nest&quot;.
The term was coined by the naturalist Roswell Hill Johnson
but Joseph Grinnell was probably the first to use it in a research program in 1917, in his paper &quot;The niche relationships of the California Thrasher&quot;.

The Grinnellian niche concept embodies the idea that the niche of a species is determined by the habitat in which it lives and its accompanying behavioral adaptations. In other words, the niche is the sum of the habitat requirements and behaviors that allow a species to persist and produce offspring. For example, the behavior of the California thrasher is consistent with the chaparral habitat it lives in—it breeds and feeds in the underbrush and escapes from its predators by shuffling from underbrush to underbrush. Its &#x27;niche&#x27; is defined by the felicitous complementing of the thrasher&#x27;s behavior and physical traits (camouflaging color, short wings, strong legs) with this habitat.

Grinnellian niches can be defined by non-interactive (abiotic) variables and environmental conditions on broad scales. Variables of interest in this niche class include average temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and terrain aspect which have become increasingly accessible across spatial scales. Most literature has focused on Grinnellian niche constructs, often from a climatic perspective, to explain distribution and abundance. Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions and an Eltonian perspective may be advantageous in explaining these processes.

This perspective of niche allows for the existence of both ecological equivalents and empty niches. An ecological equivalent to an organism is an organism from a different taxonomic group exhibiting similar adaptations in a similar habitat, an example being the different succulents found in American and African deserts, cactus and euphorbia, respectively. As another example, the anole lizards of the Greater Antilles are a rare example of convergent evolution, adaptive radiation, and the existence of ecological equivalents: the anole lizards evolved in similar microhabitats independently of each other and resulted in the same ecomorphs across all four islands.

==Eltonian niche==
In 1927 Charles Sutherland Elton, a British ecologist, defined a niche as follows: &quot;The &#x27;niche&#x27; of an animal means its place in the biotic environment, &quot;its relations to food and enemies&quot;.&quot;

Elton classified niches according to foraging activities (&quot;food habits&quot;):

Conceptually, the Eltonian niche introduces the idea of a species&#x27; &quot;response&quot; &quot;to&quot; and &quot;effect on&quot; the environment. Unlike other niche concepts, it emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment based on available resources, predators, and climatic conditions, but also changes the availability and behavior of those factors as it grows. In an extreme example, beavers require certain resources in order to survive and reproduce, but also construct dams that alter water flow in the river where the beaver lives. Thus, the beaver affects the biotic and abiotic conditions of other species that live in and near the watershed. In a more subtle case, competitors that consume resources at different rates can lead to cycles in resource density that differ between species. Not only do species grow differently with respect to resource density, but their own population growth can affect resource density over time.

Eltonian niches focus on biotic interactions and consumer–resource dynamics (biotic variables) on local scales. Because of the narrow extent of focus, data sets characterizing Eltonian niches typically are in the form of detailed field studies of specific individual phenomena, as the dynamics of this class of niche are difficult to measure at a broad geographic scale. However, the Eltonian niche may be useful in the explanation of a species&#x27; endurance of global change. Because adjustments in biotic interactions inevitably change abiotic factors, Eltonian niches can be useful in describing the overall response of a species to new environments.

==Hutchinsonian niche==
The Hutchinsonian niche is an &quot;n-dimensional hypervolume&quot;, where the dimensions are environmental conditions and resources, that define the requirements of an individual or a species to practice its way of life, more particularly, for its population to persist. The &quot;hypervolume&quot; defines the multi-dimensional space of resources (e.g., light, nutrients, structure, etc.) available to (and specifically used by) organisms, and &quot;all species other than those under consideration are regarded as part of the coordinate system.&quot;

The niche concept was popularized by the zoologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson in 1957. Hutchinson inquired into the question of why there are so many types of organisms in any one habitat. His work inspired many others to develop models to explain how many and how similar coexisting species could be within a given community, and led to the concepts of &#x27;niche breadth&#x27; (the variety of resources or habitats used by a given species), &#x27;niche partitioning&#x27; (resource differentiation by coexisting species), and &#x27;niche overlap&#x27; (overlap of resource use by different species).

Statistics were introduced into the Hutchinson niche by Robert MacArthur and Richard Levins using the &#x27;resource-utilization&#x27; niche employing histograms to describe the &#x27;frequency of occurrence&#x27; as a function of a Hutchinson coordinate. So, for instance, a Gaussian might describe the frequency with which a species ate prey of a certain size, giving a more detailed niche description than simply specifying some median or average prey size. For such a bell-shaped distribution, the &quot;position&quot;, &quot;width&quot; and &quot;form&quot; of the niche correspond to the &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;standard deviation&quot; and the actual distribution itself. One advantage in using statistics is illustrated in the figure, where it is clear that for the narrower distributions (top) there is no competition for prey between the extreme left and extreme right species, while for the broader distribution (bottom), niche overlap indicates competition can occur between all species. The resource-utilization approach postulates that not only can competition occur, but that it &quot;does&quot; occur, and that overlap in resource utilization directly enables the estimation of the competition coefficients. This postulate, however, can be misguided, as it ignores the impacts that the resources of each category have on the organism and the impacts that the organism has on the resources of each category. For instance, the resource in the overlap region can be non-limiting, in which case there is no competition for this resource despite niche overlap.

An organism free of interference from other species could use the full range of conditions (biotic and abiotic) and resources in which it could survive and reproduce which is called its fundamental niche. However, as a result of pressure from, and interactions with, other organisms (i.e. inter-specific competition) species are usually forced to occupy a niche that is narrower than this, and to which they are mostly highly adapted; this is termed the realized niche. Hutchinson used the idea of competition for resources as the primary mechanism driving ecology, but overemphasis upon this focus has proved to be a handicap for the niche concept. In particular, overemphasis upon a species&#x27; dependence upon resources has led to too little emphasis upon the effects of organisms on their environment, for instance, colonization and invasions.

The term &quot;adaptive zone&quot; was coined by the paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson to explain how a population could jump from one niche to another that suited it, jump to an &#x27;adaptive zone&#x27;, made available by virtue of some modification, or possibly a change in the food chain, that made the adaptive zone available to it without a discontinuity in its way of life because the group was &#x27;pre-adapted&#x27; to the new ecological opportunity.

Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;niche&quot; (a description of the ecological space occupied by a species) is subtly different from the &quot;niche&quot; as defined by Grinnell (an ecological role, that may or may not be actually filled by a species—see vacant niches).

A niche is a very specific segment of ecospace occupied by a single species. On the presumption that no two species are identical in all respects (called Hardin&#x27;s &#x27;axiom of inequality&#x27;) and the competitive exclusion principle, &quot;some&quot; resource or adaptive dimension will provide a niche specific to each species. Species can however share a &#x27;mode of life&#x27; or &#x27;autecological strategy&#x27; which are broader definitions of ecospace. For example, Australian grasslands species, though different from those of the Great Plains grasslands, exhibit similar modes of life.

Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For example, the niche that was left vacant by the extinction of the tarpan has been filled by other animals (in particular a small horse breed, the konik). Also, when plants and animals are introduced into a new environment, they have the potential to occupy or invade the niche or niches of native organisms, often outcompeting the indigenous species. Introduction of non-indigenous species to non-native habitats by humans often results in biological pollution by the exotic or invasive species.

The mathematical representation of a species&#x27; fundamental niche in ecological space, and its subsequent projection back into geographic space, is the domain of niche modelling.

==Contemporary niche theory==
Contemporary niche theory (also called &quot;classic niche theory&quot; in some contexts) is a framework that was originally designed to reconcile different definitions of niches (see Grinnellian, Eltonian, and Hutchinsonian definitions above), and to help explain the underlying processes that affect Lotka-Volterra relationships within an ecosystem. The framework centers around &quot;consumer-resource models&quot; which largely split a given ecosystem into resources (e.g. sunlight or available water in soil) and consumers (e.g. any living thing, including plants and animals), and attempts to define the scope of possible relationships that could exist between the two groups.

In contemporary niche theory, the &quot;impact niche&quot; is defined as the combination of effects that a given consumer has on both a). the resources that it uses, and b). the other consumers in the ecosystem. Therefore, the impact niche is equivalent to the Eltonian niche since both concepts are defined by the impact of a given species on its environment.

The range of environmental conditions where a species can successfully survive and reproduce (i.e. the Hutchinsonian definition of a realized niche) is also encompassed under contemporary niche theory, termed the &quot;requirement niche&quot;. The requirement niche is bounded by both the availability of resources as well as the effects of coexisting consumers (e.g. competitors and predators).

=== Coexistence under contemporary niche theory ===
Contemporary niche theory provides three requirements that must be met in order for two species (consumers) to coexist:

# The requirement niches of both consumers must overlap.
# Each consumer must outcompete the other for the resource that it needs most. For example, if two plants (P1 and P2) are competing for nitrogen and phosphorus in a given ecosystem, they will only coexist if they are limited by different resources (P1 is limited by nitrogen and P2 is limited by phosphorus, perhaps) and each species must outcompete the other species to get that resource (P1 needs to be better at obtaining nitrogen and P2 needs to be better at obtaining phosphorus). Intuitively, this makes sense from an inverse perspective: If both consumers are limited by the same resource, one of the species will ultimately be the better competitor, and only that species will survive. Furthermore, if P1 was outcompeted for the nitrogen (the resource it needed most) it would not survive. Likewise, if P2 was outcompeted for phosphorus, it would not survive.
# The availability of the limiting resources (nitrogen and phosphorus in the above example) in the environment are equivalent.

These requirements are interesting and controversial because they require any two species to share a certain environment (have overlapping requirement niches) but fundamentally differ the ways that they use (or &quot;impact&quot;) that environment. These requirements have repeatedly been violated by nonnative (i.e. introduced and invasive) species, which often coexist with new species in their nonnative ranges, but do not appear to be constricted these requirements. In other words, contemporary niche theory predicts that species will be unable to invade new environments outside of their requirement (i.e. realized) niche, yet many examples of this are well-documented. Additionally, contemporary niche theory predicts that species will be unable to establish in environments where other species already consume resources in the same ways as the incoming species, however examples of this are also numerous.

==Niche differentiation==
In ecology, niche differentiation (also known as niche segregation, niche separation and niche partitioning) refers to the process by which competing species use the environment differently in a way that helps them to coexist. The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species with identical niches (ecological roles) compete, then one will inevitably drive the other to extinction. This rule also states that two species cannot occupy the same exact niche in a habitat and coexist together, at least in a stable manner. When two species differentiate their niches, they tend to compete less strongly, and are thus more likely to coexist. Species can differentiate their niches in many ways, such as by consuming different foods, or using different areas of the environment.

As an example of niche partitioning, several anole lizards in the Caribbean islands share common diets—mainly insects. They avoid competition by occupying different physical locations. Although these lizards might occupy different locations, some species can be found inhabiting the same range, with up to 15 in certain areas. For example, some live on the ground while others are arboreal. Species who live in different areas compete less for food and other resources, which minimizes competition between species. However, species who live in similar areas typically compete with each other.

===Detection and quantification===
The Lotka–Volterra equation states that two competing species can coexist when intra-specific (within species) competition is greater than inter-specific (between species) competition. Since niche differentiation concentrates competition within-species, due to a decrease in between-species competition, the Lotka-Volterra model predicts that niche differentiation of any degree will result in coexistence.

In reality, this still leaves the question of how much differentiation is needed for coexistence. A vague answer to this question is that the more similar two species are, the more finely balanced the suitability of their environment must be in order to allow coexistence. There are limits to the amount of niche differentiation required for coexistence, and this can vary with the type of resource, the nature of the environment, and the amount of variation both within and between the species.

To answer questions about niche differentiation, it is necessary for ecologists to be able to detect, measure, and quantify the niches of different coexisting and competing species. This is often done through a combination of detailed ecological studies, controlled experiments (to determine the strength of competition), and mathematical models. To understand the mechanisms of niche differentiation and competition, much data must be gathered on how the two species interact, how they use their resources, and the type of ecosystem in which they exist, among other factors. In addition, several mathematical models exist to quantify niche breadth, competition, and coexistence (Bastolla et al. 2005). However, regardless of methods used, niches and competition can be distinctly difficult to measure quantitatively, and this makes detection and demonstration of niche differentiation difficult and complex.

=== Development ===
Over time, two competing species can either coexist, through niche differentiation or other means, or compete until one species becomes locally extinct. Several theories exist for how niche differentiation arises or evolves given these two possible outcomes.

====Current competition (The Ghost of Competition Present)====
Niche differentiation can arise from current competition. For instance, species X has a fundamental niche of the entire slope of a hillside, but its realized niche is only the top portion of the slope because species Y, which is a better competitor but cannot survive on the top portion of the slope, has excluded it from the lower portion of the slope. With this scenario, competition will continue indefinitely in the middle of the slope between these two species. Because of this, detection of the presence of niche differentiation (through competition) will be relatively easy. Importantly, there is no evolutionary change of the individual species in this case; rather this is an ecological effect of species Y out-competing species X within the bounds of species Y&#x27;s fundamental niche.

====Via past extinctions (The Ghost of Competition Past)====
Another way by which niche differentiation can arise is via the previous elimination of species without realized niches. This asserts that at some point in the past, several species inhabited an area, and all of these species had overlapping fundamental niches. However, through competitive exclusion, the less competitive species were eliminated, leaving only the species that were able to coexist (i.e. the most competitive species whose realized niches did not overlap). Again, this process does not include any evolutionary change of individual species, but it is merely the product of the competitive exclusion principle. Also, because no species is out-competing any other species in the final community, the presence of niche differentiation will be difficult or impossible to detect.

====Evolving differences====
Finally, niche differentiation can arise as an evolutionary effect of competition. In this case, two competing species will evolve different patterns of resource use so as to avoid competition. Here too, current competition is absent or low, and therefore detection of niche differentiation is difficult or impossible.

=== Types ===
Below is a list of ways that species can partition their niche. This list is not exhaustive, but illustrates several classic examples.
====Resource partitioning====

Resource partitioning is the phenomenon where two or more species divides out resources like food, space, resting sites etc. to coexist. For example, some lizard species appear to coexist because they consume insects of differing sizes. Alternatively, species can coexist on the same resources if each species is limited by different resources, or differently able to capture resources. Different types of phytoplankton can coexist when different species are differently limited by nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and light. In the Galapagos Islands, finches with small beaks are more able to consume small seeds, and finches with large beaks are more able to consume large seeds. If a species&#x27; density declines, then the food it most depends on will become more abundant (since there are so few individuals to consume it). As a result, the remaining individuals will experience less competition for food.

Although &quot;resource&quot; generally refers to food, species can partition other non-consumable objects, such as parts of the habitat. For example, warblers are thought to coexist because they nest in different parts of trees. Species can also partition habitat in a way that gives them access to different types of resources. As stated in the introduction, anole lizards appear to coexist because each uses different parts of the forests as perch locations. This likely gives them access to different species of insects.

Research has determined that plants can recognize each other&#x27;s root systems and differentiate between a clone, a plant grown from the same mother plants seeds, and other species. Based on the root secretions, also called exudates, plants can make this determination. The communication between plants starts with the secretions from plant roots into the rhizosphere. If another plant that is kin is entering this area the plant will take up exudates. The exudate, being several different compounds, will enter the plants root cell and attach to a receptor for that chemical halting growth of the root meristem in that direction, if the interaction is kin.

Simonsen discusses how plants accomplish root communication with the addition of beneficial rhizobia and fungal networks and the potential for different genotypes of the kin plants, such as the legume M. Lupulina, and specific strains of nitrogen fixing bacteria and rhizomes can alter relationships between kin and non-kin competition. This means there could be specific subsets of genotypes in kin plants that selects well with specific strains that could outcompete other kin. What might seem like an instance in kin competition could just be different genotypes of organisms at play in the soil that increase the symbiotic efficiency.

====Predator partitioning====
Predator partitioning occurs when species are attacked differently by different predators (or natural enemies more generally). For example, trees could differentiate their niche if they are consumed by different species of specialist herbivores, such as herbivorous insects. If a species density declines, so too will the density of its natural enemies, giving it an advantage. Thus, if each species is constrained by different natural enemies, they will be able to coexist. Early work focused on specialist predators; however, more recent studies have shown that predators do not need to be pure specialists, they simply need to affect each prey species differently. The Janzen–Connell hypothesis represents a form of predator partitioning.

====Conditional differentiation====
Conditional differentiation (sometimes called temporal niche partitioning) occurs when species differ in their competitive abilities based on varying environmental conditions. For example, in the Sonoran Desert, some annual plants are more successful during wet years, while others are more successful during dry years. As a result, each species will have an advantage in some years, but not others. When environmental conditions are most favorable, individuals will tend to compete most strongly with member of the same species. For example, in a dry year, dry-adapted plants will tend to be most limited by other dry-adapted plants. This can help them to coexist through a storage effect.

====Competition-predation trade-off====
Species can differentiate their niche via a competition-predation trade-off if one species is a better competitor when predators are absent, and the other is better when predators are present. Defenses against predators, such as toxic compounds or hard shells, are often metabolically costly. As a result, species that produce such defenses are often poor competitors when predators are absent. Species can coexist through a competition-predation trade-off if predators are more abundant when the less defended species is common, and less abundant if the well-defended species is common. This effect has been criticized as being weak, because theoretical models suggest that only two species within a community can coexist because of this mechanism.

==Segregation versus restriction==

Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called &quot;classical&quot; ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because &quot;neighbouring&quot; species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of natural selection introduced by Darwin as an explanation for evolution.

The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many vacant niches. It is based on many empirical studies and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993. Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.

Both paradigms agree that species are never &quot;universal&quot; in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, &quot;Enterobius vermicularis&quot; infects only humans.

The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:

&quot;Niche restriction&quot;:
# Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).
# Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This &quot;mating theory of niche restriction&quot; is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.

&quot;Niche segregation&quot;:
# The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm).
# Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm).
# Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., &quot;reinforcement of reproductive barriers&quot;) (e.g., Rohde 2005b).

===Relative significance of the mechanisms===
Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. – Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that interspecific competition is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984) and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don&#x27;t even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984) concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980) found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983), in his review of competition in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. – Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002) has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs. This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models. Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.

For a detailed discussion, especially of competition and reinforcement of reproductive barriers, see

== Coexistence without niche differentiation: exceptions to the rule ==
Some competing species have been shown to coexist on the same resource with no observable evidence of niche differentiation and in &quot;violation&quot; of the competitive exclusion principle. One instance is in a group of hispine beetle species. These beetle species, which eat the same food and occupy the same habitat, coexist without any evidence of segregation or exclusion. The beetles show no aggression either intra- or inter-specifically. Coexistence may be possible through a combination of non-limiting food and habitat resources and high rates of predation and parasitism, though this has not been demonstrated.

This example illustrates that the evidence for niche differentiation is by no means universal. Niche differentiation is also not the only means by which coexistence is possible between two competing species. However, niche differentiation is a critically important ecological idea which explains species coexistence, thus promoting the high biodiversity often seen in many of the world&#x27;s biomes.

Research using mathematical modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers can serve as an example. The idea is that it is also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae. The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.

== Niche and Geographic Range ==
The geographic range of a species can be viewed as a spatial reflection of its niche, along with characteristics of the geographic template and the species that influence its potential to colonize. The fundamental geographic range of a species is the area it occupies in which environmental conditions are favorable, without restriction from barriers to disperse or colonize. A species will be confined to its realized geographic range when confronting biotic interactions or abiotic barriers that limit dispersal, a more narrow subset of its larger fundamental geographic range.

An early study on ecological niches conducted by Joseph H. Connell analyzed the environmental factors that limit the range of a barnacle (&quot;Chthamalus stellatus&quot;) on Scotland&#x27;s Isle of Cumbrae. In his experiments, Connell described the dominant features of &quot;C. stellatus&quot; niches and provided explanation for their distribution on intertidal zone of the rocky coast of the Isle. Connell described the upper portion of C. stellatus&#x27;s range is limited by the barnacle&#x27;s ability to resist dehydration during periods of low tide. The lower portion of the range was limited by interspecific interactions, namely competition with a cohabiting barnacle species and predation by a snail. By removing the competing &quot;B. balanoides&quot;, Connell showed that &quot;C. stellatus&quot; was able to extend the lower edge of its realized niche in the absence of competitive exclusion. These experiments demonstrate how biotic and abiotic factors limit the distribution of an organism.

==Parameters==
The different dimensions, or &quot;plot axes&quot;, of a niche represent different biotic and abiotic variables. These factors may include descriptions of the organism&#x27;s life history, habitat, trophic position (place in the food chain), and geographic range. According to the competitive exclusion principle, no two species can occupy the same niche in the same environment for a long time. The parameters of a realized niche are described by the realized niche width of that species. Some plants and animals, called specialists, need specific habitats and surroundings to survive, such as the spotted owl, which lives specifically in old growth forests. Other plants and animals, called generalists, are not as particular and can survive in a range of conditions, for example the dandelion.

<text>David Douglas (25 June 1799 – 12 July 1834) was a Scottish botanist, best known as the namesake of the Douglas fir. He worked as a gardener, and explored the Scottish Highlands, North America and Hawaii, where he died. 

==Early life==
Douglas was born in Scone, Perthshire, the second son of John Douglas, a stonemason, and Jean Drummond. At around the age of seven, he attended a school in a neighboring parish, where he became known for his tardiness and truancy, preferring to explore the countryside during his two-mile walk to class. He attended school in Kinnoull, on the eastern banks of the River Tay, and upon leaving found work as an apprentice to William Beattie, head gardener at nearby Scone Palace, the seat of the Earl of Mansfield. He spent seven years in this position, completing his apprenticeship, and then spent a winter at a college in Perth to learn more of the scientific and mathematical aspects of plant culture. After a further spell of working at Valleyfield House in Fife (during which time he had access to a library of botanical and zoological books), he moved to the Botanical Gardens of Glasgow University and attended botany lectures. William Jackson Hooker, who was Garden Director and Professor of Botany, was greatly impressed with him and took him on an expedition to the Highlands before recommending him to the Royal Horticultural Society.

==Explorations==
Douglas made three separate trips from Britain to North America. His first, to eastern North America, began on 3 June 1823, with a return in the late autumn of 1823. The second was to the Pacific Northwest, from July 1824 returning October 1827. His third and final trip started in England in October 1829. On that last journey he went first to the Columbia River, then to San Francisco, then in August 1832, to Hawaii. In October 1832, he returned to the Columbia River region. A year later, in October 1833, he returned to Hawaii, arriving on 2 January 1834. The second expedition starting in 1824 was his most successful. The Royal Horticultural Society sent him back on a plant-hunting expedition in the Pacific Northwest that ranks among the great botanical explorations.

In the spring of 1826, David Douglas was compelled to climb a peak (Mount Brown, of the mythical pair Hooker and Brown) near Athabasca Pass to take in the view. In so doing, he was perhaps one of the first Europeans to be a &quot;mountaineer&quot; in North America. He introduced the Douglas fir (Douglas-fir) into cultivation in 1827. Other notable introductions include Sitka Spruce, Sugar Pine, Western White Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Monterey Pine, Grand Fir, Noble Fir and several other conifers that transformed the British landscape and timber industry, as well as numerous garden shrubs and herbs such as the Flowering currant, Salal, Lupin, Penstemon and California poppy. His success was well beyond expectations; in one of his letters to Hooker, he wrote &quot;you will begin to think I manufacture pines at my pleasure&quot;. Altogether he introduced about 240 species of plants to Britain.

He first briefly visited Hawaii in 1830 on his way to the Pacific Northwest. He returned again in December 1833 intending to spend three months of winter there. He was only the second European to reach the summit of the Mauna Loa volcano.

== Death ==
Douglas died under mysterious circumstances while climbing Mauna Kea in Hawaii at the age of 35 in 1834. He apparently fell into a pit trap where he was mauled to death by a bull. He was last seen alive at the hut of Englishman Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Gurney, a bullock hunter and escaped convict. Gurney was suspected in Douglas&#x27;s death, as Douglas was said to have been carrying more money than Gurney subsequently delivered with the body; others suggested he might have been robbed and murdered by two native Hawaiians. However, no evidence was found to contradict Gurney&#x27;s story.
In 1856, a marker to Douglas was erected on an outside wall at Kawaiahao Church (Kawaiahao Church Cemetery). A monument was built, at the spot where Douglas died, by members of the Hilo Burns Society, including David McHattie Forbes. It is called &quot;Ka lua kauka&quot; (&quot;Doctor&#x27;s Pit&quot; in the Hawaiian language), off Mānā Road on the Island of Hawaii (). A small stand of Douglas fir trees has been planted there.

==Legacy==
Although the common name &quot;Douglas fir&quot; refers to him, the tree&#x27;s scientific name, &quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;, honours a rival botanist, Archibald Menzies. Several Hawaiian plants were named after him in earlier taxonomies, such as &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot; known in Hawaiian as &quot;hala&quot;, sometimes given the name &quot;Pandanus douglasii&quot;. A species of &quot;horned toad&quot;, &quot;Phrynosoma douglasii&quot;, is named in honor of David Douglas. Over eighty species of plants and animals have &quot;douglasii&quot; in their scientific names, in his honour. He introduced several hundred plants to Great Britain and hence to Europe. There is a memorial to David Douglas in his birthplace of Scone. David Douglas High School and the David Douglas School District in Portland, Oregon are named after him. Remnants of a greenhouse built by David Douglas can be seen in Wood Street Village, Surrey.

In Vancouver, Washington, he is remembered via David Douglas Park which was used during World War II as interim housing for the Kaiser Shipyard workers living in little silver trailers, giving the area the brief nickname during the era of &quot;Trailer Terrace Park.&quot;

The David Douglas Chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution was founded in Redmond, Washington in 1981.

The actor Alvy Moore was cast as Douglas in the 1962 episode &quot;The Grass Man&quot; of the television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

==Family==

David Douglas had a son who was named David Finlay. David Finlay, who was recorded as being an interpreter, died in April 1850 at the hands of Black-feet raiders. He lived in Montana, an area where Douglas had spent long periods of time over 20 years previously, which would tie in with the age of his son, who died when he was around 22 years old. It is not known if David Douglas was aware that he had fathered a child.

<text>A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus &quot;Betula&quot; contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.

==Description==

Birch species are generally small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, mostly of northern temperate and boreal climates. The simple leaves are alternate, singly or doubly serrate, feather-veined, petiolate and stipulate. They often appear in pairs, but these pairs are really borne on spur-like, two-leaved, lateral branchlets. The fruit is a small samara, although the wings may be obscure in some species. They differ from the alders (&quot;Alnus&quot;, another genus in the family) in that the female catkins are not woody and disintegrate at maturity, falling apart to release the seeds, unlike the woody, cone-like female alder catkins.

The bark of all birches is characteristically marked with long, horizontal lenticels, and often separates into thin, papery plates, especially upon the paper birch. Distinctive colors give the common names gray, white, black, silver and yellow birch to different species.

The buds, forming early and full-grown by midsummer, are all lateral, without a terminal bud forming; the branch is prolonged by the upper lateral bud. The wood of all the species is close-grained with a satiny texture and capable of taking a fine polish; its fuel value is fair.

===Flower and fruit===
The flowers are monoecious, and open with or before the leaves. Once fully grown, these leaves are usually long on three-flowered clusters in the axils of the scales of drooping or erect catkins or aments. Staminate catkins are pendulous, clustered, or solitary in the axils of the last leaves of the branch of the year or near the ends of the short lateral branchlets of the year. They form in early autumn and remain rigid during the winter. The scales of the mature staminate catkins are broadly ovate, rounded, yellow or orange colour below the middle and dark chestnut brown at apex. Each scale bears two bractlets and three sterile flowers, each flower consisting of a sessile, membranous, usually two-lobed, calyx. Each calyx bears four short filaments with one-celled anthers or strictly, two filaments divided into two branches, each bearing a half-anther. Anther cells open longitudinally. The pistillate segments are erect or pendulous, and solitary, terminal on the two-leaved lateral spur-like branchlets of the year. The pistillate scales are oblong-ovate, three-lobed, pale yellow-green often tinged with red, becoming brown at maturity. These scales bear two or three fertile flowers, each flower consisting of a naked ovary. The ovary is compressed, two-celled, and crowned with two slender styles; the ovule is solitary. Each scale bears a single small, winged nut that is oval, with two persistent stigmas at the apex.

===Etymology===

The common name &quot;birch&quot; comes from Old English &quot;birce&quot;, &quot;bierce&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;berk-jōn&quot; (cf. German &quot;Birke&quot;, West Frisian &quot;bjirk&quot;), an adjectival formation from *&quot;berkōn&quot; (cf. Dutch &quot;berk&quot;, Low German &quot;Bark&quot;, Danish &quot;birk&quot;, Norwegian &quot;bjørk&quot;), itself from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;bʰerHǵ-&quot; ~ &quot;bʰrHǵ&quot;-, which also gave Lithuanian &quot;béržas&quot;, Latvian &quot;Bērzs&quot;, Russian &quot;берёза (berëza)&quot;, Ukrainian береза (&quot;beréza)&quot;, Albanian &quot;bredh&quot; &#x27;fir&#x27;, Ossetian &quot;bærz(æ)&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;bhurja&quot;, Polish &quot;brzoza&quot;, Latin &quot;fraxinus&quot; &#x27;ash (tree)&#x27;. This root is presumably derived from *&quot;bʰreh₁ǵ-&quot; &#x27;to shine, whiten&#x27;, in reference to the birch&#x27;s white bark. The Proto-Germanic rune &quot;berkanan&quot; is named after the birch.

The generic name &quot;Betula&quot; is from Latin, which is a diminutive borrowed from Gaulish &quot;betua&quot; (cf. Old Irish &quot;bethe&quot;, Welsh &quot;bedw&quot;).

==Evolutionary history==

Within Betulaceae, birches are most closely related to alder. The oldest known birch fossils are those of &quot;Betula leopoldae&quot; from the Klondike Mountain Formation in Washington State, US, which date to the early Eocene (Ypresian) around 49 million years ago.

==Ecology==


Birches often form even-aged stands on light, well-drained, particularly acidic soils. They are regarded as pioneer species, rapidly colonizing open ground especially in secondary successional sequences following a disturbance or fire. Birches are early tree species to become established in primary successions, and can become a threat to heathland if the seedlings and saplings are not suppressed by grazing or periodic burning. Birches are generally lowland species, but some species, such as &quot;Betula nana&quot;, have a montane distribution. In the British Isles, there is some difference between the environments of &quot;Betula pendula&quot; and &quot;Betula pubescens&quot;, and some hybridization, though both are &quot;opportunists in steady-state woodland systems&quot;. Mycorrhizal fungi, including sheathing (ecto)mycorrhizas, are found in some cases to be beneficial to tree growth.

A large number of lepidopteran insects feed on birch foliage.

==Uses==

Because of the hardness of birch, it is easier to shape it with power tools; it is quite difficult to work it with hand tools.

* Birch wood is fine-grained and pale in colour, often with an attractive satin-like sheen. Ripple figuring may occur, increasing the value of the timber for veneer and furniture-making. The highly decorative Masur (or Karelian) birch, from &quot;Betula verrucosa&quot; var. &quot;carelica&quot;, has ripple textures combined with attractive dark streaks and lines.
* Birch plywood is made from laminations of birch veneer. It is light but strong, and has many other good properties. It is among the strongest and dimensionally most stable plywoods, although it is unsuitable for exterior use. Birch plywood is used to make longboards (skateboard), giving it a strong yet flexible ride. It is also used (often in very thin grades with many laminations) for making model aircraft.
* Extracts of birch are used for flavoring or leather oil, and in cosmetics such as soap or shampoo. In the past, commercial oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate) was made from the sweet birch (&quot;Betula lenta&quot;).
* Birch-tar or Russian oil extracted from birch bark is thermoplastic and waterproof; it was used as a glue on, for example, arrows, and also for medicinal purposes.
* Fragrant twigs of wintergreen group birches are used in saunas.
* Birch is also associated with the feast of Pentecost in Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia, where its branches are used as decoration for churches and homes on this day.
* Ground birch bark, fermented in sea water, is used for seasoning the woolen, hemp or linen sails and hemp rope of traditional Norwegian boats.
* Birch twigs bound in a bundle, also called birch, were used for birching, a form of corporal punishment.
* Many Native Americans in the United States and Indigenous peoples in Canada prize the birch for its bark, which because of its light weight, flexibility, and the ease with which it can be stripped from fallen trees, is often used for the construction of strong, waterproof but lightweight canoes, bowls, and wigwams.
* The Hughes H-4 Hercules was made mostly of birch wood, despite its better-known moniker, &quot;The Spruce Goose&quot;.
* Birch plywood was specified by the BBC as the only wood that can be used in making the cabinets of the long-lived LS3/5A loudspeaker.
* Birch is used as firewood because of its high calorific value per unit weight and unit volume. It burns well, without popping, even when frozen and freshly hewn. The bark will burn very well even when wet because of the oils it contains. With care, it can be split into very thin sheets that will ignite from even the smallest of sparks. Birch wood can be used to smoke foods.
* Birch seeds are used as leaf litter in miniature terrain models.
* Birch oil is used in the manufacture of Russia leather, a water-resistant leather.

===As food===
The inner bark is considered edible as an emergency food, even when raw. It can be dried and ground into flour, as was done by Native Americans and early settlers. It can also be cut into strips and cooked like noodles.

The sap can be drunk or used to make syrup and birch beer. Tea can be made from the red inner bark of black birches.

===Cultivation===
White-barked birches in particular are cultivated as ornamental trees, largely for their appearance in winter. The Himalayan birch, &quot;Betula utilis&quot;, especially the variety or subspecies &quot;jacquemontii&quot;, is among the most widely planted for this purpose. It has been cultivated since the 1870s, and many cultivars are available, including &#x27;Doorenbos&#x27;, &#x27;Grayswood Ghost&#x27; and &#x27;Silver Shadow&#x27;; &#x27;Knightshayes&#x27; has a slightly weeping habit. Other species with ornamental white bark include &quot;Betula ermanii&quot;, &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;, &quot;Betula pendula&quot; and &quot;Betula raddeana&quot;.

===Medical===
====Approved topical medicine====
In the European Union, a prescription gel containing birch bark extract (commercial name &quot;Episalvan&quot;, betulae cortex dry extract (5–10 : 1); extraction solvent: &quot;n&quot;-heptane 95% (w/w)) was approved in 2016 for the topical treatment of minor skin wounds in adults. Although its mechanism of action in helping to heal injured skin is not fully understood, birch bark extract appears to stimulate the growth of keratinocytes which then fill the wound.

====Research and traditional medicine====
Preliminary research indicates that the phytochemicals, betulin and possibly other triterpenes, are active in &quot;Episalvan&quot; gel and wound healing properties of birch bark.

Over centuries, birch bark was used in traditional medicine practices by North American indigenous people for treating superficial wounds by applying bark directly to the skin. Splints made with birch bark were used as casts for broken limbs in the 16th century.

===Paper===

Wood pulp made from birch gives relatively long and slender fibres for a hardwood. The thin walls cause the fibre to collapse upon drying, giving a paper with low bulk and low opacity. The birch fibres are, however, easily fibrillated and give about 75% of the tensile strength of softwood. The low opacity makes it suitable for making glassine.

In India, the birch (Sanskrit: भुर्ज, &quot;bhurja&quot;) holds great historical significance in the culture of North India, where the thin bark coming off in winter was extensively used as writing paper. Birch paper (Sanskrit: भुर्ज पत्र, &quot;bhurja patra&quot;) is exceptionally durable and was the material used for many ancient Indian texts. The Roman period Vindolanda tablets also use birch as a material on which to write and birch bark was used widely in ancient Russia as notepaper (&quot;beresta&quot;) and for decorative purposes and even making footwear (&quot;lapti&quot;) and baskets.

===Use in musical instruments===
Birch wood is sometimes used as a tonewood for semiacoustic and acoustic guitar bodies, and occasionally for solid-body guitar bodies. It is also a common material used in mallets for keyboard percussion. Drum manufacturers, such as Gretsch and Yamaha, have been known to use birch wood in the construction of drum shells, owing to its strength and colour which takes stain in an appealing way, and which can also amber over very well, while also giving the drums an appealing tone which changes depending on the type of birch used.

==Culture==
Birches have spiritual importance in several religions, both modern and historical. In Celtic cultures, the birch symbolises growth, renewal, stability, initiation, and adaptability because it is highly adaptive and able to sustain harsh conditions with casual indifference. Proof of this adaptability is seen in its easy and eager ability to repopulate areas damaged by forest fires or clearings. Birches are also associated with &quot;Tír na nÓg&quot;, the land of the dead and the &quot;Sidhe&quot;, in Gaelic folklore, and as such frequently appear in Scottish, Irish, and English folksongs and ballads in association with death, or fairies, or returning from the grave. The leaves of the silver birch tree are used in the festival of St George, held in Novosej and other villages in Albania.
The birch is New Hampshire&#x27;s state tree and the national tree of Finland and Russia. The yellow birch is the official tree of the province of Quebec (Canada). The birch is a very important element in Russian culture and represents the grace, strength, tenderness and natural beauty of Russian women as well as the closeness to nature of the Russians. It&#x27;s associated with marriage and love. There are numerous folkloric Russian songs in which the birch tree occurs. The Ornäs birch is the national tree of Sweden. The Czech word for the month of March, Březen, is derived from the Czech word bříza meaning birch, as birch trees flower in March under local conditions. The silver birch tree is of special importance to the Swedish city of Umeå. In 1888, the Umeå city fire spread all over the city and nearly burnt it down to the ground, but some birches, supposedly, halted the spread of the fire. To protect the city against future fires, wide avenues were created, and these were lined with silver birch trees all over the city. Umeå later adopted the unofficial name of &quot;City of the Birches (&quot;Björkarnas stad&quot;)&quot;. Also, the ice hockey team of Umeå is called &quot;Björklöven&quot;, translated to English &quot;The Birch Leaves&quot;.

&quot;Swinging&quot; birch trees was a common game for American children in the nineteenth century. American poet Lucy Larcom&#x27;s &quot;Swinging on a Birch Tree&quot; celebrates the game. The poem inspired Robert Frost, who pays homage to the act of climbing birch trees in his more famous poem, &quot;Birches&quot;. Frost once told &quot;it was almost sacrilegious climbing a birch tree till it bent, till it gave and swooped to the ground, but that&#x27;s what boys did in those days&quot;.

<doc id="67257" wikidata="Q178250" url="?curid=67257" title="Chester Gould">
<text>Chester Gould (; November 20, 1900 – May 11, 1985) was an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip, which he wrote and drew from 1931 to 1977, incorporating numerous colorful and monstrous villains.

==Early life and education==
Chester Gould was born to Gilbert R. Gould and Alice Maud (née Miller), in a log cabin outside Pawnee, Oklahoma. All four of his grandparents were pioneer settlers of Oklahoma. One grandfather was a minister, and Gould and his family were members of the United Brethren Church. 

A cousin, Henry W. Gould, is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at West Virginia University.

Gilbert Gould was an editor at the &quot;Pawnee Courier-Dispatch&quot;, which Chester would later credit for becoming a cartoonist. When he was 8, a Supreme Court lawyer bought a drawing Gould had made when the lawyer was in town for a political event. Over the next few years he entered various contests and enrolled in a correspondence course in drawing. While still a senior in high school, he was discovered by the yearbook staff at Oklahoma A&amp;M University and was hired to make line drawings for the 1918 and 1919 editions.

==Development==
He enrolled at A&amp;M himself in 1919 and drew editorial cartoons for the &quot;Tulsa Democrat&quot; and sports cartoons for &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;. He was an early member of Lambda Chi Alpha, the oldest fraternity on campus, becoming its 44th initiate. In 1921 he transferred to Northwestern University, drawn to Chicago by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and its support for syndicated cartoon strips.

For the next ten years, Gould submitted many ideas for comic strips to Joseph Patterson, publisher of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, but none were accepted. To support himself, he drew ads and cartoons freelance for the &quot;Chicago Daily Journal&quot;. After graduation, he was hired by the Hearst-owned &quot;Chicago Evening American&quot;, and got his first comic strips into print: &quot;Fillum Fables&quot;, a spoof of silent films, and &quot;Radio Catts&quot;, featuring an anthropomorphic family of cats fascinated by the radio. The Hearst-owned King Features Syndicate syndicated both.

Gould met and married Edna Gauger in 1926, and their daughter was born the following year. In 1928, he joined the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; and launched his third comic strip, called &quot;The Girl Friends&quot;, while continuing to send ideas to Patterson. In June 1931, by Gould&#x27;s account, he was listening to a radio series based on Sherlock Holmes stories and reading a newspaper account of Chicago&#x27;s most powerful mobster, Al Capone; he was inspired to create a strip about a heroic detective fighting organized crime and corruption in the city. After rejecting 60 submissions from Gould, Patterson accepted his 61st.

==&quot;Dick Tracy&quot;==
Gould was hired as a cartoonist with the &quot;Tribune&quot; and introduced &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in the &quot;Detroit Mirror&quot; on Sunday, October 4, 1931. He drew the comic strip for the next 46 years from his home in Woodstock, Illinois.

In order to keep informed of police methods, Gould took courses in forensics and investigative procedures. He was later proud of having introduced the two-way wrist radio for Tracy in 1946, and in 1947, the closed-circuit television, both of which were later invented, though in somewhat different forms.

Gould&#x27;s stories were rarely pre-planned, since he preferred to improvise stories as he drew them. While fans praised this approach as producing exciting stories, it sometimes created awkward plot developments that were difficult to resolve. In one notorious case, Gould had Tracy in an inescapable deathtrap with a caisson. When Gould depicted Tracy addressing Gould personally and having the cartoonist magically extract him, publisher Joseph Patterson vetoed the sequence and ordered it redrawn. The strip also drew protests from those who felt that Gould&#x27;s depiction of crime was too gruesome, that he poured on too much gore and carnage.

Later in the strip&#x27;s Gould period, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was widely criticized for being too right-wing in character and as excessively supportive of the police. A handful of critics thought Gould ignored the rights of the accused and failed to support his agenda with an adequate storyline. The late 1950s also saw a newspaper readership growing less indulgent of Gould&#x27;s politics.

For instance, Gould introduced a malodorous, tobacco-spitting character, B.O. Plenty, with little significant complaint from readers in the 1940s. However, the 1960s introduction of crooked lawyer Flyface and his relatives, surrounded by swarming flies, created a negative reader reaction strong enough for papers to drop the strip in large numbers. There was then a dramatic change in the strip&#x27;s setting, leaving behind the strip&#x27;s origins as an urban crime drama for science fiction plot elements and regular visits to the Moon. An increasingly fantastic procession of enemies and stories ensued. The Apollo 11 Moon landing prompted Gould to abandon this phase. Finally, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was beset by the overall trend in newspaper comics away from strips with continuing storylines and toward those whose stories are largely resolved within one series of panels.

Gould, his characters, and improbable plots were satirized in Al Capp&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; with the &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; sequences (supposedly drawn by &quot;Lester Gooch&quot;); a notable villain was Bomb Face, a gangster whose head was a bomb.

Gould retired in 1977, with his last &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; strip appearing in print on Christmas Day, December 25. The strip continued with Gould&#x27;s longtime assistant artist, Rick Fletcher, producing the artwork and Max Allan Collins as writer.

==Death==

Gould died of congestive heart failure on May 11, 1985 at his home in Woodstock. He was 84 years old. Gould is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Woodstock.

==Awards and exhibitions==
Chester Gould won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award in 1959 and 1977, and was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1978. The Mystery Writers of America honored Gould and his work with a Special Edgar Award in 1980. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps and postcards.

&quot;Dick Tracy: The Art of Chester Gould&quot; was an exhibition in Port Chester, New York, at the Museum of Cartoon Art from October 4 through November 30, 1978. The exhibition was curated by Bill Crouch, Jr.

From 1991 until 2008, the art and artifacts of Gould&#x27;s career were displayed in the Chester Gould-Dick Tracy Museum that operated from the Woodstock, Illinois, Old Courthouse on the Square. Visitors to the Museum saw original comic strips, correspondence, photographs, and much memorabilia, including Gould&#x27;s drawing board and chair. In 2000, the Museum received a Superior Achievement Award from the Illinois Association of Museums, and in 2001, it was given an Award of Excellence from the Illinois State Historical Society. The museum continues today as a virtual museum online.

In 2005, Gould was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, by Michael Vance. The Oklahoma Cartoonists Collection, created by Vance, is located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.

A graduate of Northwestern University, Gould was honored with the naming of the &quot;Chester Gould Society&quot; for the School of Professional Studies donors.

==Books==
In 1983, two years before Gould&#x27;s death, his only child, Jean Gould O&#x27;Connell, recorded extensive interviews with her father, who spoke at length about his early attempts during the 1920s to get syndicated and the birth of Dick Tracy. These interviews became a major source when she wrote his biography, &quot;Chester Gould: A Daughter&#x27;s Biography of the Creator of Dick Tracy&quot;, published by McFarland &amp; Company in 2007.

The entire run of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is being reprinted in a book series by IDW Publishing. The series began in 2006. The first volume includes the five sample strips that Gould used to sell his strip, followed by over 450 strips showing the series&#x27; beginning (from October 1931 – May 1933), along with a Gould interview, never previously published, by Max Allan Collins. Twenty-six more volumes in this series have been published between 2006 and 2020, bringing the continuity to July 1974.

<text>Burlington, officially the City of Burlington, is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Vermont and the seat of Chittenden County. It is located south of the Canada–United States border and south of Montreal. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 44,743. It is the least populous city in the 50 U.S. states to be the most populous city in its state.

A regional college town, Burlington is home to the University of Vermont (UVM) and Champlain College. Vermont&#x27;s largest hospital, the UVM Medical Center, is within the city limits. The City of Burlington owns Vermont&#x27;s largest airport, the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, located in neighboring South Burlington. In 2015, Burlington became the first city in the U.S. to run entirely on renewable energy.

==History==
=== Early history to early 20th century ===
Two theories have been put forward regarding the origin of Burlington&#x27;s name. The first is that it was named after Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and the second is that the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no Burling family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.

One of the New Hampshire grants, the land that was developed as Burlington was awarded by New Hampshire colonial governor Benning Wentworth on June 7, 1763, to Samuel Willis and 63 others. In the summer of 1775, settlers began clearing the land and built two or three log huts, but the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War delayed permanent settlement until after its conclusion. The town was organized in 1785.

In 1808, the world&#x27;s first lake-going steamboat was built in Burlington.

The War of 1812 was unpopular in Vermont and the rest of New England, which had numerous trading ties with Canada. Neither Vermont nor other New England states provided militia units or financial support. Vermont voters supported the Federalist Party, which opposed the war.

At one point during the war, the U.S. had 5,000 troops stationed in Burlington, outnumbering residents and putting a strain on resources. About 500 soldiers died of disease, which was always a problem due to poor sanitation in army camps. Some soldiers were quartered in the main building at the University of Vermont, where a memorial plaque commemorates them.

In a skirmish on August 2, 1813, British forces from Canada shelled Burlington. This is described as either a bold stroke by the British with an ineffectual response from the Americans or as a weak sally by the British, which was rightly ignored by the Americans. The cannonade lasted about 10 minutes and caused no casualties. The American troops involved were commanded by Naval Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, later a hero of the Battle of Lake Champlain.

The town&#x27;s position on Lake Champlain helped it develop into a port of entry and center for trade, particularly after completion of the Champlain Canal in 1823, the Erie Canal in 1825, and the Chambly Canal in 1843. Wharves allowed steamboats to connect freight and passengers with the Rutland &amp; Burlington Railroad and the Vermont Central Railroad. Burlington became a bustling lumbering and manufacturing center – for some time the third largest lumber market in the world – and was incorporated as a city in 1865. Its Victorian-era prosperity left behind much fine architecture, including buildings by Ammi B. Young, H.H. Richardson, and McKim, Mead &amp; White.

On September 5, 1901, U.S. vice president Theodore Roosevelt spoke to a Civil War fraternal group in Burlington. Nine days later, he became U.S. president when President McKinley died.

===Late 20th century to present===

In 1870, the waterfront was extended by construction of the Pine Street Barge Canal. This became polluted over the years and was a focus for cleanup in 2009 under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Superfund program. In fact, the entire Burlington waterfront was a derelict wasteland as late as the mid-1980s, with rail yards, industrial uses and 90 oil storage tanks crowding the 60 acres of shoreline filled into the harbor during the lumbering era.

In 1980, two 18 story luxury condominium towers were proposed for the waterfront, just north of College Street. Opposition to that proposal led to the formation of the Citizens Waterfront Group to advocate for a bike path along the shore instead.

In 1987, former Mayor Bernie Sanders proposed a community boathouse to anchor public redevelopment at the waterfront. The land filled into the harbor was eventually redesigned for public use in a decision of the Vermont Supreme Court in 1989.

By 1990, the Burlington Bike Path was complete, from Oakledge Park in the south, to the Winooski River in the north. In 2004, Governor Howard Dean obtained funding for construction of a bike bridge across the Winooski River, allowing the bike path to be extended four miles out into the lake on the old railroad causeway to the Champlain Islands, now known as the Island Line Trail.
In 1978, the ice cream enterprise Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s was founded in Burlington in a renovated gas station. It became a national brand, with retail outlets in numerous cities.

The local bicycle advocacy that emerged from this effort led to the formation of the non-profit Local Motion. They now run a bike ferry during the summer to get bicycles across a 200 yard gap in the railroad causeway, so they can get all the way out to the Lake Champlain islands.

In 2021, following the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the city council scheduled a vote on a &quot;Resolution In Solidarity with the Palestinian People&quot; for September 13. The resolution called on the city council to &quot;express its solidarity with the Palestinian people, condemn anti-boycott legislation, and endorse the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which calls for nonviolent pressure on Israel.&quot; The authors&#x27; stated reasons for introducing the resolution were Israeli settlements in the West Bank, an ongoing &quot;military siege and an economic blockade&quot; of Gaza, and US military aid to Israel. They also cited reports by Human Rights Watch and B&#x27;Tselem that find Israel guilty of the crime of apartheid.

The American Jewish Committee condemned the resolution as &quot;deceptive and one-sided&quot; and criticized it for its sole focus on Israel. A coalition of local rabbis and community groups condemned the resolution as well, citing the timing of the vote during the Jewish High Holy Days, between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and fears that the resolution would fuel antisemitism. Former mayor Miro Weinberger called the resolution &quot;inappropriate and counterproductive.&quot; In a 6–5 vote, the council decided to withdraw the resolution.

In 2023, three Palestinian-American students were shot and injured in an incident during Thanksgiving break.

==Geography==
The city of Burlington is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, north of Shelburne Bay. It was built on a strip of land extending about south from the mouth of the Winooski River along the lake shore, and rises from the water&#x27;s edge to a height of .

A large ravine in what is now downtown was filled in with refuse and raw sewage in the 19th century to make way for further development.

===Neighborhoods===
Burlington is characterized by its neighborhoods, which are generally recognized as follows:

* Downtown: The city&#x27;s commercial hub is north of Maple Street, west of South Willard Street, and mostly south of Pearl Street (as it includes all property along Pearl Street that is west of South Willard Street).
* Hill Section: Burlington&#x27;s wealthiest neighborhood is east of South Union Street and Shelburne Street, and south of Main Street, but excludes UVM and University Terrace while including all of Champlain College. The Hill Section is where the Burlington Country Club is situated.
* The Intervale: The Intervale cannot be considered a neighborhood but is a large area encompassing many locally owned organic farms and nature preserves along the Winooski River. Located to the north of the Old North End and east of the New North End, it is included on this list because its total area is larger than that of most neighborhoods in Burlington.
* New North End: Burlington&#x27;s most populous neighborhood, a northwest suburban extension of the city, includes all points north of Burlington High School, as well as Leddy Park, Ethan Allen Park, and North Beach, and is west of Vermont Route 127 (the &quot;Burlington Beltline&quot;).
* Old North End: Burlington&#x27;s oldest and most densely populated neighborhood is north of all property along Pearl Street, west of Hyde Street and North Willard Street, and is inclusive of areas north of Downtown and west of the University District but south of the New North End and the Intervale. It is here that Burlington&#x27;s largely Jewish neighborhood known as Little Jerusalem flourished from the 1880s to the 1930s.
* South End: A once mostly industrial and now mostly artistic district south of Downtown and west of the Hill Section, it includes the waterfront Oakledge Park and is home to the headquarters of many of Burlington&#x27;s nationally known companies like Burton Snowboards and Dealer.com.
* University District: The University District is north of the Burlington Country Club, south of the Winooski River, east of Willard Street north of Main, and east of a large chunk of the Hill Section. It includes UVM and many former single-family homes converted to student and yuppie apartments (although these are everywhere throughout the city limits and metropolitan area).

===Public library===
The Fletcher Free Library was established in 1873, endowed by Mary Martha Fletcher, the daughter of a local businessman, but outgrew its initial building on Church Street by 1901. A new building was constructed in 1901–04 with funds provided by industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, making it the first of the four Carnegie libraries in Vermont. It was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Walter R. B. Willcox of Burlington, who won a competition to receive the commission.

The building had major settling problems in 1973 where it had been built over a former railroad ravine, which had been improperly filled in, and the library&#x27;s collection was moved elsewhere. The possible razing of the building was stopped by a citizens&#x27; committee, which successfully had it added to the National Register of Historic Places, and a grant allowed the stabilization and repair of the building. A new modern addition was completed in 1981.

The largest public library in Vermont, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Fletcher Free Library had a budget of over $1 million in 2002. It circulated more books, had more visitors, and had more computers, than any other library in Vermont. In addition to its primary services as Burlington&#x27;s public library, it is also a community center, a cultural resource for newly arrived immigrants to the Burlington area, and the city&#x27;s only free public access computer center.

A native of the city, she was the daughter of John Howard, a successful Burlington hotelier. The chapel was designed in the High Victorian Gothic style by Alfred Benjamin Fisher, on cemetery grounds designed by E. C. Ryer in 1871.

The Ira Allen Chapel, on the grounds of the University of Vermont campus, was completed in 1926, and was designed in the Georgian Revival style by McKim, Mead &amp; White. The chapel&#x27;s flashing beacon provides a nighttime landmark for those approaching Burlington from Lake Champlain. The chapel is part of the University Green Historic District.

Two of the cathedrals in Burlington—the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St. Paul and the former Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception—are modern structures built after their predecessors were destroyed by arson fires in 1971–1972. The Episcopal Cathedral was completed in 1973 and was designed by Burlington Associates (now TruexCollins) in the Brutalist style, while the Roman Catholic Cathedral was built in 1974–1977 and was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, with the park-like grounds designed by landscape architect Dan Kiley. Immaculate Conception was closed in 2018 and replaced by the Cathedral of Saint Joseph (Neoclassical, 1887).

==Sports==
The Vermont Lake Monsters of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball team, were formerly called the Vermont Expos. The team changed its name in 2007 after its parent Major League Baseball club, the Montreal Expos of the National League, moved from Montreal to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals. In 2010, the Lake Monsters ended its 17-year association with the Expos/Nationals and became the Class A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics of the American League. The Lake Monsters play on the campus of the University of Vermont at Centennial Field.

Burlington has a rich hockey history, and was the location of the first known international ice hockey match, held between the Montreal Crystals and employees of the Van Ness House, a local hotel, during the 1886 Burlington Winter Carnival. The University of Vermont&#x27;s men&#x27;s hockey team, the Catamounts, play their home games at the 4,007-seat Gutterson Field House on the UVM campus.

A professional basketball franchise, the Vermont Frost Heaves, played half of their season in the city until the team folded in 2011. The team, which originally was part of the American Basketball Association—not to be confused with the 1970s-era major basketball league of the same name that merged with the National Basketball Association—moved to the Premier Basketball League in 2008 and split their regular-season home games between Burlington and Barre. The Frost Heaves, owned by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Alexander Wolff, played their Burlington games at the Memorial Auditorium, on South Union Street, at the corner of Main. However, the franchise folded in early 2011.

The Vermont City Marathon has drawn thousands of competitors annually. A local Golden Gloves boxing tournament has been held annually since 1946.

Burlington was a venue site for the 2012 International Ice Hockey Federation Women&#x27;s World Championship.

==Government==
Burlington has had a mayor–council form of government since 1865 with its first mayor being Albert L. Catlin. Democrats and Progressives make up the majority of the council. Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, the current mayor, is a Progressive who was first elected in March 2024. The city council has twelve seats. As of 2024, the city council is composed of six Democrats, five Progressives, and one independent. Ben Traverse, a Democrat, is the current Council President.

U.S. senator and two-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders served as the mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989. His election in 1981 unseated longstanding mayor Gordon Paquette and drastically altered the political landscape of the city. Mayor Sanders created a government that was run by young Progressives, including Peter Clavelle, who was elected mayor of the city when Sanders stepped down to run for higher office. Peter Clavelle, Burlington&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, held the office from 1989 to 1993, and again from 1995 to 2006.

In the 1980s, the successive reelections of a self-proclaimed &quot;socialist&quot; drew attention from the national media. Sanders has dispelled the notion that his first victory, secured by a narrow margin, was &quot;just a fluke&quot;.

The large transient student population votes in local, state, and national elections, resulting in a considerable impact on local elections. The city signed up 2,527 new voters in the six weeks from September 1, 2008, the highest number for that time frame in over nine years.

As a nonprofit institution, the University of Vermont pays no real estate taxes; however, like many other educational institutions, it makes an annual payment in place of taxes. In 2007, the college agreed to raise this from $456,006 to $912,011 in 2010 plus a &quot;public works&quot; supplement rising from $180,040 to $191,004 over the same time frame.

The city maintains three parks on Lake Champlain. All three are free for public access, with two having parking fees.

Alice B. Moore&#x27;s election to the school commission from the second ward as a Republican in 1921 made her the first woman elected to office in Burlington.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Bus====
Burlington is the central focus of Green Mountain Transit (GMT), which provides bus service within the city and to and from surrounding municipalities.

On June 15, 2011, the Chittenden County Transportation Authority announced that it had changed its charter, effective July 1, 2011, to allow municipalities outside Chittenden County to join CCTA as member communities, thereby allowing CCTA to become Vermont&#x27;s first regional transit authority. As part of its expansion, the CCTA merged with the Green Mountain Transit Authority (GMTA), which provided bus service in the Barre-Montpelier area and surrounding communities in central Vermont.

Greyhound provides intercity bus service from the Downtown Transit Center bus station to other communities in Vermont, and to Montreal&#x27;s Gare d&#x27;autocars de Montreal and Boston&#x27;s South Station and Logan International Airport. Premier Coach&#x27;s Vermont Translines also provides intercity bus service between Burlington and Albany, New York, along the U.S. Route 7 corridor in a partnership with Greyhound, also from the airport.

====Rail====
Burlington is connected to New York City via Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;, which began serving the city in July 2022. Service is to Union Station, built on the city&#x27;s waterfront in 1916. The extension to Burlington was first proposed in 2013 by Vermont governor Peter Shumlin. Prior to this, the nearest Amtrak station was located about to the east in Essex Junction, Vermont, which is served by the &quot;Vermonter&quot;.

Rail service began in Burlington in 1849. From the late nineteenth century to 1953, the Rutland Railroad provided passenger service on the &quot;Green Mountain Flyer&quot; and the &quot;Mount Royal&quot; from Burlington to Troy, New York, with connecting service to New York City via the New York Central Railroad. The last passenger train to run north via the Burlington Tunnel to Alburgh, a town in the northwest extremity of Vermont, was in June 1938. From 2000 to 2003, the &quot;Champlain Flyer&quot; was a commuter service from Burlington south to the town of Charlotte, Vermont.

====Air====
Air carriers at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport (BTV) provide the area with commercial service to major regional hubs and international airports. While scheduled carriers have not traditionally offered scheduled commercial flights to destinations outside the United States, there is a Customs Port of Entry for unscheduled flights. From 2011 to 2018, the only available international commercial flights for BTV were via Porter Airlines&#x27; winter seasonal service to and from Billy Bishop Airport in Toronto.

====Major roads====
Burlington is served by one major Interstate highway, along with its spur route into the southern part of the city, and is at the junction of two U.S. highways. Several Vermont state highways also provide routes into and through the Burlington area.

* Interstate 89: Though it does not directly enter the Burlington city limits, I-89 has interchanges in neighboring South Burlington, Winooski, and Colchester that provide access to downtown.
* Interstate 189: I-189 connects I-89 in South Burlington to U.S. 7 at the southern end of Burlington.
* U.S. Route 2 is the main east–west route entering Burlington. After entering the city from the east, westbound U.S. 2 turns north to run concurrently with U.S. 7 towards Winooski and Colchester. The intersection with Interstate 89 is used by 42,000 cars daily.
* U.S. Route 7 is the main north–south route through Burlington. Northbound U.S. 7 joins westbound U.S. 2 in downtown Burlington, and the two routes run concurrently north to Colchester before diverging.
* Vermont Route 127 connects downtown and the Old North End with the New North End and the town of Colchester. Throughout the New North End, VT-127 is a limited-access highway officially named the Winooski Valley Parkway, though commonly known as the &quot;Burlington Beltline&quot;.

====Ferry service====
Burlington is the headquarters of the Lake Champlain Transportation Company, a privately held company that offers ferry service for the North Country of New York state and the Champlain Valley region of Vermont. One line of year-round 24-hour service is provided from the nearby town of Grand Isle, Vermont, to Plattsburgh, New York, with another line of daily service from Charlotte, Vermont, to Essex, New York.

===Internet===
The city has municipal fiber broadband, which provides telephone, broadband internet, and television. In 2008, cable management tried to drop Al-Jazeera English from the lineup. This was successfully thwarted by protesters and the station was, in 2009, one of three &quot;small cable operators&quot; in the nation to carry this channel.

===Electricity===
Burlington owns its own power company, Burlington Electric Department. In 2009, the department announced that it would purchase 40% of the output of the 40 MW Sheffield, Vermont, wind-generated electricity when it became available.

==== Renewable energy ====
Burlington began operating on 100% renewable energy in 2014 after being a pioneer in the renewable energy sector for decades. The Burlington Electric Department, which began operating in 1903, originally used coal as a primary source of energy. However, after experiencing the effects of fluctuating coal prices throughout the second World War, the department slowly began using wood as an energy source because of the price and overall energy efficiency of wood. Since then, the city has experienced a sustainability boom, and today runs on 100% renewable energy. A succession of mayors in the city, along with corresponding public interest, are credited with this change. Gordon Paquette made the decision to completely transition from coal to wood at the McNeil Generating Station in 1977, and Bernie Sanders picked up this momentum of the environmental movement in the small city. This continued with Peter Clavelle, who mandated recycling in the city, and passed a number of bonds which funded energy improvements in infrastructure. In 1995, the city issued the Legacy Plan, which aimed to &quot;go beyond the branding and rhetoric and create actual examples that will resonate and make a difference in people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

Today, that plan has come to fruition in many ways. The city operates entirely on energy from the Winooski One Hydro Plant, a series of wind turbines and solar panels, as well as the sustainably-sourced wood burning plant at McNeil Generating Station. This made Burlington the first city to run completely on sustainable energy sources: a landmark for green infrastructure. Along with keeping energy rates low for customers, sustainability in the city extends beyond energy infrastructure. A non-profit organization in the city started an incubator farm that produces 30,000 pounds of fresh, local food for those facing food insecurity. The city has also worked on drastic building restoration projects, installed bikeways for more efficient transportation, and prioritized energy saving in the downtown.

In September 2019, the former mayor Miro Weinberger announced plans to get the city to net zero status by 2030. This would mean that the city would produce and consume equal amounts of energy. In October 2020, Burlington Electric proposed an ordinance that would require all buildings in the city to switch to electric energy sources. This would put the city closer to that net-zero goal, and continues its legacy as a trailblazer for sustainable infrastructure.

===Health and social services===
Burlington is home to University of Vermont Medical Center, a tertiary referral hospital for Vermont and the North Country of New York, Level I Trauma Center, and teaching hospital.

In 2010, the government banned smoking within of the city&#x27;s parks and recreational areas.

Howard Center, headquartered in Burlington, provides social services to state residents, and runs Vermont&#x27;s first and the area&#x27;s only methadone maintenance program, the Chittenden Clinic.

===Signage===
Burlington City Council unanimously voted on August 8, 2011 a resolution to promote the use of French in municipal public services, in restaurant menus and in second language courses in schools.

<text>William Henry Pratt (23 November 1887 – 2 February 1969), known professionally as Boris Karloff () and occasionally billed as Karloff the Uncanny, was a British actor. His portrayal of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in the horror film &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), his 82nd film, established him as a horror icon, and he reprised the role for the sequels &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935) and &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939). He also appeared as Imhotep in &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), and voiced the Grinch in, as well as narrating, the animated television special of Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (1966), which won him a Grammy Award.

Aside from his numerous film roles (174 films), Karloff acted in many live stage plays and appeared on dozens of radio and television programs as well. For his contribution to film and television, Karloff was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960.

==Early life==

William Henry Pratt was born on 23 November 1887, at 36 Forest Hill Road, Peckham. His parents were Edward John Pratt (1826/7–1897), of the Indian Civil Service, where he worked for the salt revenue service, and Eliza Sara (born 1848), née Millard. Both his parents died when Karloff was young, and he was primarily raised by a half-sister and his elder siblings. His brother, Sir John Thomas Pratt, was a British diplomat. Karloff&#x27;s father Edward John Pratt was Anglo-Indian, with a British father and Indian mother, meaning that Karloff was at least a quarter Indian, while Karloff&#x27;s mother also had some Indian ancestry; thus Karloff had a relatively dark complexion that differed from his peers at the time. His mother&#x27;s maternal aunt was Anna Leonowens, whose tales about life in the royal court of Siam (now Thailand) were the basis of the novel &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;. Pratt was bow-legged, had a lisp, and stuttered as a young boy. He learned how to manage his stutter, but not his lisp, which was noticeable throughout his career in the film industry.

Pratt spent his childhood years in Enfield, in the County of Middlesex. He was the youngest of nine children, and following his mother&#x27;s death was brought up by his elder siblings. After first attending Enfield Grammar School, he received a private education at Uppingham School and Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. Following this he attended King&#x27;s College London, where he took studies aimed at a career with the British Government&#x27;s Consular Service. However, in 1909, he left university without graduating and drifted, departing England for Canada, where he worked as a farm labourer, truck driver and did various odd jobs in British Columbia until happening upon stage acting, which led to a later film career.

==Professional career==

===Adoption of stage name===
Pratt began appearing in theatrical performances in Canada in 1911 and during this period he chose &quot;Boris Karloff&quot; as his stage name. His presence in Regina, Saskatchewan, at the Regina Theatre on the night of the Regina Cyclone in 1912 is a commemorated event. Karloff always said he chose the first name &quot;Boris&quot; simply because it sounded foreign and exotic, and that &quot;Karloff&quot; was a family name. Karloff&#x27;s daughter, Sara, publicly denied any knowledge of Slavic forebears, &quot;Karloff&quot; or otherwise.

It has been speculated by film historians that he took the stage name from a mad scientist character named &quot;Boris Karlov&quot; in the novel &quot;The Drums of Jeopardy&quot; by Harold MacGrath. The novel was not published until 1920, at least eight years after Karloff had been using the name on stage and in films. (Warner Oland played &quot;Boris Karlov&quot; in a film version in 1931.) Another possible influence was thought to be a character in the Edgar Rice Burroughs fantasy novel &quot;The Rider,&quot; which features a &quot;Prince Boris of Karlova&quot;, but as the novel was not published until 1915, the influence may be backward, that Burroughs saw Karloff in a play and adapted the name for the character.

One reason for the name change was to prevent embarrassment to the Pratt family. Whether or not his brothers (all dignified members of the British Foreign Service) actually considered young William the &quot;black sheep of the family&quot; for having become an actor, Karloff apparently worried they felt that way. He did not reunite with his family until he returned to Britain to make &quot;The Ghoul&quot; (1933), extremely worried that his siblings would disapprove of his new, macabre claim to world fame. Instead, his brothers jostled for position around him and happily posed for publicity photographs upon their reunion with him. After the photo was taken, Karloff&#x27;s brothers immediately started asking about getting a copy of their own. The story of the photo became one of Karloff&#x27;s favorites.

=== Canadian and U.S. stage work ===
Karloff joined the Jeanne Russell Company in 1911 and performed in towns including Kamloops (British Columbia) and Prince Albert (Saskatchewan). After the devastating tornado in Regina on 30 June 1912, Karloff, who was in the midst of an engagement at the Regina Theatre, and other performers helped with clean-up efforts. He later took a job as a railway baggage handler and joined the Harry St. Clair Company that performed in Minot, North Dakota, for a year in an opera house above a hardware store.

While he was trying to establish his acting career, Karloff had to perform years of manual labour in Canada and the U.S. to make ends meet. Among this work, he spent one year laying track, digging ditches, shoveling coal, clearing land, and working with surveying parties for the B.C. Electric Railway Company, at the rate of $2.50 per day. From this gruelling work with the BCER and other employers, Karloff was left with back problems for the rest of his life. Because of his health, he did not serve in World War I.

During this period, Karloff worked in various theatrical stock companies across the U.S. to hone his acting skills. Some acting companies mentioned were the Harry St. Clair Players and the Billie Bennett Touring Company. By early 1918 he was working with the Maud Amber Players in Vallejo, California, but because of the Spanish flu outbreak in the San Francisco area and the fear of infection, the troupe was disbanded. He was able to find work with the Haggerty Repertory for a while (according to the 1973 obituary of Joseph Paul Haggerty, he and Boris Karloff remained lifelong friends).

=== Early Hollywood career ===

Once Karloff arrived in Hollywood, he appeared in small roles in dozens of silent films, but the work was sporadic and he often had to take up manual labour such as digging ditches or delivering construction plaster to make ends meet. (According to Karloff, his first film was a Frank Borzage picture at Universal for which he received $5 as an extra; the title of this film has never been traced.)

His first certain screen role was in a film serial, &quot;The Lightning Raider&quot; (1919) with Pearl White. He was in another serial that same year, &quot;The Masked Rider&quot; (1919), the earliest of his film appearances that has survived. Karloff could also be seen in &quot;His Majesty, the American&quot; (1919) with Douglas Fairbanks, &quot;The Prince and Betty&quot; (1919), &quot;The Deadlier Sex&quot; (1920) with Blanche Sweet, and &quot;The Courage of Marge O&#x27;Doone&quot; (1920). He played an Indian in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1920) with Wallace Beery and he would often be cast as an Arab or Indian in his early films.

Karloff&#x27;s first major role came in a film serial, &quot;The Hope Diamond Mystery&quot; (1920). He was Indian in &quot;Without Benefit of Clergy&quot; (1921) and an Arab in &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot; (1921) and villainous in &quot;The Cave Girl&quot; (1921). He was a maharajah in &quot;The Man from Downing Street&quot; (1922), a Nabob in &quot;The Infidel&quot; (1922) and had roles in &quot;The Altar Stairs&quot; (1922), &quot;Omar the Tentmaker&quot; (1922) (as an Imam), &quot;The Woman Conquers&quot; (1922), &quot;The Gentleman from America&quot; (1923), &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1923) and the serial &quot;Riders of the Plains&quot; (1923).

Karloff did a Western, &quot;The Hellion&quot; (1923), and a drama, &quot;Dynamite Dan&quot; (1924). He could be seen in &quot;Parisian Nights&quot; (1925), &quot;Forbidden Cargo&quot; (1925), &quot;The Prairie Wife&quot; (1925) and the serial &quot;Perils of the Wild&quot; (1925). Karloff went back to bit part status in &quot;Never the Twain Shall Meet&quot; (1925), directed by Maurice Tourneur, but he had a good support part in &quot;Lady Robinhood&quot; (1925) starring Evelyn Brent in the titular role.

Karloff went on to be in &quot;The Greater Glory&quot; (1926), &quot;Her Honor, the Governor&quot; (1926), &quot;The Bells&quot; (1926) (as a mesmerist), &quot;The Nickel-Hopper&quot; (1926) with Mabel Normand, &quot;The Golden Web&quot; (1926), &quot;The Eagle of the Sea&quot; (1926), &quot;Flames&quot; (1926), &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; (1926) with Wallace Beery and Esther Ralston, &quot;Flaming Fury&quot; (1926), &quot;Valencia&quot; (1926), &quot;The Man in the Saddle&quot; (1926) with Hoot Gibson, &quot;Tarzan and the Golden Lion&quot; (1927) (as an African), &quot;Let It Rain&quot; (1927), &quot;The Meddlin&#x27; Stranger&quot; (1927), &quot;The Princess from Hoboken&quot; (1927), &quot;The Phantom Buster&quot; (1927) with Buddy Roosevelt, and &quot;Soft Cushions&quot; (1927).

Karloff had roles in &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; (1927), &quot;The Love Mart&quot; (1927) with Noah Beery Sr., &quot;The Vanishing Rider&quot; (1928) (a serial), &quot;Burning the Wind&quot; (1928), &quot;Vultures of the Sea&quot; (1928), and &quot;The Little Wild Girl&quot; (1928).

He was in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot; (1929), &quot;The Fatal Warning&quot; (1929) for Richard Thorpe, &quot;The Phantom of the North&quot; (1929), &quot;Two Sisters&quot; (1929), &quot;Anne Against the World&quot; (1929), &quot;Behind That Curtain&quot; (1929) with Warner Baxter, and &quot;The King of the Kongo&quot; (1929), a serial directed by Thorpe.

While one day sitting at the bus stop in the pouring rain, Lon Chaney Sr., &#x27;The Man of a Thousand Faces&#x27;, spotted Karloff and offered him a ride. Chaney told him &quot;to find something different that will set you apart and is different from anything someone else has done or is willing to do and do it better&quot;.

Karloff had an uncredited bit part in &quot;The Unholy Night&quot; (1930) directed by Lionel Barrymore, and bigger parts in &quot;The Bad One&quot; (1930),&quot;The Sea Bat&quot; (1930) starring Charles Bickford and directed by Lionel Barrymore and Wesley Ruggles, and &quot;The Utah Kid&quot; (1930) directed by Thorpe.

A film which brought Karloff recognition was &quot;The Criminal Code&quot; (1931), a prison drama directed by Howard Hawks in which he reprised a dramatic part he had played on stage. In the same period, Karloff had a supporting role as a mob boss in Hawks&#x27; gangster film &quot;Scarface&quot; starring Paul Muni and George Raft, but the film was not released until 1932 because of censorship problems.

He did another serial for Thorpe, &quot;King of the Wild&quot; (1931), then had support parts in &quot;Cracked Nuts&quot; (1931) with Wheeler and Woolsey, &quot;Young Donovan&#x27;s Kid&quot; (1931) with Jackie Cooper, &quot;Smart Money&quot; (1931) with Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney in their only film together, &quot;The Public Defender&quot; (1931) with Richard Dix, &quot;I Like Your Nerve&quot; (1931) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Loretta Young, and &quot;Graft&quot; (1931) with Regis Toomey and future agent Sue Carol.

Another significant role in the autumn of 1931 saw Karloff play a key supporting part as an unethical newspaper reporter in &quot;Five Star Final&quot; with Edward G. Robinson, a film about tabloid journalism which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

He could also be seen in &quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot; (1931) with Elissa Landi, Lionel Barrymore and Laurence Olivier during Olivier&#x27;s memorable first round in Hollywood, &quot;The Mad Genius&quot; (1931) with John Barrymore, &quot;The Guilty Generation&quot; (1931) with Robert Young and &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; (1931) with Gloria Swanson.

===Stardom===
Karloff acted in eighty-one films before being discovered by James Whale and cast in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931). Karloff&#x27;s role as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster was physically demanding – it necessitated a bulky costume with four-inch platform boots – but the costume and extensive makeup produced an iconic image. The costume was a job in itself for Karloff with the shoes weighing each, which further aggravated his back problems. Universal Studios quickly copyrighted the makeup design for the Frankenstein monster that Jack P. Pierce had created.

It took a while for Karloff&#x27;s stardom to be established with the public – he had small roles in &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (1932), &quot;Business and Pleasure&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Miracle Man&quot; (1932). As receipts for &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot; flooded in, Universal gave Karloff third billing in &quot;Night World&quot; (1932), with Lew Ayres, Mae Clarke and George Raft.


Karloff was reunited with Whale at Universal for &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932), a horror film based on the novel &quot;Benighted&quot; by J. B. Priestley, in which he finally enjoyed top billing above Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart; he was billed simply as &quot;KARLOFF&quot;, a custom that Universal continued for several years. He was loaned to MGM to play the titular role in &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (also 1932), for which he had top billing.

Back at Universal, he was cast as Imhotep who is revived in &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), an original story inspired by the unsealing of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb—though a remake of &quot;Dracula&quot; set in Egypt, conceived to continue the success of the &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; adaptations. &quot;The Mummy&quot; was as successful at the box-office as his other two films and Karloff was now established as a star of horror films. Like &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot; would spawn a line of sequels, although Karloff would not reprise the iconic 1932 role.

Karloff returned to England to star in &quot;The Ghoul&quot; (1933), then made a non-horror film for John Ford, &quot;The Lost Patrol&quot; (1934), for which his performance was highly acclaimed.

Karloff was third billed in the Twentieth Century Pictures historical film &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot; (1934) with George Arliss, which was highly popular.

Horror had become Karloff&#x27;s primary genre, and he gave a string of lauded performances in Universal&#x27;s horror films, including several with Bela Lugosi, his main rival as heir to Lon Chaney&#x27;s status as the leading horror film star. While the long-standing, creative partnership between Karloff and Lugosi never led to a close friendship, it produced some of the actors&#x27; most revered and enduring productions, beginning with &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1934) and continuing with &quot;Gift of Gab&quot; (1934), in which both had cameos. Karloff reprised the role of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935) for James Whale. Then he and Lugosi were reunited for &quot;The Raven&quot; (1935). Billed only by his last name during this period, Karloff had top billing above Lugosi in all their films together despite Lugosi having the larger role in &quot;The Raven&quot;.

For Columbia, Karloff made &quot;The Black Room&quot; (1935) then he returned to Universal for &quot;The Invisible Ray&quot; (1936) with Lugosi, more a science fiction film. Karloff was then cast in a Warner Bros. horror film, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (1936).

Because the Motion Picture Production Code (known as the Hays Code) began to be seriously enforced in 1934, horror films declined in the second half of the 1930s. Karloff worked in other genres, making two films in Britain, &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Man Who Changed His Mind&quot; (1936) which was released in the U.S. as &quot;The Man Who Lived Again&quot;.

He returned to Hollywood to play a supporting role in &quot;Charlie Chan at the Opera&quot; (1936), then starred in a crime drama, &quot;Night Key&quot; (1937). At Warners, he did two films with John Farrow, playing a Chinese warlord in &quot;West of Shanghai&quot; (1937) and a murder suspect in &quot;The Invisible Menace&quot; (1938).

Karloff went to Monogram to play the title role of a Chinese detective in &quot;Mr. Wong, Detective&quot; (1938), which led to a series. Karloff&#x27;s portrayal of the character is an example of Hollywood&#x27;s use of yellowface and its portrayal of East Asians in the earlier half of the 20th century. He had another heroic role in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Island&quot; (1939).

Universal found reissuing &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; led to success at the box-office and began to produce horror films again starting with &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939). Karloff reprised his role, with Lugosi also starring as Ygor and top-billed Basil Rathbone as Dr. Frankenstein. This was Karloff&#x27;s first Universal film since the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in which Karloff was not top billed as &quot;KARLOFF&quot;, a custom that the studio had used for eight films in a row while Karloff was at the height of his career. Basil Rathbone held top billing for &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, and since Rathbone, Karloff and Lugosi were all billed above the title, billing Basil, Boris and Bela was hard to resist. Karloff was never billed by simply his last name again. Regarding &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, the film&#x27;s director Rowland V. Lee said his crew let Lugosi &quot;work on the characterization; the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected ... when we finished shooting, there was no doubt in anyone&#x27;s mind that he stole the show. Karloff&#x27;s monster was weak by comparison.&quot;

After &quot;The Mystery of Mr. Wong&quot; (1939) and &quot;Mr. Wong in Chinatown&quot; (1939) he signed a three-picture deal with Columbia, starting with &quot;The Man They Could Not Hang&quot; (1939). Karloff returned to Universal to make &quot;Tower of London&quot; (1939) with Rathbone, playing the murderous henchman of King Richard III.
Karloff made a fourth Mr Wong film at Monogram &quot;The Fatal Hour&quot; (1940). At Warners he was in &quot;British Intelligence&quot; (1940), then he went to Universal to do &quot;Black Friday&quot; (1940) with Lugosi.

Karloff&#x27;s second and third films for Columbia were &quot;The Man with Nine Lives&quot; (1940) and &quot;Before I Hang&quot; (1940). In between he did a fifth and final Mr Wong film, &quot;Doomed to Die&quot; (1940).

Karloff appeared at a celebrity baseball game as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in 1940, hitting a gag home run and making catcher Buster Keaton fall into an acrobatic dead faint as the monster stomped into home plate.

Karloff finished a six picture commitment with Monogram with &quot;The Ape&quot; (1940). He and Lugosi appeared with Peter Lorre in a comedy at RKO, &quot;You&#x27;ll Find Out&quot; (1941), then he went to Columbia for &quot;The Devil Commands&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Boogie Man Will Get You&quot; (1941).

===Professional expansion and further success===
An enthusiastic performer, he returned to the Broadway stage in the original production of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; in 1941, in which he played a homicidal gangster enraged to be frequently mistaken for Karloff. Frank Capra cast Raymond Massey in the 1944 film, which was shot in 1941, while Karloff was still appearing in the role on Broadway. The play&#x27;s producers allowed the film to be made conditionally: it was not to be released until the production closed. (Karloff reprised his role on television in the anthology series &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; (1955), and with Tony Randall and Tom Bosley in a 1962 production on the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. He also starred in a radio adaptation produced by Screen Guild Theatre in 1946.)

In 1944, he underwent a spinal operation to relieve a chronic arthritic condition.

Karloff returned to film roles in &quot;The Climax&quot; (1944), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943). More liked was &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944), marking Karloff&#x27;s &quot;retirement&quot; from playing the Monster, where instead, he comes full circle to play the villainous Dr. Niemann, a mad scientist fixated on life-experiments much like Henry Frankenstein, and pass the torch to actor Glenn Strange, who would play the Monster in subsequent films.

Karloff made three films for producer Val Lewton at RKO: &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; (1945), his last teaming with Lugosi, &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; (1945) and &quot;Bedlam&quot; (1946).

In a 1946 interview with Louis Berg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Karloff discussed his arrangement with RKO, working with Lewton and his reasons for leaving Universal. Karloff left Universal because he thought the Frankenstein franchise had run its course; the entries in the series after &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; were B-pictures. Berg wrote that the last installment in which Karloff appeared—&quot;House of Frankenstein&quot;—was what he called a &quot; &#x27;monster clambake,&#x27; with everything thrown in—Frankenstein, Dracula, a hunchback and a &#x27;man-beast&#x27; that howled in the night. It was too much. Karloff thought it was ridiculous and said so.&quot; Berg explained that the actor had &quot;great love and respect for&quot; Lewton, who was &quot;the man who rescued him from the living dead and restored, so to speak, his soul.&quot;

Horror films experienced a decline in popularity after the war, and Karloff found himself working in other genres.

For the Danny Kaye comedy &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947), Karloff appeared in a brief but starring role as Dr. Hugo Hollingshead, a psychiatrist. Director Norman Z. McLeod shot a sequence with Karloff in the Frankenstein monster make-up, but it was deleted from the finished film.

Karloff appeared in a film noir, &quot;Lured&quot; (1947), and as an Indian in &quot;Unconquered&quot; (1947). He had support roles in &quot;Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome&quot; (1947), &quot;Tap Roots&quot; (1948), and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff&quot; (1949).
During this period, Karloff was a frequent guest on radio programmes, whether it was starring in Arch Oboler&#x27;s Chicago-based &quot;Lights Out&quot; productions (including the episode &quot;Cat Wife&quot;) or spoofing his horror image with Fred Allen or Jack Benny. In 1949, he was the host and star of &quot;Starring Boris Karloff,&quot; a radio and television anthology series for the ABC broadcasting network.

He appeared as the villainous Captain Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in a 1950 stage musical adaptation which also featured Jean Arthur.

Karloff returned to horror films with &quot;The Strange Door&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Black Castle&quot; (1952).

He was nominated for a Tony Award for his work opposite Julie Harris in &quot;The Lark,&quot; by the French playwright Jean Anouilh, about Joan of Arc, which he reprised years later on TV&#x27;s &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame.&quot;

During the 1950s, he appeared on British television in the series &quot;Colonel March of Scotland Yard,&quot; in which he portrayed John Dickson Carr&#x27;s fictional detective Colonel March, who was known for solving apparently impossible crimes. Christopher Lee appeared alongside Karloff in the episode &quot;At Night, All Cats are Grey&quot; broadcast in 1955. A little later, Karloff co-starred with Lee in the film &quot;Corridors of Blood&quot; (1958).

Karloff appeared in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1952) and visited Italy for &quot;The Island Monster&quot; (1954) and then returned to Hollywood to appear in &quot;Sabaka&quot; (1954).

Karloff, along with H. V. Kaltenborn, was a regular panelist on the NBC game show, &quot;Who Said That?&quot; which aired between 1948 and 1955. Later, as a guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;, Karloff sang &quot;Those Were the Good Old Days&quot; from &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; while Gisele MacKenzie performed the solo, &quot;Give Me the Simple Life&quot;. On &quot;The Red Skelton Show,&quot; Karloff guest starred along with actor Vincent Price in a parody of Frankenstein, with Red Skelton as &quot;Klem Kadiddle Monster&quot;. He served as host and one of the stars of the anthology series &quot;The Veil&quot; (1958), a 12-episode Hal Roach TV series which was never broadcast at all due to financial problems at the producing studio; the complete series was later rediscovered in the 1990s and eventually released on DVD.

Karloff made some horror films in the late 1950s: &quot;Voodoo Island&quot; (1957), &quot;The Haunted Strangler&quot; (1958), &quot;Frankenstein 1970&quot; (1958) (this time as the Baron), and &quot;Corridors of Blood&quot; (1958). Karloff donned the Frankenstein Monster make-up for the last time in 1962 for a Halloween episode of the TV series &quot;Route 66&quot;, which also featured Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr.

During this period, he hosted and acted in a number of television series, including &quot;Thriller&quot; and Britain&#x27;s &quot;Out of This World&quot;.

===Spoken word recordings and horror anthologies===
He recorded the title role of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; for the Shakespeare Recording Society (Caedmon Audio 1962). He also recorded the narration for Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under Mario Rossi.

Records he made for the children&#x27;s market included &quot;Three Little Pigs and Other Fairy Stories&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Frightened&quot; (volume 1 and 2), Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot; and, with Cyril Ritchard and Celeste Holm, &quot;Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes&quot;, and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;.

Karloff was credited for editing several horror anthologies, commencing with &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; (Cleveland and NY: World Publishing Co, 1943) (compiled with the help of Edmond Speare). This wartime-published anthology went through at least five printings to September 1945. It has been reprinted recently (Orange NJ: Idea Men, 2007). Karloff&#x27;s name was also attached to &quot;And the Darkness Falls&quot; (Cleveland and NY: World Publishing Co, 1946); and &quot;The Boris Karloff Horror Anthology&quot; (London: Souvenir Press, 1965; simultaneous publication in Canada - Toronto: The Ryerson Press; US pbk reprint NY: Avon Books, 1965 retitled as &quot;Boris Karloff&#x27;s Favourite Horror Stories&quot;; UK pbk reprints London: Corgi, 1969 and London: Everest, 1975, both under the original title), though it is less clear whether Karloff himself actually edited these.

&quot;Tales of the Frightened&quot; (Belmont Books, 1963), though based on the recordings by Karloff of the same title, and featuring his image on the book cover, contained stories written by Michael Avallone; the second volume, &quot;More Tales of the Frightened&quot;, contained stories authored by Robert Lory. Both Avallone and Lory worked closely with Canadian editor and book packager Lyle Kenyon Engel, who also ghost-edited a horror story anthology for horror film star Basil Rathbone.

=== Final roles and work ===

Karloff went to Italy to appear in &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; (1963) directed by Mario Bava. He made &quot;The Raven&quot; (1963) for Roger Corman and American International Pictures (AIP). When &quot;The Raven&quot; had successfully wrapped shooting with time left in Karloff&#x27;s contract, Corman conscribed a new story with the same sets to feature Karloff in &quot;The Terror&quot; (1963), with Jack Nicholson in the leading role and Karloff playing a baron who murdered his wife. He made a cameo in AIP&#x27;s &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; (1964) and had a bigger role in that studio&#x27;s &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1964), directed by Jacques Tourneur, and travelled to England to make &quot;Die, Monster, Die!&quot; (1965) co-starring Nick Adams. British actress Suzan Farmer, who played his daughter in the film, later recalled Karloff was aloof during production &quot;and wasn&#x27;t the charming personality people perceived him to be&quot;, probably because he was in such intense pain in the 1960s.

In 1966, Karloff also appeared with Robert Vaughn and Stefanie Powers in the spy series &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Mother Muffin Affair&quot;, Karloff performing in drag as the titular character. That same year, he also played an Indian Maharajah on the installment of the adventure series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; titled &quot;The Night of the Golden Cobra&quot;. Karloff&#x27;s last film for AIP was &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot; (1966).

In 1967, he played an eccentric Spanish professor who believes himself to be Don Quixote in a whimsical episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; titled &quot;Mainly on the Plains&quot;, which he filmed in Spain. &quot;Cauldron of Blood&quot;, shot in Spain around the same time, and co-starring Viveca Lindfors, was only released in 1970 after Karloff&#x27;s death.

In the mid-1960s, he enjoyed a late-career surge in the United States when he narrated the made-for-television animated film of Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, and also provided the voice of the Grinch, although the song &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot; was sung by the American voice actor Thurl Ravenscroft. The film was first broadcast on CBS-TV in 1966. Karloff later received a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Recording For Children&quot; after the recording was commercially released. Because Ravenscroft (who never met Karloff in the course of their work on the show) was uncredited for his contribution to &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, his performance of the song was at times misattributed to Karloff.

He appeared in &quot;Mad Monster Party?&quot; (1967) and went to England to star in the second feature film of the British director Michael Reeves, &quot;The Sorcerers&quot; (1967).

Karloff starred in &quot;Targets&quot; (1968), the first feature film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, featuring two separate plotlines that converge into one. In one, a disturbed young man kills his family, then embarks on a killing spree. In the other, a famous horror-film actor confirms his retirement, agreeing to one last appearance at a drive-in cinema. Karloff starred as the retired horror film actor, Byron Orlok, a thinly disguised version of himself; Orlok (named both for Karloff himself and Count Orlok) was facing an end-of-life crisis, which he resolves through a confrontation with the crazed gunman at the drive-in cinema.

Around the same time, he played the occult expert Professor Marsh in a British production titled &quot;The Crimson Cult&quot; (&quot;Curse of the Crimson Altar&quot;, also 1968), which was the last Karloff film to be released during his lifetime.

He ended his career by appearing in four low-budget Mexican horror films: &quot;Isle of the Snake People&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Invasion&quot;, &quot;Fear Chamber&quot; and &quot;House of Evil&quot;. This was a package deal with Mexican producer Luis Enrique Vergara. Karloff&#x27;s scenes for all four films were directed by Jack Hill and shot back-to-back within one month in Los Angeles in the spring of 1968. The films were later completed in Mexico and theatrically released in the early 1970s. Karloff was originally slated to travel to Mexico to shoot the films, but he had emphysema and crippling arthritis. Only half of one lung was still functioning and he required oxygen between takes, so Hill arranged for Karloff to film his scenes in California.

Due to the unexpected sudden death of the producer Vergara, all four Mexican films were embroiled for a while in legal actions and were only released posthumously in 1971, with the last, &quot;The Incredible Invasion&quot;, not released until 1972, more than two years after Karloff&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Upon returning to Britain to live in 1959, his address was 43 Cadogan Square, London. In 1966, he bought 25 Campden House (at 29 Sheffield Terrace), Kensington W8, and Roundabout Cottage in the Hampshire village of Bramshott. A longtime heavy smoker, he had emphysema, which left him with only half of one lung still functioning. He contracted bronchitis in late 1968 and was hospitalised at University College Hospital. He died of pneumonia at King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, in Sussex, on 2 February 1969, at the age of 81.

His body was cremated following a requested modest service at Guildford Crematorium, Godalming, Surrey, where he is commemorated by a plaque in the Garden of Remembrance. A memorial service was held at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden (&quot;the Actors&#x27; Church&quot;), London, where there is also a plaque.

==Personal life==
Karloff married six times. His wives included stage actress Grace Harding (married from 1910 to 1913), actress Olive de Wilton (from 1916 to 1919), musician Montana Laurena Williams (from 1920 to 1922) and actress Helen Vivian Soule (from 1924 to 1928).

His fifth marriage to Dorothy Stine lasted from 1930 until 1946. This union resulted in Karloff&#x27;s only child, daughter Sara Karloff, being born on November 23, 1938 (Karloff&#x27;s own 51st birthday).

His sixth and final marriage, to Evelyn Hope Helmore, was in April 1946, immediately after his fifth divorce. They were happily married 23 years at the time of his death.

In 1958, Karloff&#x27;s niece Diana Bromley was arrested and charged with murdering her two small children with a razor in Haslemere, England, then attempting to slash her own throat. She was the daughter of Karloff&#x27;s brother Sir John Thomas Pratt.

Beginning in 1940, Karloff dressed as Father Christmas every Christmas to hand out presents to physically disabled children in a Baltimore hospital.

He never legally changed his name to &quot;Boris Karloff&quot;. He signed official documents &quot;William H. Pratt, a.k.a. Boris Karloff&quot;.

He was a charter member of the Screen Actors Guild, and he was especially outspoken due to the long hours he spent in makeup while playing Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster and the Mummy. He was an early member of the Hollywood Cricket Club.

==Legacy==

During the run of &quot;Thriller,&quot; Karloff lent his name and likeness to a comic book for Gold Key Comics based upon the series. After &quot;Thriller&quot; was cancelled, the comic was retitled &quot;Boris Karloff&#x27;s Tales of Mystery&quot;. An illustrated likeness of Karloff continued to introduce each issue of this publication for more than a decade after his death (he was not involved however in writing or drawing the stories); the comic book lasted until the early 1980s (a Gold Key comic book series based upon &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; that ran concurrently with Karloff&#x27;s did the same thing with host Rod Serling&#x27;s likeness after his death). In 2009, Dark Horse Comics began publishing reprints of &quot;Boris Karloff&#x27;s Tales of Mystery&quot; in a hardcover edition.

For his contribution to film and television, Karloff was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1737 Vine Street for motion pictures, and 6664 Hollywood Boulevard for television. He was featured by the U.S. Postal Service as Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster and the Mummy in its series &quot;Classic Monster Movie Stamps&quot; issued in September 1997. In 1998, an English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled in his hometown in London. The British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; in 2016 ranked Karloff&#x27;s portrayal as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster the sixth-greatest horror movie character of all time.

A street called Karloff Way, near Rochester, England, is named in his honour.

<text>Pavel Osipovich Sukhoi (; , &quot;Paviel Vosipavič Suchi&quot;; 22 July 1895 – 15 September 1975) was a Soviet aerospace engineer and aircraft designer known as the founder of the Sukhoi Design Bureau. Sukhoi designed military aircraft with Tupolev and Sukhoi for 50 years, and produced many notable Soviet planes such as the Sukhoi Su-7, Su-17, and Su-24. His planes set two altitude world records (1959, 1962) and two world speed records (1960, 1962). Sukhoi was honored in the Soviet Union as a Hero of Socialist Labor and awarded the Order of Lenin three times.

==Biography==
Pavel Osipovich Sukhoi was born 22 July 1895 in Hlybokaye, Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire, to ethnic Belarusian parents of peasant background. He had five sisters and no brothers. In 1900, Sukhoi&#x27;s family moved to Gomel when his father, Osip Andreevich Sukhoi, got a job as a teacher at a school for the children of railway workers. From 1905 to 1914, Sukhoi attended the gymnasium in Gomel, now the Belarusian State University of Transport. In 1915, Sukhoi was admitted to the Imperial Moscow Technical School in Moscow after passing the entrance exams. However, Sukhoi&#x27;s studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army following the escalation of World War I. 

Sukhoi attended warrant officer training assigned to the artillery of the Russian Western Front. Sukhoi was in the Russian Army when it collapsed after the October Revolution in 1917, returning to Moscow to find his university was closed. Instead, Sukhoi returned to Gomel to live with his parents and was offered a place as a mathematics teacher in the small town of Luninets near Brest-Litovsk. In 1919, Sukhoi fled to Gomel as Polish troops advanced on Luninets during the Polish–Soviet War, and began teaching at the school for the children of railway workers headed by his father. Around this time, Sukhoi contracted typhus and then scarlet fever which significantly affected his ability to speak, and he developed a reputation as a quiet person for the remainder of his life.

In 1920, Sukhoi was finally demobilized from the army because of his health-related problems, and the government of the Russian Soviet Republic issued a resolution to reopen institutions of higher education in Russia. Sukhoi returned to his studies at BMSTU and graduated in 1925 with his thesis titles &quot;Single-engined Pursuit Aircraft of 300 hp&quot; under the direction of aeronautics pioneer Andrei Tupolev. In March 1925, Sukhoi started working as an engineer and designer with the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) and Moscow Factory Number 156 under Tupolev. During the following years, Sukhoi designed and constructed aircraft including the record-setting Tupolev ANT-25 and the TB-1 and TB-3 heavy bombers. In 1932, Sukhoi was appointed head of the engineering and design department of TsAGI, and in 1938 he was promoted to head of the department of design. Sukhoi also developed a multi-purpose light aircraft, the Su-2, which saw service in the early years of the Eastern Front of World War II.

In September 1939, Sukhoi founded an independent engineering and design department named Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB Sukhoi) located in Kharkiv. Sukhoi was not satisfied with the geographical location of the OKB, which was isolated from the scientific centers of Moscow. Sukhoi insisted that the OKB should relocate to an aerodrome in Moscow Oblast, and by the first half of 1940 the relocation was completed. By the winter of 1942, Sukhoi encountered another problem: since he had no production line of his own, he had nothing to do. Sukhoi had developed a new ground-attack aircraft, the Su-6, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin decided that this plane should not be put into production, favouring production of the Ilyushin Il-2. 

In the postwar years, Sukhoi was among the first Soviet aircraft designers who led the work on jet aircraft, creating several experimental jet fighters. From 1949, Sukhoi fell out of Stalin&#x27;s favour and was forced to return to work under Tupolev, this time as Deputy Chief Designer. In 1953, the year of Stalin&#x27;s death, Sukhoi was permitted to re-establish his own Sukhoi Design Bureau. Sukhoi produced several major serial combat aircraft during the Cold War, including the supersonic Su-7, which became the main Soviet fighter-bomber of the 1960s, and interceptors Su-9 and Su-15, which formed the backbone of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Sukhoi also pioneered variable-sweep wing aircraft, such as the Su-17 and Su-24. Sukhoi also started a number of projects that were not developed, including the ambitious Mach-3-capable Sukhoi T-3 attack aircraft. From 1958 to 1974, Sukhoi served as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Sukhoi died on 15 September 1975 at the Barvikha sanatorium in Moscow, and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. The last fighter Sukhoi designed was the T-10 (Su-27) but he did not live to see it fly.

<text>Thomas Edmund Burke (January 15, 1875 – February 14, 1929) was an American sprinter. He was the first Olympic champion in the 100 and 400 meter sprint races.

==Biography==
Burke was born in Massachusetts in 1875. He competed for the Suffolk Athletic Club in South Boston and the Boston Athletic Association (BAA).

Burke, a student at Boston University School of Law, was a reputed runner in the 400 meters and 440 yards, having won the AAU title (440 yards) in 1895. He had no such reputation for the first event he entered in the inaugural modern Olympic Games in Athens, 1896. With many top sprinters absent, Burke surprisingly won the 100 meters. He was also noted for his &quot;crouch start&quot;, which was uncommon at that time but in standard use now. His time in the final was 12.0 seconds. In the preliminary heat, he had an even better time – 11.8 seconds.

At the same Olympics, Burke also won the 400 meters, his top event. His times for that event were 58.4 seconds in the preliminary heats and 54.2 seconds in the final, in both of which Burke finished first.

Later in his career, Burke specialized in the longer distances, winning IC4A titles in the 440 and 880 yards events. In 1897, he was one of the initiators of the annually held Boston Marathon, inspired by the success of the marathon event at the 1896 Olympics.

Burke later became a lawyer, but was also an athletics coach and a part-time journalist, writing for &quot;The Boston Journal&quot; and the &quot;Boston Post&quot;.

In World War I he was commissioned a first lieutenant and at age 43 was the oldest man in the US military to earn his aviator&#x27;s wings. Burke died in 1929, aged 54.

<doc id="67291" wikidata="Q57678" url="?curid=67291" title="Armin Hary">
<text>Armin Hary (; (born 22 March 1937) is a retired German sprinter who won the 1960 Olympic 100 meters dash. He was the first non-American to win the event since Percy Williams of Canada took the gold medal in 1928, the only German to ever win the event in the history of the Olympics, the first man to run 100 meters in 10.0 seconds and the last White man to establish a world record in 100 meters dash.

&quot;The most amazing sprinter. I have ever seen&quot;. [[Jesse Owens]].

==Early life==
After playing soccer all throughout his childhood Hary switched to sprinting at age 14. Only a few years later, in 1958, he won his first international title when he came first in the 100 m and the 4 × 100 m at the European Championships.

Also in 1958, Hary appeared to have run a new world record with a time of 10.0 seconds, but the track&#x27;s slope of was found to exceed the maximum allowed .

== World record ==
On June 21, 1960 at Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich Hary ran into the history books by running the 100m in 10.0 seconds, a new word record. But the judges were so shocked, they said it must have been a false start. Hary was allowed a repeat run and ran another 10.0 seconds 35 minutes later.

== Olympic Games 1960 in Rome ==
That same year, at the Olympics, he achieved his greatest moment of fame. After a nerve-wracking number of near-starts the six men finally came off the mark together, but within two strides Hary had accelerated to a half-meter lead. By the 50-meter mark Hary opened up a two-meter gap, towards the finish Duke’s Dave Sime started closing in, but Hary sprinted to the gold medal in the 100 m dash with a time of 10.2 seconds completing the finest exhibition of sprinting in Olympic history.

Armin Hary also won a 2nd Gold medal in the 4x100m relay when USA was disqualified for an illegal baton pass. Germany&#x27;s time, 39.5 seconds, equaled their own world record.

== Fastest starter ==
Due to his reaction time and quick acceleration out of the blocks Hary was often accused of jumping or anticipating the gun. Considered the fastest starter in the world, Hary was periodically tested for his quick reaction time, it was discovered that he had extraordinary reflexes. With the help of high speed photography Armin Hary’s quick start sequence has been well documented and studied. Long believed to be physiologically impossible Hary’s reaction time was recorded at 0.04 seconds compared to the average human’s of 0.132 seconds.

The new IAAF false start rule of 0.100 is based on the fact that no human besides Hary has ever been able to react faster to the sound of the gun.

His iconic starts have earned him the nickname “Thief of Starts” from the term “Thief of Hearts”.

== Sponsors ==
He was also the first track star to be affected by the rivalry between Adidas and Puma; each of the two then-fledgling companies wanted the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest man&quot; to wear its shoes at the 1960 Olympics, putting him right in the middle of the Dassler brother feud. During the companies expensive bidding war for the most famous athlete in the world, Hary realised that neither company had an exclusivity clause in their contract, so without telling the other, he signed with both. Wearing Puma spikes on the track in his 100 meter final and Adidas shoes on the victory stand when receiving his gold medal.

== Personal life ==
In 1966 he married Christina Diana H. Bagusat heiress of the Bagusat fortune, with whom he has two children, his son Armin jr. and his daughter Diana. Hary also has a daughter with acclaimed actress Helga Charlotte Tolle.

== End of career ==
In the early 1960s Hary was forced to retire from sprinting after suffering serious injuries in a car accident.

==Awards and honours ==

* 1960 received a unique medal promised to the first person to run 100m in 10sec by Hirohito the emperor of Japan 
* 2000 Runner of the Century 
* 2000 Athlete of the Century

<text>Valeriy Pylypovych Borzov (; ; born 20 October 1949) is a Soviet-Ukrainian former sprinter and politician. He is a two-time Olympian, a former president of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine, and Minister for Youth and Sports of Ukraine.

In 1972 he won the 100 and 200 metres sprint events at the Olympic Games in Munich.

==Career==
Valeriy Borzov was born in Sambir, Drohobych Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union, Borzov started his track and field career in 1968. He became a household name in the Track and Field circles after having won the sprint-double at the 1971 European Championships in Helsinki. He had already won the 100 m championship in 1969, when he equalled Armin Hary&#x27;s nine-year-old European record of 10.0 seconds.

At the 1972 Munich Olympics, two American favourites and world record holders, Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson, missed the 100 m quarterfinals due to a misunderstanding about the starting time of the heats. Coincidentally Borzov almost missed his own quarter-final as well, having fallen asleep in the stadium, his coach waking him up just as the race was about to start. Borzov won the 100 m sprint with relative ease in a time of 10.14 seconds. Borzov then won the 200 m in great style. The picture, featuring Borzov winning the 200 m heats at the 1972 Summer Olympics was selected for the Voyager Golden Record and later launched into space aboard two Voyager spacecraft in 1977. He also won silver as part of the Soviet 4 × 100 relay team, leaving Munich with three medals and the title of the fastest human in the world.

Between the 1972 and the 1976 Olympics, Borzov spent more time on his studies and soccer. Still, this did not stop him from winning his third successive 100 m title at the European Championships in 1974. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, he finished third in the 100 m race behind Caribbean sprinters Hasley Crawford and Donald Quarrie, in a time of 10.14, his fourth Olympic medal. In the 4 × 100 m relay, his team won another bronze.

A persisting injury forced Borzov to abandon his hopes to participate in his third Olympic Games. He ended his career in 1979. He married Ludmilla Tourischeva, a four-time Olympic champion in gymnastics, in 1977.

==Political career==
Borzov&#x27;s political career started during the 1970s as a member of the Komsomol of Ukraine. In 1980–1986 he was one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Komsomol. From 1991 to 1998, Borzov served as the president of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee. He has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1994. He has also held a Youth and Sports cabinet minister position with the Government of Ukraine from 1990 till 1997. From 1998 until 2006, he was a member of the Ukrainian parliament.

Soon after being elected to the party list for People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (commonly abbreviated as Rukh) in 1998 he changed from the Rukh faction to the faction &quot;Reforms Center&quot; in 1998–1999. Yet after dissolution of the parliamentary faction of Hromada, in 1999 Borzov became one of the first who joined the newly created parliamentary faction Batkivshchyna in Verkhovna Rada, with which he stayed almost to the end of the third parliamentary convocation. In 2001, Borzov joined the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united). He stayed with the same party for the next elections in 2002, and eventually became a member in 2003.

<text>Allan Wipper Wells (born 3 May 1952) is a British former track and field sprinter who became the 100 metres Olympic champion at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. In 1981, he was both the IAAF Golden Sprints and IAAF World Cup gold medallist. He is also a three-time European Cup gold medallist.

He was a multiple medallist for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games, winning two golds at the 1978 Commonwealth Games and completing a 100 metres/200 metres sprint double at the 1982 Commonwealth Games. Wells also recorded the fastest British 100/200 times in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 100 m in 1984.

==Biography==

===Early years and long jump===
Born in Edinburgh, Wells was educated at Fernieside Primary School and then Liberton High School. He left school at age 15 to begin an engineering apprenticeship. He was initially a triple jumper and long jumper, and was the Scottish indoor long jump champion in 1974.

===Commonwealth and European sprint titles===
He began concentrating on sprint events in 1976. In 1977 he won the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) Indoor 60 metres title, and won his first of seven outdoor Scottish sprint titles.

In the 1978 season his times and victories continued to improve. He set a new British record at Gateshead 10.29, beating Don Quarrie and James Sanford, and also won the UK 100/200 Championships. At the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, he won the gold medal in the 200 m and silver in the 100 m. He also won the 4 × 100 m running the second leg with Drew McMaster, David Jenkins and Cameron Sharp running the other three legs.

This success continued in 1979, when he won the European Cup 200 metres in Turin, Italy, beating the new world record holder Pietro Mennea on his home ground; he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres.

===1980 – Olympic success and the showdown in Koblenz===

At the start of the 1980 season, Wells won the AAA&#x27;s 100 metres, then went to the Côte d&#x27;Azur to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. He never used starting blocks, until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics. Prior to the Olympics he was put under pressure by Margaret Thatcher in the boycott of the games led by the Americans. He responded by declining all media requests. His Olympic participation was threatened by chronic back pain that struck him shortly before the games began. Each day he underwent four exhausting treatment sessions that left him too tired to train. Instead when not undergoing treatment he spent his time relaxing.

In Moscow, Wells qualified for the final, with a new British record 10.11 s, where he faced pre-race favourite Silvio Leonard of Cuba. Wells finished with an extreme lean which allowed his head and shoulder to cross the finish line before Leonard&#x27;s chest in a photo finish; both men were given a final time of 10.25 s. Wells became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion at that time at the age of 28 years 83 days.

The 200 m final was another close affair. Wells won the silver medal behind Pietro Mennea, who beat him by 0.02 s; again he set a British record of 20.21 s. He went on to break a third British record, 38.62 s, with the sprint relay team that finished fourth in the final.

In a later interview Wells said the two issues he faced prior to the games were inadvertently key factors in his success. He said in an interview to &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;When we got to Moscow, [my wife and coach] Margot and I decided that I&#x27;d do six starts and see how it went. The fourth and fifth were full-out as if I was competing and I asked Margot what she thought: she said they were the best she&#x27;d ever seen me do. The rest had done me a lot of good, I was really fresh and committed, and those starts gave me the psychological edge over everyone else, which was key because the Olympics is all about your mental aptitude. You&#x27;re at your fastest when you&#x27;re relaxed and flowing (Wells&#x27; 10.11secs to qualify for the 100m final remains the Scottish record) rather than having to be aggressive.&quot;

Following the Moscow Olympics, there was some suggestion that Wells&#x27;s gold medal had been devalued by the boycott of the games. Wells accepted an invitation to take on the best USA sprinters of the day, among others, the ASV Weltklasse track meeting in Cologne in West Germany. Less than two weeks after the Moscow gold, he won the final in Cologne in a time of 10.19s, beating Americans Stanley Floyd (10.21), Mel Lattany (10.25), Carl Lewis (10.30) and Harvey Glance (10.31). Lattany went straight over to Wells after crossing the line to say, &quot;For what it&#x27;s worth, Allan, You&#x27;re the Olympic champion and you would have been Olympic champion no matter who you ran against in Moscow.&quot;

At the end of 1980, Wells was awarded Scottish Sports Personality of the Year.

===1981 World Cup win===

In 1981, after a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Wells won the European Cup 100 metres, beating East German Frank Emmelmann. Wells also finished 2nd in the 200 m.

He then won the &quot;IAAF Golden sprints&quot; in Berlin, which was the most prominent sprint meeting in the world that year. Although finishing second to the Frenchman Hermann Panzo by 0.01 secs in the 100, Wells won the 200 beating the top four American sprinters Mel Lattany, Jeff Phillips, Stanley Floyd, Steve Williams as well as Canada&#x27;s Ben Johnson in the 100/200, 10.15/20.15 (200 wind assist) for Wells to win the event in an aggregate 30.30.

Wells won the 100 metres at the IAAF World cup in Rome, beating Carl Lewis; Wells then finished 2nd in the world cup 200 in 20.53. Afterwards, he beat Mel Lattany and Stanley Floyd again, when he won a 200 in 20.26 in the Memorial Van Damme meeting in Brussels, Belgium.

===Later sprinting career===

In 1982, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Wells won two more Commonwealth Games titles in the 100 m, a wind assisted 10.02. and then the 200 m, and a bronze medal in the relay. He shared the 200 m title with Mike McFarlane of England in 20.43 in a rare dead heat.

In 1983, he won his third European Cup title by winning the 200 metres in 20.72, beating his old adversary Pietro Mennea in London, and again took 2nd in the 100 m.

He then finished 4th in both the 100/200 sprint finals at the IAAF World Championships in Helsinki.

At age 32, he reached the 100 m semi-finals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and was a member of the relay team that finished 7th in the final.

Wells missed most of 1985 with injury. He was not selected for the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in 1986, as he had failed to compete at the Scottish trials. However, on 5 August at Gateshead, he beat both Ben Johnson and Atlee Mahorn, the respective Commonwealth 100 m and 200 m champions.

Wells gained additional attention at Gateshead for being the first to be seen sporting the now common Lycra running shorts. The sight of these led to him being dubbed Wilson of the Wizard (a comic book character).

Wells was consequently selected for Stuttgart in the European championships, coming fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m finals. He also had a victory against Linford Christie at Crystal Palace at the end of 1986 in 100m at 10.31. One of his last victories was winning the Inverness Highland Games 100/200 double in 1987. In 1987 his best time was 10.28 and he qualified for the Rome World Championships but he
was injured.

Although his later career was plagued by repeated back injuries, he still won a career total of 18 medals at major championships before retiring in his mid-30s. He and Don Quarrie and Pietro Mennea set a trend for sprinters in their mid thirties to compete longer in the late Eighties.

===After competitive retirement===

Since 1982 Wells has lived in Surrey, with his wife Margot. After retirement, he was a coach for the British bobsleigh team. Margot was also a Scottish 100/100 hurdles champion. They are now based in Guildford, Surrey where she is a fitness consultant, and Allan is a retired systems engineer. Allan coached the Bank of Scotland specialist sprint squad alongside another former Scottish sprinter, Ian Mackie.

Wells&#x27;s personal best for the 100 metres is 10.11, and for the 200 metres is 20.21, run at the Moscow 1980 games, and both are still Scottish records.

He also ran a wind-assisted (+5.9 m/s) 10.02 in Brisbane, 1982 (still the track record as of August 2024 which he shares with Rohan Browning of Sydney, Australia from April 2023), and (+3.7 m/s) 20.11 in Edinburgh, 1980.

In June 2015, a BBC documentary (Panorama: &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;) uncovered allegations by Wells&#x27; former teammate of historical doping by the 1980 Olympic 100m champion, beginning in 1977. Wells denied the allegations.

As of August 2024, Wells holds two track records for 200 metres, both of which had wind-assistance. They are Turin (20.29, 1979, +2.2 m/s) and Venice (20.26, 1981, +8.5 m/s).

==Honours and awards==
Wells was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1982 Birthday Honours for services to athletics. He was also inducted alongside Eric Liddell and Wyndham Halswelle (two other former Scottish Athletic Olympic Champions) into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

Wells was the first baton holder for the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, carrying the baton from Buckingham Palace in London in October 2013.

In July 2014, Wells received, along with his wife Margot, an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Edinburgh Napier University.

<doc id="67301" wikidata="Q7217335" url="?curid=67301" title="Politics of Belgium">
<text>The politics of Belgium take place in the framework of a federal, representative democratic, constitutional monarchy. The King of the Belgians is the head of state, and the prime minister of Belgium is the head of government, in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. The federation is made up of (language-based) communities and (territorial) regions. Philippe is the seventh and current King of the Belgians, having ascended the throne on 21 July 2013.

Since around 1970, the significant Belgian national political parties have split into distinct representations for each communities&#x27; interests, besides defense of their ideologies. These parties belong to three main political families, though all close to the centre: the right-wing Liberals, the social conservative Christian Democrats and the Socialists forming the left-wing. Other important newer parties are the Green parties and, nowadays mainly in Flanders, the nationalist and far-right parties. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as trade unions and employers&#x27; organizations such as the Federation of Belgian Enterprises. Majority rule is often superseded by a &quot;de facto&quot; confederal decision-making process where the minority (the French-speakers) enjoy important protections through specialty majorities (2/3 overall and majority in each of the 2 main communities). According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Belgium was 2023 the 8th most electoral democratic country in the world.

==Constitution==
The Constitution of Belgium, the primary source of law and the basis of the political system of the Country, was established on February 7, 1831. It has been changed several times, but the most relevant reforms were performed in 1970 and in 1993.

In 1970, in response to a growing civil conflict between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities in Brussels, the Government declared that &quot;the unitary state, its structure and functioning as laid down by law, had become obsolete&quot;. The new constitution recognised the existence of strong communitarian and regional differences within Belgium, but sought to reconcile these differences through a diffusion of power to the communities and the regions.

In 1993, the parliament approved a constitutional package transforming Belgium into a full-fledged federal state.

==Government==

===Executive===

| King
| Philippe
| 21 July 2013
| Prime Minister
| Bart De Wever
| N-VA
| 3 February 2025

====Head of state====
The King of the Belgians is the constitutional head of the Belgian state and holds office for life. The duties of the king are laid out by the Belgian Constitution and other laws enforced under it.

As titular head of state, the king plays a ceremonial and symbolic role in the nation. His main political function is to designate a political leader to form a new cabinet after an election or the resignation of a cabinet. In conditions where there is a &quot;constructive vote of no-confidence,&quot; the government has to resign and the lower house of Parliament proposes a new prime minister to the king. The king is also seen as playing a symbolic unifying role, representing a common national Belgian identity.

Philippe succeeded his father Albert II on 21 July 2013 upon his abdication.

====Federal government====
The executive power is held by the prime minister and the ministers, who together form the Council of Ministers, and by the secretaries of state, each of whom is deputy to a minister and is part of the federal Government, but does not sit in the Council of Ministers.

Members of the Federal Government, who are formally appointed by the King, are in fact drawn from the political parties which form the government coalition.

The Federal Government must enjoy the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives.

The total number of ministers, excluding the prime minister, cannot exceed 15. Also, the number of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers must be equal, with the possible exception of the prime minister.

Ministers head executive departments of the government. The prime minister and his ministers administer the government and the various public services and the ministers must defend their policies and performance in person before the Chamber.

====Regional and community governments====

The regional and community parliaments and governments have jurisdiction over transportation, public works, water policy, cultural matters, education, public health, environment, housing, zoning, and economic and industrial policy. They rely on a system of revenue-sharing for funds. They have the authority to levy a very few taxes (mostly surcharges) and to contract loans. Moreover, they have obtained exclusive treaty-making power for those issues coming under their respective jurisdictions. Of total public spending (interest payments not considered), more than 30% is authorized by the regions and communities, although their financing comes for over 80% from national Belgian budgets; at the same time, the national government controls 100% of social security, and strictly limits the taxation policy by the federalized entities. As a result, Belgian institutions still control over 90% of the effective, global taxation levels on individuals and companies.

Though since 1993 article 35 of the Constitution requires the creation of a list specifying federal as opposed to regional and communities&#x27; competences, such list was never created. Therefore, the federal government continues to exercise all competences not explicitly dedicated to the lesser levels.

The Flemish parties generally favour much larger community (and regional) autonomy, including financial and tax autonomy, while the francophone parties generally oppose it. The French-speaking parties tend to favour more state control.

As of October 2019, the regional executives are the following:
* Minister-President of Flemish Government (Community+Region): Jan Jambon (N-VA)
* Minister-President of French Community Government: Pierre-Yves Jeholet (MR)
* Minister-President of Wallonia: Elio Di Rupo (PS)
* Minister-President of Brussels-Capital Regional Government: Rudi Vervoort (PS)
* Minister-President of German Community Government: Oliver Paasch (ProDG)

====Provincial and local government====
The two biggest regions, Flanders and Wallonia, are further subdivided into five provinces each. The Brussels-Capital Region is directly divided into 19 municipalities. In total, Belgium counts 581 municipalities. Provincial and local government is an exclusive competency of the regions. Therefore, one should see the relevant articles for more detailed information on provincial and local government.

In the Brussels region, there is another form of intermediate government, constituted by institutions from each of the two competent communities. Those institutions (COCOF for the French-speakers and VGC for the Flemings) have similar competencies, although only COCOF has legislative powers, given by the French Community. For Brussels community matters common to both communities there is a Common Community Commission.

===Legislative===

Legislative powers in Belgium are divided between the national, the regional and the community levels.

The Belgian Federal Parliament consists of the Senate (Dutch: Senaat, French: Sénat) and the Chamber of Representatives (Dutch: Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers, French: Chambre des Représentants). The Chamber has 150 members; the Senate has 60. All 150 representatives are elected directly via a system of proportional representation. The Senate consists of 50 senators elected by the parliaments of the communities and regions, and 10 senators co-opted by the others.

Since the Constitutional reforms of 1993 and 2013, the two Houses of Parliament do not sit on a level of parity: other than in cases regarding the constitutional, institutional or federal structure or international relation, the consent of the Senate either is not required (so-called &quot;unicameral laws&quot;, voted only by the House, such as the budget) or can be dispensed of by the House. The Chamber of Representatives is also the only house that votes the confidence to the Government.

Each of the five components of the federal system (Flemish Community, French Community, German-speaking Community, Walloon Region and Brussels-Capital Region) have their own, directly elected unicameral council or parliament. They vote decrees (or ordinances in Brussels), that have the same value and are on the same juridical level as the federal laws.

===Judiciary===

The judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the Napoleonic code. It has a judicial review of legislative acts. It accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction, with reservations. The Court of Appeals is one level below the Court of Cassation, an institution based on the French Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation (Dutch: &quot;Hof van Cassatie&quot;, French: &quot;Cour de Cassation&quot;) is the most important court in Belgium. Judges are appointed for life by the Belgian monarch.

==Elections and parties==
===Electoral system===
The election for the Belgian Chamber of Representatives is based on a system of open list proportional representation. Several months before an election, each party forms a list of candidates for each district. Parties are allowed to place as many candidates on their lists as there are seats available. The formation of the list is an internal process that varies with each party. The place on the list is considered to play a role in the election of a candidate, by giving stronger visibility to those high on the list; this phenomenon, however, seems to have lost importance since the last electoral reform.

Belgian voters are given five options. They may:
* Vote for a list as a whole, thereby showing approval of the order established by the party;
* Vote for one or more individual candidates, regardless of his/her ranking on the list (a &quot;preference vote&quot;);
* Vote for one or more of the &quot;alternates&quot; (substitutes);
* Vote for one or more candidates, and one or more alternates;
* Vote invalid or blank so no one receives the vote.

While there are some options to vote on more than one person, voters cannot vote for candidates of more than one candidate list (party). Doing so makes the vote invalid.

Political campaigns in Belgium are relatively short, lasting only about one month. They are subjected to several limitations:
* There are restrictions on the use of billboards.
* For all of their activities, campaigns included, the political parties have to rely on government subsidies and dues paid by their members.

Belgium is one of the few countries that has compulsory voting, thus having one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world.

Elections for the Chamber of Representatives (Federal Parliament) are normally held every five years and coincide with those for the European Parliament. Before 2014, they were held every four years and were held separately.
The community and regional parliaments are elected every five years, and their elections coincide with those for the European Parliament as well.
Elections for the members of Belgium&#x27;s municipal and provincial councils are held every six years.

The latest municipal and provincial elections were held in 2018 and the latest federal and regional elections were held in 2019.

===Political parties===
In Belgium, aside from a few minor German-speaking parties, most political parties are either Dutch-speaking (Flemish) or French-speaking; the only major bilingual party operating across all of Belgium is the Workers Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB), a far-left party which first won seats in the Chamber in 2014 and as of 2019 has three seats in Dutch-speaking Flanders and nine seats in Brussels and Wallonia. Parties run their own think tanks ( / ), research outfits that draft policy. When their party is in power, they serve as back offices for ministers&#x27; cabinets.

Another important characteristic of Belgian national politics is the highly federal nature of decision making. Important decisions require both a national majority (2/3 for constitutional changes), as well as majorities in the two main language groups. On top of that, both these communities can activate &#x27;alarm bell&#x27;-procedures, delaying changes. In addition, there are no national parties to speak of. As a result of this, Belgian decision making can be slow and expensive. On top, it tends to significantly favour the more conservative parties. Given the historically very high public expenditure, and the very strict central control over taxation, even for revenues going to regions and communities, the tendency of Belgian governments to lower taxation and especially labour charges has been limited, at least if compared to radical-liberal approaches followed by certain other countries.

====History of the political landscape====
From the creation of the Belgian state in 1830 and throughout most of the 19th century, two political parties dominated Belgian politics: the Catholic Party (Church-oriented and conservative) and the Liberal Party (anti-clerical and progressive). In the late 19th century, the Socialist Party arose to represent the emerging industrial working class. These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character.

In the years before and after the Second World War, the linguistic problem became a stronger divisive issue in Belgian politics, with the emergence in the 1950s and 1960s of linguistic parties (Volksunie, FDF and Rassemblement Wallon). In the 1960s and 1970s, each of the main political parties of Belgium split into Flemish and French-speaking parties.

After May 68, the country saw a growing environmental and left wing movement, that led to the foundation of the ecological parties Groen! and Ecolo.

Especially in Flanders, the 1980s saw the growth of the far right, represented by the Vlaams Belang, which became one of the larger parties of the country in the 1990s.

During the years surrounding the new millennium, an attempt at restructuring the political landscape took place, mainly taking the form of political cartels.

==Trade unions==
Belgium is a highly unionised country, and organised labour is a powerful influence in politics. About 53% of all private sector and public service employees are labour union members. Not simply a &quot;bread and butter&quot; movement in the American sense, Belgian labour unions take positions on education, public finance, defence spending, environmental protection, women&#x27;s rights, abortion, and other issues. They also provide a range of services, including the administration of unemployment benefits.

Belgium&#x27;s three principal trade union organizations are the Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CSC/ACV) (1,705,000 members), the General Federation of Belgian Labour (FGTB/ABVV) (1,198,000 members) and the General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium (CGSLB/ACLVB) which has 230,000 members.

Until the fifties, the FGTB/ABVV was the largest confederation, since then, however, the CSC/ACV has become the leading trade union force. In the most recent works council elections held in 2004 the CSC/ACV garnered close to 53% of the vote, the Socialist confederation obtained 36%, and the Liberal confederation 10%.

The Confederation of Catholic labour Unions (CSC/ACV). Organised in 1912, the CSC/ACV rejects the Marxist concept of &quot;class struggle&quot; and seeks to achieve a just social order based on Christian principles. The CSC/ACV is not formally linked to its party political counterparts, the Christian Democratic parties (CD&amp;V and CDH), but exercises great influence in their councils.

The CSC/ACV is the leading union in all Flemish provinces, and in Wallonia&#x27;s Luxembourg province. It has almost equal strength with the socialist confederation in the Brussels area. Its president is currently .

The Belgian Socialist Confederation of labour (FGTB/ABVV). The FGTB/ABVV derives from the Socialist Trade Union Movement, established in the late 19th century in Walloon industrial areas, Brussels, and urban areas of Flanders. Today the FGTB/ABVV is the leading union in the provinces of Hainaut, Namur, and Liège and matches the CSC/ACV in Brussels. The FGTB/ABVV is led by President Michel Nollet.

==Linguistic division==
Belgium is a country in which language is a major political issue. In the 19th and early 20th century, Flemings did not enjoy the same rights as French-speakers, both de facto and de jure. When the country was founded in 1830 under a census voting system, only around 1% of the adult population could vote: nobility, haute-bourgeoisie and higher clerics, all of them French-speaking. A Flemish movement fought peacefully to gain equal rights, obtaining most of these. Minor issues exist also between German- and French-speakers.

In the 3rd century AD, Germanic Franks migrated into what is now Belgium. The less populated northern areas became Germanic, while in the southern part, where the Roman presence had been much stronger, Latin persisted despite the migrations of the Franks. This linguistic frontier has more or less endured.

The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and the 19th century further accentuated the north–south division. Francophone Wallonia became an early industrial boom area, affluent and politically dominant. Dutch-speaking Flanders remained agricultural and was economically and politically outdistanced by Wallonia and the capital. The elite during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century spoke French, even in the Dutch-speaking area. In the 20th century, and particularly after the Second World War, Flanders saw an economic flowering while Wallonia became economically stagnant. As Flemings became more educated and more well off, and sought a fair and equal share of political power, tensions between the two communities rose.

Linguistic demonstrations in the early 1960s led in 1962 to the establishment of a formal linguistic border and elaborate rules were made to protect minorities in linguistically mixed border areas. In 1970, the Constitution was amended. Flemish and francophone cultural councils were established with authority in matters relating to language and culture for the two language groups.

The 1970 constitutional revision did not finally settle the problem, however. A controversial amendment declared that Belgium consists of three cultural communities (the Flemish Community, the French(-speaking) Community and the German-speaking Community) and three economic regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels) each to be granted a significant measure of political autonomy. It was not until 1980, however, that an agreement could be reached on how to implement this new constitutional provision.

In August 1980, the Belgian Parliament passed a devolution bill and amended the Constitution, establishing:
* A Flemish community legislative assembly (council) and Flemish government;
* A Francophone community legislative council and government competent for cultural, language, and educational matters; and
* Walloon and Flemish regional legislative assemblies and governments competent for regional economic matters.

Immediately, the Flemings had their regional legislative council and government transfer its competencies to the community legislative council and government. That became competent for both cultural, language, and educational affairs, and for regional economic matters.

Since 1984 the German language community of Belgium (in the eastern part of Liège Province) has had its own legislative assembly and executive, competent for cultural, language, and educational affairs.

In 1988–89 the Constitution was again amended to give additional responsibilities to the regions and communities. The most sweeping change was to devolve nearly all responsibilities for educational matters to the communities. Moreover, the regions and communities were provided additional revenue, and Brussels Region was given its own legislative assembly and executive.

Another important constitutional reform took place in the summer of 1993. It formally changed Belgium from a unitary to a federal state. It also (modestly) reformed the bicameral parliamentary system and provided for the direct election of the members of the community and regional legislative councils. The bilingual Brabant province was split into separate Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant provinces, whereas in the Brussels-Capital Region most of the elsewhere provincial powers are exercised by the region and the responsibilities of an elsewhere provincial governor towards the federal level, by the Governor of Brussels-Capital. However, the electoral and judicial districts of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde were not split.

Despite the numerous constitution revisions, the matter is not completely settled. There is still a lot of political tension between French-speakers and Dutch-speakers, and, to a lesser degree, between French-speakers and the politically far weaker German-speakers.

===Shift from linguistic to cultural and political animosity===
At the end of the 20th century, it became clear that the main opposition between Flemings and Walloons was not primarily linguistic anymore, but had shifted to major political and demographic differences. Flemish parties appear much more &#x27;Anglo-Saxon&#x27; in policy choices, moving away from &#x27;big state&#x27; philosophies. French-speaking parties, including their &#x27;right-wing&#x27; parties, tend to favor big government and state support for the poor.

This became very obvious after the 2007 elections: in Flanders, the classical left-wing parties only captured 1/4 of the votes. On the French-speaking side, the left still carried 1/2 of the votes. One of the key differences centers on the policy towards everyone receiving allocations. Flemings strongly favor a policy focused at helping them regain their autonomy.

<text>Belgium is a federal state located in Western Europe and is divided into three regions: the Flemish Region (Flanders), the Walloon Region (Wallonia), and the Brussels Capital Region (Brussels).

Belgium borders the North Sea and shares borders with the countries of France (620 km), the Netherlands (450 km), Germany (162/167 km) and Luxembourg (148 km). 

==General information==

Total renewable water resources: 18.3 cu km (2011)

Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):
&quot;total:&quot; 6.22 cu km/yr (12%/88%/1%)
&quot;per capita:&quot; 589.8 cu m/yr (2007)

Natural hazards:
flooding is a threat in areas of reclaimed coastal land, protected from the sea by concrete dikes

Geography – note:
crossroads of Western Europe; majority of West European capitals within 1,000  km of Brussels which is the seat of both the EU and NATO

Longest Distances: 280 km SE-NW/ 222 km NE-SW

==Area==
Belgium has an area of 30,689 km² (11,849 sq mi), with or 55.1% for the Walloon Region, or 44.4% for the Flemish Region, and or 0.5% for the Brussels Capital Region.

Its land area is 30,494 km² (11,774 sq mi) or 99.36%, and its water area is 195 km² (75 sq mi) or 0.64%. Belgium has also 3,454 km² (1,334 sq mi) of sea territories in the North Sea; including this, its total territory is 34,143 km² (13,183 sq mi).

By provinces, the area (of 30,689 km²) is distributed as such:
* Luxembourg: 
* Liège: 
* Hainaut: 
* Namur: 
* West Flanders: 
* East Flanders: 
* Antwerp: 
* Limburg: 
* Flemish Brabant: 
* Walloon Brabant: 

For the purpose of total area, the Brussels-Capital Region should also be included, though no longer a province since the Brabant was split. 

On 29 May 2000, 2,000 square meters were granted by the Netherlands to Belgium (a piece of land in Zelzate along the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal).

Compared to other countries, Belgium is 44% larger than Wales in the United Kingdom and about the size of Maryland in the United States. Belgium is actually used as an unusual unit of measurement in comparing country sizes.

In November 2016, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to cede small, uninhabited parcels of land to reflect a change in course of the river Meuse (or Maas, in Dutch). The land swap is to take effect as of 2018.

==Physical geography==


Belgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west, the central plateau, and the Ardennes uplands in the south-east. The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by dikes or, further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. The second geographical region, the central plateau, lies further inland. This is a smooth, slowly rising area that has many fertile valleys and is irrigated by many waterways. Here one can also find rougher land, including caves and small gorges. The third geographical region, called the Ardennes, is more rugged than the first two. It is a thickly forested plateau, very rocky and not very good for farming, which extends into northern France and in Germany where it is named Eifel. This is where much of Belgium&#x27;s wildlife can be found. Belgium&#x27;s highest point, the Signal de Botrange is located in this region at only . Belgium has relatively few natural lakes and none of any great size.

Notable natural regions include the Ardennes, Campine and High Fens.

===Rivers and lakes===
All of Belgium is drained into the North Sea, except the municipality of Momignies (Macquenoise), which is drained by the river Oise into the English Channel. Three major rivers flow into the sea: the Scheldt (200 km in Belgium, 350 km in total), the Meuse (183 km in Belgium, 925 km in total) and the Yser (50 km in Belgium, 78 km in total). Other rivers are the Rupel, Senne, Sambre, Lesse, Ourthe, Lys and Dijle. The main lakes include the Lake Genval, Lake Bütgenbach, Lake Eau d&#x27;Heure, Lake Gileppe, Lake Eupen and Lake Robertville.

===Artificial waterways===
Belgium has also many artificial waterways or canals, among others the Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal, the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, the Canal du Centre and the Albert Canal in Antwerp.

===Climate===
The Belgian climate, like most of northwest Europe, is maritime temperate, with significant precipitation in all seasons (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;; the average temperature is in January, and in July; the average precipitation is in January, and in July). Belgium usually has cool winters but temperatures as low as −16 °C (3 °F) have been registered and summers are comfortably warm but temperatures can occasionally rise as high as 30 °C (86 °F).

===Mountain and hills===
Belgium&#x27;s highest point is the Signal de Botrange at 694 metres above the sea level. Other hills in Belgium include the Kemmelberg (159 m high) and the Koppenberg (77 m high) both known as part of the route of the cycle races Gent–Wevelgem and the Tour of Flanders respectively.

===Extreme points===
This is a list of the extreme points of Belgium, the points that are farther north, south, east, west, high or low than any other location.
* Northernmost point — Dreef, municipality of Hoogstraten, Antwerp Province
* Southernmost point — Torgny, municipality of Rouvroy, Luxembourg
* Westernmost point — De Panne, West Flanders (also the northernmost point in France)
* Easternmost point — Krewinkel, municipality of Büllingen, Liège Province
* Highest point — Signal de Botrange (694 m)
* Lowest point — De Moeren (−3 m)

The Belgian National Geographic Institute calculated that the central point of Belgium lies at coordinates , in Nil-Saint-Vincent-Saint-Martin in the municipality of Walhain.

==Human geography==

===Demographics===
===Political geography===
==Natural resources==
Natural resources in Belgium include construction materials, silica sand and carbonates. Belgium used to have coal mines. As of 2012, the land use was as follows:
* Arable land: 26.49%
* Permanent crops: 0.79%
* Other: 72.72%

As of 2007, the estimated area of irrigated land was of 233.5 km2.

==Environment==
Because of its high population density and location in the centre of Western Europe, Belgium faces serious environmental problems. A 2003 report suggested that the water in Belgium&#x27;s rivers was of the lowest quality in Europe, and bottom of the 122 countries studied. The environment is exposed to intense pressures from human activities: urbanisation, dense transportation network, industry, extensive animal breeding, and crop cultivation; air and water pollution also have repercussions for neighbouring countries; uncertainties regarding federal and regional responsibilities (now resolved) have slowed progress in tackling environmental challenges.

In Belgium forest cover is around 23% of the total land area, equivalent to 689,300 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 677,400 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 251,200 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 438,200 hectares (ha). For the year 2015, 47% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 53% private ownership and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown. 

==Cities==
The main cities in Belgium in terms of population are Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi and Liège. Other notable cities include Bruges, Namur, Leuven, Mons and Mechelen.

<doc id="67303" wikidata="Q16902146" url="?curid=67303" title="Two Towers, Bologna">
<text>The Two Towers (), both leaning, are symbols of Bologna, Italy, and the most prominent of the Towers of Bologna. They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (&quot;mura dei torresotti&quot;). The taller one is called the &quot;Asinelli&quot;. The smaller tower with a greater lean is called the &quot;Garisenda&quot;. Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited with having constructed the towers between 1109 and 1119.

Their construction may have been a competition between the two families to show which was the more powerful family. The scarcity of documents from this early period makes this uncertain. The name of the Asinelli family, for example, is documented for the first time in 1185, almost 70 years after the presumed construction of the tower which is attributed to them.

==Asinelli Tower==
It is believed that the Asinelli Tower initially had a height of ca. and was raised later to the current , with an overhanging battlement of 2.2 m (6.6 ft). In the 14th century the city became its owner and used it as a prison and small stronghold.

During this period a wooden construction was added around the tower at a height of roughly 30 metres, about 100 feet, above ground, which was connected with an aerial footbridge to the Garisenda Tower. The footbridge was destroyed in a 1398 fire. Its addition is attributed to Giovanni Visconti, Duke of Milan, who allegedly wanted to use it to control the turbulent &quot;Mercato di Mezzo&quot;, the central street, today the via Rizzoli, to suppress possible revolts. The Visconti had become the rulers of Bologna after the decline of the Signoria of the Pepoli family, but were rather unpopular in the city.

Severe damage was caused by lightning that often resulted in small fires and collapses. In 1824 a lightning rod was installed. The tower has survived at least two documented large fires: the first in 1185 was due to arson and a second one in 1398.

The Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1640 and Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in the 1700s for experiments to study the motion of heavy bodies and the Earth&#x27;s rotation. In World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: During bombing attacks, four volunteers took post at the top to direct rescue operations, to places hit by Allied bombs. Later, a RAI television relay was installed on top.

==Garisenda Tower==

The Garisenda Tower today has a height of , with an overhang of . Initially, it was approximately 60 metres (about 200 feet) high, but had to be lowered in the 14th century due to a yielding of the ground which left it slanting and dangerous. In the early 15th century, the tower was bought by the &quot;Arte dei Drappieri&quot;, which remained the sole owner until the &quot;Garisenda&quot; became municipal property at the end of the 19th century.

It was cited several times by Dante in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and &quot;The Rhymes&quot;, a confirmation of his stay in Bologna, and by Goethe in his &quot;Italian Journey&quot;. The Two Towers were the subject of an eponymous poem by Giosuè Carducci as part of the &quot;Barbarian Odes&quot;. Charles Dickens wrote about the towers in his &quot;Pictures from Italy&quot;. Antal Szerb wrote about them in &quot;The Third Tower: Journeys in Italy&quot;.

In October 2023, the tower was sealed off by the city of Bologna after fears the structure was tilting too far. Bologna officials noted that the tower has leaned since it was built; it had sustained additional damage in the medieval era when ironwork and bakery ovens were built inside. On 2 December 2023, the city announced that the tower was in danger of collapsing, and it began constructing a barrier to contain debris in the event of a fall. According to the city officials, work to prevent the collapse of the tower is expected to take at least 10 years and cost €20 million.

<doc id="67304" wikidata="Q1769535" url="?curid=67304" title="Economy of Belgium">
<text>The economy of Belgium is a highly developed, high-income, mixed economy. 

Belgium&#x27;s economy has capitalised on the country&#x27;s central geographic location, and has a well-developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Belgium was the first European country to join the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century. It has since developed a highly-developed transportation infrastructure made up of ports (most notably the Port of Antwerp), canals, railways, and highways, in order to integrate its industry with that of its neighbours. Among OECD nations, Belgium has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 29% of GDP. 

Belgium&#x27;s industry is concentrated mainly in the populous region of Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and Charleroi, along the &quot;Sillon industriel&quot;. Belgium imports raw materials and semi-finished goods that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soils. Despite the heavy industrial component, services dominate the country&#x27;s economy and account for 77.2% of Belgium&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP), while agriculture accounts for 0.7%.

With exports equivalent to over two-thirds of the country&#x27;s gross national income (GNI), Belgium depends heavily on world trade. Belgium&#x27;s trade advantages are derived from its central geographic location and a highly skilled, multilingual, and productive work force. One of the founding members of the European Community, Belgium strongly supports deepening the powers of the present-day European Union (EU) to integrate European economies further. About three-quarters of its trade is with other EU countries. In 2021, Belgium&#x27;s public debt was about 108% of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP).

== History ==
=== In the twentieth century ===
For 50 years through World War II, French-speaking Wallonia was a technically advanced, industrial region, with its industry concentrated along the sillon industriel, while Dutch-speaking Flanders was predominantly agricultural with some industry, mainly processing agricultural products and textiles. This disparity began to fade during the interwar period. When Belgium emerged from World War II with its industrial infrastructure relatively undamaged thanks to the Galopin doctrine, the stage was set for a period of rapid development, particularly in Flanders. The postwar boom years, enhanced by the establishment of the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels, contributed to the rapid expansion of light industry throughout most of Flanders, particularly along a corridor stretching between Brussels and Antwerp, which is the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam.

Foreign investment contributed significantly to Belgian economic growth in the 1960s. In particular, U.S. firms played a leading role in the expansion of light industrial and petrochemical industries in the 1960s and 1970s.

The older, traditional industries of Wallonia, particularly steel industry, began to lose their competitive edge during this period, but the general growth of world prosperity masked this deterioration until the 1973 and 1979 oil price shocks and resultant shifts in international demand sent the economy into a period of prolonged recession. In the 1980s and 1990s, the economic center of the country continued to shift northwards to Flanders with investments by multinationals (automotive industry, chemical industry) and growing local industrial agriculture (for textiles and food).

The early 1980s saw the country facing a difficult period of structural adjustment caused by declining demand for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform. Consequently, the 1980–82 recession shook Belgium to the core—unemployment mounted, social welfare costs increased, personal debt soared, the government deficit climbed to 13% of GDP, and the national debt, although mostly held domestically, mushroomed.

Against this grim backdrop, in 1982, Prime Minister Martens&#x27; center-right coalition government formulated an economic recovery program to promote export-led growth by enhancing the competitiveness of Belgium&#x27;s export industries through an 8.5% devaluation. Economic growth rose from 2% in 1984 to a peak of 4% in 1989. In May 1990, the government linked the Belgian franc to the Deutsche Mark, primarily through closely tracking German interest rates. Consequently, as German interest rates rose after 1990, Belgian rates have increased and contributed to a decline in the economic growth rate. In 1992–93, the Belgian economy suffered the worst recession since World War II, with the real GDP declining 0.96% in 1993.

On 1 May 1998, Belgium became a first-tier member of the European Monetary Union.

===In the twenty-first century===
Belgium switched from the Belgian franc to the Euro as its currency after 1 January 2002. Belgian per capita GDP ranks among the world&#x27;s highest. In 2008, the per capita income (PPP) was $37,500. The federal government has not managed to present balanced budgets in recent years and public debt remains high, at 99% of 2009 GDP. In 2009, during the Great Recession, Belgium suffered negative growth and increased unemployment. GDP growth in 2009 was −1.5%.

=== Trade unions ===
With 65% of the workers belonging to a union, Belgium is a country with one of the highest percentages of trade union membership. Only the Scandinavian countries have a higher trade union density. The biggest union with around 1.7 million members is the Christian democrat Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904. The origins of the union can be traced back to the &quot;Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union&quot; that was founded in 1886. The second biggest union is the socialist General Federation of Belgian Labour (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5 million. The ABVV-FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in Ghent by a group of weavers. This and other socialist unions became unified around 1898. The ABVV-FGTB in its current form dates back to 1945. The third major multi-sector union in Belgium is the liberal (classical liberal) union General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium (ACLVB-CGSLB) which is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290 thousand members. The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite the many small liberal unions. Back then the liberal union was known as the &quot;Nationale Centrale der Liberale Vakbonden van België&quot;. In 1930, the ACLVB-CGSLB adopted its current name.

Besides these &quot;big three&quot; there are a number of smaller unions, some more influential than others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also the Neutral and Independent Union that rejects the pillarization of the &quot;big three&quot; trade unions (their affiliation with political parties). There is also a small Flemish nationalist union that exists only in the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium, called the Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond. The last Belgian union worth mentioning is the very small, but highly active anarchist union called the Vrije Bond.

== Trade ==

About 80% of Belgium&#x27;s trade is with fellow EU member states. Given this high percentage, it seeks to diversify and expand trade opportunities with non-EU countries. The Belgian authorities are, as a rule, anti-protectionist and try to maintain a hospitable and open trade and investment climate. The European Commission negotiates on trade issues for all member states, which, in turn lessens bilateral trade disputes with Belgium.

The Belgian Government encourages new foreign investment as a means to promote employment. With regional devolution, Flanders, Brussels, and Wallonia are now courting potential foreign investors and offer a host of incentives and benefits. Foreign companies in Belgium account for approximately 11% of the total work force, with the U.S.

Attracted by the EU 1992 single-market program, many foreign firms and lawyers have settled in Brussels since 1989.

== Employment ==
The social security system, which expanded rapidly during the prosperous 1950s and 1960s, includes a medical system, unemployment insurance coverage, child allowances, invalid benefits, and other benefits and pensions. With the onset of a recession in the 1970s, this system became an increasing burden on the economy and accounted for much of the government budget deficits. The national unemployment figures mask considerable differences between Flanders and Wallonia. Unemployment in Wallonia is mainly structural, while in Flanders it is cyclical. Flanders&#x27; unemployment levels are generally only about half those of Walloon. The southern region continues a difficult transition out of sunset industries (mainly coal and steel), while sunrise industries (chemicals, high-tech, and services) dominate in Flanders.

Belgium&#x27;s unemployment rate was 6.5% in 2008. A total of 4.99 million people make up Belgium&#x27;s labor force. The vast majority of these people (80%), work in the service sector. The Belgian Industry claims 19% of the labor force; and agriculture claims 1%. As in other industrialized nations, pension and other social entitlement programs have become a major economic and political concern as the baby boomers approach retirement age.

== Budget ==
Although Belgium is a wealthy country, public expenditures far exceeded income for many years, and taxes were not diligently pursued. The Belgian Government reacted to the 1973 and 1979 oil price hikes by hiring the redundant work force into the public sector and subsidizing industries like coal, steel, textiles, glass, and shipbuilding, which had lost their international competitive edge. As a result, cumulative government debt reached 121% of GDP by the end of the 1980s. However, thanks to Belgium&#x27;s high personal savings rate, the Belgian Government financed the deficit from mainly domestic savings, minimizing the deleterious effects on the overall economy.

The federal government ran a 7.1% budget deficit in 1992 at the time of the EU&#x27;s Treaty of Maastricht, which established conditions for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) that led to adoption of the common Euro currency on 1 January 2002. Among other criteria spelled out under the Maastricht treaty, the Belgian Government had to attain a budget deficit of no greater than 3% of GDP by the end of 1997; Belgium achieved this, with a total budget deficit in 2001 (just prior to implementation of the Euro) that amounted to 0.2% of GDP. The government has balanced the budget every year since, until 2009 where it ran a deficit of about $25 billion. Belgium&#x27;s accumulated public debt remains high at 99% of 2009 GDP. A slight decrease in the accumulated public debt compared to GDP has been seen, however, thanks to a higher economic growth rate compared to the budget growth rate, which pushed the percentage from 99% of GDP in 2009 to 95% of GDP in 2011, a four-point decrease in two years, a feat rare enough to mention in the Western World.

== Regional differences ==
The economy of Belgium is varied and cannot be understood without taking the regional differences into account. Indeed, the Flemish and Walloon economies differ in many respects (consider for instance Eurostat and OECD statistics), and cities like Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Bruges, Charleroi or Ghent also exhibit significant differences. In general, productivity in Flanders is roughly 20% higher (per inhabitant) than in Wallonia. Brussels&#x27; GDP per capita is much higher than either region, although this is misleading, as many of those that work in the Brussels-Capital Region live in Flanders or Wallonia. Their output is counted in Brussels and not where they live, artificially raising the &quot;per capita&quot; GDP of Brussels and slightly lowering that of Flanders and Wallonia.

Unemployment has remained consistently more than twice as high in Wallonia than in Flanders, and has been even higher in Brussels, during most of the last 20 years (2012: Flanders: 4.55%; Wallonia: 10.12% and Brussels: 17.47%).

=== Brussels ===
Being the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the European Union, its economy is massively service-oriented. It has a number of regional headquarters of multinational corporations. It is also host to a great number of European institutions, in addition to the Belgian federal government, the government of the Flemish Community and the government of the French Community. Brussels also has many commuters, with 230,000 coming from Flanders, and 130,000 from Wallonia. Much of the success of Brussels is based on the high educational skills of its workforce. As of July 2012, however, the statistical unemployment rate in Brussels was 20.6%.

=== Flanders ===
In 2004, the port of Antwerp was the second largest European sea port by cargo volume, and the Antwerp freight railway station accounts for one-third of Belgian freight traffic. Antwerp is the first diamond market in the world, diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based BASF plant is the largest BASF-base outside Germany, and accounts on its own for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities include car manufacturing, telecommunications, photographic products.

The port of Bruges-Zeebrugge is one of the most important, modern and fastest growing ports in Europe. It is Europe&#x27;s largest port for RoRo traffic and natural gas. It also is the world&#x27;s largest port for the import and export of new vehicles. Tourism is also a major component of the economy of Bruges. Due to its pristine medieval city centre, Bruges has become a popular tourist destination. Annually about 2.5 million day tourists visit the city and in 2007 there were about 1.4 million overnight stays.

The port of Ghent, in the north of the city, is the third largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal, which ends near the Dutch port of Terneuzen on the Western Scheldt. The port houses, among others, big companies like ArcelorMittal, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Volvo Parts, Honda, and Stora Enso. The Ghent University, the second largest university of Belgium by number of students, and a number of research oriented companies are situated in the central and southern part of the city. Tourism is increasingly becoming a major employer in the local area. Begonias have been cultivated in the Ghent area since 1860. Belgium is the world&#x27;s largest producer of begonias, planting 60 million tubers per year. Eighty percent of the crop is exported.

=== Wallonia ===
In the past, Liège was one of the most important steel-making centres in Europe. Starting in 1817, John Cockerill extensively developed the iron and steel industry. The industrial complex of Seraing was the largest in the world. Although now a shadow of its former self, steel production and the manufacture of steel goods remain important.

Liège has also been an important centre for gunsmithing since the Middle Ages and the arms industry is still strong with the headquarters of FN Herstal. The economy of the region is now diversified, the most important centers are mechanical industries (aircraft engine and Spacecraft propulsion), space technology, information technology, biotechnology and also production of water, beer or chocolate. Liège Science Park south east of the city, near the University of Liège campus, houses spin-offs and high technology businesses. Liège is also a very important logistic center: the city possesses the third largest river port in Europe, directly connected to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Germany via the Meuse river and the Albert Canal. In 2006 Liège Airport was the 8th most important cargo airport in Europe. A new passenger terminal was opened in 2005. It is also the main hub and the headquarters of TNT Airways.

Charleroi features an industrial area, iron and steel industry, glassworks, chemicals, and electrical engineering. Charleroi is in the center of a vast coal basin, called &quot;Pays Noir&quot;. Many slag heaps still surround the city. Charleroi is also known for its publishing industry with Dupuis, one of the main publishers of Franco-Belgian comics, located in Marcinelle.

== Data ==

<text>Harold Maurice Abrahams (15 December 1899 – 14 January 1978) was an English track and field athlete. He was Olympic champion in 1924 in the 100 metres sprint, a feat depicted in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Abrahams&#x27;s father, Isaac, was a Jewish immigrant from Polish Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire since the Partitions of Poland. He worked as a financier, and settled in Bedford with his Welsh Jewish wife, Esther Isaacs. Harold was born in Bedford in 1899. His eldest brother was the physician Sir Adolphe Abrahams (1883–1967), the founder of British sport medicine. His middle brother was another British Olympic athlete, long jumper Sir Sidney Abrahams (1885–1957).

Abrahams was educated at Bedford School and Repton School, then both all-boys independent schools. Before attending university, Abrahams served the British Army. Having been a cadet, he was commissioned in the Bedfordshire Regiment as a temporary second lieutenant on 5 March 1919; he relinquished his commission on 1 September 1921 having completed his period of service. 

He studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from 1919 to 1923. At Cambridge, he was a member of the Cambridge University Athletics Club (of which he was president 1922–1923), Cambridge University Liberal Club, the University Pitt Club, and the Gilbert and Sullivan Society. After university he trained as a lawyer. 

Abrahams was also a member of the Achilles Club, a track and field club formed in 1920 by and for past and present representatives of Oxford and Cambridge universities. One of the club&#x27;s founding members was Evelyn Montague, who like Abrahams is also portrayed in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot;

==Athletics==
Abrahams had been a sprinter and long jumper since his youth. He continued to compete in running while at Cambridge. Abrahams earned a place in the 1920 Olympic team, but was eliminated in the quarter-finals of both the 100 m and the 200 m, and finished 20th in the long jump. He was also part of the British relay team that took fourth place in the 4 × 100 m.

The following year, Abrahams finished second behind Harry Edward in the 100 yards and 220 yards events at the 1921 AAA Championships. He became the national long jump champion after winning the AAA Championships title at the 1923 AAA Championships.

After graduating from Cambridge, he employed Sam Mussabini, a professional coach, who improved his style and training techniques in preparation for the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France.

For six months, Mussabini emphasised the 100 metres at Abrahams&#x27;s direction, with the 200 metres as secondary. Through vigorous training, Abrahams perfected his start, stride and form. Abrahams won both the 100 yards and long jump titles at the 1924 AAA Championships and one month before the 1924 Games, Abrahams set the English record in the long jump , a record which stood for the next 32 years. The same day he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds, but the time was not submitted as a record because the track was on a slight downhill.

At the 1924 Summer Games, Abrahams won the 100 m in a time of 10.6 seconds, beating all the American favourites, including the 1920 gold-medal winner Charley Paddock. In third place was Arthur Porritt, later Governor-General of New Zealand and Queen&#x27;s Surgeon. The Paris Olympics 100 m dash took place at 7 p.m. on 7 July 1924, and Abrahams and Porritt dined together at 7 p.m. on 7 July every year thereafter, until Abrahams&#x27;s death in 1978. Teammate Eric Liddell, the British 100-yard dash record holder at that time, declined to compete in the Paris 100 m because one of the heats for the event was held on a Sunday. Both Liddell and Abrahams competed in the final of the 200 m race, with Liddell finishing third and Abrahams sixth. Liddell went on to win the gold medal in the 400 metres. Abrahams was the opening runner for the British 4 × 100 m team, which won the silver medal. He did not compete in the long jump.

==Later life==
In May 1925, Abrahams broke his leg while long-jumping, ending his athletic career. He returned to his legal career as a barrister. In 1928, he was team captain of the British Olympic team at Amsterdam and editor of the Official British Olympic Report for the same games. Subsequently, he worked as an athletics journalist for forty years, becoming a commentator on the sports for BBC radio.

Later in his life, he also became president of the Jewish Athletic Association, and served as chairman for the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA).

In 1936, when the Amateur Athletic Union considered a boycott of Hitler&#x27;s Olympics, Abrahams successfully led the fight against doing so. While the influential Avery Brundage minimized the scope of the Third Reich&#x27;s persecution of Jews, Abrahams instead argued on pragmatic grounds: “I do not believe that any real good will come if this resolution is adopted; on the contrary, I believe that it will do harm.&quot; He went on to report from the 1936 Berlin Olympics for the BBC, exuberantly covering Jack Lovelock&#x27;s win in the 1500 metres: “A hundred yards to go! Come on, Jack!! My God, he’s done it. Jack, come on! Lovelock wins. Five yards, six yards, he wins. He’s won. Hooray!” His daughter reported that Abrahams had sat close to Hitler, and had said afterwards: &quot;I wish I&#x27;d shot him.&quot;

Abrahams wrote a number of books, including &quot;Oxford Versus Cambridge. A Record Of Inter-University Contests From 1827-1930&quot; (co-written with John Bruce-Kerr), &quot;The Olympic Games, 1896–1952&quot; and &quot;The Rome Olympiad, 1960&quot;.

Although not an official timer, Abrahams was present when Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile in 1954.

Abrahams died in Enfield on 14 January 1978, aged 78. He was buried in the same grave as his wife Sybil Evers, in St John the Baptist churchyard in Great Amwell, Hertfordshire.

==Personal life==
While at Cambridge, Abrahams was romantically involved with academic Christina McLeod Innes, and they became informally engaged, but their relationship waned and ended as Abrahams began focusing exclusively on his athletics and the Olympics. In early 1934, he met D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company singer Sybil Evers, and they began a passionate on-and-off romance. According to his biographer Mark Ryan, Abrahams had a fear of commitment and old-fashioned ideas about the role of women in marriage, but he was able to overcome these, and the couple wed in December 1936. In the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, Abrahams is instead depicted as dating D&#x27;Oyly Carte soprano Sybil Gordon (portrayed by Alice Krige), and the film portrays the couple as meeting a decade earlier than he and Evers actually did.

Abrahams cut a strip of gold off his Olympic medal to make the bridal wedding ring. Both the medal and the ring (following Sybil&#x27;s death) were later stolen, on separate occasions.

Sybil Evers could not have children, so they adopted an eight-week-old boy, Alan, in 1942, and a nearly three-year-old girl, Susan, in 1946; Susan (&quot;Sue&quot;) later married the formerly imprisoned anti-nuclear activist Pat Pottle, with whom she had two sons.

During the Nazi regime and war, the couple also fostered two Jewish refugees: a German boy called &quot;Ken Gardner&quot; (born Kurt Katzenstein), and an Austrian girl named Minka.

Sybil Evers died in 1963 at the age of 59. Abrahams set up two awards in her name: the Sybil Evers Memorial Prize for Singing (1965–1995), an annual cash prize awarded to the best female singer in her last year at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art, and the Sybil Abrahams Memorial Trophy, presented each year from 1964 onward at Buckingham Palace by the Duke of Edinburgh, President of the British Amateur Athletics Association, to the best British woman athlete.

Abrahams was active in freemasonry. He was a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, which was portrayed in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

==Honours==
Abrahams was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957. Abrahams has been recognised with an English Heritage Blue plaque at his former home in Golders Green in northwest London, which was unveiled by his daughter Sue Pottle and nephew Tony Abrahams. Abrahams lived at Hodford Lodge, 2 Hodford Road, from 1923 to 1930, years during which he achieved his greatest successes.

A plaque from the Heritage Foundation was unveiled at his birthplace, Rutland Road in Bedford, on 8 July 2012. This coincided with the Olympic torch relay passing through the town.

Abrahams was immortalised in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, in which he was played by British actor Ben Cross. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. His memorial service serves as the framing device for the movie, which tells his story and that of Liddell.

Abrahams was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the England Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009.

In July 2012, plans were announced to erect a memorial to Abrahams in Telford, Shropshire, to recognise that before the 1924 Olympics he won a gold medal in the 100-yard sprint at the Midlands Area AAA championships at St George&#x27;s Recreation Club ground. The memorial, in the form of a plaque, was unveiled by Sue Pottle in October 2014 in the lounge of the club, which now possesses the medal he won at the event.

Norris McWhirter once commented that Abrahams &quot;managed by sheer force of personality and with very few allies to raise athletics from a minor to a major national sport&quot;. Reflecting in 1948 on Abrahams&#x27; athleticism, Philip Noel-Baker, Britain&#x27;s 1912 Olympic captain and a Nobel Prize winner, wrote:
I have always believed that Harold Abrahams was the only European sprinter who could have run with Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, and the other great sprinters from the U.S. He was in their class, not only because of natural gifts – his magnificent physique, his splendid racing temperament, his flair for the big occasion – but because he understood athletics and had given more brainpower and more will power to the subject than any other runner of his day.

<text>Demographic features of the population of Belgium include ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects. All figures are from the National Institute for Statistics unless otherwise indicated.

==Population==
As of January 1, 2024, Belgium had a population of 11,763,650 and is the 81st most populous country in the world. The population of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels on January 1, 2024 was 6,821,770 (58.0% of Belgium), 3,692,283 (31.4% of Belgium) and 1,249,597 (10.6% of Belgium), respectively. The population density of Belgium is as of January 1, 2024, making it the 38th most densely populated country in the world, and the 7th most densely populated country in Europe. The most densely populated province is Antwerp, the least densely populated province is Luxembourg.

As of January 1, 2020, Belgium had a population of 11,492,641, as compared to 2010 (10,839,905 people) an increase of about 653,000. 2010 compared to 2000 (10,239,085 people), an increase of about 601,000 people. 2000 compared to 1990 (9,947,782 people), an increase of about 291,000 people.

The following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review in 2019.

=== Fertility ===
The total fertility rate (TFR) gradually increased during the last decade from 1.60 in 1997, 1.65 in 2002 and 1.82 in 2007. The rates in Brussels are higher than the national average (1.79 in 1997, 1.93 in 2002 and 2.09 in 2007), while they are below the average in Flanders (1.54 in 1997, 1.56 in 2002 and 1.77 in 2007), due to the higher percentage of non-European immigrants with higher birth rates in Brussels.

The total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.

===Structure of the population===



==Immigration==
Since the relaxation of the Belgian nationality law more than 1.3 million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship and are now considered &quot;new Belgians&quot;. 89.2% of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.

In 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population. Of these, 685 000 (6.4%) were born outside the EU and 695 000 (6.5%) were born in another EU Member State.

==Origin groups==

Belgium does not collect data on ethnicity or race, but does collect data on the country of origin of citizens.

The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Italian Belgians, with more than 450,000 people, which is well over 4% of Belgium&#x27;s total population. The Moroccan Belgians are the third-largest group, and the largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 340,359. According to Michèle Tribalat in the beginning of 2020, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed 32.1% of the total population. According to Statbel, 65.5% of the Belgian population was Belgian with a Belgian background in 2024. The Belgian background by age group was 51.8% among those under 18, 62.1% among 18-64-year-olds and 85.5% among those aged 65 and over.

Of these &#x27;New Belgians&#x27;, 55.1% are of non-Belgian European ancestry and 44.9% are from non-Western countries.

The rest consists mostly of French-speaking people from Brussels, Turks, Kurds, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Spaniards, Greeks, Bosniaks, Algerians, Congolese, Vietnamese, Poles, Indians, and Guineans (around 23% of Belgium&#x27;s population is of non-Belgian origin). Approximately 30,000 Roma live in Belgium.

The exact number of French-speakers in Brussels is hard to determine, but it is estimated that 85% of the people living in Brussels use French and 10% use Dutch in their households, as the sole language or secondary language, while Arabic is also largely spoken. See the Brussels article for more details.

In the table are the top 30 countries by origin of the population of Belgium in 2020


==Languages==

Belgium&#x27;s three official languages are Dutch, spoken by about 60% of the population, French, spoken by about 40%, and German, spoken by less than 1%. The vast majority of Belgium&#x27;s population, 99%, is literate as defined by the Belgian government, i.e. capable of reading and writing in an official language by the time a citizen has reached the age of 15. English is the official (meetings) language of the European Commission, 10% of the job market in Brussels.

==Religion==

As of 2012, 58% of Belgians identify as Roman Catholic. Other Christians comprise 7% of the population. Muslims comprise 5%. 27% of Belgians are agnostics, atheists or otherwise irreligious.

<text>Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii, the common spotted orchid, is a subspecies of flowering plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae.

&quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; is one of Europe&#x27;s most common wild orchids. It is widespread across much of Europe, with the range extending eastward into Siberia, Mongolia and Xinjiang. The species is also reportedly naturalised in the Canadian Province of Ontario.

&quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant ranging from in height. The inflorescence is a dense-flowered spike, produced in June–August, that is at first conical then cylindrical. The flower colour can vary from white to pale purple with purple spots, a symmetrical pattern of dark purple loops or dots and dashes. The lip has three lobes. The bracts are usually shorter than the flower. The lip is smaller than that of the very similar &quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; and has three deeper cuts. The middle lobe is more than half as large as a lateral lobe. Some colonies are highly perfumed, attractive to day-flying moths. The leaves are narrow lanceolate, keeled and often dark-spotted.

== Identification ==
It is similar to other orchids in the &quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; group. &quot;D. maculata&quot; ssp. &quot;maculata&quot; is distinguished by having the lip less deeply trilobed, while &quot;D. maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;saccifera&quot; has one spur large and saccular (sac-shaped) and the bracts of the inflorescence as long as or longer than the flowers. Outside of the &quot;maculata group&quot;, &quot;D. majalis&quot; is very similar to &quot;D. maculata subsp. fuchsii&quot;, but is distinguished by the following characters: the spots of the leaves are less elongated, the bracts of the inflorescence are longer and the lower transcend the inflorescence itself; it tends to be less cylindrical (a little more &#x27;globular&#x27;), the stem is hollow (not solid) and the leaves are slightly larger. Other similar orchids are &quot;D. incarnata&quot; and &quot;D. majalis&quot; subsp. &quot;lapponica&quot; but these species have hollow stems and different habitat (fens and bogs).

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; is a Eurosiberian species occurring over Europe from Ireland in the west eastwards to Mongolia, the Altai Mountains and across northern Asia. It is sympatric with &quot;D. maculata&quot;.

Typical habitats are, variously across the range, conifer, beech and chestnut forests, moderately wet meadows, bogs and margins of streams. The preferred substrate is supposedly calcareous although it seems not to be particularly linked to this type of substrate. In mountain, subalpine and alpine ecosystems &quot;D.  maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; is found from 900 to 2300 m above sea level. Elsewhere it is found from sea level.

The full list of areas (World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions) for &quot;D. maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; is Finland, Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Corsica, Italy, Romania, former Yugoslavia, Belarus, Baltic States, Central European Russia, East European Russia, North European Russia, South European Russia, Northwest European Russia, Ukraine, Altay, Buryatiya, Chita, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Tuva, West Siberia, Yakutiya, Xinjiang, Mongolia.

In Italy it is found mainly in the Alps in the northern Apennines. In Britain it is widespread, the most common orchid, occurring from alkaline marshes to chalk downland. After the bee orchid, &quot;Ophrys apifera&quot;, it is the most successful orchid coloniser of waste land.

==Ecology==
Pollination may be by bumblebees, or the longhorn beetle &quot;Alosterna tabacicolor&quot;.

&quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; forms mycorrhizal associations with fungi in the Tulasnellaceae and Ceratobasidium groups.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Dactylorhiza&quot; is Ancient Greek for finger root, referring to the shape of the plant&#x27;s roots. The subspecies name &quot;fuchsii&quot; honours the 16th-century German botanist Leonhart Fuchs. The English name &#x27;common spotted&#x27; refers to the species&#x27; abundance and the spots on its leaves. The French and German common names also honour Leonhart Fuchs.

This plant belongs to a problematic group of orchids. &quot;D. maculata&quot; subsp. &quot;fuchsii&quot; is very variable in flower colour and flower morphology, plant height and the scent of flowers. This is due to the ease of introgression (the transfer of genetic material from one sympatric species to another, only partially isolated from the first, through interspecific hybridization and repeated backcrossing to a parental species), the ability of these plants to adapt quickly and easily to habitat and different substrates and possibly other causes. As a result, a multitude of forms have been defined for this plant. The World Checklist of Kew Gardens lists over 25 varieties, of which 7 are recognized as valid.

=== Hybrids ===
Hybrids with other species of the same genus are frequent. Species include:
*&quot;Dactylorhiza majalis&quot; 
*&quot;Dactylorhiza traunsteineri&quot; 
*&quot;Dactylorhiza incarnata&quot; subsp. &quot;ochroleuca&quot;
This plant hybridizes easily with species of different genera (intergeneric hybridization). The list below shows some of these intergeneric hybrids (these hybrids are not always recognized by all botanists):
*×&quot;Dactylodenia lawalreei&quot; – hybrid with &quot;Gymnadenia odoratissima&quot;
*×&quot;Dactylodenia st-quintinii&quot; – hybrid with &quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot;
*×&quot;Dactyloglossum mixtum&quot; – hybrid with &quot;Coeloglossum viride&quot;
*×&quot;Rhizanthera martysiensis&quot; – hybrid with &quot;Platanthera chlorantha&quot;

<doc id="67310" wikidata="Q2165056" url="?curid=67310" title="Disk read-and-write head">
<text>A disk read-and-write head is the small part of a disk drive that moves above the disk platter and transforms the platter&#x27;s magnetic field into electric current (reads the disk) or, vice versa, transforms electric current into magnetic field (writes the disk). The heads have gone through a number of changes over the years.

In a hard drive, the heads &quot;fly&quot; above the disk surface with clearance of as little as 3 nanometres. The flying height has been decreasing with each new generation of technology to enable higher areal density. The flying height of the head is controlled by the design of an air bearing etched onto the disk-facing surface of the &quot;slider&quot;. The role of the air bearing is to maintain the flying height constant as the head moves over the surface of the disk. The air bearings are carefully designed to maintain the same height across the entire platter, despite differing speeds depending on the head distance from the center of the platter. If the head hits the disk&#x27;s surface, a catastrophic head crash can result. The heads often have a diamond-like carbon coating.

== Inductive heads ==
Inductive heads use the same element for both reading and writing.

=== Traditional head ===
The heads themselves started out similar to the heads in tape recorders—simple devices made out of a tiny C-shaped piece of highly magnetizable material such as permalloy or ferrite wrapped in a fine wire coil. When writing, the coil is energized, a strong magnetic field forms in the gap of the C, and the recording surface adjacent to the gap is magnetized. When reading, the magnetized material rotates past the heads, the ferrite core concentrates the field, and a current is generated in the coil. In the gap the field is very strong and quite narrow. That gap is roughly equal to the thickness of the magnetic media on the recording surface. The gap determines the minimum size of a recorded area on the disk. Ferrite heads are large, and write fairly large features. They must also be flown fairly far from the surface thus requiring stronger fields and larger heads.

=== Metal-in-gap (MIG) heads===
Metal-in-gap (&quot;MIG&quot;) heads are ferrite heads with a small piece of metal in the head gap that concentrates the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced by thin-film heads.

===Thin-film heads===
First introduced in 1979 on the IBM 3370 disk drive, thin-film technology uses photolithographic techniques similar to those used on semiconductor devices to fabricate hard drive heads. At the time, these heads had smaller size and greater precision than the ferrite-based heads then in use; they were electronically similar to them and used the same physics. Thin layers of magnetic (Ni–Fe), insulating, and copper coil wiring materials were built on ceramic substrates that were then physically separated into individual read/write heads integrated with their air bearing, significantly reducing the manufacturing cost per unit. Thin-film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin-film heads allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4 GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.

==Magnetoresistive heads (MR heads)==

The next head improvement in head design was to separate the writing element from the reading element allowing the optimization of a thin-film element for writing and a separate thin-film head element for reading. The separate read element uses the magnetoresistive (MR) effect which changes the resistance of a material in the presence of a magnetic field. These MR heads are able to read very small magnetic features reliably, but can not be used to create the strong field used for writing. The term &quot;AMR&quot; (Anisotropic MR) is used to distinguish it from the later introduced improvement in MR technology called &quot;GMR&quot; (giant magnetoresistance) and &quot;TMR&quot; (tunneling magnetoresistance).

The transition to perpendicular magnetic recording (&quot;PMR&quot;) media has major implications for the write process and the write element of the head structure but less so for the MR read sensor of the head structure.

=== AMR heads ===
The introduction of the AMR head in 1990 by IBM led to a period of rapid areal density increases of about 100% per year.

===GMR heads===
In 1997 GMR, giant magnetoresistive heads started to replace AMR heads.

Since the 1990s, a number of studies have been done on the effects of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), which may allow for even greater increases in density. But so far it has not led to practical applications because it requires low temperatures and large equipment size.

=== TMR heads===
In 2004, the first drives to use tunneling MR (&quot;TMR&quot;) heads were introduced by Seagate allowing 400 GB drives with 3 disk platters. Seagate introduced TMR heads featuring integrated microscopic heater coils to control the shape of the transducer region of the head during operation. The heater can be activated prior to the start of a write operation to ensure proximity of the write pole to the disk and medium. This improves the written magnetic transitions by ensuring that the head&#x27;s write field fully saturates the magnetic disk medium. The same thermal actuation approach can be used to temporarily decrease the separation between the disk medium and the read sensor during the readback process, thus improving signal strength and resolution. By mid-2006 other manufacturers have begun to use similar approaches in their products.
