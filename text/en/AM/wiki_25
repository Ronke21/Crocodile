<doc id="67317" wikidata="Q936801" url="?curid=67317" title="Watership Down">
<text>Watership Down is an adventure novel by English author Richard Adams, published by Rex Collings Ltd of London in 1972. Set in Hampshire in southern England, the story features a small group of rabbits. Although they live in their natural wild environment, with burrows, they are anthropomorphised, possessing their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology. Evoking epic themes, the novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home (the hill of Watership Down), encountering perils and temptations along the way.

&quot;Watership Down&quot; was Richard Adams&#x27;s debut novel. It was rejected by several publishers before Collings accepted the manuscript; the published book then won the annual Carnegie Medal (UK), annual Guardian Prize (UK), and other book awards. 

The novel was adapted into a 2D animated feature film in 1978 and a 2D animated children&#x27;s television series from 1999 and 2001. In 2018, the novel was adapted again, this time into a 3D animated series, which both aired in the UK and was made available on Netflix.

Adams completed a sequel almost 25 years later, in 1996, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot;, constructed as a collection of 19 short stories about El-ahrairah and the rabbits of the Watership Down warren.

==Origin and publication history==

The story began as tales that Richard Adams told his young daughters Juliet and Rosamund during long car journeys. He recounted in 2007 that he &quot;began telling the story of the rabbits... improvised off the top of [his] head, as [they] were driving along&quot;. The daughters insisted he write it down—&quot;they were very, very persistent&quot;. After some delay, Adams began writing the novel in the evenings; he completed it 18 months later. The book is dedicated to the two girls.

Adams&#x27;s descriptions of wild rabbit behaviour were based on &quot;The Private Life of the Rabbit&quot; (1964), by British naturalist Ronald Lockley. The two later became friends, embarking on an Antarctic tour that became the subject of a co-authored book, &quot;Voyage Through the Antarctic&quot; (A. Lane, 1982).

In his autobiography, &quot;The Day Gone By&quot;, Adams wrote that he based &quot;Watership Down&quot; and the stories in it on his experiences during Operation Market Garden, the Battle of Arnhem, in 1944. The character of Hazel, the leader of the group of rabbits, was modelled on Adams&#x27;s commanding officer, Major John Gifford. He gave the warrior Bigwig the personality of Captain Desmond Kavanagh, who is buried at the Airborne Cemetery in Oosterbeek, The Netherlands. 

&quot;Watership Down&quot; was rejected seven times before it was accepted by Rex Collings. The one-man London publisher Collings wrote to an associate, &quot;I&#x27;ve just taken on a novel about rabbits, one of them with extra-sensory perception. Do you think I&#x27;m mad?&quot; The associate did call it &quot;a mad risk,&quot; in her obituary of Collings, to accept &quot;a book as bizarre by an unknown writer which had been turned down by the major London publishers; but,&quot; she continued, &quot;it was also dazzlingly brave and intuitive.&quot; Collings had little capital and could not pay an advance but &quot;he got a review copy onto every desk in London that mattered.&quot; Adams wrote that it was Collings who gave &quot;Watership Down&quot; its title. There was a second edition released in 1973.

Macmillan USA, then a media giant, published the first U.S. edition in 1974; a Dutch edition was also published that year by Het Spectrum.

==Plot summary==

===Part 1: The Journey===

In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a runty young rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren&#x27;s imminent destruction. He and his brother Hazel fail to convince the Threarah, their Chief Rabbit, of the need to evacuate; they then try to convince the other rabbits, but only succeed in gaining nine followers, all bucks (males) and no does (females). Captain Holly of the Sandleford Owsla, the warren&#x27;s military caste, accuses the group of fomenting dissension against the Threarah. He tries to stop them from leaving, but is driven off.

Once out in the world, the traveling group of rabbits finds itself following the leadership of Hazel, who had been considered an unimportant member of the warren. The group travels far through dangerous territory. Bigwig and Silver, both former Owsla and the strongest rabbits among them, protect the others, helped by Hazel&#x27;s good judgement and the ingenuity of the clever rabbit Blackberry. Along the way, they cross the River Enborne, and evade a badger, a dog, a crow, and a car. Hazel and Bigwig also stop three rabbits from attempting to return to the Sandleford warren.

A rabbit named Cowslip invites Hazel&#x27;s group to join his warren, where a farmer leaves food for the rabbits and shoots all the predators. Fiver senses death and deception in the new warren, but the rest of Hazel&#x27;s group, enjoying the peace and good food, decide to ignore Fiver&#x27;s warnings and the strange and evasive behaviour of the new rabbits. Later, Bigwig is caught in a snare, only surviving the ordeal thanks to Blackberry and Hazel&#x27;s quick thinking. Fiver deduces the truth, and admonishes the rest in a wild lecture; the farmer feeds and protects the rabbits so he can harvest them for meat and skins, and Cowslip&#x27;s rabbits invited the guests into their warren to increase their own odds of survival. The Sandleford rabbits, badly shaken, continue on their journey. They are joined by Strawberry, a buck who deserts Cowslip&#x27;s warren.

===Part 2: On Watership Down===

Fiver&#x27;s visions instruct the rabbits to seek a home atop the hills. The group eventually finds and settles in a beech (a wooded hill) on Watership Down. While digging the new warren, they are joined by Captain Holly and his friend Bluebell. Holly is severely wounded, and both rabbits are ill from exhaustion, having escaped both the violent destruction of the Sandleford Warren by humans and an attack by Cowslip&#x27;s rabbits along the way. Holly&#x27;s ordeal has left him a changed rabbit and, after telling the others that Fiver&#x27;s terrible vision has come true, he offers to join Hazel&#x27;s band in whatever way they will have him. 

Although Watership Down is a peaceful habitat, Hazel realizes that, with all buck rabbits and no does, the warren will soon die out. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they discover a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded. At Hazel&#x27;s request, Holly leads a small embassy to Efrafa to present their request for does.

Hazel and Pipkin (the smallest rabbit) decide to scout out the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find a rabbit hutch. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the four hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Two nights later, Hazel leads a raid on the farm, which frees two does and a buck from the hutch. Hazel is wounded in the leg by the farmer&#x27;s shotgun and presumed dead; Fiver&#x27;s visions prompt him and Blackberry to return and rescue Hazel. When the embassy to Efrafa returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state run by the despotic General Woundwort, who refuses to allow anyone to leave his warren. Holly and his three companions have managed to escape with little more than their lives.

===Part 3: Efrafa===
While they were imprisoned in Efrafa, Holly&#x27;s group had met an Efrafan doe named Hyzenthlay, who wishes to leave the warren and can recruit other does to join in the escape. Hazel and Blackberry devise a plan to rescue Hyzenthlay&#x27;s group and bring them to Watership Down. 

Bigwig infiltrates Efrafa in the guise of a &#x27;hlessi&#x27; (a wandering rabbit unattached to any warren). He is recruited into the Efrafan Owsla by Woundwort, while Hazel and several other Watership rabbits hide across the nearby River Test. With help from Kehaar, Bigwig manages to free Hyzenthlay and nine other does, as well as a condemned Efrafan prisoner named Blackavar. Woundwort and his officers pursue them, but the Watership rabbits and the escapees use a punt to float away down the Test and escape.

===Part 4: Hazel-rah===
Downriver, the punt strikes a bridge, killing one doe. Once the rabbits are back on shore, they begin the long journey home, losing one more doe to a fox along the way. As they near Watership, they come across Captain Campion and his Efrafan patrol, who have been tracking them. Blackavar advises Hazel that the patrol must be killed to prevent them from reporting to Woundwort, but Hazel spares them and sends them off.

A few weeks later, the Owsla of Efrafa, led by Woundwort, unexpectedly arrives to destroy the warren at Watership Down and take back the escapees. Fiver experiences another vision, which gives Hazel the solution to the problem. While Bigwig fights and injures Woundwort in a narrow tunnel, preventing the rest of the Efrafans from getting any further into the burrows, Hazel, Dandelion and Blackberry return to Nuthanger Farm. They release Bob, the farmer&#x27;s Labrador, and lure him back to Watership Down. Bob attacks the Efrafans, who flee in terror, leaving Woundwort to stubbornly stand his ground unobserved. Following the fight, Bob returns to Nuthanger Farm with a few wounds, but there is no sign of Woundwort&#x27;s body. Groundsel, one of the Efrafan officers, fervently believes the General must have survived.

After releasing the dog, Hazel is attacked by Tab, one of the farmhouse cats. He is saved by young Lucy, the former owner of the escaped hutch rabbits, who shows him to the local doctor before releasing him. Upon returning to Watership, Hazel effects a lasting peace and friendship between the remaining Efrafans and the Watership rabbits. Some time later, Hazel and Campion, the intelligent new chief of Efrafa, send rabbits to start a new warren at Caesar&#x27;s Belt, to relieve the effects of overcrowding at both their warrens.

===Epilogue===
As time goes on, the three warrens on the downs prosper under Hazel, Campion and Groundsel (their respective chiefs). General Woundwort is never seen or heard from again; he becomes a legend among the rabbits, and a sort of bogeyman to frighten rabbit kits. Kehaar rejoins his colony, but continues to visit the rabbits every winter. He refuses to search for Woundwort, showing that even he still fears him. 

Years later, on a cold March morning, an elderly Hazel is visited by El-ahrairah, the legendary rabbit folk hero and spiritual Prince of the Rabbits. He invites Hazel to join his Owsla, reassuring Hazel of Watership&#x27;s future success and prosperity. Leaving his friends and his physical body behind, Hazel departs Watership Down with El-ahrairah.

==Characters==
=== Rabbits ===
;Sandleford warren
* Hazel/Hazel-rah: The novel&#x27;s protagonist. Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave, affectionate and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He becomes their Chief Rabbit in the process, with his name accordingly expanded to &quot;Hazel-rah&quot; (&quot;Chief Hazel&quot; or &quot;Prince Hazel&quot; in Lapine). He often relies on Fiver&#x27;s advice, and he trusts his brother&#x27;s instincts most of the time.
* Fiver: Hazel&#x27;s younger brother, a runt rabbit whose Lapine name means &quot;Little One of Many&quot; (Rabbits have a single word, &quot;hrair&quot; - sometimes translated as &quot;thousand&quot; - for all numbers greater than four. Fiver&#x27;s name in Lapine, &quot;Hrairoo&quot;, indicates that he is the smallest of a litter of five or more rabbits.) As a seer, he has visions and strong instincts. He is shy, kind, and intelligent, and though he does not directly act as a leader, the others listen to and follow his advice. Vilthuril becomes his mate.
* Bigwig: An ex-Owsla officer, and the largest, strongest, and bravest rabbit of the group. His name in Lapine is &quot;Thlayli&quot;, which literally means &quot;Fur-head&quot; and refers to the shock of fur on the back of his head. Though he is initially harsh and cynical, he is naturally compassioniate and eventually learns to be less quick-tempered. He is also shown to be cunning in his own way when he rescues the does from Efrafa, and later devises a plan to defeat the larger and stronger General Woundwort. This final confrontation leaves him severely wounded, but he survives and becomes the leader of Hazel&#x27;s Owsla.
* Blackberry: A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He is often capable of understanding concepts the other rabbits find incomprehensible. He realizes, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel&#x27;s most trusted advisors, and he and Kehaar devise the plan to rescue does from Efrafa.
* Dandelion: Described as a &quot;dashing&quot; buck rabbit, notable for his storytelling ability and speed. He is the first to recognize Watership Down as their best new home, and is instrumental in both raids on Nuthanger farm.
* Buckthorn: A strong half-grown buck who was expected to be part of the Sandleford Owsla once he reached maturity. He joins Bigwig and Silver as a fighter for the group.
* Hawkbit: Described in the book as a &quot;rather slow, stupid rabbit&quot;, but is accepted by Hazel regardless.
* Speedwell and Acorn: Pair of rank-and-file rabbits who are friends of Hawkbit. Like him, they are initially distrustful of Hazel, but soon become valuable sentries and burrow diggers.
* Silver: The sturdy and level-headed nephew of Sandleford&#x27;s Chief Rabbit. At Sandleford, he is teased for his pale grey fur (his namesake) and accused of getting his position in the Owsla through nepotism, prompting him to join the fugitives. He, Bigwig and Buckthorn frequently defend the other rabbits along their journey.
* Pipkin: A small and initially timid buck rabbit. Hazel refuses to leave him behind when he is wounded, and Pipkin grows fiercely loyal to Hazel. He serves as a comforter to Holly, and becomes very brave, offering to go into Efrafa himself when Bigwig is late in returning. He also is the first to jump into the River Test, when Hazel orders the rabbits to do so. His name is &quot;Hlao-roo&quot; (&quot;Little Dimple in the Grass&quot;) in Lapine.
* Holly: Former captain of the Sandleford Warren Owsla, escapes with Bluebell when his warren is destroyed by men. He is near death when he finds the warren at Watership Down, but is nursed back to health and welcomed by the fugitives.
* Bluebell: Buck rabbit who escapes with Holly during the destruction of Sandleford. He tells jokes (often in rhyme) to cope, and to help himself and Holly recover from the mental strain of seeing the Sandleford warren destroyed and Pimpernel killed by Cowslip&#x27;s rabbits. He, like Dandelion, is also a storyteller.
* Pimpernel: A Sandleford rabbit, who helps Bluebell to escape the poisoning of the Sandleford warren but becomes very ill and weak in the process. He travels towards Watership with Holly and Bluebell, but is murdered by Cowslip&#x27;s rabbits.
* Threarah - Usually called &quot;THE Threarah&quot; because his name means &quot;Lord/Prince Rowan Tree&quot; in Lapine, and there is only one rowan near the warren. He is Silver&#x27;s uncle, and the cool and detached leader of the Sandleford Warren. He believes in the gift of foresight, but dismisses Fiver&#x27;s fears, believing rabbits can best weather any dangers by sitting tight. He is presumed killed when the men poison his warren.

;Cowslip&#x27;s warren
* Cowslip: While not chief rabbit of his warren, he is the first to meet Hazel and the others, and tricks them into staying in the Warren of the Snares, which is why they refer to it as &quot;Cowslip&#x27;s Warren&quot; afterwards. He and the others refuse to answer any questions or discuss the snares. After Fiver exposes and ruins their blissful denial and Strawberry defects to Fiver&#x27;s side, Cowslip leads some other rabbits to attack Holly&#x27;s group as it passes through their territory.
* Strawberry: A large, sleek buck from Cowslip&#x27;s warren who leaves with the Watership Down rabbits after his doe, &quot;Nildro-hain&quot; (&quot;Blackbird&#x27;s Song&quot;, in Lapine), is killed by a snare.

;Nuthanger Farm
* Haystack and Clover: Two of the hutch does, who escape in order to live with the wild rabbits. Clover&#x27;s mate, Laurel, does not escape with her and allows himself to be taken back to the hutch by the farmer. Later, Holly becomes Clover&#x27;s new mate.
* Boxwood: A hutch buck who escapes in order to live with the wild rabbits. He is taken under Strawberry&#x27;s wing, as he initially does not know how to survive in the wild. He is Haystack&#x27;s mate.

;Efrafa
* General Woundwort: The main antagonist of the novel. A fearless, cunning and brutally efficient rabbit who was orphaned at a young age and raised by humans, Woundwort escaped, founded the Efrafa warren, and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy and kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren as an act of revenge against Bigwig&#x27;s stealing does from Efrafa, an attack defeated by Hazel&#x27;s ingenuity and Bigwig&#x27;s bravery. After fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he disappears completely, and many rabbits remain unsure if he still lives or not.
* Captain Campion: Woundwort&#x27;s most trusted subordinate, Campion is a loyal, brave and clever officer. Despite being on opposite sides, Bigwig and Hazel like Campion and twice refuse to kill him when they have him at their mercy. After Woundwort disappears, Campion becomes the Chief Rabbit of Efrafa and reforms it, making peace with the Watership rabbits.
* Vervain: The sadistic and callous head of the Owslafa (Council Police) in Efrafa, said to be one of the most hated rabbits in the warren. He is ordered to kill Fiver during the Watership attack, but Fiver calmly prophesies his death, and he flees in terror. He disappears during the retreat back to Efrafa, presumably killed by predators.
* Groundsel: A calm, sensible member of Woundwort&#x27;s Owsla, he rescues an Efrafan patrol when their Captain is killed by a fox. He accompanies Woundwort to Watership with the rest of the Owsla, though he is wisely hesitant to attack Hazel&#x27;s rabbits after their earlier displays of cleverness. He and four others surrender to Fiver after the dog incident, and he is accepted into Watership as a friend, eventually becoming the Chief Rabbit at the new warren in Caesar&#x27;s Belt.
* Hyzenthlay: A doe who leads other Efrafan does to oppose Woundwort and his council, as they are unable to reproduce because of overcrowding. Woundwort orders her group to be broken up and scattered across the warren; however, she and several friends escape Efrafa with Bigwig. Like Fiver, she has visions, but has trouble interpreting them. Her name means literally &quot;shine-dew-fur&quot;, or &quot;fur shining like dew&quot;.
* Thethuthinnang - In Lapine, &quot;Movement of Leaves&quot;. A very sturdy, sensible doe and Hyzenthlay&#x27;s friend and lieutenant in organizing the rebellion among the Efrafan does.
* Vilthuril: An Efrafan doe - her name&#x27;s translation is never given. She escapes Efrafa with Bigwig, Hyzenthlay and the other does. She becomes Fiver&#x27;s mate, and is said to be the only one to understand him as well as Hazel. One of their kittens, Threar, becomes a seer like his father.
* Blackavar: A rabbit with dark fur who tries to escape from Efrafa but is apprehended, mutilated, and put on display to discourage further escape attempts. When he is liberated by Bigwig, he quickly proves himself an expert tracker and ranger, and also shows himself to be an effective fighter when the Efrafan rabbits attack the warren.

=== Non-rabbits ===

* Kehaar: A black-headed gull who is forced, by an injured wing, to take refuge on Watership Down, and befriends the rabbits when they help him. He is characterized by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing. After discovering the Efrafan warren and helping the rabbits, he re-joins his colony, but visits them often. According to Adams, Kehaar was based on a fighter from the Norwegian Resistance in World War II.
* The Mouse: Never named, the mouse is a resident of Watership Down before the arrival of the rabbits. While rabbits usually despise smaller mammals like rodents and shrews, and view them as untrustworthy, Hazel kindly saves the mouse from a kestrel. This action allies the mice and rabbits on Watership Down, and the same mouse later warns them of General Woundwort&#x27;s intended surprise attack, thus saving many lives.

=== Mythical characters ===
* Frith: The primary deity in rabbit folklore, similar to the God of Abraham, said to have created the world. While forced to create &quot;elil&quot; (predators) because of the rabbits&#x27; refusal to stop overpopulating the Earth, Frith promised that rabbits would never be allowed to go extinct. In Lapine, the word &quot;Frith&quot; means &quot;the sun/sunrise&quot;.
* El-ahrairah: A rabbit trickster culture hero, who is the protagonist of nearly all of the rabbits&#x27; stories. He represents what every rabbit wants to be: Smart, devious, tricky, and devoted to the well-being of his warren. In Lapine, his name is a contraction of the phrase &quot;Elil-hrair-rah&quot;, which means &quot;prince with a thousand enemies&quot;. His stories of cleverness (and excessive hubris) are similar to Br&#x27;er Rabbit and Anansi.
* Prince Rainbow: A lesser deity in rabbit folklore, tasked by Frith to organize the world. He often abuses his power to try to harm or rein in El-ahrairah and the rabbits, but is always outsmarted.
* Rabscuttle: Another mythical folk hero, Rabscuttle is El-ahrairah&#x27;s second-in-command and Owsla Captain. He participates in many of El-ahrairah&#x27;s capers. He is considered to be almost as clever as his chief. His name may be a reference to a rabbit&#x27;s &quot;scut&quot;, or tail.
* Black Rabbit of Inlé: Known as &quot;Inlé-rah&quot; (&quot;Prince/Chief of the Moon&quot; or &quot;Prince/Chief of the Dead&quot;) to his ghostly Owsla, he is a sombre phantom servant of the god Frith who appears in rabbit folklore as a kind of analogue to the grim reaper. His duty is to ensure all rabbits die at their predestined time, and he avenges any rabbit killed without his consent. &quot;Inlé&quot; is the Lapine term for the moon/moonrise, as well as the word for the Land of the Dead.

==Lapine language==
&quot;Lapine&quot; is a fictional language created by author Richard Adams for the novel, where it is spoken by the rabbit characters. The language was again used in Adams&#x27;s 1996 sequel, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot;, and has appeared in both the film and television adaptations. The language fragments in the books consist of a few dozen distinct words, used mainly for the naming of rabbits, their mythological characters, and objects in their world. The name &quot;Lapine&quot; comes from the French word for rabbit.

==Themes==
&quot;Watership Down&quot; has been described as an allegory, with the labours of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and Silver &quot;mirror[ing] the timeless struggles between tyranny and freedom, reason and blind emotion, and the individual and the corporate state.&quot; Adams draws on classical heroic and quest themes from Homer and Virgil, creating a story with epic motifs.

===The Hero, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the &quot;Aeneid&quot;===
The book explores the themes of exile, survival, heroism, leadership, political responsibility, and the &quot;making of a hero and a community&quot;. Joan Bridgman&#x27;s analysis of Adams&#x27;s works in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; identifies the community and hero motifs: &quot;[T]he hero&#x27;s journey into a realm of terrors to bring back some boon to save himself and his people&quot; is a powerful element in Adams&#x27;s tale. This theme derives from the author&#x27;s exposure to the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his study of comparative mythology, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), and in particular, Campbell&#x27;s &quot;monomyth&quot; theory, also based on Carl Jung&#x27;s view of the unconscious mind, that &quot;all the stories in the world are really one story.&quot;

The concept of the hero has invited comparisons between &quot;Watership Down&#x27;s&quot; characters and those in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Hazel&#x27;s courage, Bigwig&#x27;s strength, Blackberry&#x27;s ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion&#x27;s and Bluebell&#x27;s poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the epic poem &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Kenneth Kitchell declared, &quot;Hazel stands in the tradition of Odysseus, Aeneas, and others&quot;. Tolkien scholar John Rateliff calls Adams&#x27;s novel an &quot;Aeneid&quot; &quot;what-if&quot; book: what if the seer Cassandra (Fiver) had been believed and she and a company had fled Troy (Sandleford Warren) before its destruction? What if Hazel and his companions, like Odysseus, encounter a seductive home at Cowslip&#x27;s Warren (Land of the Lotus Eaters)? Rateliff goes on to compare the rabbits&#x27; battle with Woundwort&#x27;s Efrafans to Aeneas&#x27;s fight with Turnus&#x27;s Latins. &quot;By basing his story on one of the most popular books of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Adams taps into a very old myth: the flight from disaster, the heroic refugee in search of a new home, a story that was already over a thousand years old when Virgil told it in 19 BC.&quot;

===Religious symbolism===
When asked in a 2007 BBC Radio interview about the religious symbolism in the novel, Adams said the story was &quot;nothing like that at all&quot;. He said the rabbits in Watership Down did not worship; however, &quot;they believed passionately in El-ahrairah.&quot; Adams explained that he meant the book to be &quot;only a made-up story... in no sense an allegory or parable or any kind of political myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls.&quot; Instead, he explained, the &quot;let-in&quot; religious stories of El-ahrairah were meant more as legendary tales, similar to a rabbit Robin Hood, and these stories were interspersed throughout the book as humorous interjections to the often &quot;grim&quot; tales of the &quot;real story&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Economist&quot; heralded the book&#x27;s publication, saying &quot;If there is no place for &quot;Watership Down&quot; in children&#x27;s bookshops, then children&#x27;s literature is dead.&quot; Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at &quot;Newsweek&quot;, gave the novel a glowing review: &quot;Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created.&quot; Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that &quot;subtly speaks to a child&quot;, with &quot;engaging characters and fast-paced action [that] make it readable.&quot; This echoed Nicholas Tucker&#x27;s praise for the story&#x27;s suspense in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;: &quot;Adams... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one.&quot;

D. Keith Mano, a science fiction writer and conservative social commentator writing in the &quot;National Review&quot;, declared that the novel was &quot;pleasant enough, but it has about the same intellectual firepower as Dumbo.&quot; He pilloried it further: &quot;&quot;Watership Down&quot; is an adventure story, no more than that: rather a swashbuckling crude one to boot. There are virtuous rabbits and bad rabbits: if that&#x27;s allegory, &quot;Bonanza&quot; is an allegory.&quot;

John Rowe Townsend notes that the book quickly achieved such a high popularity despite the fact that it &quot;came out at a high price and in an unattractive jacket from a publisher who had hardly been heard of.&quot; Fred Inglis, in his book &quot;The Promise of Happiness: Value and meaning in children&#x27;s fiction&quot;, praises the author&#x27;s use of prose to express the strangeness of ordinary human inventions from the rabbits&#x27; perspective.

&quot;Watership Down&quot;&#x27;s universal motifs of liberation and self-determination have been identified with by readers from a diversity of backgrounds; the author Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto &quot;Watership Down&quot;, has remarked &quot;Turns out plenty of other people have seen their histories in that book... some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism... a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. &quot;Watership Down&quot; can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres.&quot; Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and &quot;Watership Down&quot; for its &quot;motifs [that] hit home in every culture... all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots and plug into the archetype.&quot;

===Awards===
Adams won the 1972 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. He also won the annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice. In 1977 California schoolchildren selected it for the inaugural California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category, which annually honours one book from the last four years. In The Big Read, a 2003 survey of the British public, it was voted the forty-second greatest book of all time.

===Criticism of gender roles===
The 1993 Puffin Modern Classics edition of the novel contains an afterword by Nicholas Tucker, who wrote that stories such as &quot;Watership Down&quot; &quot;now fit rather uneasily into the modern world of consideration of both sexes&quot;. He contrasted Hazel&#x27;s sensitivity to Fiver with the &quot;far more mechanical&quot; attitude of the bucks towards the does portrayed as &quot;little more than passive baby-factories&quot;.

In a 1974 &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; essay &quot;Male Chauvinist Rabbits&quot;, Selma G. Lanes alleges that the does are only &quot;instruments of reproduction to save his male rabbits&#x27; triumph from becoming a hollow victory.&quot; Lanes argued that this view of female rabbits came from Adams rather than his source text, Ronald Lockley&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of the Rabbit&quot; in which the rabbit world is matriarchal, and new warrens are initiated by dissatisfied young females.

In similar vein, literary critic Jane Resh Thomas said &quot;Watership Down&quot; &quot;draws upon... an anti-feminist social tradition which, removed from the usual human context and imposed upon rabbits, is eerie in its clarity&quot;. Thomas also called it a &quot;splendid story&quot; in which &quot;anti-feminist bias... damages the novel in only a minor way&quot;.

Adams&#x27;s 1996 sequel, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot; includes stories where the female rabbits play a more prominent role in the Watership Down warren.

=== Ownership controversy ===
On 27 May 2020, the high court in London ruled that Martin Rosen, the director of the 1978 film adaptation, had wrongly claimed that he owned all rights to the book, as well as terminating his contract for rights to the film. Rosen had entered into adaptation contracts worth more than $500,000 (£400,000), including licences for an audiobook adaptation and the 2018 television adaptation.

In his ruling, Judge Richard Hacon ordered Rosen to pay over $100,000 in damages for copyright infringement, unauthorised licence deals, and denying royalty payments to the Adams estate. Rosen was also directed to provide a record of all licence agreements involving &quot;Watership Down&quot;, and pay court costs and the Adams estate&#x27;s legal fees totalling £28,000.

==Adaptations==
===Music===
In the early 1970s Bo Hansson was introduced to the book by his then girlfriend. This gave him an idea to create a new album in the same style as his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; album. In 1977 he released the all instrumental &quot;El-Ahrairah&quot;. The title was taken directly from the pages of &quot;Watership Down&quot;, with El-Ahrairah being the name of a trickster, folk-hero/deity rabbit, known as &quot;The Prince with a Thousand Enemies&quot;. In other countries the album was released as &quot;Music Inspired by Watership Down&quot;.

===Film===
In 1978 Martin Rosen wrote and directed an animated film adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot;. The voice cast included John Hurt, Richard Briers, Harry Andrews, Simon Cadell, Nigel Hawthorne, and Roy Kinnear. The film featured the song &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, sung by Art Garfunkel. Released as a single, the song became a UK number one hit although Richard Adams said that he hated it.

Although the essentials of the plot remained relatively unchanged, the film omitted several side plots. Though the Watership Down warren eventually grew to seventeen rabbits with the additions of Strawberry, Holly, Bluebell, and three hutch rabbits liberated from the farm, the movie includes a band of only eight. Rosen&#x27;s adaptation was praised for &quot;cutting through Adams&#x27; book... to get to the beating heart&quot;.

The film has also seen some positive critical attention. In 1979 the film received a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Additionally, British television station Channel 4&#x27;s 2006 documentary &quot;100 Greatest Cartoons&quot; named it the 86th greatest cartoon of all time. But, &quot;lovable bunnies notwithstanding, younger children might be troubled by the more graphic scenes. Numerous rabbits die in bloody fights, while one gets choked by a snare and another is snatched by a bird of prey.&quot;

===Television===
From 1999 to 2001, the book was also adapted as an animated television series, broadcast on CITV in the UK and on YTV in Canada. Only the first two series were aired in the UK, while all three series were aired in Canada. It was produced by Martin Rosen and starred several well-known British actors, including Stephen Fry, Rik Mayall, Dawn French, John Hurt, and Richard Briers, running for a total of 39 episodes over three seasons. Although the story was broadly based on the novel and most characters and events retained, some of the story lines and characters (especially in later episodes) were entirely new. In 2003, the second season was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Music Score for a Dramatic Series.

===2018 animated series===
In July 2014, it was announced that the BBC would be airing a new animated series based on the book and in April 2016 that the series would be a co-production between the BBC and Netflix, consisting of four one-hour episodes, with a budget of £20 million. The four episode serial premiered on the BBC and Netflix on 23 December 2018, with the voices of James McAvoy as Hazel, John Boyega as Bigwig, and Ben Kingsley as General Woundwort. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for the performances of its voice cast, but received criticism for its tone and the quality of the computer animation.

===Theatre===
In 2006, &quot;Watership Down&quot; was again adapted for the stage, this time by Rona Munro. It ran at the Lyric Hammersmith in London. Directed by Melly Still, the cast included Matthew Burgess, Joseph Traynor, and Richard Simons. The tone of the production was inspired by the tension of war: in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Still commented, &quot;The closest humans come to feeling like rabbits is under war conditions... We&#x27;ve tried to capture that anxiety.&quot; A reviewer at &quot;The Times&quot; called the play &quot;an exciting, often brutal tale of survival&quot; and said that &quot;even when it&#x27;s a muddle, it&#x27;s a glorious one.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Watership Down&quot; was adapted for the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago by John Hildreth. This production was directed by Katie McLean Hainsworth and the cast included Scott T. Barsotti, Chris Daley, Paul S. Holmquist, and Mandy Walsh.

===Role-playing game===
&quot;Watership Down&quot; inspired the creation of &quot;Bunnies &amp; Burrows&quot;, an early role-playing game in which the main characters are talking rabbits, published in 1976 by Fantasy Games Unlimited. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, as well as the first with detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official &quot;GURPS&quot; supplement in 1992.

===Radio===
In 2002, a two-part, two-hour dramatisation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; by Neville Teller was broadcast by BBC Radio 4.

In November 2016, a new two-part two-hour dramatisation, written by Brian Sibley, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

===Audiobooks===
In the 1970s, the book was released by Argo Records read by Roy Dotrice, with musical background—music by George Butterworth performed by Academy of St Martin in the Fields under the direction of Neville Marriner.

Alexander Scourby narrated an unabridged edition, originally published on LP in the 1970s by the Talking Books program of the American Foundation for the Blind (NLSB). The LPs have been destroyed by NLSB and are very rare.

In 1984, &quot;Watership Down&quot; was adapted into a four-cassette audiobook by John Maher in association with the Australian Broadcasting Company&#x27;s Renaissance Players. Produced by John Hannaford and narrated by Kerry Francis, the audiobook was distributed by The Mind&#x27;s Eye.

In 1990, a 16-hour, 11-cassette recording read by John MacDonald was published by Books on Tape, Inc. of Santa Ana, CA.

Andrew Sachs recorded a five and a half-hour abridged version of the story for Puffin Audiobooks.

In 2010, Audible.com released an unabridged digital download of the book, narrated by the multiple award-winning Ralph Cosham.

In 2019, Blackstone Audio Inc. released an unabridged version of &quot;Watership Down&quot; with a foreword by the author, Richard Adams. Peter Capaldi narrated the 17-hour, 31-minute book.

=== Graphic novel ===
A new graphic novel version of Watership Down was released in 2023, adapted by award-winning author James Sturm and illustrated by bestselling artist Joe Sutphin.

==Parodies==
In the American stop motion TV show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, a parody of the book is done with the Fraggles, the main characters of the 80s show &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, in place of the rabbits.

The November 1974 issue of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine, released shortly after the resignation and pardon of President Richard Nixon, featured a satirical parody of the novel entitled &quot;Watergate Down&quot;, written by Sean Kelly, in which rabbits are replaced by rats, described as animals with &quot;the morals of a Democrat and the ethics of a Republican&quot;.

The Dropout &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; series &quot;Dimension 20&quot; has a side quest &quot;Burrow&#x27;s End&quot; loosely based on &quot;Watership Down&quot;. The main characters are Stoats looking for a new warren to live in.

<doc id="67318" wikidata="Q1317938" url="?curid=67318" title="Geography of Chile">
<text>The geography of Chile is extremely diverse, as the country extends from a latitude of 17°South to Cape Horn at 56° and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Andes in the east. Chile is situated in southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean and a small part of the South Atlantic Ocean. Chile&#x27;s territorial shape is considered among the world&#x27;s most unusual; from north to south, the country extends , and yet it only averages in width. Chile reaches from the middle of South America&#x27;s west coast straight down to the southern tip of the continent, where it curves slightly eastward. The Diego Ramírez Islands and Cape Horn, the southernmost points in the Americas where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans meet, are Chilean territory. Chile&#x27;s northern neighbors are Peru and Bolivia, and its border with Argentina to the east, at , is the world&#x27;s third-longest. The total land area is . The very long coastline of gives Chile the 11th largest exclusive economic zone of .

==Physical geography==

The northern two-thirds of Chile lie on top of the telluric Nazca Plate, which, moving eastward about ten centimeters a year, is forcing its way under the continental plate of South America. This movement has resulted in the formation of the Peru–Chile Trench. At its deepest point, the trench descends to over .

The same telluric displacements that created the Peru-Chile Trench make the country prone to earthquakes. During the twentieth century, Chile has been struck by twenty-eight major earthquakes, all with a force greater than 6.9 on the Richter scale. The strongest of these occurred in 2010 (registering an estimated 8.8 on the Richter scale) and in Valdivia 1960 (reaching 9.5). This latter earthquake occurred on May 22, the day after another major quake measuring 7.25 on the Richter scale, and covered an extensive section of south-central Chile. It caused a tsunami that destroyed several fishing villages in the south and raised or lowered sections of the coast as much as two meters. The convergence between the Earth&#x27;s surface plates has also generated the Andes, a geologically young mountain range that in Chilean territory alone, includes about 620 volcanoes, many of which are active. 

Approximately 80 percent of Chile&#x27;s terrain consists of mountainous formations. The majority of the Chilean population resides in close proximity to these mountain ranges. Additionally, there are other, less imposing mountain ranges present. These non-Andean mountains, though they can manifest in various locations, typically constitute parts of transverse and coastal ranges. The transverse ranges, notably found in the near north and far north natural regions, extend in diverse configurations from the Andes to the ocean, shaping valleys oriented in an east-west direction. On the other hand, the coastal ranges are predominantly visible in the central region of the country, contributing to the formation of the Central Valley (&quot;Valle Central&quot;) between these ranges and the Andes. In the southernmost reaches, the Central Valley merges with the waters of the ocean. Here, the elevated sections of the coastal range facing the Andes transform into a multitude of islands, creating a complex network of channels and fjords that have posed navigational challenges to seafarers.

Much of Chile&#x27;s coastline is rugged. The Humboldt Current, which originates northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula (which juts into the Bellingshausen Sea) and runs the full length of the Chilean coast, makes the water cold. During the summer months, the temperature of the water off Chile&#x27;s beaches in the central part of the country stays below . A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 564 km2 of tidal flats in Chile, making it the 44th-ranked country in the world in terms of tidal flat area.

Chilean territory extends as far west as Polynesia. The best known of Chile&#x27;s Pacific Islands is Easter Island (Isla de Pascua, also known by its Polynesian name of Rapa Nui), with a population of 2,800 people. Located west of Chile&#x27;s mainland port of Caldera, just below the Tropic of Capricorn, Easter Island provides Chile a gateway to the Pacific. It is noted for its 867 monoliths (moais), which are huge (up to twenty meters high) and mysterious, expressionless faces sculpted of volcanic stone. The Juan Fernández Islands, located west of Valparaíso, are the locale of a small fishing settlement. They are famous for their lobster. One of the islands, Robinson Crusoe Island, is where Alexander Selkirk, the inspiration for Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel, was marooned for about four years.

==Natural regions==
Since Chile extends from a point about north of the Tropic of Capricorn to a point hardly more than north of the Antarctic Circle, a broad selection of the Earth&#x27;s climates can be found in this country. Therefore, geographically, the country can be divided into many different parts. It is usually divided by geographers into five regions: the far north, the near north, central Chile, the south, and the far south. Each has its own characteristic vegetation, fauna, climate, and, despite the omnipresence of both the Andes and the Pacific, its own distinct topography.

===Far North===

The far north (Norte Grande), which extends from the Peruvian border to about 27° south latitude, a line roughly parallel to the Copiapó River, is extremely arid. It mainly contains the Atacama Desert, one of the driest areas in the world. In certain areas, this desert does not register any rainfall at all. Geographically, the aridity can be explained by the following conditions:

* The desert is located on the leeward side of the Chilean Coast Range, so little moisture from the Pacific Ocean can reach the desert.
* The Andes are so high that they block convective clouds, which may prevent precipitation formed above the Amazon Basin from entering the desert to the east.
* An inversion layer is created by the cold Humboldt current and the South Pacific High.

Average monthly temperatures range at sea level between about during the summer and about during the winter. Most of the population lives in the coastal area, where the temperatures are more moderate and the humidity higher. Contrary to the image of monochrome barrenness that most people associate with deserts, the landscape is spectacular, with its crisscrossing hills and mountains of all shapes and sizes, each with a unique hue depending on its mineral composition, its distance from the observer, and the time of day.

In the far north, the land generally rises vertically from the ocean, sometimes to elevations well over . The Cordillera Domeyko in the north runs along the coast parallel to the Andes. This topography generates coastal microclimates because the fog that frequently forms over the cold ocean waters, as well as any low clouds, is trapped by the high bluffs. This airborne moisture condenses in the spines and leaves of the vegetation, droplets that fall to the ground and irrigate the plants&#x27; roots. Beyond the coastal bluffs, there is an area of rolling hills that encompasses the driest desert land; this area ends to the east with the Andes towering over it. The edges of the desert in some sections have subterranean aquifers that have permitted the development of forests made up mainly of tamarugos, spiny trees native to the area that grow to a height of about twenty-five meters. Most of those forests were cut down to fuel the fires of the many foundries established since colonial times to exploit the abundant deposits of copper, silver, and nitrate found in the area. The result was the creation of even drier surface conditions.

The far north is the only part of the country in which there is a large section of the Andean plateau. During summer the area receives considerable rainfall in what is commonly known as the &quot;Bolivian winter,&quot; forming shallow lakes of mostly saline waters (Salar de Llamara, Salar des Miraje, Salar de Atacama) that are home to a number of bird species, including the Chilean flamingo. Some of the water from the plateau trickles down the Andes in the form of narrow rivers, many of which form oases before being lost to evaporation or absorption into the desert sands, salt beds, and aquifers. However, some rivers do manage to reach the Pacific, including the Loa River, whose U-shaped course across the desert makes it Chile&#x27;s longest river. The water rights for one of the rivers, the Lauca River, remain a source of dispute between Bolivia and Chile. These narrow rivers have carved fertile valleys in which exuberant vegetation creates a stark contrast to the bone-dry hills. In such areas, roads usually are built halfway up the arid elevations in order to maximize the intensive agricultural use of the irrigated land. They offer spectacular panoramic vistas, along with the harrowing experience of driving along the edges of cliffs.

In the far north, the kinds of fruits that grow well in the arid tropics thrive, and all kinds of vegetables can be grown year-round. However, the region&#x27;s main economic foundation is its great mineral wealth. For instance, Chuquicamata, the world&#x27;s largest open-pit copper mine, is located in the far north. Since the early 1970s, the fishing industry has also developed lots in the main ports of the area, most notably Iquique and Antofagasta.

===Near North===

The near north (Norte Chico) extends from the Copiapó River to about 32° south latitude, or just north of Santiago. It is a semiarid region whose central area receives an average of about of rain during each of the four winter months, with trace amounts the rest of the year. The near north is also subject to droughts. The temperatures are moderate, with an average of during the summer and about during the winter at sea level. The winter rains and the melting of the snow that accumulates on the Andes produce rivers whose flow varies with the seasons, but which carry water year-round. Their deep Transverse Valleys provide broad areas for cattle raising and, most important, fruit growing, an activity that has developed greatly since the mid-1970s. Nearly all Chilean pisco is produced in the near north.

As in the far north, the coastal areas of the near north have a distinct microclimate. In those sections where the airborne moisture of the sea is trapped by high bluffs overlooking the ocean, temperate rain forests develop as the vegetation precipitates the vapor in the form of a misty rain. Because the river valleys provide breaks in the coastal elevations, maritime moisture can penetrate inland and further decrease the generally arid climate in those valleys. The higher elevations in the interior sections are covered with shrubs and cacti of various kinds.

===Central Chile===

Central Chile (Chile Central), home to a majority of the population, includes the three largest metropolitan areas—Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción. It extends from about 32° south latitude to about 37° south latitude. The climate is of the temperate Mediterranean type, with the amount of rainfall increasing considerably and progressively from north to south. In the Santiago area, the average monthly temperatures are about in the summer months of January and February and in the winter months of June and July; the average monthly precipitation is no more than a trace in January and February and in June and July. In Concepción, by contrast, the average monthly temperatures are somewhat lower in the summer at but higher in the winter at , and the amount of rain is much greater: in the summer, Concepción receives an average of 0.8 inch (20 millimeters) of rain per month; in June and July, the city is pounded by an average of 10 inches (253 mm.) per month. The numerous rivers greatly increase their flow as a result of the winter rains and the spring melting of the Andean snows, and they contract considerably in the summer. The combination of abundant snow in the Andes and relatively moderate winter temperatures creates excellent conditions for Alpine skiing.

The topography of central Chile includes a coastal range of mountains running parallel to the Andes. Lying between the two mountain ranges is Central Valley, which contain some of the richest agricultural land in the country, especially in its northern portion. The area just north and south of Santiago is a large producer of fruits, including the grapes from which the best Chilean wines are made. Exports of fresh fruit began to rise dramatically in the mid-1970s because Chilean growers had the advantage of being able to reach markets in the Northern Hemisphere during winter in that part of the world. Most of these exports, such as grapes, apples, and peaches, go by refrigerator ships. But some, such as berries, go by air freight.

The southern portion of central Chile contains a mixture of some high-quality agricultural lands, many of which were covered originally with old-growth forests. They were cleared for agriculture but were soon exhausted of their organic matter and left to erode. Large tracts of this worn-out land, many of them on hilly terrain, have been reforested for the lumber, especially for the cellulose and paper industries. New investments during the 1980s in these industries transformed the rural economy of the region. The pre-Andean highlands and some of the taller and more massive mountains in the coastal range (principally the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) still contain large tracts of old-growth forests of remarkable beauty, some of which have been set aside as national parks. Between the coastal mountains and the ocean, many areas of central Chile contain stretches of land that are lower than the Central Valley and are generally quite flat. The longest beaches can be found in such sections.

===South===

Although many lakes can be found in the Andean and coastal regions of central Chile, the south (Sur de Chile) is definitely the country&#x27;s most lacustrine area. Southern Chile stretches from below the Bío-Bío River at about 37° south latitude to Chacao channel at about 42° south latitude. In this lake district of Chile, the valley between the Andes and the coastal range is closer to sea level, and the hundreds of rivers that descend from the Andes form lakes, some quite large, as they reach the lower elevations. They drain into the ocean through other rivers, some of which (principally the Calle-Calle River, which flows by the city of Valdivia) are the only ones in the whole country that are navigable for any stretch. The Central Valley&#x27;s southernmost portion is submerged in the ocean and forms the Gulf of Ancud. Isla de Chiloé, with its rolling hills, is the last important elevation of the coastal range of mountains.

The south is one of the rainiest areas in the world. One of the wettest spots in the region is Valdivia, with an annual rainfall of . The summer months of January and February are the driest, with a monthly average precipitation of . The winter months of June and July each produce on average a deluge of . Temperatures in the area are moderate. In Valdivia, the two summer months average , whereas the winter months average .

The snow-covered Andes form a constant backdrop to vistas of clear blue or even turquoise waters, as at Todos los Santos Lake. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white-water sections and waterfalls. The vegetation, including many ferns in the shady areas, is a lush green. Some sections still consist of old-growth forests, and in all seasons, but especially in the spring and summer, there are considerable amounts of wildflowers and flowering trees. The pastures in the northernmost section, around Osorno, are well suited for raising cattle; milk, cheese, and butter are important products of that area. All kinds of berries grow in the area, some of which are exported, and freshwater farming of various species of trout and salmon has developed, with cultivators taking advantage of the abundant supply of clear running water. The lumber industry is also important. A number of tourists, mainly Chileans and Argentines, visit the area during the summer.

Many of Chile&#x27;s distinctive animal species have been decimated as they have been pushed farther and farther into the remaining wilderness areas by human occupation of the land. This is the case with the huemul, a large deer, and the Chilean condor, the largest bird of its kind; both animals are on the national coat of arms. The remaining Chilean cougars, which are bigger than the ones in California, have been driven to isolated national parks in the south by farmers who continue to hunt them because they kill sheep and goats.

===Far South===

In the far south (&quot;Chile Austral&quot;), which extends from between 42° south latitude to Cape Horn, the Andes and the South Pacific. In the northern part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. The summer months average , whereas the winter months average . The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average in the summer months and in the winter months. The area generally is chilly and wet and houses a combination of channels, fjords, snow-capped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within a narrow space. The southern part of the far south includes the city of Punta Arenas, which, with about 125,000 inhabitants, is the southernmost city in Chile. Punta Arenas receives much less precipitation than other parts of &quot;Zone Austral&quot;; its annual total is only , or slightly more than what Valdivia receives in the month of June alone. This precipitation is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, with the two main summer months receiving a monthly average of thirty-one millimeters and the winter months , some of it in the form of snow. Temperatures are colder than in the rest of the country. The summer months average , and the winter months average . The virtually constant wind from the South Pacific Ocean makes the air feel significantly colder.

The far south contains large expanses of pastures that are often used for raising sheep, even though overgrazing is an issue in some areas. The area&#x27;s other main economic activity is oil and natural gas extraction from the areas around the Strait of Magellan. This strait is one of the world&#x27;s important sea-lanes because it unites the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through a channel that avoids the rough open waters off Cape Horn. The channel is perilous, however, and Chilean pilots guide all vessels through it.

== Population geography ==

=== Demographics ===
=== Urban population ===
The distribution of population is very condensed around the capital, Santiago, where approximately 90% of the people live. The cities of Valparaiso and Concepcion are the next highly populated cities, in that order. The population is 87.6% urbanized. In 2009, 12,037,290 living in urban parts of Chile actually had functioning facilities in their home, while 403,276 people did not have proper facilities in their dwelling. 100% of the urban population has some form of access to sanitation facilities, while 90.9% of rural people have these facilities available. This is much higher than the rural average for the world that is at 50.5% access to sanitation facilities.

The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs note the average annual rate of population change from 2015 to 2017 is 1.022. The UN data also shows live births per woman (2015–2017) averaging 1.765 and combined infant mortality rate for both sexes at 6.258 per 1,000 live births.

====Natural hazards====
Natural disasters are a significant cause of Chilean emigration. Earthquakes are common in Chile due to the country&#x27;s location on the Nazca Plate and South American Plate. Chile notoriously had some of the most powerful earthquakes in history with the Valdivia Earthquake in 1960 at 9.5 on the Richter scale and the Maule Earthquake at 8.8 in 2010. The top three countries that Chilean emigrants are moving to are Argentina, Peru, and the United States.

Chile&#x27;s natural hazards include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. The natural hazards are attributed to Chile&#x27;s location along the Ring of Fire. Severe earthquakes can trigger tsunamis for this country with 6,435 km of coastline. There are also more than three-dozen active volcanoes in Chile with the most active being the Llaima in the north Chilean Andes.

== Urban geography ==
The three most populated cities in Chile are Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción. The populations of these cities are: Santiago at 6,680,000, Valparaíso at 967,000 and Concepción at 857,000. Santiago is located in central Chile with the Mapocho River running through the city. Valparaíso is located on the coast about 116 km northwest of Santiago. Concepción is also a coastal city that lies near the mouth of the Biobío River.

=== Origins ===

Industrial cities, such as Concepción and Talcahuano, began as colonial centers in the 1600s. Most of the large cities in Chile began as settlement locations for Spanish colonists living in homes constructed from adobe. They have grown to be the densely populated urban conurbations they are known for today.
=== Gentrification ===
Gentrification is occurring in the municipal district of Santiago, which is impacting low income residents. Housing availability has reduced by 50% for residents and rent for new apartments has increased, changing the average income of that location. Floor Area Ratio instigated by the state has resulted in highly dense and smaller living spaces.

== Cultural geography ==
=== Racialized landscapes in Chile ===
Due to Chile&#x27;s high population density in urban cities like Santiago, housing developments started developing upwards. These high rises see an abundance of foreign migrants as occupants.

=== Religious landscapes and sacred places ===
In Chile, there are a number of pilgrimage and devotional sites dedicated to Catholic or cult&#x27;s saints. These include the Church of Our Lady of Andacollo, the Church of Our Lady at Mount Carmel at Tirana, and the Church of the Immaculate Conception of Lo Vásquez.

==== La Virgen de Andacollo ====
While there are several tales of her origin and variations on her name, the Virgin Andacollo is flaunted on the first Sunday of every month in the plaza of Andacollo, Chile. The Virgin Andacollo is the Patron Saint of miners who heals the sick and rescues those lost in the mines. On the first Sunday of October, the town of Andacollo celebrates their saint with La Fiesta Chico. Thousands of pilgrims come to the northern Chilean town each December for La Fiesta Grande. This event lasts from December 23 to 27. This celebration attracts as many as 500,000 people a year.

==== &quot;Animitas&quot; ====
It is not uncommon to come across roadside shrines in Chile. These shrines are called &quot;Animitas&quot; and they are particularly common along rural highways or in lower-income towns. The shrines can be devoted to saints or those who died tragically. These &quot;animitas&quot; identify the spot where a body and soul were thought to be separated and where a soul might linger.

==== Churches of Chiloé ====

The Chiloé archipelago is located in southern Chile and is home to the Churches of Chiloé. These churches date back to the early 17th century. Their history began when the first Jesuits arrived in Chile. There are more than 60 churches, but 16 of them are recognized as world heritage sites by UNESCO as well as national monuments in Chile. The Achao church is the oldest church that still stands and was built entirely without using nails.

== Political geography ==
=== Border disputes with Bolivia ===
Chile has long been in conflict with Bolivia over coastal and land sovereignty. The War of the Pacific was fought between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru in the late 1800s. The latter two had rich nitrate deposits. However, Peru established a monopoly over their deposits and Bolivia applied export tariffs to Chile. After the war, Chile had won 120,000 km2 of land that included Antofagasta on the coastline of Bolivia. This has left Bolivia landlocked since 1904. 
Bolivians still fights for coastal and territorial sovereignty. Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia, has argued that Bolivia&#x27;s landlocked status has made the country endure great &quot;historical injustice&quot;. Morales also has argued that were Chileans to give back Antofagasta, it would have no significant effect on their country. The land Bolivia lost to Chile more than a century ago is now home to some of the biggest copper mines in the world. Chile has no intention of giving up any land to Bolivia, but is very open to coastal access negotiations.

In October 2018, the International Court of Justice ruled against Bolivia in its dispute with Chile. The court ruled that Chile did not have to discuss granting Bolivia sea access.

=== Border disputes with Peru ===
There have been continuous disputes between Chile and Peru since the 1800s due to the fact that they both claim boundary coastal lines. Peru claims the northern part of Chile, which is now southwest of Peru. This &quot;triangulation&quot; was made to fix the boundary problem between Chile and Peru. The decisions were accomplished on January 27, 1839, by the International Court of Justice The War of the Pacific occurred from the years 1879–1883; the war was caused because of the mineral resources Chile had. This led for Chile to control sea shipping to Peru and send out an army to invade Peru on October 8, 1879. An attempt was also made to invade the United States in October 1880 but failed. There was a resistance between Peru and Chile for a few years. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Ancón, which was signed by both of them on October 20, 1883, to keep the peace between them. In 2008, Peru took Chile to court over their maritime disputes. In 2014, the International Court of Justice&#x27;s ruling resulted in Chile losing 80 miles from Chile&#x27;s northwestern ocean zone. This ruling severely impacted fishers in the country.

=== Border disputes with Argentina ===
Border disputes between Chile and Argentina deal with the Patagonia region; one of the many such disputes deals with the countries&#x27; southern ice-fields. The disagreements began when Argentina maps started to include part of the southern ice-fields. The dispute between these two countries deals with water, as this contested land contains the second-largest reserve of potable water in the world. Despite these differing ideas about what land belongs to which country, former President of Chile Sebastián Piñera claims that these issues will get resolved.

==Agricultural geography==

Agriculture accounts for 4.4% of GDP (industry 31.4%, services 64.3%). A 2017 estimate has 8.881 million people working within the Chilean labor force, and 9.2% working within agriculture by occupation. Chile&#x27;s labor force places fifty-ninth in the country comparison list according to the CIA World Factbook. Chile currently utilizes 14,015 Hectares of agricultural land. Chilean agriculture includes the cultivation and trade of grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, and beans. Grapes are the largest fruit export product with an export value of $1.76 billion. Non-animal foods, fruit, and vegetable exports total about $11.7 billion. Beef and poultry industries, fish, wool and timber are also included. Animal products have an export value of $5.89 billion. Water heavy industries are causing groundwater, lake, and river depletion in Chile. Illegal water extractions are now becoming common in Chile. Exploiting the country&#x27;s water has been detrimental to the citizens and animals that rely on these sources of water.

=== Climate and weather ===
Located on the west coast of South America, Chile has a total area of 756,102 km2. There are four climates that separate Chile. One of these climates is the dry climate. This is located the north above Santiago, the Atacama Desert has temperatures of up to 90 °F. The central part of Chile has a warmer climate that reaches up to 82.4 °F. The inner region of Chile has a snow climate. South of Chile there is a wet climate because of the Mediterranean coastline this leading the wet season to range from May to August. Summer in Chile lasts from December through February. Winter lasts from June through August with low temperatures up to -2 °C.

===Land use===
As of 2011, Chile allocates 21.1% of its land to agriculture. Chile&#x27;s allocation percentage is smaller than its neighboring countries Argentina (53.9%) and Bolivia (34.3%), but larger than Peru&#x27;s (18.8%). Of the land Chile devotes to agriculture, only 1.7% is arable land. Chile&#x27;s diverse climate and small area is responsible for such a low percentage. Some desert countries like Egypt have a higher arable land percentage than Chile.

== Economic geography ==
Chile maintains a market-oriented economy with high levels of foreign trade compounded by strong financial institutions. These factors have given Chile the highest sovereign bond rating in South America. Chile is committed to trade liberalization and has 26 trade agreements covering 60 countries. In May 2010 Chile became the first South American member of OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Chile&#x27;s top 3 importing partners are China, the United States, and Brazil. In November 2005, Chile and China signed the China-Chile Free Trade Agreement. More than 90% of Chile&#x27;s imports enter China duty-free.
The United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement began in 2004. Since 2015, 100% of U.S. imports have been entering Chile duty-free. Consumer and Industrial export products enter Chile duty-free as well. Since 2017, Chile and Brazil have been negotiating a trade deal that&#x27;s on track to be signed by the end of 2018. Chile&#x27;s top three exporting partners are China, the United States, and Japan. Chile and Japan were previously in Economic Partnership Agreements. In 2018, Chile and Japan were among the eleven nations that signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This trade pact aims to reduce tariffs, enforce environmental standards and remove barrier regulations.

==Districts==
Anguilla is divided into fourteen districts:


==Climate==
Anguilla features a tropical wet and dry climate under the Köppen climate classification. The island has a rather dry climate, moderated by northeast trade winds. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. Average daily maxima range from about in December to in July. With no mountains to slow or trap clouds, rainfall is erratic, averaging about per year, the wettest months being September and October, and the driest February and March. Anguilla is vulnerable to hurricanes from June to November, peak season August to mid-October.
The island suffered damage from Hurricane Luis in 1995, severe flooding of from Hurricane Lenny in 1999 and severe damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017, which remains the most powerful hurricane to hit the island.

==Vegetation==
Anguilla&#x27;s coral and limestone terrain provide no subsistence possibilities for forests, woodland, pastures, crops, or arable lands. Its dry climate and thin soil hamper commercial agricultural development. In Anguilla forest cover is around 61% of the total land area, equivalent to 5,500 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, which was unchanged from 1990.

<doc id="67325" wikidata="Q5333626" url="?curid=67325" title="Economy of Anguilla">
<text>The economy of Anguilla depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and remittances from emigrants. Due to its small size, few natural resources, and reliance on tourism and foreign direct investment, Anguilla is vulnerable to external economic conditions in the United States, Canada and Europe. Therefore, economic growth in Anguilla can be very volatile. Anguilla&#x27;s currency is the East Caribbean dollar, though the US dollar is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.70.

==History==
In the 19th century, Anguilla&#x27;s major product was salt produced by evaporation on the shores of the island&#x27;s lakes, which was exported to the United States. Sugar, cotton, sweetcorn, and tobacco were also grown. By the beginning of World War I, the island had been almost entirely deforested by charcoal-burners. Most of the land was held by black sustenance farmers producing sweet potatoes, peas, beans, and corn and rearing sheep and goats. Salt continued to be exported to nearby Saint Thomas, along with phosphate of lime and cattle.

Modern Anguilla has focused its development on tourism, its related construction industry, and offshore finance. The first comprehensive financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994. 

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of Hurricane Luis in September. Hotels were hit particularly hard but a recovery occurred the following year. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of Hurricane Lenny in 2000. Before the 2008 worldwide crisis, the economy of Anguilla was growing strongly, especially the tourism sector, which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies. Anguilla&#x27;s tourism industry received a major boost when it was selected to host the World Travel Awards in December 2014. Known as &quot;the Oscars of the travel industry&quot;, the awards ceremony was held at the CuisinArt Resort and Spa and was hosted by Vivica A. Fox. Anguilla was voted the World&#x27;s Leading Luxury Island Destination from a short list of top-tier candidates such as St. Barts, the Maldives, and Mauritius. The economy, including the tourism sector, suffered its biggest setback in late 2017 due to the effects of Hurricane Irma in September, which was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island and which caused major material damage of $320 million. A lot of infrastructure was damaged, which was repaired in 2018/19 and the economy began to recover in 2019. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/21, caused a setback in the economy.

Anguilla&#x27;s financial system comprises seven banks, two money services businesses, more than 40 company managers, more than 50 insurers, 12 brokers, more than 250 captive intermediaries, more than 50 mutual funds, and eight trust companies. In 2013, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, the regulator of Anguilla&#x27;s banks, took control over Anguilla&#x27;s indigenous banks and in 2016, fleeced the foreign depositors in order to prop up Anguilla&#x27;s banking system and make local depositors whole.

Anguilla has become a popular tax haven, having no capital gains, estate, profit, sales, or corporate taxes. In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% &quot;Interim Stabilisation Levy&quot;, Anguilla&#x27;s first form of income tax. Anguilla also has a 0.75% property tax.

Anguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from solar power to become less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory&#x27;s legislation, so that it can integrate renewables into its grid. Barbados has also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other Small Island Developing States are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. &quot;For a small island we&#x27;re very far ahead,&quot; said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. &quot;We&#x27;ve got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focusing efforts on the question of sustainable energy supply for several years now. As a result, we have a lot of information we can share with other islands.&quot;

According to a Bloomberg report, due to a skyrocketing interest in artificial intelligence, Anguilla was expected to profit in 2023 from a surge in demand for web addresses ending with the country&#x27;s top-level domain .ai. The total number of registrations of .ai domain names had already doubled in 2022, and according to Vince Cate, who has managed the top-level domain, Anguilla will bring in as much as $30 million in domain-registration fees for 2023.

==Industry==

Major industries in Anguilla include tourism, boat building, and offshore financial services. In 1997 there was an industrial production growth rate of 3.1%.

42.6 GWh of electricity are consumed, produced entirely by fossil fuel.

Agricultural products include small quantities of tobacco, vegetables, and cattle raising.

In 2011 Anguilla became the fifth-largest jurisdiction for captive insurance, behind Bermuda, Cayman, Vermont and Guernsey. The captive industry plays an ever-increasing and important part of Anguilla&#x27;s financial services industry. Captive management firms, including Capstone Associated Services, have staffed offices in Anguilla in order to service the fast-growing captive insurance industry.

<text>Diego Portales University (, UDP) is one of the first private universities founded in Chile and is named after the Chilean statesman Diego Portales.

UDP has campuses in the Barrio Universitario de Santiago and Huechuraba.

== History ==

Universidad Diego Portales (UDP) was founded in 1982. It was an initiative of the founders of the Professional Institute of Sales and Advertising (IPEVE) which at that time had been in existence for almost 20 years (1963).

In 1983, the university embarked on its academic programme with the creation of three faculties: the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Administrative Sciences, and the Faculty of Psychology. In 1989, two new faculties were created: the Faculty of Information and Communications and the Faculty of Engineering Sciences.

In 1991, the university decided to undergo the process of national accreditation with the aim of attaining the status of Autonomous University.

On March 18, 1993, the Superior Council for Education in plenary session ratified Universidad Diego Portales as successfully fulfilling its institution mission, for which it was designated as having “Full Institutional Autonomy”, authorized to bestow all categories of academic degree and title independently. Since 1993, the university has embarked on consolidation and growth in its academic programme.

In 1994, degree courses in Advertising and Design were transferred from IPEVE to Universidad Diego Portales, and the Bachelor of Arts degree programme was introduced. In 1999, the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Fine Arts was created and the Faculty of Humanities founded.

In 2002, Universidad Diego Portales took a step in its growth with the creation of new programs and its incursion into two new fields of knowledge: Health and Education. UDP that same year designed a plan for long-term infrastructure growth, involving the issue of a Security Bond guaranteed by the World Bank for approximately US$25 million, thus becoming the first educational institution to use this type of financing.

In 2004 Universidad Diego Portales became one of the first private universities to achieve institutional accreditation as a university from the National Undergraduate Accreditation Commission (CNAP) in three areas: Institutional Management, Undergraduate Teaching, and Equipment and Infrastructure.

==Research and knowledge production==

The growing importance of knowledge in the development of nations has led UDP to implement a programme of research and knowledge production oriented towards the search for solutions to national problems of high public impact.

In consequence, the Centre for Juridical Research of the Faculty of Law has made significant contributions towards the Penal Procedures Reform which is being implemented throughout the country; two other centres belonging to the Faculty of Humanities and Education (Cognitive Development Centre) and the Faculty of Communication and Letters (Journalism and Advertising Research Centre, CIPP) are implementing programmes of public interest in the areas of cognitive development, community strengthening and the role of the communications media in society.

Added to the above, the Humanities Institute and the Social Sciences Research Institute have embarked on multidisciplinary research programmes oriented towards relevant national issues, contributing to the national debate on a permanent basis from a rigorous new perspective.

The university is implementing 21 programmes with external financing from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT), the Fund for the Development of Art and Culture (FONDART), the Bicentennial Programme of the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation (MIDEPLAN), the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC), the United Nations Development Programme and the National Council for Narcotics Control (UNDP-CONACE), and the European Commission&#x27;s 6th Marco Programme, in the fields of Education, Psychology, Health, Law, Social Sciences, Humanities and Engineering. To these must be added the over 25 research projects that are financed internally.

Moreover, members of the academic staff have published more than 50 articles in ISI-indexed publications from 2005 to June 2006.

An Astronomy &quot;Nucleus&quot; was formed in 2013, being part of the Faculty of Engineering and Sciences. It performs research in areas ranging from protoplanetary disks and extrasolar planets to supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and high redshift galaxies. The group has a strong focus on observational astronomy, performing observations at X-ray, optical, infrared, and submillimiter/radio wavelengths. Its research programs utilize the world-class telescopes located in the north of Chile as well as space-based observatories.

<text>The geography of Argentina is heavily diverse, consisting of the Andes Mountains, pampas, and various rivers and lakes. Bordered by the Andes in the west and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, its neighbouring countries are Chile to the west, Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, and Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast.

In terms of area, Argentina is the second largest country in South America after Brazil, and the eighth largest country in the world. Its total area is . Argentina claims a section of Antarctica (Argentine Antarctica) that is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. Argentina also asserts claims to several British South Atlantic islands.

With a population of 46.6 million, Argentina ranks as the world&#x27;s 31st most populous country as of 2010.

==General characteristics==
Argentina is located in the Southern part of South America, being the biggest country in the Southern Cone. It limits with Chile to the west and south, with the Argentina–Chile border being its largest one. Bolivia and Paraguay limit Argentina in the north, the Argentina–Paraguay border is the second largest one. The northern half of Argentina limits with Brazil and Uruguay to the east, and the southern half with the Atlantic Ocean. The Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory, are located to the east of southern Argentina, across the ocean. Argentina is located at a strategic point over the Strait of Magellan, the link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 

Argentina has a land area of 2,780,400 km². It is the 8th largest country in the world, between India and Kazakhstan. It is the second largest country in South America, after Brazil, and the fourth largest in the Americas after Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The surface is almost eight times that of Germany, and four times that of Texas, and three-tenths the size of the United States. The Argentine Sea, the maritime claims of Argentina, include an exclusive economic zone of 200 nm.

The terrain is composed of plains to the East, with the Andes mountain range at the western border. Climate is mostly temperate, with an arid area at southeast Patagonia and subantartic climate at the southwest. The Iguazu Falls, one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature, is the largest waterfall system in the world. It is located at the frontier with Brazil, with both countries having part of it. 

As for the national extreme points, the northernmost point is the confluence of the Grande de San Juan river and the Mojinete river, at the Jujuy Province. The southernmost point is the Cape San Pío at the Tierra del Fuego Province, at the entry point of the Beagle Channel. The westernmost point is located at the Los Glaciares National Park, at the Santa Cruz Province. The easternmost point is the &quot;Hito V&quot; (CONALI), located at Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones. The highest point of Argentina is the Aconcagua mountain at the Mendoza Province, with 6962 m., which is also the highest point of South America. The lowest point is Laguna del Carbón, at the Santa Cruz Province.

In Argentina forest cover is around 10% of the total land area, equivalent to 28,573,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 35,204,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 27,137,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 1,436,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 7% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 0% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 4% private ownership and 96% with ownership listed as other or unknown.

==Regions==

The Cuyo region is located in the middle-west of the country. It comprises the west of Catamarca and La Rioja, most of San Juan, and the center and north of Mendoza. It limits to the Argentine Northwest to the north, Chile to the west, the Pampas to the east, and the Patagonia to the south. Most of the region is part of the Andes mountain range. It is divided in the occidental range, whose mountains are largely uniform, and the oriental range, with more varied geographic features. The snow line is located at 5000 m. of altitude. There is a corridor between mountains with rivers and lakes, irrigated by the snow that melts during summer. Most of those rivers become tributaries of the Desaguadero River. The climate is arid, with few rains and even few clouds. There are few native trees, and most vegetation are bushes adapted to the climate. The fauna includes camelids such as guanacos and vicuñas, and vultures like the Andean condor.

The Gran Chaco region is located in the north of the country. It comprises the provinces of Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero and north of Santa Fe. It limits to Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, the Argentine Norwest to the west, the Pampas to the south, and Paraguay and the Mesopotamia to the east. The land is completely flat, which leads to an abundance of swamps and vernal pools. The most important rivers are the Paraguay and Parana, and their tributaries Pilcomayo and Bermejo. The climate is subtropical, with a dry season to the west and without it to the east. There are xerophilous forests.

The Mesopotamia region is located in the east of the country, between the Parana and Uruguay rivers. It comprises the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre Ríos. It limits to Paraguay and Brazil to the north, Gran Chaco and pampas to the west, Brazil and Uruguay to the east, and the pampas to the south. Most of it is a plain, and the rivers end at the Río de la Plata, making the Río de la Plata Basin. 

The Argentine Northwest region comprises the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Catamarca, and La Rioja. It limits to Bolivia to the north, Chile to the west, Cuyo to the south and the Gran Chaco to the east. The region is divided into three subregions, the Puna to the west, valleys in the middle, and hills to the east. The Puna is a high treeless plateau, which continues to the west into the Atacama Desert in Chile. It has characteristic salt pans. There is very little water in that area, mostly in temporary streams. The hills and valleys are wetter, with the rain that comes from the east, and includes rivers such as the Salado and Bermejo. Climate is arid in the Puna and subtropical in the east. 

Argentina&#x27;s provinces are divided in seven zones regarding climate and terrain. From North to South, West to East:
* Argentine Northwest: Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Catamarca, La Rioja
* Gran Chaco: Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero
* Mesopotamia: Misiones, Corrientes, Entre Ríos
* Cuyo: San Juan, Mendoza, San Luis
* The Pampas: Santa Fe, La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Córdoba
* Patagonia: Rio Negro, Neuquén, Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego

===Land use===
* Arable land: 13.9%
* Permanent crops: 0.4%
* Permanent pastures: 39.6%
* Forest: 10.7%
* Other: 35.4% (2020)
* Irrigated land: 23,600 km2 (2020)
* Total renewable water resources: 814 km3/yr

==Mountains and hills==
== Water resources ==
In Argentina, the fluvial net is integrated by many systems of different economic relevance, which could be measured by their amount of flow and navigability. Water flow relevance is based on its potential to be used for irrigation and as a source of energy. Depending on where the water streams drain, rivers and creeks could be classified into three different kinds of watersheds:
* Open or exorheic watersheds: they have exterior drainage (into the sea) - Parana River, Uruguay River, Negro River
* Closed or endorheic watersheds: they have interior drainage - Atuel River, Diamante River, Tunuyan River
* Areic watersheds: they lack of drainage and could be found in the center-west of the chaquenean plain, on the west of the pampean region and in some patagonic areas

On the other hand, lakes and lagoons are permanent accumulations of water over impervious depressions. Their difference is mainly based on their extension and depth. They are very important for stream regulation, as a source of energy, tourist attraction and its ichthyologic wealth. In Argentina, all major lakes are in Patagonia.

===Rivers===
Major rivers in Argentina include the Pilcomayo, Paraguay, Bermejo, Colorado, Río Negro, Salado, Uruguay and the largest river, the Paraná. The latter two flow together before meeting the Atlantic Ocean, forming the estuary of the Río de la Plata. Regionally important rivers are the Atuel and Mendoza in the homonymous province, the Chubut in Patagonia, the Río Grande in Jujuy, and the San Francisco River in Salta.

===Lakes===
There are several large lakes in Argentina, many of them in Patagonia. Among these are lakes Argentino and Viedma in Santa Cruz, Nahuel Huapi in Río Negro and Fagnano in Tierra del Fuego, and Colhué Huapi and Musters in Chubut. Lake Buenos Aires and O&#x27;Higgins/San Martín Lake are shared with Chile. Mar Chiquita, Córdoba, is the largest saltwater lake in the country. There are numerous reservoirs created by dams. Argentina features various hot springs, such as those at Termas de Río Hondo with temperatures between 30 °C and 65 °C.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 3,091 km2 of tidal flats in Argentina, making it the ninth ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.

==Climate==
Argentina is subject to a variety of climates. The north of the country, including latitudes in and below the Tropic of Capricorn, is characterized by very hot, wet summers (which result in a number of swamp lands) with mild drier winters, and is subject to periodic droughts during the winter season.

Central Argentina has hot summers with tornadoes and thunderstorms (in western Argentina producing some of the world&#x27;s largest hail), and cool winters. The southern regions have warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall, especially in mountainous zones. Higher elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions.

==Political geography==
Argentina borders six countries with one, near the Falkland Islands, being a maritime border with the United Kingdom. Its largest and the world&#x27;s second largest international land border is with Chile , which is long. The Argentina–Paraguay border is long.

Strategic importance:
* Location relative to sea lanes between South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans (Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel, Drake Passage)

===Territorial claims===
* Land claims
** Falkland Islands
** South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands
** Argentine Antarctica
**Desert Lake
* Maritime claims on Argentine Sea
** Territorial sea: 
** Contiguous zone: 
** Exclusive economic zone: 
** Continental shelf: or to the edge of the continental margin
** Elevation: 

==National parks==
The National Parks of Argentina make up a network of thirty national parks in Argentina. The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and biotopes, from Baritú National Park on the northern border with Bolivia to Tierra del Fuego National Park in the far south of the continent (see List of national parks of Argentina).

The creation of the National Parks dates back to the 1903 donation of 73 square kilometers of land in the Lake District in the Andes foothills by Francisco Moreno. This formed the nucleus of a larger protected area in Patagonia around San Carlos de Bariloche. In 1934, a law was passed creating the National Parks system, formalizing the protected area as the Nahuel Huapi National Park and creating the Iguazú National Park. The National Park Police Force was born, enforcing the new laws preventing tree-felling and hunting. Their early task was largely to establish national sovereignty over these disputed areas and to protect borders.

Five further national parks were declared in 1937 in Patagonia and the service planned new towns and facilities to promote tourism and education. Six more were declared by 1970.

In 1970 a new law established new categories of protection, so that there now were National Parks, National Monuments, Educational Reserves and Natural Reserves. Three national parks were declared in the 1970s. In 1980, another new law affirmed the status of national parks - this law is still in place. The 1980s saw the service reaching out to local communities and local government to help in the running and development of the national parks. Ten more national parks were created with local co-operation, sometimes at local instigation. In 2000, Mburucuyá and Copo National Parks were declared, and El Leoncito natural reserve was upgraded to a national park.

The headquarters of the National Park Service are in downtown Buenos Aires, on Santa Fe Avenue. A library and information center are open to the public. The administration also covers the national monuments, such as the Petrified Forest, and natural and educational reserves.

<text>The government of Argentina, within the framework of a federal system, is a presidential representative democratic republic. The president of Argentina is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the president. Legislative power is vested in the National Congress. The Judiciary is independent from the Executive and from the Legislature, and is vested in the Supreme Court and the lower national tribunals. From the own government is also called Presidency of the Nation ().

==Executive branch==
The current composition of the executive branch includes solely the president, who is the head of state and is formally given the power over the administration to follow through with the interests of the nation. The president is also the chief of the Argentine Armed Forces.

The president and the vice president are elected through universal suffrage by the nation. The constitutional reform of 1994 introduced a &quot;two-round system&quot;, more popularly known in the country as ballotage, by which the winning presidential ticket has to receive either more than 45% of the overall valid votes, or at least 40% of it and a 10% lead over the runner-up. In any other case, the two leading tickets get to face a second round whose victor will be decided by a simple majority. This mechanism was not necessary in the 1995 election, when it could have first come into use, nor in the ones in 1999, 2007, 2011, and 2019. However, it was instrumental in the selection of Néstor Kirchner in 2003, of Mauricio Macri in 2015, and, most recently, of Javier Milei in 2023.

The cabinet of ministers is appointed by the president, but is not technically part of the executive power. The vice president belongs to the legislative branch, since they also hold the presidency of the senate.

=== Current presidency ===
=== Current ministries ===


==Legislative branch==

The National Congress () constitutes the legislative branch of government. The Congress consists of the Senate (72 seats), presided by the Vice-President of the Nation, and the Chamber of Deputies (257 seats), currently presided by Julián Domínguez, deputy for Buenos Aires province. Senators stay in office for six years, and deputies, for four.

Each of the Provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires elect deputies and senators directly. Deputies are representatives of the whole people of the Nation, while Senators represent their districts. Each district elects a number of deputies roughly proportional to their overall population by proportional representation, and three senators: two for the majority, and one for the first minority. Members of both chambers are allowed indefinite re-elections.

Every two years, each of the 24 electoral districts (the twenty-three Provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) elects one half of their lower chamber representatives. Districts with an odd number of Deputies elect one more or one fewer of them on each election. As for the Senators, the twenty-four districts are divided into three groups consisting of eight districts. Every two years all eight districts of one of those groups elect all their three senators, assigning two of them from the party that obtains the majority, and one from the first minority party. Six years later, the same group of districts will hold its next senatorial elections.

==Judiciary branch==

The Judiciary Branch is composed of federal judges and others with different jurisdictions and of a Supreme Court with nine members (one President, one Vice President, and seven Ministers), appointed by the President with approval of the Senate, who may be deposed by Congress. As of December 2015 there are six vacancies, which then President Kirchner stated she did not intend to fill.

* President of the Supreme Court: Dr. Horacio Rosatti
* Vice-President of the Supreme Court: Dr. Carlos Rosenkrantz
* Minister of the Court: Dr. Juan Carlos Maqueda
* Minister of the Court: Dr. Ricardo Lorenzetti

==Provincial and municipal governments==
Argentina is divided into 23 districts called Provinces and one autonomous district, which hosts the national capital, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (which is conurbated into the province of Buenos Aires). Each of the provinces has its own constitution, laws, authorities, form of government, etc., though these must first and foremost comply with the national constitution and laws.

The government of each province has three branches. The Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. The Executive branch is led by a governor. The Legislative Branch may be organized as a unicameral or a bicameral system, i.e:, with either one or two chambers or houses; currently, eight of the 24 provinces has a bicameral legislature.

Each province, except for Buenos Aires Province, is divided into districts called departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;). Departments are merely administrative divisions; they do not have governing structures or authorities of their own. They are in turn divided into municipalities (cities, towns and villages). Each province has its own naming conventions and government systems for different kinds of municipalities. For example, Córdoba Province has &quot;municipios&quot; (cities) and &quot;comunas&quot; (towns); Santa Fe Province further distinguishes between first- and second- tier &quot;municipios&quot;; Chaco Province refers to every populated center as &quot;municipios&quot;, in three categories.

The Province of Buenos Aires has a different system. Its territory is divided into 134 districts called &quot;partidos&quot;, each of which usually contains several cities and towns.

Regardless of the province, each department/partido has a head town (&quot;cabecera&quot;), often though not necessarily the largest urban center, and in some provinces often named the same as their parent district.

Municipalities are ruled by mayors, usually called Intendant (&quot;intendente&quot;) in the case of cities and towns (the larger categories). A city has a legislative body called the Deliberative Council (&quot;Concejo Deliberante&quot;). The smaller towns have simpler systems, often ruled by commissions presided by a communal president (&quot;presidente communal&quot;) or a similarly named authority.

Buenos Aires city, seat of the National Government, was declared an autonomous city by the 1994 constitutional reform. Its mayor, formerly chosen by the President of the Republic, is now elected by the people, and receives the title of Chief of Government (&quot;Jefe de Gobierno&quot;). Other than that, Buenos Aires, as the provinces, has its own Legislative Branch (a unicameral Legislature) and elect deputies and senators as representatives to the National Congress.

<doc id="67340" wikidata="Q5333468" url="?curid=67340" title="Economic history of Argentina">
<text>The economic history of Argentina is one of the most studied, owing to the &quot;Argentine paradox&quot;. As a country, it had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal relative to other developed economies, which inspired an enormous wealth of literature and diverse analysis on the causes of this relative decline. Since independence from Spain in 1816, the country has defaulted on its debt nine times. Inflation has often risen to the double digits, even as high as 5,000%, resulting in several large currency devaluations.

Argentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture because the country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was among the world&#x27;s ten wealthiest states per capita.

Beginning in the 1930s, the Argentine economy deteriorated notably. The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930 when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina was one of the most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962, the Argentine per capita GDP was higher than that of Austria, Italy, Japan, and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government&#x27;s encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.

The era of import substitution ended in 1976, but at the same time growing government spending, large wage increases, and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship also contributed to the huge foreign debt by the late 1980s which became equivalent to three-fourths of the GNP.

In the early 1990s, the government reined in inflation by implementing a currency board system and introducing a new convertible peso equal in value to the U.S. dollar and privatized numerous state-run companies using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession at the turn of the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso. By 2005 the economy had recovered, but the country again defaulted in 2014 and 2020.

==Colonial economy==
During the colonial period, present-day Argentina offered fewer economic advantages compared to other parts of the Spanish Empire, such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals and did not have established native civilizations to subject to the &quot;encomienda&quot;.

Only two-thirds of its present territory were occupied during the colonial period, while the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau which remains sparsely populated to this day. The agricultural and livestock sector&#x27;s output was principally consumed by the producers themselves and by the small local market. They only became associated with foreign trade towards the end of the 18th century.

The period between the 16th and the end of the 18th century was characterized by the existence of self-sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances, a lack of road, maritime or river communications, and the hazards and hardship of land transport. By the end of the 18th century, a significant national economy came into being as Argentina developed a market in which reciprocal flows of capital, labor, and goods could take place on a significant scale between its different regions, which it had hitherto lacked.

In the colonial period, the territories that now make up Argentina were subject, like the rest of the Spanish territories in the Americas, to legal restrictions regarding how and with whom trade could be conducted. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, trade directly through the port of Buenos Aires, rather than via the official system of fleets out of the port of Lima in modern Perú, was forbidden except through special permission from the Crown. In practice, however, this did not mean that the colonial economy of what is now Argentina was closed to trade.

In addition to trade with Brazil and Guinea, which was legalized in the early seventeenth century, colonial Buenos Aires also conducted trade directly with Spain and other European powers through the so-called &quot;navíos de registro&quot;— ships with royal permission to sail outside the official fleet or Spanish treasure fleet system to conduct specific services, such as transport soldiers. Dutch and Basque merchants in particular played an important role, in partnership, in managing the system of &quot;navíos de registro&quot; to conduct trans-Atlantic trade with Buenos Aires. Even more important than the &quot;navíos&quot; was a system of contraband trade into which the &quot;navíos&quot; were inserted. Thus, in the second half of the seventeenth century an estimated 200 ships entered the port of Buenos Aires without any permission at all, as opposed to 34 &quot;navíos de registro&quot;. On top of this system of largely technically illegal transatlantic trade was the &quot;situado&quot; system of funding from the royal treasury in Potosí, in Upper Peru, which supplied the military garrison in Buenos Aires. In practice, the &quot;situado&quot; funded, through a system of credit, a local economy in Buenos Aires which was itself inserted into the contraband economy.

Argentinian historian Zacarías Moutoukias argues that this system of trade, in which Buenos Aires was linked with the mining economy of the Andes through the &quot;situado&quot; and to cross-Atlantic trade through contraband and the &quot;navíos de registro&quot;, created an integrated political and commercial elite in Buenos Aires, made up of military officers, Crown officials and local merchants, and a political economy in which “corruption”— that is, the violation of royal laws regarding trade— was not an aberration but rather a defining characteristic.  For Moutoukias, “corruption” in this context was simply “the violation of a fixed set of norms that limited the integration of the crown’s representatives with the local oligarchy”— a violation that was tacitly tolerated by the Crown because it was lucrative.

Historians like Milcíades Peña consider this historical period of the Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but a hybrid system result of the interaction of the Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in prehistory.

The Argentine territories, held back by their closed economies, the lack of any activity closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labor and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.

This trade was legally limited to Spain: the Spanish Crown enforced a monopsony which limited supplies and enabled Spanish merchants to mark up prices and increase profits. British and Portuguese merchants broke this monopsony by resorting to contraband trade.

Other scholars reject the label of “feudal” to describe Argentine economy and society during the colonial period. Historian Jeremy Adelman, for example, describes an agrarian economy in the Argentinian interior in which both wage labor and production for the market were quite common during the colonial period. In the seventeenth century, this included the development of textile workshops (&quot;obrajes&quot;), the raising of mules for transport and the hunting of feral cattle herds to produce meat, leather and tallow— all of these economic activities supplied the mining economy of Potosí in the Andes. In the 18th century, the depletion of feral cattle herds led to the development of settled livestock agriculture in the Argentine Littoral as well as in inland regions. The relative lack of extra-economic coercion due to ample access to land on the agrarian frontier, the prevalence of wage labor, the variety of types of land tenure (ownership, tenancy, a spectrum of usufruct rights) as well as a lack of a fixed and hegemonic landed elite all lead Adelman to reject the label of “feudalism” to describe the agrarian economy of what now makes up Argentina during the colonial period.

The British desire to trade with South America grew during the Industrial Revolution and the loss of their 13 colonies in North America during the American Revolution. To achieve their economic objectives, Britain initially launched the British invasions of the Río de la Plata to conquer key cities in Spanish America but they were defeated by the local forces of what is now Argentina and Uruguay not once but twice without the help of Spain. When they allied to Spain during the Napoleonic Wars, they requested the Spanish authorities to open commerce to Britain in return.

The first Argentine historians, such as Bartolomé Mitre, attributed the free trade to &quot;The Representation of the Hacendados&quot; economic report by Mariano Moreno, but is currently considered the result of a general negotiation between Britain and Spain, as reflected in the Apodaca-Canning treaty of 1809. The actions of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in Buenos Aires reflected similar outcomes emanating from the other Spanish cities of South America.

Compared to other parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the development of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.

The colonial livestock ranches were established toward the middle of the 18th century. The pace of growth in the region increased dramatically with the establishment in 1776 of the new Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata with Buenos Aires as its capital, and increased legal trading allowed by the Free Trade Act of 1778, which allowed for &quot;free and protected&quot; trade between Spain and its colonies. This trade system disintegrated during the Napoleonic era, and contraband became common again.

==Post-independence transition==
During the early post-independence period, an important share of Argentina&#x27;s exports came from cattle and sheep production. The livestock-raising economy was based upon the abundance of fertile land in the littoral provinces. Cropping apparently lacked comparative advantage compared to livestock grazing.

Exports rose 4% to 5% annually from 1810 to 1850 and 7% to 8% from 1850 to 1870. This growth was achieved through the extension of the frontier and greater efficiency in livestock production.

As a result of the diversification in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.

Most poor gauchos joined forces with the most powerful caudillos in the vicinity. As the Federalist Party, they opposed the policies implemented by Buenos Aires, and waged the Argentine Civil Wars.

===1810–1829===
After Argentina became independent in 1810, an era in which commerce was controlled by a small group of peninsular merchants came to an end. The Primera Junta, the first government established after the 1810 May Revolution, undertook a protectionist policy until their fall from government.

The First Triumvirate (1811–1812), influenced by Bernardino Rivadavia and Manuel García, instead promoted unrestricted trade with Britain. The Second Triumvirate (1812–1814) and José Gervasio Artigas (who controlled the Liga Federal during the 1815–1820 period) sought to restore the initial protectionist policy, but the Supreme Director restored free trade once more. Thus, the economy of the Río de la Plata became one of the most open economies in the world.

Between 1812 and 1816 divisions developed between a Unitarist faction centred on Buenos Aires and a Federalist faction in the provinces, which eventually led to a series of civil wars that ended with the conquest of Buenos Aires by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820.

Each province had its own money, and the same money had a different value from one province and another, and even among cities in the same province.

The government of Martín Rodríguez (1820–1824) and his minister Bernardino Rivadavia, then Las Heras and finally Rivadavia himself as the first president of Argentina from 1826 to 1827, developed an economic plan deemed as &quot;The happy experience&quot;. This plan increased the British influence in the national politics. It was based on five main pillars: complete free trade and no protectionist policies against British imports, finance with a central bank managed by British investors, absolute control of the port of Buenos Aires as the sole source of income from national customs, British exploitation of the national natural resources, and a Unitarist national organization centred in Buenos Aires. After Rivadavia resigned in 1827, ending the &quot;happy experience&quot;, the federalist Manuel Dorrego assumed power as governor of Buenos Aires, but was soon executed by the unitarist Juan Lavalle during a military coup.

The exports of gold, allowed by the free trade policies, soon depleted the national reserves. This posed a great problem, as gold was the medium of exchange of the local economy. Rivadavia sought to fix it by establishing the &quot;Discount Bank&quot;, a central bank for printing fiat money. Like a number of other central banks worldwide, this bank was not owned by the state, but by private investors, British in this case.
The report of the American John Murray Forbes to John Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States, in 1824 mentioned that Britain had a huge influence in the economic power of the country.

He mentioned that the government in Buenos Aires was so eager to be on good terms with Britain and gain recognition of the declaration of independence that most official institutions (as the Bank) were under British control, and that Britain had similar control over the Argentine economy to that metropole of a colony, without the financial, civil or military costs. Even the lack of an Argentine merchant fleet allowed Britain to manage the maritime trade. Forbes&#x27;s testimony should be appraised in perspective of the contemporary Anglo-American commercial rivalry, In light of the partial nature of the account and of his &quot;jealousy, even antipathy&quot; towards the English in Rio de la Plata.

In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the government borrowed heavily to finance new projects and to pay off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, the government received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers in exchange for a debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.

===1829–1870===

Juan Manuel de Rosas forced Lavalle to leave the province, and the federals ruled Buenos Aires until 1852. Rosas modified a number of policies of the Rivadavian period but maintained others: he set a customs law with protectionist policies, but kept the port under the exclusive control of Buenos Aires and refused to call a constituent assembly.

The customs law set trade barriers to products produced in the country, and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods, together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of the control of the port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre Ríos grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.
In 1838 there was a new currency crisis, and the peso papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the &#x27;law of differential rights&#x27;, benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with Buenos Aires.

The end of the civil wars provided the political and legal stability necessary to assert property rights and cut transaction costs, contributing to the huge inflows of capital and labor resources that built modern Argentina. In 1866 an attempt was made to stabilize the currency, by introducing a system of convertibility, which restricted the monetary authorities to issue paper currency only if it was fully backed by gold or convertible foreign currency. The decades of the 1860s and 1880s experienced the most favorable performance of the economy overall, setting the stage for the so-called Golden Age of Argentine history. Nevertheless, the first years of independence included a difficult economic development. In spite of the new freedom caused by the inauguration of the republic, the country was not economically united: expansion in some parts and decline in other parts. Indeed, people experienced different levels of income and welfare. Therefore, it is unclear whether this period of time (1820–1870) brought an income or welfare improvement.

In the 60 years after the founding of the farming colony at Esperanza in 1856, the base of Argentine agriculture gradually shifted from livestock to crops.

==Export-led boom==
Argentina, which had been insignificant during the first half of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods. A 2018 study describes Argentina as a &quot;super-exporter&quot; during the period 1880–1929 and credits the boom to low trade costs and trade liberalization on one hand and on the other hand to the fact that Argentina &quot;offered a diverse basket of products to the different European and American countries that consumed them&quot;. The study concludes &quot;that Argentina took advantage of a multilateral and open economic system.&quot;

During the second half of the 19th century, there was an intense process of colonization of the territory in the form of latifundia. Until 1875 wheat was imported as it was not grown in sufficient quantities to supply local demand; by 1903 the country supplied all its own needs and exported of wheat, enough to sustain 16,000,000 people.

In the 1870s real wages in Argentina were around 76% relative to Britain, rising to 96% in the first decade of the 20th century. GDP per capita rose from 35% of the United States average in 1880 to about 80% in 1905, similar to that of France, Germany and Canada.

===1870–1890===

In 1870, during Domingo Faustino Sarmiento&#x27;s presidency, total debt amounted to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president after winning the 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina&#x27;s first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions needed to get the debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda&#x27;s administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much more manageable economic environment.
In 1881, a currency reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.

The profitability of the agricultural sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual rate of growth of exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification.

The first Argentine railway, a road, had been built in 1854. By 1885, a total of of railways were open for traffic. The new railways brought livestock to Buenos Aires from the vast pampas, for slaughter and processing in the (mainly English) meat-packing plants, and then for shipment around the world. Some contemporary analysts lamented the export bias of the network configuration, while opposing the &quot;monopoly&quot; of private British companies on nationalist grounds. Others have since argued that the initial layout of the system was mostly shaped by domestic interests, and that it was not, in fact, strictly focused on the port of Buenos Aires.

The scarcity of labor and abundance of land induced a high marginal product of labor. European immigrants (chiefly Italians, Spaniards, French and Germans), tempted by the high wages, arrived in droves. The government subsidized European immigration for a short time in the late 1880s, but immigrants arrived in massive numbers even with no subsidy.

===Baring crisis to World War I===

Juárez Celman&#x27;s administration saw a substantial increase in the ratio of debt to GDP toward the end of his tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman&#x27;s government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies program, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.

Celman&#x27;s successor, Carlos Pellegrini, laid the foundations for a return to stability and growth after the restoration of convertibility in 1899. He also reformed the banking sector in ways that were to restore stability in the medium term. Rapid growth rates soon returned: in the period 1903–1913, GDP increased at an annual rate of 7.7%, and industry grew even faster, jumping by 9.6%. By 1906, Argentina had cleared the last remnants of the 1890 default and a year later the country re-entered the international bond markets.

All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal instability was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 played a crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labor force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country&#x27;s income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy&#x27;s or Spain&#x27;s. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world&#x27;s monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world&#x27;s economic output.

==Interwar period==
===1914–1929===

Argentina, like many other countries, entered into a recession following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States during the war and would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.

As a consequence, investable funds became increasingly concentrated in a single institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to rent-seeking. Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets was a result of crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot&#x27;s principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.

However, unlike its neighbors, Argentina became capable of still having relatively healthy growth rates during the 1920s, not being as affected by the worldwide collapse of commodity prices as Brazil and Chile were. For instance, during the 1920s, automobile ownership per capita in Argentina was the highest in the Southern Hemisphere, and grew to become the 4th highest in the world, at a level similar to that of France.

For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina was not an industrialized country by the standards of Britain, Germany or the United States. In the structure of its economy and its role as a commodity exporter, it has been compared to Canada and Australia during this period, in the framework of the Staple Theory. A major hindrance to full industrialization was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.

Exports of frozen beef, especially to Great Britain, proved highly profitable after the invention of refrigerated ships in the 1870s. However Britain imposed new restrictions on meat imports in the late 1920s, which sharply reduced beef imports from Argentina. Ranchers responded by switching from livestock to crop production, but there was lasting damage to the Argentine economy.

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression had a comparatively mild effect on Argentina: the unemployment rate never went above 10%, and the country largely recovered by 1935. However, the Depression permanently halted its economic expansion. Actually, much like other agricultural exporters, the economy was already in a downturn beginning in 1927, a result of declining prices.

Argentina abandoned the gold standard in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso&#x27;s value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw the value of its exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.

In response to the Great Depression, successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self-sufficient in industry as well as agriculture. The strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised. The import-substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century, but the Great Depression intensified it. The government&#x27;s encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture, and agricultural production fell dramatically.

In 1930, the armed forces forced the Radicals from power and improved economic conditions, but political turbulence intensified. In 1932, Argentina required immigrants to have a labor contract prior to arrival, or proof of financial means of support. The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a quota of the British market for exports of its primary products, but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs and the effects of deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain.

Unemployment resulting from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed. The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed to the process of internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns to the cities, especially Buenos Aires, where there were greater opportunities for employment. The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections. Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish. 

In 1940, Finance Minister Federico Pinedo proposed an economic plan to seek closer ties to the United States and encourage industrial exports to replace the slowing agricultural exports as the engine for the nation&#x27;s growth, but it was never fully implemented due to a lack of political consensus, owing to the illness and resignation of President Ortiz and the political turmoil of those years. Some economic historians lament the lack of follow-through on this plan and the subsequent focus on the internal market instead, as a critical mistake. Nevertheless, industrial exports did see some growth during this period, as non-traditional manufactured goods grew from a share of 2.9% of total exports in 1939, to 19.4% by 1943.

==Import substitution industrialization Era==
===First Peronist period: Nationalization===


After the 1943 Argentine coup d&#x27;état, Juan Perón, a member of the United Officers Group that engineered the plot, became Minister of Labor. Campaigning among workers with promises of land, higher wages, and social security, he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections. Under Perón, the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation of Labor. Perón turned Argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources. During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.

Early Peronism was a period of macroeconomic shocks during which a strategy of import substitution industrialization was put into practice. Bilateral trade, exchange control and multiple exchange rates were its most important characteristics. Beginning in 1947, Perón took a leftward shift after breaking up with the &quot;Catholic nationalism&quot; movement, which led to gradual state control of the economy, reflected in the increase in state-owned property, interventionism (including control of rents and prices) and higher levels of public investment, mainly financed by the inflationary tax. The expansive macroeconomic policy, which aimed at the redistribution of wealth and the increase of spending to finance populist policies, led to inflation.

Wartime reserves enabled the Peronist government to fully pay off the external debt in 1952; by the end of the year, Argentina became a net creditor to the tune of US$5 billion. Between 1946 and 1948, the French and British-owned railways were nationalized, and the existing networks were expanded, with the rail network reaching 120,000 kilometers by 1954. The government also established the IAPI to control the foreign trade in export commodities. Perón erected a system of almost complete protection against imports, largely cutting off Argentina from the international market. In 1947, he announced his first Five-Year Plan based on growth of nationalized industries. Protectionism also created a domestically oriented industry with high production costs, incapable of competing in international markets. At the same time, output of beef and grain, the country&#x27;s main export goods, stagnated. The IAPI began shortchanging growers and, when world grain prices dropped in the late 1940s, it stifled agricultural production, exports and business sentiment, in general. Despite these shortcomings, protectionism and government credits did allow an exponential growth of the internal market: radio sales increased 600% and fridge sales grew 218%, among others.

During the first Five-Year Plan, various public works and programs were executed, with the aim to modernize the country&#x27;s infrastructure. For example, a total of 22 hydroelectric power plants were erected, increasing electrical output from 45,000 kVA in 1943 to 350,000 kVA in 1952. Between 1947 and 1949, a network of gas pipelines, which linked Comodoro Rivadavia with Buenos Aires, was built. The gas distribution reached 15 million m³, reducing costs by a third.

During this period Argentina&#x27;s economy continued to grow, on average, but more slowly than the world as a whole or than its neighbors, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina&#x27;s GDP per capita accounted fell to less than half of that of the United States.

Perón&#x27;s second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favored increased agricultural output over industrialization, but industrial growth and high wages in previous years had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as the majority of those who worked in agriculture labored on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón&#x27;s second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country&#x27;s comparative advantage in agriculture.

===Post-Peron era and the 1960s===
In the 1950s and part of the 1960s, the country had a slow rate of growth in line with most Latin American countries, while most of the rest of the world enjoyed a golden era. Stagnation prevailed during this period, and the economy often found itself contracting, mostly the result of union strife.

Wage growth beginning in 1950 pushed prices up. The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell. High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy, a cut in public expenditures, and increases in taxes and utility prices. Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed became one of the leading causes for Perón&#x27;s downfall in the Revolución Libertadora of 1955, as the working classes saw their quality of life diminished, thus stripping Perón from a large part of his popular support.

Arturo Frondizi won the 1958 presidential election in a landslide. In the same year he announced the beginning of the &quot;oil battle&quot;: a new attempt at import substitution which aimed to achieve self-sufficiency in oil production by signing several contract with foreign companies for the mining and exploitation of oil. In 1960, Argentina joined the Latin American Free Trade Association.

Another coup in June 1966, the so-called Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena to head the Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit to the private sector.
Krieger&#x27;s tenure witnessed increased concentration and centralization of capital, coupled with privatization of many important sectors of the economy. The international financial community offered strong support for this program, and economic growth continued. GDP expanded at an average annual rate of 5.2% between 1966 and 1970, compared to 3.2% during the 1950s.

After 1966, in a radical departure from past policies, the Ministry of Economy announced a program to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation program focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from an annual rate of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.

A gradual reversal in trade policy culminated in the military announcing import substitution as a failed experiment, lifting protectionist barriers and opening the economy to the world market. This new policy boosted some exports, but an overvalued currency meant certain imports were so cheap that local industry declined, and many exports were priced out of the market. The Ministry of Economy put an end to the exchange rate policy of previous governments. The currency underwent a 30% devaluation. In 1970, the &quot;peso moneda nacional&quot; (one of the longest-lived currencies in the region) was replaced by the &quot;peso ley&quot; [shortened form of &quot;peso ley 18188&quot;] (100 to 1).

In May 1969, discontent with Krieger&#x27;s economic policies led to riots in the cities of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, and with it the standard of living. Perón&#x27;s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.

== Deindustrialization (1975–2002)==
=== Stagnation (1975–1990) === 
Between 1975 and 1990, real per capita income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of economic development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The share of manufacturing as a percentage of GDP at the start of the 1990s had receded to similar levels than in the 1940s.

In the early 1970s, per capita income in Argentina was twice as high as in Mexico and more than three times as high as in Chile and Brazil. By 1990, the difference in income between Argentina and the other Latin American countries was much smaller. Starting with the Rodrigazo in 1975, inflation accelerated sharply, reaching an average of more than 300% per year from 1975 to 1991, increasing prices 20 billion times.

When the military dictatorship finance minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz assumed power, inflation was equivalent to an annual rate of 5000%, and output had declined sharply. In 1976, the era of import substitution was ended, and the government lowered import barriers, liberalized restrictions on foreign borrowing, and supported the peso against foreign currencies. That exposed the fact that domestic firms could not compete with foreign imports because of the overvalued currency and long-term structural problems. A financial reform was implemented that aimed both to liberalize capital markets and to link Argentina more effectively with the world capital market.

After the relatively stable years of 1976 to 1978, fiscal deficits started to climb again, and the external debt tripled in three years. The increased debt burden interrupted industrial development and upward social mobility. From 1978, the rate of exchange depreciation was fixed with a &quot;tablita&quot;, an active crawling peg that was based on a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of depreciation. The announcements were repeated on a rolling basis to create an environment in which economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation. Inflation gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100%. In 1978 and 1979, the real exchange rate appreciated because inflation consistently outpaced the rate of depreciation. The overvaluation ultimately led to capital flight and a financial collapse.

Growing government spending, large wage raises, and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s, when it briefly exceeded an annual rate of 1000%. Successive regimes tried to control inflation by wage and price controls, cuts in public spending, and restriction of the money supply. Efforts to stem the problems came to naught when in 1982 Argentina came into armed conflict with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.

In August 1982, after Mexico had announced its inability to service its debt, Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance, as it too was in serious difficulties. While developments looked positive for a while, an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems, particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both the budget and external competitiveness, and the program failed. With the peso quickly losing value to inflation, the new Argentine peso argentino was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.

In December 1983, Raúl Alfonsín was elected President of Argentina, bringing an end to the military dictatorship. Under Alfonsin, negotiations started on a new program with the IMF, but they led to nothing. In March 1984, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela lent Argentina $300 million for three months, followed by a similar amount by the United States. That provided some breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an agreement was reached between the IMF and Argentina.

In 1985, the Argentine austral replaced the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina failed to pay the debt for several months, and the debt was renegotiated with the creditor banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as fiscal policy was undermined by large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again falling out of compliance with an IMF program. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.

The next move by the authorities was to launch the Primavera Plan in August 1988, a package of economically heterodox measures that foresaw little fiscal adjustment. The IMF refused to resume lending to Argentina. Six months after its introduction, the plan collapsed, leading to hyperinflation and riots.

=== Convertibility Plan (1991–2002) ===

The Peronist Carlos Menem was elected president in May 1989. He immediately announced a new shock program, this time with more fiscal adjustment in view of a government deficit of 16% of GDP. In November 1989 agreement was reached on yet another standby with the IMF, but again the arrangement was ended prematurely, followed by another bout of hyper-inflation, which reached 12,000% per year.

After the collapse of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatization became strongly popular. Menem privatized almost everything the state owned, except for a couple of banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatization, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatization the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernized farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outflows of employees. In addition, the process of privatization was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatized enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their prices on long-term contracts were indexed to American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.

In 1991, economy minister Domingo Cavallo set out to reverse Argentina&#x27;s decline through free-market reforms such as open trade. On 1 January 1992, a monetary reform replaced the austral with the peso at a rate of 10,000 australs for 1 peso. The cornerstone of the reform process was a currency board, under which the peso was fixed by law at par to the dollar, and the money supply restricted to the level of hard-currency reserves. This was a risky policy which meant at a later stage Argentina could not devalue. After a lag, inflation was tamed. With risk of devaluation apparently removed, capital poured in from abroad. GDP growth increased significantly and total employment rose steadily until mid-1993. During the second half of 1994, the economy slowed down and unemployment increased from 10% to 12.2%.

Although the economy was already in a mild recession at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labor force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, at the beginning of 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.

Exports grew from $12 billion in 1991 to $27 billion in 2001, but many industries could not compete abroad, especially after Brazil&#x27;s devaluation. The strong, fixed exchange rate turned the trade balance to a cumulative US$22 billion in deficits between 1992 and 1999. Unable to devalue, Argentina could only become more competitive if prices fell. Deflation came from recession, falling wages and rising unemployment. Interest rates remained high, with banks lending dollars at 25%.

The share of public spending in GDP increased from 27% in 1995 to 30% in 2000. Some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient industries, such as sugar, which could not compete when international trade was opened. To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on an old-age pension reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions.

==Economic crisis (1998–2002)==
Argentina fell into a deep recession in the second half of 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina&#x27;s sluggish GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.

In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking assistance from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina rapidly lost credit in capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, the de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to the complete loss of market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine sovereign debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.

In December 2001, a series of deposit runs began to destabilize the banking system, leading the Argentine authorities to impose a partial withdrawal freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the currency convertibility regime.

The ensuing economic and political crisis was arguably the worst since the country&#x27;s independence. By the end of 2002, the economy had contracted by 20% since 1998. Over the course of two years, output fell by more than 15%, the Argentine peso lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment exceeded 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from 16.8% in October 1993, to an already high 25.9% in October 1998 (at the beginning of the recession), to 35.4% in October 2001, to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.

Critics of the policy of economic liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina&#x27;s economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF&#x27;s Independent Evaluation Office criticized the IMF&#x27;s conduct prior to Argentina&#x27;s economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country&#x27;s fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.

==Kirchnerism and relative growth (2003–2015)==

In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was appointed president, the fifth in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing recovery, having stabilized prices and the exchange rate to head off hyperinflation. After the default in 2001, growth reached over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was in part due to a commodity price boom, and also because the government managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.

=== Kirchner administration ===

Néstor Kirchner became president in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans, soybean oil, and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina&#x27;s export revenue, triple the joint share of the traditional exports of beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government&#x27;s total tax receipts, around two-thirds from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes discouraged foreign investment, while high spending pushed inflation over 20%.

An attempt by the Kirchner administration to impose price controls in 2005 failed, as many items went out of stock and the mandatory prices were often ignored. Various sectors of the economy were re-nationalized, including the postal service (2003), the San Martín Railway line (2004), the water utility serving the Province of Buenos Aires (2006) and Aerolíneas Argentinas (2009).

In December 2005, Kirchner decided to liquidate the Argentine debt to the IMF in a single payment, without refinancing, for a total of $9.8 billion. The payment was partly financed by a US$1.6 billion loan from Venezuela. As of mid-2008 Venezuela holds an estimated US$6 billion in Argentine debt. In 2006, Argentina re-entered international debt markets selling US$500 million of its Bonar V five-year dollar denominated bonds, with a yield of 8.36%, mostly to foreign banks, and Moody&#x27;s boosted Argentina&#x27;s debt rating from B− to B.

In early 2007 the administration began interfering with inflation estimates.

=== Fernández administration ===
On December 10, 2007, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner became president. In 2008 the rural sector mobilized against a resolution that would have increased the tax rate on soybean exports from 35% to 44.1%. Ultimately, the new taxation regime was abandoned. Official Argentine statistics are believed to have significantly underreported inflation since 2007, and independent economists publishing their own estimates of Argentine inflation have been threatened with fines and prosecution.

In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalized private pension funds worth almost $30 billion, ostensibly to protect the pensions against falling stock prices around the world, although critics said the government simply wanted to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 1998–2002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds&#x27; beneficiaries.

The late-2000s recession hit the country in 2009 with GDP growth slowing to 0.8%. High GDP growth resumed in 2010, and the economy expanded by 8.5%. In April 2010, Economy Minister Amado Boudou prepared a debt swap package for the holders of over US$18 billion in bonds who did not participate in the 2005 Argentine debt restructuring. In late 2010, the largest new natural gas deposits in 35 years were discovered in Neuquén Province. The unemployment rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 7.3%.

In November 2011, the government laid a plan to cut utilities subsidies to higher income households. By mid-2011, credit was outpacing GDP by a wide margin, raising concerns that the economy was overheating. Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012. In April 2012, the government announced plans to expropriate YPF, despite the opposition of some energy experts, claiming that YPF&#x27;s Spanish partner and major holder, Repsol, had not done its duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation, as well as being a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF&#x27;s economic growth.

Rising inflation and capital flight caused a rapid depletion of the country&#x27;s dollar reserves, prompting the government to severely curtail access to dollars in June 2012. The imposition of capital controls, in turn, led to the emergence of a black market for dollars, known as the &quot;dólar blue&quot;, at higher rates than the official exchange rate.

By May 2014, private forecasts estimated annual inflation at 39.9%, one of the highest rates in the world. In July 2014, a ruling from a New York court ordered the country to pay the remaining holders of the bonds defaulted in 2001, which by then were mostly American Vulture funds, before it paid any of its exchange bondholders. The Argentine government refused, causing the country to default on its debt again.

== Economic problems since 2016 ==
=== Presidency of Mauricio Macri ===

On December 17, 2015, Macri lifted foreign exchange restrictions, leading to a 30% devaluation of the Peso, the largest since 2002. In January 2016 it was devalued to 44 cents. Unemployment reached double digits as, with massive layoffs in the public and private sectors.

In April 2016, monthly inflation rose to 6.7%, the highest since 2002, according to the indicator, with annual inflation reaching 41.7%, one of the highest in the world. Another estimate said that inflation reached 37.4%, the fiscal deficit 4.8%, and predicted GDP would fall by 1.9%. In December 2015, the government announced the elimination of export restrictions for wheat, maize and meat, while reducing withholding taxes on soybeans to 30% at a fiscal cost of 23,604 million pesos. This led to large price increases in staple products including oil, which increased by 51%, flour 110%, chicken 90%, noodles 78%, and a 50% increase in the price of meat in two weeks. Because of a 150-180% increase in feed prices, many pig producers were in crisis. It is estimated that in the province of Buenos Aires alone, 40 thousand pork producers would fail.

One of Macri&#x27;s promises during the 2015 campaign was the elimination of Income tax for workers, saying &quot;During my government workers will not pay tax on profits&quot;. The Minister of the Economy and Public Finances, Alfonso Prat-Gay said that the draft amendments to the income tax would be sent to Congress for treatment on March 1, 2016. , Macri had not fulfilled his promise, and it was not in the government&#x27;s plan to eliminate the Income tax in the future either.

An extremely high inflation rate was strangling the urban and rural working population: decreasing from the astounding 40% of 2016, it was expected to be 17% by 2018. Other vulnerabilities include an unemployment rate close to 9% (expected to be in two digits in the next two years), as well as the sharp rise in the current-account deficit around 3% to 4% of GDP in 2017–2018 thanks to an over-valued currency. Forecasts from the IMF show GDP growth in 2018 decelerating to 2.5% from 2.75%, and clearly any halting of the cyclical upswing in the global economy would set the country back.

=== Presidency of Alberto Fernández === 

In 2019 the inflation was considered the highest in 28 years according to the index, ascending to 53.8%. To the cause of the quarantine in 2020, in April, 143,000 SMEs will not be able to pay salaries and fixed expenses for the month, even with government assistance, so they will have to borrow or increase their capital contribution, and approximately 35,000 companies consider closing their business. even so, the president remains firm in his decision to maintain the state of total quarantine. Despite cuts in the payment chain, some project 180 total days and calculate 5% of companies that fell in May. In 2023, the rate of inflation in Argentina surpassed 100% for the first time since the early 1990s.

=== Presidency of Javier Milei ===

On 10 December 2023, Javier Milei, a right-wing libertarian, was sworn in as new president of Argentina. During the electoral campaign, inflation was at over 100 percent. At the time of Milei&#x27;s inauguration in December 2023, Argentina’s economy was suffering 143 percent annual inflation, the currency had plunged and four out of 10 Argentines were in poverty.

In January 2024, a study by the Catholic University of Argentina estimated that the country&#x27;s poverty rate had reached 57.4%, the highest poverty rate in the country since 2004. However, by the third quarter of 2024 the Catholic University of Argentina estimated that the poverty rate had eased to 49.9% of the population, while Torcuato Di Tella University estimated that poverty stood at 36.8% of the population for the second semester of the year.

In November 2024, Argentina&#x27;s monthly inflation rate slowed to 2.4%, the lowest in over four years. Annual inflation was expected to end 2024 closer to 100%. Favourable results and normalization in Argentina’s economy are expected to continue in 2025. The annual inflation rate, which was 211% in 2023, is expected to be below 30% in 2025. Economic activity has also begun to recover after the severe recession at the beginning of 2024. The economy is expected to expand by more than 4% in 2025.

==Argentine paradox==

The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan, and Argentina.

According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), the main difference between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the smaller number of landowners each with larger areas of land in Argentina.

Duncan and Fogarty (1984) argued that the key difference lies in the contrast between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia&#x27;s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labor.

Taylor (1992) pointed out that the relatively high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by the relatively high prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which was caused by the industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favored by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labor productivity.

<doc id="67344" wikidata="Q628021" url="?curid=67344" title="Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic">
<text>The Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic () are the combined armed forces of Argentina. It is controlled by the Commander-in-Chief (the President) and a civilian Minister of Defense. In addition to the Army, Navy and Air Force, there are two security forces, controlled by the Ministry of Security, which can be mobilized on occasion of an armed conflict: the National Gendarmerie, a gendarmerie used to guard borders and places of strategic importance; and the Naval Prefecture, a coast guard used to protect internal major rivers and maritime territory.

Traditionally, Argentina maintains close defense cooperation and military-supply relationships with the United States and to a lesser extent, with Israel, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Belarus, Italy, and Russia.

As of 2024, the current Chief of the General Staff is the Air Force Brigadier General Xavier Isaac.

==History==
The oldest forces of the Argentinian military are the Argentinian Army and the Argentinian Navy, both created in 1810, during the Argentine War of Independence, while the Argentinian Air Force was established in 1945. The Argentine military played a role in the institutional life of the country, during a series of coups d&#x27;état that took place in the 20th century.

=== 1955–1963 internal strife===

After the Revolución Libertadora coup that deposed president Juan Domingo Perón in 1955, the armed forces split into opposing sectors named &quot;Azules y colorados&quot; (&quot;Blues and Reds&quot;). The fight would end in 1963 with military clashes and the defeat of the &quot;reds&quot; who were opposed to Perón.

=== 1965 Operacion 90 ===

In 1965, the Argentine military conducted a 10-man patrol on Antarctica called Operación 90 under then-Colonel Jorge E. Leal to perform scientific observations and promote Argentina&#x27;s claim to a portion of the continent.

=== 1975 Counter-insurgency ===

In 1975 the armed forces started a massive operation in the Tucumán Province to crush the ERP (&quot;Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo&quot; or People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army) guevarist guerrilla group which attempted to create a &quot;revolutionary foco in this remote and mountainous province, in the north-west of Argentina.&quot;

===National Reorganization Process===
The last military dictatorship, the National Reorganization Process, lasted from 1976 to 1983. As Isabel Perón was unable to defeat the terrorist organizations of Montoneros and ERP, the military took power during the 1976 Argentine coup d&#x27;état and exterminated the violent communist guerrillas by random detentions, torture or death. The government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that sympathized with Perón, antagonized the Armed Forces with the justification of the past junta and limited the powers of the armed forced to avoid state terrorism of the past.

====1978 Beagle Conflict====

====1982 Malvinas War====
On 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands, followed shortly afterwards by the invasion of South Georgia. Britain sent a task force to recover the islands. Argentina surrendered on 14 June. The political effect of the surrender lead to protests against the dictatorship, which hastened its downfall.

===1983 transition to democracy===

The democratic government of Raúl Alfonsín that took office in 1983 prosecuted the 1970s crimes and made the unprecedented (and only Latin American example) Trial of the Juntas and soon the Army was rocked by uprisings and internal infighting. Far-right sectors of the Army rebelled in the Carapintadas (&quot;painted faces&quot;) movement. To contain the rebellions, Alfonsín promoted the Full stop law and the Law of due obedience. The following president, Carlos Menem, gave the presidential pardon to the military found guilty in the Trial of the Juntas. It would not be until 1990, when the last military uprising in Argentine history was crushed, that the political conflict within the Army finally subsided.

In January 1989, during the subversive attack on La Tablada, the Army used white phosphorus in a violation of the Geneva Convention (according to a document presented by the human rights commission of the United Nations on January 12, 2001).

=== Gulf War and 1990s ===
Argentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War sending a destroyer and a corvette in first term and a supply ship and another corvette later to participate on the United Nations blockade and sea control effort of the gulf. The success of &quot;Operación Alfil&quot; (English: &quot;Operation Bishop&quot;) as it was known, with more than 700 interceptions and sailed on the operations theatre helped to overcome the so-called &quot;Malvinas syndrome&quot;.

From 1990 to 1992, the Baradero-class patrol boats were deployed under UN mandate ONUCA to the Gulf of Fonseca in Central America. In 1994, the three Drummond-class corvettes participated on Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti.

Also, in the 1990s, Argentine Armed Forces began a close defense cooperation and friendship policy with neighbors Brazil and Chile, with emphasis on fulfillment of United Nations mandates.

The Argentine military have been reduced both in number and budget, but became more professional, especially after conscription was abolished by president Menem. The British embargo due to the Falklands War () was officially eliminated and Argentina was granted Major Non-NATO ally status by United States President Bill Clinton.

=== Present ===

The modern Argentine Armed Forces are committed to international peacekeeping under United Nations mandates, humanitarian aid on emergencies relief and support the country&#x27;s continuous presence at Antarctica.

Democratic governments since 1983 streamlined the military budget and did not approve any large scale equipment purchases. Argentina military spending is one of the lowest of South America and as of 2010, its 0.9% of GDP only exceeds Suriname Within the defence budget itself funding for training and even basic maintenance was significantly cut, a factor contributing to the accidental loss of the Argentine submarine San Juan in 2017. The result has been a steady erosion of Argentine military capabilities, with some arguing that Argentina had, by the end of the 2010s, ceased to be a capable military power.

The small-scale capability modernization that Argentina has attempted has been actively opposed by the United Kingdom. In 2019 the Argentine Air Force and government selected the Korean KAI FA-50 as its interim fighter to replace its aging Falklands-vintage aircraft. However, the deal was cancelled in early 2020 leaving the Air Force without a fighter replacement. British intervention was apparently a key factor in the cancellation with Britain stopping the export of the aircraft incorporating various British components. In October 2020, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) confirmed that since major components of the aircraft were supplied by the U.K., the aircraft could not be exported to Argentina. Britain similarly blocked the potential sale of Brazilian license-built Saab Gripen aircraft to Argentina given avionics that were of British origin.

In 2003, for the first time, the Argentine Navy (classified as a major non-NATO ally) interoperated with a United States Navy battlegroup when destroyer ARA Sarandí (D-13) joined the USS Enterprise Carrier Strike Group and Destroyer Squadron 18 as a part of Exercise Solid Step during their tour in the Mediterranean Sea.

On June 12, 2006, President Néstor Kirchner brought into force the Defense Law, which had been passed in 1988 as a means to modernize the doctrine of the armed forces and define their role. The law states that the armed forces will only be used against foreign aggression, and reduces the powers of the heads of the armed services, centralizing whole operational and acquisitions decisions under the authority of the Armed Forces Joint General Staff (&quot; – EMC&quot; ) emphasizing Jointness.

In 2007, an agreement for cooperation in peace operations was signed with France.

A combined Argentinian-Chilean force for future United Nations Mandates was created. Named Cruz del Sur (), the new force began assembly in 2008 with its headquarters alternating between the two countries each year.

In 2009, UNASUR, the South American countries union, created the CDS ( Spanish: &quot;Consejo de Defensa Sudamericano&quot; (South American Defence council) in order to promote cooperation and transparency between their armed forces

As of 2011, they perform with Chile the PARACACH (Patrulla de Rescate Antártica Combinada Argentina-Chile, Argentine Chilean Antarctic combined search and rescue patrol) with support from the German Space Agency which provided satellite imagery

==Structure==
The three branches of the Argentine Armed Forces are under the direct authority of the Defense Ministry, while the Argentine National Gendarmerie and the Argentine Naval Prefecture, as security forces, under the direct authority of the Ministry of Security.



==International participation==
Argentina was the only South American country to send warships and cargo planes in 1991 to the Gulf War under UN mandate and has remained involved in peacekeeping efforts in multiple locations like UNPROFOR in Croatia/Bosnia, Gulf of Fonseca, UNFICYP in Cyprus (where among Army and Marines troops the Air Force provided the UN Air contingent since 1994) and MINUSTAH in Haiti.

UNFICYP was also a precedent in the Latin American military as troops of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay are embedded in the Argentine contingent

Since 1999 and as of June 2006, Argentina is the only Latin American country to maintain troops in Kosovo during SFOR (and later EUFOR) operations where combat engineers of the Argentine Armed Forces are embedded in an Italian brigade.

In 2007, an Argentine contingent including helicopters, boats and water purification plants was sent to help Bolivia against their worst floods in decades. In 2010 the Armed Forces were also involved in Haiti and Chile humanitarian responses after their respective earthquakes.

Argentine military forces formed part of

*Haiti - UN MINUSTAH video ( Including the Mobile Field Hospital and helicopters )

<text>This article deals with the [[diplomacy|diplomatic affairs]], [[foreign policy]] and [[international relations]] of the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the political level, these matters are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also known as the &quot;Cancillería&quot;, which answers to the President. The current Minister of Foreign Affairs, since December 2023, is Chancellor (es: &quot;Canciller&quot;) Diana Mondino.

== History ==

=== From isolation to nationhood ===
Owing to its geographical remoteness, local authorities in what is today Argentina developed an early sense of autonomy. Based largely on economic needs, during colonial times their pragmatism led to a flourishing unofficial market in smuggled goods, out of the then-small port of Buenos Aires, in blatant contravention of the Spanish mercantilist laws. With the Enlightened despotism of the late-eighteenth-century Bourbon kings and the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776, trade increased as the political importance of the port-city of Buenos Aires soared. The urgency for a complete liberalization of commerce remained a powerful political cause for Criollos and Mestizos, further stimulated by the politically egalitarian and revolutionary ideals spread by the French and Anglo-American revolutions. Ultimately, the actual experience of successfully defending without Spanish aid the viceroyalty from a foreign invader during the 1806–1807 British invasions of the Río de la Plata, triggered a decisive quest for even greater autonomy from the colonial metropolis.

Between 1808 and 1810, the Napoleonic French Empire openly invaded Spain, after deposing King Ferdinand VII and taking him prisoner. A Spanish resistance formed an emergency government, the Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom in order to govern themselves and the Spanish Empire in the absence of Ferdinand VII. But, when the Supreme Central Junta dissolved itself on 29 January 1810, under extreme pressure from Napoleonic forces, most of the main cities of Spanish America refused to acknowledge its successor, a Regency Council, as the legitimate depositary of sovereignty. They proceed to name their own local juntas, as a means to exercise government in the absence of the prisoner king.

On 25 May 1810, a Criollo-led &quot;cabildo abierto&quot; formally assumed the authority from Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. However, the ensuing United Provinces of South America (formed on the basis of the former Viceroyalty) declared itself independent on 9 July 1816, after Ferdinand VII was restored in 1815. During the Independence Wars no sovereign state recognized the United Provinces.

Until the fall of the Royalist stronghold of Lima in 1821, and the Battle of Ayacucho of 1824, territorial integrity was solely sustained by the military brilliance of Generals José de San Martín and Manuel Belgrano, the continuous efforts of northern provinces defenders Martín Miguel de Güemes and Juana Azurduy, among many others. However, during this same period, internecine power conflicts among diverse leaders, and ideological and economical struggles developed between Buenos Aires Province and much of the rest of the United Provinces, with many of the Provinces bonding themselves into a Federal League, inspired by &quot;Federalist&quot; José Gervasio Artigas&#x27; leadership. In practice, each side treated the other&#x27;s grievances as a &quot;foreign policy&quot; matter.

The &quot;Unitarian&quot; Constitution of 1819 was immediately rejected by the provinces, and a state of anarchy ensued following the Battle of Cepeda. The only cause that could regain unity among the hostile factions was the 1825 invasion of what today is Uruguay on the part of Brazilian Empire. Uruguay, then known as the &quot;Province of the Eastern Bank of the Uruguay River&quot;, was considered a somewhat breakaway Province, since Montevideo served as the seat of the Royalist Viceroy Francisco Javier de Elío during its war on the May Revolution; and that, after the independentists victory, the Province became the main stronghold of the Federal League leader José Gervasio Artigas, who waged a long and bitter dispute during the 1810s against the Unitarians about the shape the national organization would have.

The war crisis led to a new Constitution and a first semblance of a united national government, at the same time it represented the first foreign policy crisis of the young nation (known as &quot;República Argentina&quot;, &quot;per&quot; the 1926 Constitution), as it forced the nation into war with Brazil.

The common cause the crisis provided did lead to enough institutional stability to have the British Empire recognize Argentina (as President James Monroe had the U.S. State Department done in 1822) and led to the election of the first President of Argentina. The opportunity for unity, however, was wasted largely because the new President, Bernardino Rivadavia, pushed a new Constitution even more biased towards Buenos Aires&#x27; agenda than the failed 1819 document. The war with Brazil, moreover, went badly. Land battles were won, early on, and despite some heroic feats on the part on Irish-born Admiral Guillermo Brown, the war dragged on, resulting in bankruptcy. This and the hated new constitution led to the end of the first republic by 1828; it also led, however, to peace with Brazil and the formation of an independent Uruguay.

26 September 1828 treaty itself became another foreign policy crisis, as it triggered a violent &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by generals opposed to what they saw as a unilateral surrender. The murder of the man responsible for the treaty, Buenos Aires Governor Manuel Dorrego, itself led to a countercoup that brought with it the promise of a lasting peace; but eventually led to destabilizing consequences.

The countercoup brought in a new governor for the Buenos Aires Province, who would in time become the leading figure of a loose confederation of Argentine Provinces (the so-called Argentine Confederation). Juan Manuel de Rosas made it his mission to stabilize Argentina in a confederacy under the tutelage of Buenos Aires Province. This led to repression, massacres of Native Americans in the Pampas and, in 1838, an international embargo over the case of a French journalist tortured to death at Rosas&#x27; orders. An unyielding Rosas might have let the impasse continue for a decade or more; but, Admiral Guillermo Brown made his talents amenable once again, forcing the French blockade to be lifted in 1841.

Having come to power avenging the murder of a man who had decided to cease interference in Uruguay, Rosas invaded Uruguay upon the 1842 election of a government there antagonistic to his personal commercial interests (mainly centered in the export of cow hides and beef jerky, valuable commodities in those days). Commercially close with the French and British Empires, Uruguay&#x27;s crisis met with swift reprisals against Rosas and the Argentine Confederacy from the two mighty powers. Slapped with fresh embargoes and a joint blockade, Argentina by 1851 found itself bankrupt and with &quot;rogue nation&quot; standing; on 3 February 1852, a surprise military campaign led by the Governor of Entre Ríos Province, Justo José de Urquiza, put an end to the Rosas regime and, until 1878, at least, serious Argentine foreign policy misadventures.

=== Constitution and conflict resolution ===

The deposition of Rosas led to Argentina&#x27;s present institutional framework, outlined in the 1853 constitution. The document, drafted by a legal scholar specializing in the interpretation of the United States Constitution put forth national social and economic development as its overriding principle. Where foreign policy was concerned, it specifically put emphasis on the need to encourage immigration and little else, save for the national defense against aggressions. This, of course, was forced into practice by Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López&#x27;s disastrous 1865 invasion of northern Argentine territory, leading to an alliance between 1820s-era adversaries Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives (particularly Paraguay&#x27;s own).

Setbacks notwithstanding, the policy was successful. Domestically, Argentina was quickly transformed by immigration and foreign investment into, arguably, the most educationally and economically advanced nation in Latin America. Whatever else was happening domestically, internationally, Argentine policy earned a reputation for pragmatism and the reliance of conflict resolution as a vehicle to advance national interests. The era&#x27;s new strongman, Gen. Julio Roca, was the first Argentine leader to treat foreign policy on equal footing with foreign investment and immigration incentives, universal education and repression as instruments of national development. His first administration occupied Patagonia and entered into an 1881 agreement with Chile to that effect and his second one commissioned archaeologist Francisco Moreno to survey an appropriate boundary between the two neighbors, which brought Chile into the historic 1902 pact, settling questions over Patagonian lands east of the Andes. Later that year, endorsed his Foreign Secretary&#x27;s successful negotiation of a debt dispute between Venezuela, France and Germany. Foreign Secretary Luis Drago&#x27;s proposal in this, a dispute among third parties, became the Drago Doctrine, part of international law to this day.
This success led to a joint effort between Argentina, Brazil and Chile to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the United States&#x27; occupation of Veracruz, Mexico in April 1914. That May, the three nations&#x27; foreign ministers hosted U.S. officials in Canada, a conference instrumental in the withdrawal of U.S. troops that November. This also resulted in the 1915 ABC pact signed between the three and, like Brazil and Chile, Argentina thereafter pursued a pragmatic foreign policy, focused on preserving favorable trade relationships. This policy was in evidence during the 1933 Roca-Runciman Treaty, which secured Argentine markets among British colonies, and in the Argentine position during the Chaco War. Resulting from the 1928 discovery of petroleum in the area, the dispute developed into war after Bolivia&#x27;s appeal for Argentine intervention in what it saw as Paraguayan incursions into potentially oil-rich lands were rejected. Bolivia invaded in July 1932 and, despite its legitimate claim to what historically had been its territory, its government&#x27;s ties to Standard Oil of New Jersey (with whom the Argentine government was in dispute over its alleged pirating of oil in Salta Province) led Buenos Aires to withhold diplomatic efforts until, in June 1935, a cease-fire was signed. The laborious negotiations called in Buenos Aires by Argentine Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas yielded him Latin America&#x27;s first Nobel Peace Prize in 1936 and a formal peace treaty in July 1938.

==World War II==

As they had during World War I, Argentine governments of different ideological stripes remained consistent in one important foreign policy point: they maintained Argentina neutral, preferring to offer the nation&#x27;s vast agricultural export capacity to British and U.S. wartime needs; indeed, Argentine trade surpluses totalled US$1 billion during World War I and US$1.7 billion during World War II.

In early 1945, the United States and 19 Latin American countries met in Mexico at the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace. Argentina was not invited. The conference demanded that Argentina declare war on Germany or else it would be isolated. Argentina did so on 27 March 1945, and kept its status in the Pan-American Union and at the insistence of Latin American delegations was admitted to the new United Nations.

==Cold War==

The incipient Cold War in evidence following World War II led the new administration of Juan Perón to conclude that a third world war might follow. Perón restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and, in 1949, articulated a &quot;third way&quot; as his foreign policy doctrine, in hopes of avoiding friction with either superpower, while opening the door to grain sales to the perennially shortage-stricken Soviets. Though commercial concerns continued to dominate foreign policy, conflict resolution was again ventured into when President Arturo Frondizi initiated negotiations between U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Cuban representative Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara during a Western Hemisphere summit in Uruguay in August 1961. Frondizi followed these exchanges with private discussions with &quot;Che&quot; Guevara in Buenos Aires, a misstep resulting in the Argentine military&#x27;s opposition to further talks. Ultimately, Cuba was expelled from the Organization of American States in January 1962 and Frondizi was forced by the military to resign that March. The effort, though fruitless, showed audacity on the part of Frondizi, whom President Kennedy called &quot;a really tough man.&quot;

=== A stray from precedent ===
Argentina&#x27;s relations with its neighbor Chile, though generally cordial, have been strained by territorial disputes – mostly along their mountainous shared border – since the nineteenth century.

In 1958 the Argentine Navy shelled a Chilean lighthouse during the Snipe incident.

On 6 November 1965 the Argentine Gendarmerie killed Chilean Lieutenant Hernán Merino Correa, member of Carabineros de Chile in the Laguna del Desierto incident.

In 1978 the bellicose Argentine dictatorship abrogated the binding Beagle Channel Arbitration and started the Operation Soberania in order to invade Chile but aborted it a few hours later due to military and political reasons. The conflict was resolved after the Argentine defeat in the Falklands by Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict of Pope John Paul II and in the form of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina (&quot;Tratado de Paz y Amistad&quot;), granting the islands to Chile and most of the Exclusive economic zone to Argentina; since then, other border disputes with Chile have been resolved via diplomatic negotiations.

The military dictatorship in Argentina invaded and occupied the British-controlled Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982, starting the Falklands War. The war lasted 74 days before an Argentine surrender on 14 June. The war cost the lives of nearly a thousand Argentine and British troops as well as three Falkland Islanders. It dealt the dictatorship a humiliating blow, opening the door for the return of a democratically elected government.

Since the return of civilian rule to Argentina in 1983, relations with Chile, the United Kingdom and the international community in general improved and Argentine officials have since publicly ruled out interpreting neighboring countries&#x27; policies as any potential threat; but Argentina still does not enjoy the full trust of the Chilean political class.

Michel Morris stated that Argentina has used threats and force to pursue its claims against Chile and Great Britain and that some of the hostile acts or armed incidents appear to have been caused by zealous local commanders.

=== Menem Presidency ===
Early on in the administration of President Carlos Menem (1989–1999), Argentina restored diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and developed a strong partnership with the United States. It was at this time that Argentina left the Non-Aligned Movement and adopted a policy of &quot;automatic alignment&quot; with the United States. In 1990, Menem&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Guido di Tella, memorably pronounced the U.S.–Argentine alliance to be a &quot;carnal relationship.&quot;
Argentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War and all phases of the Haiti operation. It has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide, with Argentine soldiers/engineers and police/Gendarmerie serving in El Salvador–Honduras–Nicaragua (where Navy patrol boats painted white were deployed), Guatemala, Ecuador–Peru, Western Sahara, Angola, Kuwait, Cyprus, Croatia, Kosovo, Bosnia and East Timor.

In recognition of its contributions to international security and peacekeeping, U.S. President Bill Clinton designated Argentina as a major non-NATO ally in January 1998. The country is currently of two in Latin America that hold this distinction, the other being Brazil.

At the United Nations, Argentina supported United States policies and proposals, among them the condemnations of Cuba on the issue of human rights, and the fight against international terrorism and narcotics trafficking. In November 1998, Argentina hosted the United Nations conference on climate change, and in October 1999 in Berlin, became one of the first nations worldwide to adopt a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions target.

Argentina also became a leading advocate of non-proliferation efforts worldwide. After trying to develop nuclear weapons during the 1976 military dictatorship, Argentina scrapped the project with the return of democratic rule in 1983, and became a strong advocate of non-proliferation efforts and the peaceful use of nuclear technologies.

Since the return of democracy, Argentina has also turned into strong proponent of enhanced regional stability in South America, the country revitalized its relationship with Brazil; and during the 1990s (after signing the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina) settled lingering border disputes with Chile; discouraged military takeovers in Ecuador and Paraguay; served with the United States, Brazil and Chile as one of the four guarantors of the Ecuador–Peru peace process. Argentina&#x27;s reputation as a mediator was damaged, however, when President Menem and some members of his cabinet were accused of approving the illegal sale of weapons to Ecuador and to Croatia.

In 1998, President Menem made a state visit to the United Kingdom, and the Prince of Wales reciprocated with a visit to Argentina. In 1999, the two countries agreed to normalize travel to the Falkland Islands () from the mainland and resumed direct flights.

In the 1990s, Argentina was an enthusiastic supporter of the Summit of the Americas process, and chaired the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) initiative.

=== Kirchner Presidency ===

Within the term of President Néstor Kirchner, from 2003 onwards, Argentina suspended its policy of automatic alignment with the United States and moved closer to other Latin American countries. Argentina no longer supports the UN Commission on Human Rights resolution criticizing the &quot;human rights situation in Cuba&quot; and calling upon the Government of Cuba to &quot;adhere to international human rights norms&quot;, but has chosen instead to abstain. In the 2006 United Nations Security Council election, Argentina supported, like all Mercosur countries, the candidacy of Venezuela (a Mercosur member) over Guatemala for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council.

The Mercosur has become a central part of the Argentine foreign policy, with the goal of forming a Latin American trade bloc. Argentina has chosen to form a bloc with Brazil when it comes to external negotiations, though the economic asymmetries between South America&#x27;s two largest countries have produced tension at times.

Between 4 and 5 November 2005, the city of Mar del Plata hosted the Fourth Summit of the Americas. Although the themes were unemployment and poverty, most of the discussion was focused on the FTAA. The summit was a failure in this regard, but marked a clear split between the countries of the Mercosur, plus Venezuela, and the supporters of the FTAA, led by the United States, Mexico and Canada. FTAA negotiations have effectively stalled until at least the conclusion of the 2006 Doha round global trade talks.

In 2005, Argentina assumed again (see history here ) the two-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council.

As of 2007, during Kirchner&#x27;s almost four years in power, Argentina entered into 294 bilateral agreements, including 39 with Venezuela, 37 with Chile, 30 with Bolivia, 21 with Brazil, 12 with China, 10 with Germany, 9 with the United States and Italy, and 7 with Cuba, Paraguay, Spain and Russia.

=== Macri Presidency ===

Mauricio Macri started his term with a series of foreign policy objectives: (i) re-invigorate bilateral relations with the US and Europe, (ii) revise the foundations of Mercosur, evaluating (together with Brazil) alternatives that imply more free trade and (iii) go back to a single exchange rate, allow for a revival of commodity exports and attract foreign direct investment. However, the realization of these objectives will depend on the evolution of domestic (the fate of Kirchnerism) and regional (the fate of the PT in Brazil) developments.

== Issues ==

=== Sovereignty claims ===

Argentina claims part of Antarctica as Argentine Antarctica, an area delimited by the 25° West and 74° West meridians and the 60° South parallel. This claim overlaps the British and Chilean claims, though all territorial claims in Antarctica are currently suspended under the Antarctic Treaty System. Argentina also claims the British overseas territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. In addition a long border with Chile in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field is awaiting demarcation as required under a 1998 treaty.

On 22 April 2009, the Argentine government submitted a claim to the United Nations (UN) for of ocean territory to be recognised as Argentina&#x27;s continental shelf as governed by the Convention on the Continental Shelf and Convention on the Law of the Sea. Argentina claims to have spent 11 years investigating the matter and submitted of documents in support of the claim. If the claim is recognised by the UN then Argentina will gain the rights to the commercial exploitation of the sea bed (which includes mining and oil drilling). The new claim will add to the existing of commercial shelf already managed by Argentina and includes the disputed British overseas territories of the Falklands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and parts of Antarctica disputed with Chile and the United Kingdom.

As of 2016 the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) decided to expand Argentina maritime territory in the South Atlantic Ocean by 35% thus increasing by its territorial waters, fixing the limit of its territory at from its coast. However, this ruling did not increase Argentina&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) which is calculated differently and over which the CLCS has no authority to make a determination. In fact, the CLCS finding is likely to strengthen the UK’s claim to the contested seabed around the islands because the CLCS finding makes it more likely that the seabed between the islands and the Argentine mainland needs to be shared. The UN CLCS ruling included a caveat referencing the unresolved diplomatic dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.

=== Other incidents ===
Argentina, through its Coast Guard and Navy, has been traditionally greatly involved in fishery protection in the Argentine Sea with the first major incidents tracing back to the 1960s when a destroyer fired and holed a Russian trawler and continued through recent years.

In November 2006, an Argentine judge issued an arrest warrant for former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and eight other ex-officials in relation to the 1994 bombing of the Jewish-Argentine Mutual Association (AMIA) community center in Buenos Aires which killed 85 people. Iran refused to carry out the arrest demanded by the warrant claiming it to be a &quot;Zionist plot&quot;. As a result, President Néstor Kirchner ordered the security forces to be on the alert for incidents similar to the 1994 bombing.

Argentina has a dispute with neighboring Uruguay about two pulp mills on the Uruguay side of the shared Uruguay River near the Argentine city of Gualeguaychú. Residents of Gualeguaychú, concerned about pollution from the mills, blockaded bridges across the river in 2006. The case was brought before the International Court of Justice. Meanwhile, the denial of preliminary measures in July 2006 allowed the mills to begin functioning. An ICJ decision was released in 2010. It found that Uruguay had broken its 1985 treaty obligation to consultant Argentina before building the mills but that Argentine claims of pollution caused by the new mills were not backed by the evidence.

<text>The Government of the Republic of Armenia () or the executive branch of the Armenian government is an executive council of government ministers in Armenia. It is one of the three main governmental branches of Armenia and is headed by the Prime Minister of Armenia.

==Current government==

The incumbent government of Armenia is led by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan who, as leader of Civil Contract (the party which won elections in December 2018), was appointed prime minister on 14 January 2019 by President Armen Sarkissian.

==Powers==
===Powers of Government granted by former revision of Constitution (accepted in 2005)===
====Resignation of the Government and its formation====
Following the Article 55 of Armenian Constitution, the Republic&#x27;s president must accept resignation of the government on the day of
# first sitting of newly elected Nation Assembly
# assumption of the office by the president of the Republic
# expression of the vote of no confidence to the Government
# resignation of the prime minister
# vacant position of prime minister

Later on the prime minister must be appointed by the president of the Republic. The elected prime minister should enjoy the confidence of majority Deputies and if this is impossible the confidence of maximum number of the deputies. Ministers must be appointed within 20 days after prime minister is appointed. After these the Government is considered to be formed. All the ministers, including the prime minister, must be citizens of the Republic of Armenia. The structure of the Government must be defined by law in regard to recommendation by the Government. The procedure for the organization of operations of the Government and other public administration bodies under the Government must be defined by the decree of the president upon the submission of prime minister.

The role of the Prime Minister is that it should supervise the Government activities, coordinate the work of the Ministers and it should adopt decisions on the organization of Government activities. In addition, decisions passed by the Government must be signed by the Prime Minister. The president has the right to suspend Governmental decisions for one month for checking the compliance of decisions with the constitution. Government decisions about appointment or dissolution of the governors must be approved by the President.

This draft shall be debated and voted on by the National Assembly within a period of thirty days in accordance with the procedure defined by this Article.

====Restriction on members====
According to Article 88 of Armenian Constitution &quot;A member of Government can not be engaged in hold an office in commercial organizations or in state and local self-government bodies not connected with his/her duties, or be involved in entrepreneurial activities, save for pedagogical creative, and academic activities.&quot;

====Powers on local self-governed communities====
Articles 109 and 110 of Armenian Constitution state that the Government may remove the Head of Community in cases prescribed by the law on the basis of the conclusion of the Constitutional Court. The communities may, based on the interests of the public, be merged with each other or separated by the law. The appropriate law shall be adopted by the National Assembly upon the recommendation of the Government. Before submitting the legislative initiative the Government shall appoint local referendums in those communities.

However, the Government can not put the motion on confidence more than two times in any single session.

==Leaders==
Each of the three Armenian Republics had an executive branch at the time of their existence, each being led by a prime minister.

===Prime Ministers of Armenia===
===Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic===
The governmental structure of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was similar to that of the other Soviet republics. It is mentioned in the article 79 of USSR constitution &quot;The highest executive and administrative organ of state power of a Union Republic is the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Union Republic&quot;. The council was formed by Supreme Soviet of the Union Republic, which was the only legislative body in a Union Republic and the highest organ of state power. The council consisted of the following positions:

* Chairman
* Vice-chairman
* Chairman of the State Planning Commission
* People&#x27;s Commissars-of:
** Food industry, light industry, agriculture, finance, internal trade, justice, education, municipal economy, public health etc.
* The Representative of the Committee of Agricultural Stocks
* Chief of the Board of Arts
* The Representative of the All-Union People&#x27;s Commissariats

The Council issued orders and decisions and supervised their execution. The Council was responsible and accountable to Supreme Soviet of the Union Republic but between the sessions of the Union Republics Supreme Soviet, the Council was responsible and accountable to the Presidium of the same Supreme Soviet. The Council of People&#x27;s Commissars controlled those branches of state administration that came within the jurisdiction of Union Republic. It issued within the limits of the jurisdiction of their respective People&#x27;s Commissariats, orders and instructions. The Council of People&#x27;s Commissariats of a Union Republic were either Union-Republic or Republican Commissariats. Union-Republican controlled those branches of the state administration that were entrusted to them and were subordinate both to the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Union Republic and to the appropriate Union-Republic People&#x27;s Commissars of the U.S.S.R.. The Republican Commissariats again directed branches that were entrusted to them but were subordinate only to Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Union Republic.

===Prime Ministers of the First Armenian Republic===
On May 30, 1918, Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) decided that Armenia must be a republic under a provisional coalition government. It was decided that the Republic must have its own constitution and self-governing system. The government of the Republic was headed by prime minister. He was chosen by the National Council of Armenia. Later on the prime minister himself formed his cabinet. Prime minister was accountable for international, domestic and regional issues. The first prime minister became Hovhannes Katchaznouni whose cabinet was made up from five members, all of which were from ARF. In addition, a ministry of interior was created, whose first head was Aram Manukian. The ministry of interior was responsible for domestic problems. Its key responsibilities were to create public school system, railroad system, communication and telegraph systems, also it was responsible for enforcing law and order. All these responsibilities were controlled by a specific department, each of which became a separate ministry later on.

Prime minister had direct involvement in regional and international issues. Hamazasp Ohanjyan, the third prime minister, and Avetis Aharonian left for Berlin trying to reassure the tense relations between Turkey and Armenia. Unfortunately none of them succeeded to accomplish his goal.

<text>James W. Prescott (born January 21, 1934) is an American developmental psychologist, whose research focused on the origins of violence, particularly as it relates to a lack of mother-child bonding.

Prescott was a health scientist administrator at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), one of the Institutes of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1966 to 1980. He created and directed the Developmental Behavioral Biology Program at the NICHD where he initiated NICHD-supported research programs to study the relationship between mother-child bonding and the development of social abilities in adult life. Inspired by Harry Harlow&#x27;s famous experiments on rhesus monkeys, which established a link between neurotic behavior and isolation from a care-giving mother, Prescott further proposed that a key component to development comes from the somesthetic processes (body touch) and vestibular-cerebellar processes (body movement) induced by mother-child interactions, and that deprivation of this stimulation causes brain abnormalities. By analogy to the neurotic behavior in monkeys, he suggested that these developmental abnormalities are a major cause of adult violence amongst humans.

Prescott also served as assistant head of the Psychology Branch of the Office of Naval Research (1963 to 1966) and as president of the Maryland Psychological Association (1970 to 1971). In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

Prescott&#x27;s findings about origins of child abuse was innovative, groundbreaking, and controversial. In 1978, Hustler Magazine published an article by Prescott with shocking photos of actual abused children. Dr. Prescott supported this publication of his work in order to reach an audience outside of the scientific community. For this, NICHD fired Prescott, and he protested in front of the U.S. Senate and House Appropriations Committee. Prescott testified that &quot;we are producing more criminals . . . &#x27;by the manner in which we are raising our children ... than we will be able to house in all the prisons that we can build.&#x27;&quot;

<text>[[Chile]]&#x27;s 2017 census reported a population of 17,574,003 people. Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, due to a declining birth rate. By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million people, at which point it is projected to either stagnate or begin declining. About 85% of the country&#x27;s population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in Greater Santiago alone. The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5.6 million people, Greater Concepción with 861,000 and Greater Valparaíso with 824,000.

==Population size and structure==
According to the total population was in , compared to only 6,143,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2015 was 20.1%, 69.0% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 10.9% was 65 years or older.





=== Structure of the population ===



==Vital statistics==

===Official statistics===


(p) = preliminary figures.| 20201

===Current vital statistics===
The Ine publishes monthly the vital statistics report.
===United Nations estimates===

The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.

==Ethnic groups==
Chile is a diverse society, home to individuals with varied ethnic backgrounds. Studies on the ethnic makeup of Chile differ significantly from one another.

According to censuses from the colonial period, the white population exceeded 70% of the population of Chile (approximately 79% in 1810).102

Around 2007, a public health book from the University of Chile states that 65% of the population are Mestizos with predominantly White admixture, with 30% being of Caucasoid origin and Amerindians comprising the remaining 5%. National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) professor of Latin American studies, Francisco Lizcano, estimates that 52.7% of the Chilean population can be classified as culturally European, with 39.3% being Mestizo and the remaining 8% belonging to Amerindian cultures. Other social studies put the total number of Whites at over 60%.

According to a 2012 estimate by the US Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook, the population consists of 88.9% of &quot;White and non-Indigenous&quot;, with the remaining percentages being Amerindians, except for a 0.3% &quot;unspecified&quot;. 

The 2011 Latinobarómetro survey asked respondents in Chile to identify their race, with the majority (67%) selecting &quot;white,&quot; followed by &quot;mestizo&quot; (25%), and &quot;indigenous&quot; (8%). In a 2002 national poll, the majority of Chileans reported having &quot;some&quot; (43.4%) or &quot;much&quot; (8.3%) indigenous ancestry, while 40.3% claimed to have none.

As of 2002, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, 22% of Chileans were white and 72% were mestizo.
A 2002 national census classified the population as indigenous and non-indigenous rather than as White or Mestizo.

===Indigenous communities===

The 1907 census reported 101,118 Indians, or 3.1% of the total country population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke their native language were considered, irrespective of their &quot;racial purity.&quot;

According to the 2002 census, only indigenous people that still practiced a native culture or spoke a native language were surveyed, and 4.6% of the population (692,192 people) fit that description. Of that 4.6%, 87.3% declared themselves Mapuche. Most of the indigenous population show varying degrees of mixed ancestry.

Chile is one of the twenty-two countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169. Chile ratified the convention in 2008. In November 2009, a court decision in Chile, considered to be a landmark ruling in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention 169. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upholds rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.

Chile administers Easter Island a territory 4,100 km west of the mainland. The Rapa Nui people are native to the island and are Polynesian in origin. About 3,500 live on the island, but around 10,000 came to the mainland in the 20th century.

=== European immigration ===


Chile – located far from Europe and difficult to reach – was never an attractive place for migrants from Europe, a situation recognized in the census of 1907, the census which recorded the highest percentage of Europeans versus the total population of Chile (2.2%).

European migration in the 19th century did not result in a remarkable change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan and the city of Concepcion in the BIO-BIO Region.

Spain and France was the largest source of European immigration to Chile during the 17th and 18th centuries, specially from the deep southern parts of Andalusia and Extremadura, which contributed to the Chilean ethnogenesis with thousands of peasants who migrated to the fertile lands of the Chilean Central Valley alongside the Basque merchants who started to arrive in the 18th century in great numbers.

The largest contingent of people to have arrived in post-independence Chile came from Spain and from the Basque country, a region divided between northern Spain and southern France. Estimates of the number of Chileans who have one or two surnames of Basque origin range from 10% (1,600,000) to as high as 20% (3,200,000). Note that this phenomenon occurs not only in Chile, but also in every Autonomous Community of Spain, as well as in other Latin American countries – one can see that a substantial portion of their populations have one or two surnames of Basque or Navarre origin, tending to be more common in the upper classes, and hence becoming more unusual in lower classes.

Chile&#x27;s various waves of non-Spanish immigrants include Italians, Irish, French, Greeks, Germans, English, Scots, Croats, and Poles.

In 1848 an important and substantial German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government for the colonization of the southern region, the Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians), strongly influenced the cultural and racial composition of the southern provinces of Chile. It is difficult to count the number of descendants of Germans in Chile, given the great amount of time since 1848. Because many areas of southern Chile were sparsely populated, the traces of German immigration there are quite noticeable. An independent estimate calculates that about 500,000 Chileans could descend from German immigrants.

Other historically significant immigrant groups included Croats, whose descendants today are estimated at 380,000 persons, or 2.4% of the Chilean population. Some authors claim that close to 4.6% of the Chilean population must have some Croatian ancestry. Over 700,000 Chileans (4.5% of the Chilean population) may have British (English, Scottish or Welsh) and Irish forebears. Chileans of Greek descent are estimated to number between 90,000 and 120,000; most live in or near either Santiago or Antofagasta, and Chile is one of the five countries in the world most populated with descendants of Greeks. The descendants of Swiss immigrants add 90,000, and estimates suggest that about 5% of the Chilean population has some French ancestry. 600,000 Chileans descend from Italian immigrants. Other groups of Europeans exist but are found in smaller numbers, such as the descendants of Austrians and Dutchmen (estimated at about 50,000).

=== Latin American immigrants ===
Since the reestablishment of democracy in Chile, the former tendency for emigrants from the country to outnumber immigrants to it has reversed. Chile now is one of the two countries in Latin America with a positive migration rate. Since 1990, with the opening of Chile to the world, through a free market system, and the consequent socioeconomic development of the country, has been noted the attraction of a significant number of immigrants from various Latin American countries, which represented in Census 2017, approximately 1,200,000 people, corresponding to 7% of the population residing in the Chilean territory, without counting their descendants born in Chile, due to the effects of the ius soli. Their main origins, corresponds to: 288,233 Venezuelans, 223,923 Peruvians, 179,338 Haitians, 146,582 Colombians, 107,346 Bolivians, 74,713 Argentines, 36,994 Ecuadorians, 18,185 Brazilians, 17,959 Dominicans, 15,837 Cubans and 8,975 Mexicans.

This has prompted a change in the physiognomy of certain communes in the country where its number is concentrated. In communes such as Santiago Centro and Independencia, 1/3 of residents is a Latin American immigrant (28% and 31% of the population of these communes, respectively). Other communes of Greater Santiago with high numbers of immigrants are Estación Central (17%) and Recoleta (16%). In the northern regions such as Antofagasta region, 17.3% of the population is a Latin American foreigner, with communes such as Ollagüe (31%), Mejillones (16%), Sierra Gorda (16%) and Antofagasta (11%), with high percentages of Latin American immigrants, mainly Bolivians, Colombians and Peruvians.

=== Other ethnic groups ===
It is estimated that about 5% of the population (800,000) is descendant of Asian immigrants, chiefly from the Middle East (i.e. Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese, &quot;see&quot; Arab Chileans). Most of these are Christians from the Levant, of whom roughly 500,000 are Palestinian descendants, mostly Christians, are believed to reside in Chile. Additionally, about 18,000–25,000 Jews reside in Chile.

In recent years, Chile has had a growing East Asian population, mainly from China (see Chinese Chilean), but also from Japan (see Japanese Chilean) and South Korea (see Koreans in Chile). The earliest wave of East Asian immigration took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly Chinese and Japanese contract laborers.

There is a sizable population of Romani people in Chile. They are widely and easily recognized, and continue to hold on to their traditions and language, and many continue to live semi-nomadic lifestyles traveling from city to city and living in small tented communities

=== Population genetics ===
Genetics studies fluctuate between 57,8% and 67.9% European; between 32.1% and 44.3% Amerindian; and 2.5%—6.3% African ancestry percentages. A genetic study by the University of Chile found that the average Chilean&#x27;s genetic makeup consists of 64% Caucasian and 35% Amerindian ancestry. In a 2014 study of Chilean soldiers stationed in Arica, researchers found that the average self-identifying white person (37.9%) was genetically only 54% European.

==Languages==

The Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and &quot;s&quot; sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.

There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: Mapudungun, Quechua, Aymara and Rapa Nui. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the lingua franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.

German is spoken to a great extent in southern Chile, either in small countryside pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.

Through initiatives such as the English Opens Doors program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten. Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech. Since 2010, all students from 3rd grade in secondary school have been tested on listening and reading comprehension in English. The evaluation is compulsory and the instrument is Educational Testing Service&#x27;s TOEIC Bridge.

==Religion==
Christianity is the most widely professed religion in Chile, with Catholicism being its largest denomination.

<doc id="67366" wikidata="Q184558" url="?curid=67366" title="Absolute monarchy">
<text>Absolute monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign is the sole source of political power, unconstrained by constitutions, legislatures or other checks on their authority. 

The absolutist system of government saw its high point in Europe during the 16th and 17th century, associated with a form of rule unconstrained by the former checks of feudalism, embodied by figures such as Louis XIV of France, the &quot;Sun King&quot;. Attempting to establish an absolutist government along continental lines, Charles I of England viewed Parliament as unnecessary, which would ultimately lead to the English Civil War (1642–1651) and his execution. Absolutism declined substantially, first following the French Revolution, and later after World War I, both of which led to the popularization of modes of government based on the notion of popular sovereignty. Nonetheless, it provided an ideological foundation for the newer political theories and movements that emerged to oppose liberal democracy, such as Legitimism and Carlism in the early 19th century, or &quot;integral nationalism&quot; in the early 20th century.

Absolute monarchies include Brunei, Eswatini, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Vatican City, and the individual emirates composing the United Arab Emirates, which itself is a federation of such monarchies – a federal monarchy. Though absolute monarchies are sometimes supported by legal documents, they are distinct from constitutional monarchies, in which the authority of the monarch is restricted (e.g. by legislature or unwritten customs) or balanced by that of other officials, such as a prime minister, as is in the case of the United Kingdom, or the Nordic countries.

==Historical examples of absolute monarchies==
=== Outside Europe ===
In the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan wielded absolute power over the state and was considered a Padishah meaning &quot;Great King&quot; by his people. Many sultans wielded absolute power through heavenly mandates reflected in their titles, such as &quot;Shadow of God on Earth&quot;. In ancient Mesopotamia, many rulers of Assyria, Babylonia and Sumer were absolute monarchs as well.

Throughout Imperial China, many emperors and one empress (Wu Zetian) wielded absolute power through the Mandate of Heaven. In pre-Columbian America, the Inca Empire was ruled by a Sapa Inca, who was considered the son of Inti, the sun god and absolute ruler over the people and nation. Korea under the Joseon dynasty and short-lived empire was also an absolute monarchy.

===Europe===

Throughout much of European history, the divine right of kings was the theological justification for absolute monarchy. Many European monarchs claimed supreme autocratic power by divine right, and that their subjects had no rights to limit their power.

Throughout the Age of Enlightenment, the concept of the divine right to power and democratic ideals were given serious merit.

The Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the &quot;Springtime of the Peoples&quot; or the &quot;Springtime of Nations&quot;, were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history. By the 19th century, divine right was regarded as an obsolete theory in most countries in the Western world, except in Russia where it was still given credence as the official justification for the Tsar&#x27;s power until February Revolution in 1917 and in the Vatican City where it remains today.

====Kingdoms of England and Scotland====
James VI and I and his son Charles I tried to import the principle of divine right into Scotland and England. Charles I&#x27;s attempt to enforce episcopal polity on the Church of Scotland led to rebellion by the Covenanters and the Bishops&#x27; Wars, then fears that Charles I was attempting to establish absolutist government along European lines was a major cause of the English Civil War, although he did rule this way for 11 years starting in 1629, after dissolving the Parliament of England for a time.

====Denmark–Norway====
Absolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 of Denmark–Norway, which ordered that the Monarch: This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm in Denmark. Absolute monarchy lasted until 1814 in Norway, and 1848 in Denmark.

====Habsburgs====
The House of Habsburg is currently extinct in its male line, due to the death of the childless Charles II of Spain in 1700. However, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine still carries the female line of the House of Habsburg. 

The first member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine to rule over the Holy Roman Empire was Joseph II, a sovereign raised during the Enlightenment. Joseph II extended full legal freedom to serfs in 1781. Franz Joseph I of Austria was Emperor of Austria from 1848 until his death in 1916 and was succeeded by Charles I of Austria. Charles I was the last Emperor of Austria and abdicated on 12 November 1918 due to Austria-Hungary losing World War I.

====Hungary====

====France====
Louis XIV of France (1638–1715) is said to have proclaimed . Although often criticized for his extravagances, such as the Palace of Versailles, he reigned over France for a long period, some historians consider him an absolute monarch, while some other historians have questioned whether Louis&#x27; reign should be considered &#x27;absolute&#x27;, given the reality of the balance of power between the monarch and the nobility, as well as parliaments.

The king of France concentrated legislative, executive, and judicial powers in his person. He was the supreme judicial authority. He could condemn people to death without the right of appeal. It was both his duty to punish offenses and stop them from being committed. From his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul them.

====Prussia====
In Brandenburg-Prussia, the concept of absolute monarch took a notable turn from the above with its emphasis on the monarch as the &quot;first servant of the state&quot;, but it also echoed many of the important characteristics of absolutism. Prussia was ruled by the House of Hohenzollern as a feudal monarchy from 1525 to 1701 and an absolute monarchy from 1701 to 1848, after which it became a federal semi-constitutional monarchy from 1848 to 1918 until the monarchy was abolished during the German Revolution.

Frederick I was the first &quot;King in Prussia&quot;, beginning his reign on 18 January 1701. King Frederick the Great adopted the title &quot;King of Prussia&quot; in 1772, the same year he annexed most of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, and practiced enlightened absolutism until his death in 1786. He introduced a general civil code, abolished torture and established the principle that the Crown would not interfere in matters of justice. He also promoted an advanced secondary education, the forerunner of today&#x27;s German gymnasium (grammar school) system, which prepares the brightest pupils for university studies. The Prussian education system was emulated in various countries, including the United States.

====Russia====
Until 1905, the tsars and emperors of Russia governed as absolute monarchs. Ivan IV (&quot;the Terrible&quot;) was known for his reign of terror through the &quot;oprichnina&quot;. Following the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century, the traditional alliance of autocratic monarchy, the church, and the aristocracy was widely seen as the only basis for preserving the social order and Russian statehood, which legitimized the rule of the Romanov dynasty. Peter I (&quot;the Great&quot;) reduced the power of the Russian nobility and strengthened the central power of the monarch, establishing a bureaucracy. This tradition of absolutism was expanded by Catherine II and her descendants. Although Alexander II made some reforms and established an independent judicial system, Russia did not have a representative assembly or a constitution until the 1905 Revolution. However, the concept of absolutism was so ingrained in Russia that the Russian Constitution of 1906 still described the monarch as an autocrat. 

Russia became the last European country (excluding Vatican City) to abolish absolutism, and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th century (the Ottoman Empire drafted its first constitution in 1876). Russia was one of the four continental empires which collapsed after World War I, along with Germany, Austria–Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1918, the Bolsheviks executed the Romanov family, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.

====Sweden====

The form of government instituted in Sweden under King Charles XI and passed on to his son, Charles XII is commonly referred to as absolute monarchy; however, the Swedish monarch was never absolute in the sense of wielding arbitrary power. The monarch still ruled under the law and could only legislate in agreement with the Riksdag of the Estates; rather, the absolutism introduced was the monarch&#x27;s ability to run the government unfettered by the privy council, contrary to earlier practice. The absolute rule of Charles XI was instituted by the crown and the Riksdag in order to carry out the Great Reduction which would have been made impossible by the privy council which comprised the high nobility.

After the death of Charles XII in 1718, the system of absolute rule was largely blamed for the ruination of the realm in the Great Northern War, and the reaction tipped the balance of power to the other extreme end of the spectrum, ushering in the Age of Liberty. After half a century of largely unrestricted parliamentary rule proved just as ruinous, King Gustav III seized back royal power in the coup d&#x27;état of 1772, and later once again abolished the privy council under the Union and Security Act in 1789, which, in turn, was rendered void in 1809 when Gustav IV Adolf was deposed in a coup and the constitution of 1809 was put in its place. The years between 1789 and 1809, then, are also referred to as a period of absolute monarchy.

==Contemporary trends==
Many nations formerly with absolute monarchies, such as Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco and Qatar, have &quot;de jure&quot; moved towards a constitutional monarchy. However, in these cases, the monarch still retains tremendous powers, even to the extent that by some measures, parliament&#x27;s influence on political life is viewed as negligible or merely consultative.

In Bhutan, the government moved from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy following planned parliamentary elections to the Tshogdu in 2003, and the election of a National Assembly in 2008.

In Nepal, there were several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the Nepalese Civil War, the Maoist insurgency, and the 2001 Nepalese royal massacre, with the Nepalese monarchy being abolished on 28 May 2008.

In Tonga, the king had majority control of the Legislative Assembly until 2010.

=== Liechtenstein ===
Liechtenstein has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch — the Prince of Liechtenstein was given vast expanded powers after a referendum to amend the Constitution of Liechtenstein in 2003, which led BBC News to describe the prince as an &quot;absolute monarch again&quot;. The referendum granted the monarch the powers to dismiss the government, nominate judges and veto legislation, among others. Just prior to the referendum, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe published a comprehensive report analysing the amendments, opining that they were not compatible with the European standards of democracy, effectively making Liechtenstein a &quot;de facto&quot; absolute monarchy. Prince Hans-Adam II had also previously threatened to leave the country and move his assets out of Liechtenstein if voters had chosen to restrict his powers.

=== Vatican City ===

Vatican City continues to be an absolute monarchy, but is unique because it is also a microstate, ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and elective monarchy. As of 2023, Vatican City has a population of 764 residents (regardless of citizenship). It is the smallest state in the world both by area and by population. The Pope is the absolute monarch of Vatican City, and is elected by a papal conclave with a two-thirds supermajority.

As governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Pope, who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. Unlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; or &quot;jus soli&quot;, citizenship of Vatican City is granted on &quot;jus officii&quot;, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.

==Current absolute monarchs==

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, and according to the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia adopted by Royal Decree in 1992, the King must comply with Sharia (Islamic law) and the Quran. The Quran and the body of the Sunnah (traditions of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad) are declared to be the Kingdom&#x27;s Constitution, but no written modern constitution has ever been promulgated for Saudi Arabia, which remains the only Arab nation where no national elections have ever taken place since its founding. No political parties or national elections are permitted. The Saudi government is the world&#x27;s most authoritarian regime in 2023 measured by the electoral democracy score of the V-Dem Democracy indices.

==Scholarship==
There is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among European monarchs. Some, such as Perry Anderson, argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states, while historians such as Roger Mettam dispute the very concept of absolutism. In general, historians who disagree with the appellation of &quot;absolutism&quot; argue that most monarchs labeled as &quot;absolutist&quot; exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other &quot;non-absolutist&quot; rulers, and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist rhetoric of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs. Renaissance historian William Bouwsma summed up this contradiction:
Anthropology, sociology, and ethology as well as various other disciplines such as political science attempt to explain the rise of absolute monarchy ranging from extrapolation generally, to certain Marxist explanations in terms of the class struggle as the underlying dynamic of human historical development generally and absolute monarchy in particular.

In the 17th century, French legal theorist Jean Domat defended the concept of absolute monarchy in works such as &quot;On Social Order and Absolute Monarchy&quot;, citing absolute monarchy as preserving natural order as God intended. Other intellectual figures who supported absolute monarchy include Thomas Hobbes and Charles Maurras.

<doc id="67367" wikidata="Q285972" url="?curid=67367" title="Mbox">
<text>Mbox is a generic term for a family of related file formats used for holding collections of email messages. It was first implemented in Fifth Edition Unix.

All messages in an mbox mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain text in a single file. Each message starts with the four characters &quot;From&quot; followed by a space (the so-called &quot;From_ line&quot;) and the sender&#x27;s email address. RFC 4155 defines that a UTC timestamp follows after another separating space character.

However, as noted in the RFC, there is enormous variation between different storage systems. As a specific example, if exporting via IMAP the popular Gmail service uses - as a placeholder in lieu of the sender&#x27;s address, follows this with a timestamp representing either the time the IMAP export was configured or the time of reception (whichever is more recent), and makes no attempt to escape &quot;From -&quot; strings which appear in the body of an email.

A format similar to mbox is the MH Message Handling System. Other systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server and the Cyrus IMAP server, store mailboxes in centralized databases managed by the mail system and not directly accessible by individual users. The maildir mailbox format is often cited as an alternative to the mbox format for networked email storage systems.

== Mail storage protocols ==
Unlike the Internet protocols used for the exchange of email, the format used for the storage of email has never been formally defined through the RFC standardization mechanism and has been entirely left to the developer of an email client. However, the POSIX standard defined a loose framework in conjunction with the mailx program. In 2005, the application/mbox media type was standardized as RFC 4155, which hinted that mbox stores mailbox messages in their original Internet Message (RFC 2822) format, except for the used newline character, seven-bit clean data storage, and the requirement that each newly added message is terminated with a completely empty line within the mbox database.

== Mbox family ==
The mbox format uses a single blank line followed by the string &#x27;From &#x27; (with a space) to delimit messages; this can create ambiguities if a message contains the same sequence in the message text.

Over the years, four popular but incompatible variants arose: &quot;mboxo&quot;, &quot;mboxrd&quot;, &quot;mboxcl&quot;, and &quot;mboxcl2&quot;. The naming scheme was developed by Daniel J. Bernstein, Rahul Dhesi, and others in 1996. Each originated from a different version of Unix. &quot;mboxcl&quot; and &quot;mboxcl2&quot; originated from the file format used by Unix System V Release 4 mail tools. &quot;mboxrd&quot; was invented by Rahul Dhesi et al. as a rationalization of &quot;mboxo&quot; and subsequently adopted by some Unix mail tools including qmail.

All these variants have the problem that the content of the message sometimes must be modified to remove ambiguities, as shown below, so that applications have to know which quoting rule has been used to perform the correct reversion, which turned out to be impractical. Using MIME and choosing a content-transfer-encoding that quotes &quot;From_&quot; lines in a standard-compliant fashion ensures that message content doesn&#x27;t need to be changed, but only their MIME representation. Therefore, checksums remain constant, a necessary precondition for supporting S/MIME and Pretty Good Privacy. Applications that newly create messages and store them in mbox database files will likely use this approach to detach message content from database storage format.

&quot;mboxo&quot; and &quot;mboxrd&quot; locate the message start by scanning for &quot;From &quot; lines that are found before the email message headers. If a &quot;codice_1&quot; string occurs at the beginning of a line in either the header or the body of a message (a mail standard violation for the former, but not for the latter), the email message must be modified before the message is stored in an mbox mailbox file or the line will be taken as a message boundary. To avoid misinterpreting a &quot;codice_1&quot; string at the beginning of the line in the email body as the beginning of a new email, some systems &quot;From-munge&quot; the message, typically by prepending a greater-than sign:
 &gt;From my point of view...

In the &quot;mboxo&quot; format, such lines have irreversible ambiguity.
In the &quot;mboxo&quot; format, this can lead to corruption of the message. If a line already contained codice_3 at the beginning (such as in a quotation), it is unchanged when written. When subsequently read by the mail software, the leading codice_4 is erroneously removed. The &quot;mboxrd&quot; format solves this by converting codice_1 to codice_3 and converting codice_3 to codice_8, etc. The transformation is then always reversible.

Example:

From MAILER-DAEMON Fri Jul 8 12:08:34 2011
From: Author &lt;author@example.com&gt;
To: Recipient &lt;recipient@example.com&gt;
Subject: Sample message 1
This is the body.
&gt;From (should be escaped).
There are 3 lines.
From MAILER-DAEMON Fri Jul 8 12:08:34 2011
From: Author &lt;author@example.com&gt;
To: Recipient &lt;recipient@example.com&gt;
Subject: Sample message 2
This is the second body.

The &quot;mboxcl&quot; and &quot;mboxcl2&quot; formats use a codice_9 header to determine the messages&#x27; lengths and thereby the next &quot;real From line&quot;. &quot;mboxcl&quot; still quotes &quot;From  lines&quot; in the messages themselves as &quot;mboxrd&quot; does, while &quot;mboxcl2&quot; doesn&#x27;t.

=== Modified mbox ===
Some email clients use a modification of the mbox format for their mail folders.
* Eudora used an &quot;mboxo&quot; variation where a sender&#x27;s email address is replaced by the constant string &quot;???@???&quot;. Most mbox clients store incoming messages as received. Eudora separates out attachments embedded in the message, storing the attachments as separate individual files in one folder.
* The Mozilla family of email clients (Mozilla, Netscape, Thunderbird, et al.) use an &quot;mboxrd&quot; variation with more complex &quot;From line&quot; quoting rules.

== File locking ==
Because more than one messages are stored in a single file, some form of file locking is needed to avoid the corruption that can result from two or more processes modifying the mailbox simultaneously. This could happen if a network email delivery program delivers a new message at the same time as a mail reader is deleting an existing message.

Various mutually incompatible mechanisms have been used by different mbox formats to enable message file locking, including codice_10 and codice_11. This does not work well with network mounted file systems, such as the Network File System (NFS), which is why traditionally Unix used additional &quot;dot lock&quot; files, which could be created atomically even over NFS.

Mbox files should also be locked while they are being read. Otherwise, the reader may see corrupted message contents if another process is modifying the mbox at the same time, even though no actual file corruption occurs.

== As a patch format ==
In open source development, it is common to send patches in the diff format to a mailing list for discussion. The diff format allows for irrelevant &quot;headers&quot;, such as mbox data, to be added. Version control systems like git have support for generating mbox-formatted patches and for sending them to the list as emails in a thread.

<text>David O. Selznick (born David Selznick: May 10, 1902June 22, 1965) was an American film producer, screenwriter and film studio executive who produced &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) and &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), both of which earned him an Academy Award for Best Picture. He also won the Irving Thalberg Award at the 12th Academy Awards, Hollywood&#x27;s top honor for a producer, in recognition of his shepherding &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; through a long and troubled production and into a record-breaking blockbuster.

The son and son-in-law of movie moguls Lewis J. Selznick and Louis B. Mayer, Selznick served as head of production at R.K.O. Radio Pictures and went on to become one of the first independent movie producers. His first wife was Mayer&#x27;s daughter Irene Selznick, who became a highly successful Broadway producer after their divorce, and his second wife was Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Jones. 

==Early life==
Selznick was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence Anna (née Sachs) and Lewis J. Selznick, a silent film producer and distributor of Jewish origin. His father was born in the Russian Empire in 1870. 

David had three siblings, including his brother Myron, also a film producer and later a talent agent. David Selznick added the &quot;O&quot; to distinguish himself from an uncle with the same name, and because he thought it had flair. The &quot;O&quot; stands for nothing, and he never had his name legally changed to incorporate it.

He studied at Columbia University in New York City and started training as an apprentice for his father until the elder&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1923. In 1926, Selznick moved to Hollywood, and with the help of his father&#x27;s connections, he gained a job as an assistant story editor at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He left MGM for Paramount Pictures in 1928, where he worked until 1931. While at Paramount he married Irene Gladys Mayer, daughter of MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer.

==Stint at RKO==
David Sarnoff, head of RKO, hired Selznick as Head of Production in October 1931. In addition to implementing rigorous cost-control measures, Selznick championed the unit production system, which gave the producers of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system. &quot;Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism&quot;, said Selznick, &quot;and this being a creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made.&quot; Instituting unit production, he predicted, would also result in cost savings of 30–40 percent. 

To make films under the new system, Selznick recruited prize behind-the-camera personnel, such as director George Cukor and producer/director Merian C. Cooper, and gave producer Pandro S. Berman, aged twenty-six, increasingly important projects. Selznick discovered and signed a young actress who was quickly counted as one of the studio&#x27;s big stars, Katharine Hepburn. John Barrymore was also enlisted for a few memorable performances. 

Selznick spent a mere fifteen months as RKO production chief, resigning over a dispute with new corporate president Merlin Aylesworth concerning creative control. One of his last acts at RKO was to approve a screen test for a thirty-three-year-old, balding Broadway song-and-dance man named Fred Astaire. In a memo, Selznick wrote, &quot;I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is ... tremendous&quot;. 

Selznick&#x27;s tenure was widely considered masterful: In 1931, before he arrived, the studio had produced forty-two features for $16 million in total budgets. In 1932, under Selznick, forty-one features were made for $10.2 million, with clear improvement in quality and popularity. He backed several major successes, including &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1932), with Cukor directing Hepburn&#x27;s debut, and the monumental &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933)—largely Merian Cooper&#x27;s brainchild, brought to life by the astonishing special effects work of Willis H. O&#x27;Brien.

==Return to MGM==
In 1933 he returned to MGM where his father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer, was studio CEO. Mayer established a second prestige production unit for Selznick, parallel to that of Irving Thalberg, who was in poor health. Selznick&#x27;s unit output included the all-star cast movie &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1935), &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935), and &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1935).

Greta Garbo&#x27;s contract with MGM supposedly provided that only Selznick or Thalberg could produce her pictures for the studio. When Selznick later announced his departure from MGM, Garbo asked him to stay, offering to allow him the exclusive right to produce her films. Selznick declined the offer.

==Selznick International Pictures==

Selznick longed to be an independent producer with his own studio. In 1935 he realized that goal by leasing RKO&#x27;s Culver City studios and back lot, forming Selznick International Pictures, and distributing his films through United Artists. His successes continued with classics such as &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; (1936), &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937), &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1937), &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1938), &quot;The Young in Heart&quot; (1938), &quot;Made for Each Other&quot; (1939), &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1939) and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), which remains the highest-grossing film of all time (adjusted for inflation). &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; won eight Oscars and two special awards. Selznick also won the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award that same year.

The following year he produced his second Best Picture Oscar winner, &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), the first Hollywood production of British director Alfred Hitchcock. Selznick had brought Hitchcock over from England, launching the director&#x27;s American career. &quot;Rebecca&quot; was Hitchcock&#x27;s only film to win Best Picture.

==Later productions==
After &quot;Rebecca&quot;, Selznick closed Selznick International Pictures and took some time off. His business activities included the loan of his contracted artists to other studios, including Alfred Hitchcock, Ingrid Bergman, Vivien Leigh and Joan Fontaine. He formed The Selznick Studio and returned to producing pictures with &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), which he also wrote. He followed that with the Hitchcock films &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947), as well as &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948) with Jennifer Jones. 

He also developed film projects and sold the packages to other producers. Among the movies that he developed but then sold was Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946). In 1949 he co-produced the Carol Reed picture &quot;The Third Man&quot; with Alexander Korda.

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; overshadowed the rest of Selznick&#x27;s career. Later, he was convinced that he had wasted his life trying to outdo it. A major effort to was &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), which featured future wife Jennifer Jones in the role of the primary character Pearl. With a huge budget, the film is known for causing moral upheaval because of the then risqué script written by Selznick. And though it was a troublesome shoot with a number of directors, the film would be a major success. The film was the second highest-grossing film of 1947 and was the first movie that Martin Scorsese saw, inspiring Scorsese&#x27;s own directorial career.

&quot;I stopped making films in 1948 because I was tired,&quot; Selznick later wrote. &quot;I had been producing, at the time, for twenty years...Additionally it was crystal clear that the motion-picture business was in for a terrible beating from television and other new forms of entertainment, and I thought it a good time to take stock and to study objectively the obviously changing public tastes...Certainly I had no intention of staying away from production for nine years.&quot; Selznick spent most of the 1950s nurturing the career of his second wife, Jennifer Jones. His last film, the big budget production &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957) starring Jones and Rock Hudson, was ill-received. But in 1954, he ventured into television, producing a two-hour extravaganza called &quot;Light&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee,&quot; which, in true Selznick fashion, made TV history by being telecast simultaneously on all four TV networks: CBS, NBC, ABC, and DuMont.

==Personal life==

In 1928, Selznick began an on-again off-again affair with Jean Arthur, one of the actresses under contract at Paramount while he was an executive there. Simultaneously he was dating Irene Gladys Mayer, daughter of MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer.

In 1930, Selznick married Mayer and after living in a series of rented houses they moved into an estate in Beverly Hills, California. It was purchased for them by Mayer&#x27;s father and designed by architect Roland Coate in 1933–1934. They separated in 1945 and divorced in 1948. They had two sons, Jeffrey Selznick (1932–1997) and Daniel Selznick (1936–2024). Daniel, who died in August 2024, would serve as an executive at Universal Pictures for four years and also produced the television mini-series &quot;Blood Feud&quot; and Hoover vs. The Kennedys, among others, and theatrical productions such &quot;The Man with the Perfect Wife&quot;.

In 1949, he married actress Jennifer Jones, whom he had discovered early in her career and mentored. They had one daughter, Mary Jennifer Selznick (1954–1976), who died by suicide by jumping from a 22nd-floor window in Los Angeles on May 11, 1976.

Selznick was an amphetamine user, and often dictated long, rambling memos to his directors, writers, investors, staff and stars. The documentary &quot;Shadowing The Third Man&quot; relates that Selznick introduced &quot;The Third Man&quot; director Carol Reed to the use of amphetamines, which allowed Reed to bring the picture in below budget and on schedule by filming nearly 22 hours at a time.

Selznick was a Republican. On October 18, 1944, the Hollywood Committee, led by Selznick and Cecil B. DeMille, held the Hollywood for Dewey Rally in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket, as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who was Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948. The gathering drew 93,000, with Lionel Barrymore as the master of ceremonies and short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney.

===Accusations of sexual abuse===
Selznick International Pictures employee Anita Colby warned Shirley Temple to be careful if she “found Selznick in stockings.” Temple wrote in her autobiography &quot;Child Star&quot; that this gave her “the impression that casual sex could be a condition of employment” with Selznick. When she was 17, he locked Temple in his office and unsuccessfully attempted to rape her. About the incident Temple wrote:

:“Coming around my side of the desk, he reached and took my hand in his. Glancing down, I saw the telltale stocking feet. Pulling free, I turned for the door, but even more quickly he reached back over the edge of his desk and flicked a switch I had learned from Colby was a remote door-locking device. I was trapped. Like the cartoon of wolf and piglet, once again we circled and reversed directions around his furniture. Blessed with the agility of a young dancer and confronted by an amorous but overweight producer, I had little difficulty avoiding passionate clumsiness.“

== Portrayals in film and television ==
Jonathan Shields, the lead character in the 1952 film &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, was loosely based on Selznick, to the point that Selznick contemplated suing the makers of the film for defamation.

Tony Curtis plays Selznick in the 1980 TV movie &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot;.

Ron Berglas appears as Selznick in the TV movie &quot;RKO 281&quot; (1999). Toby Leonard Moore plays Selznick in the 2020 film &quot;Mank&quot;. Both films are dramatizations of the events surrounding the making of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

Selznick appears as a character in the second season of the anthology series &quot;Feud&quot;, &quot;&quot;. He is portrayed by actor Scott Zimmerman.

==Death==
Selznick died on June 22, 1965, at age 63 following several heart attacks, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. There he joined his older brother Myron Selznick (who had died in 1944) in the family crypt.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, David O. Selznick has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Blvd in front of the historic Hollywood Roosevelt hotel.

<text>Clue is a 1985 American black comedy mystery film based on the board game &quot;Clue&quot;. It was directed by Jonathan Lynn, who cowrote the script with John Landis, and produced by Debra Hill, and it stars the ensemble cast of Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, and Lesley Ann Warren, with Colleen Camp and Lee Ving in supporting roles.

Like the board game, the film has multiple different endings. Each of three possibilities were screened at different theaters, and home media releases include all. The film initially received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office, grossing $14.6 million in the United States against its budget of $15 million, but later developed a considerable cult following.

==Plot==
In 1954, six strangers are ominously invited to a secluded New England mansion. Each guest is greeted by the butler Wadsworth and the maid Yvette, and receives a pseudonym to maintain confidentiality: &quot;Colonel Mustard&quot;, &quot;Mrs. White&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Peacock&quot;, &quot;Mr. Green&quot;, &quot;Professor Plum&quot;, and &quot;Miss Scarlet&quot;. During dinner, they discover they all hold government influence before being joined by Mr. Boddy, who has been blackmailing everyone for some time. Wadsworth has called the police to arrest Boddy, but Boddy threatens to expose everyone&#x27;s secrets if they turn him in. He then presents the six guests with weapons—a candlestick, rope, lead pipe, wrench, revolver, and dagger—and suggests someone kill Wadsworth to protect their secrets before turning out the lights. After a gunshot rings out, Boddy is found on the floor, seemingly dead.

As the guests investigate Boddy&#x27;s death, Wadsworth explains how he became indentured to Boddy and summoned the guests, hoping to force a confession from Boddy and turn him over to the police. As the group suspect the cook, only to find she was fatally stabbed with the dagger, someone discovers Boddy is alive before killing him with the candlestick. Wadsworth locks the weapons in a cupboard, but before he can throw away the key, a stranded motorist arrives and Wadsworth locks him in the lounge before throwing a key out the front door. The group draw lots to pair up before searching the manor. However, someone burns the blackmail evidence, unlocks the cupboard, and kills the motorist with the wrench. Discovering a secret passage, Mustard and Scarlet find themselves locked in the lounge with the motorist&#x27;s corpse. When they scream for help, Yvette shoots the door open with the revolver. The group deduce that Wadsworth threw out the wrong key and the murderer pickpocketed the cupboard key from him.

A cop investigating the motorist&#x27;s abandoned car arrives to use the phone. The mansion receives a call from FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, which Wadsworth takes alone. After successfully distracting the cop and concealing the bodies, the group resumes their search until someone turns off the electricity. In the darkness, Yvette, the cop, and an arriving singing telegram girl are murdered with the rope, pipe, and revolver, respectively. Wadsworth restores the power and gathers the group, having deduced what happened. Recreating the night&#x27;s events and amidst a brief interruption from an evangelist, he explains how the other five victims were Boddy&#x27;s informants who are each connected to one of the guests, which dovetails into one of three possible outcomes.

===&quot;How It Could Have Happened&quot;===
Yvette murdered the cook and Boddy under orders from Scarlet, who then killed her and the other victims. Intending to sell the guests&#x27; secrets, Scarlet prepares to use the revolver to kill Wadsworth, who argues there are no bullets left before disarming her just as law enforcement raid the manor and the evangelist is revealed to be the chief of police. Wadsworth further reveals he is an undercover FBI agent before accidentally firing the last bullet in the revolver at a chandelier, which narrowly misses Mustard as it falls.

===&quot;How About This?&quot;===
Peacock killed all the victims to prevent her exposure for taking bribes from foreign powers before holding the others at gunpoint to escape. To the others&#x27; confused relief, Wadsworth reveals he is an undercover FBI agent. Peacock is arrested outside before law enforcement raid the manor and the evangelist is revealed to be the chief of police.

===&quot;Here&#x27;s What Really Happened&quot;===
Apart from Green, everyone committed one murder: Peacock killed the cook, Plum killed Boddy, Mustard killed the motorist, Scarlet killed the cop, White killed Yvette, and Wadsworth killed the singing telegram girl. Holding the guests at gunpoint, Wadsworth reveals he is the real Boddy, Plum killed the real butler, and announces his intent to continue blackmailing them. However, Green draws his own revolver and kills Boddy. He then reveals he is an undercover FBI agent sent to investigate Boddy before letting in law enforcement and the evangelist, who is revealed to be the chief of police, to arrest everyone.

==Production==
===Development===
Producer Debra Hill initially acquired the rights to adapt the game from Parker Brothers and intended to distribute through Universal Pictures. As early as 1981, Hill mentioned plans to adapt the game into a movie, with P. D. James reported to be writing the screenplay with multiple endings.

===Screenplay===
The multiple endings were developed by John Landis, who had initially been set to direct, and who claimed in an interview to have invited playwright Tom Stoppard, writer and composer Stephen Sondheim, and actor Anthony Perkins to write the screenplay. The script was ultimately finished by Jonathan Lynn, who was invited to direct as a result.

A fourth ending was written for the film; according to Lynn, &quot;It really wasn&#x27;t very good. I looked at it, and I thought, &#x27;No, no, no, we&#x27;ve got to get rid of that.&#x27;&quot; In it, Wadsworth committed all the murders, and reveals he poisoned the champagne, leaving no witnesses when the six guests soon die. The officers arrive and capture Wadsworth, but he breaks free and steals a police car, though his escape is ultimately thwarted when three police dogs lunge from the back seat.

===Casting===
Carrie Fisher was originally cast to portray Miss Scarlet, but withdrew to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; she was replaced with Lesley Ann Warren. Jonathan Lynn&#x27;s first choice for Wadsworth was Leonard Rossiter, but he died before filming commenced. The second choice was Rowan Atkinson, but it was decided that he was not sufficiently well known at the time, so Tim Curry was cast. The entire cast received the same salary and billing, despite their different levels of notability at the time.

===Filming===
&quot;Clue&quot; was filmed on sound stages 17 and 18 at the Paramount Pictures film studios in Hollywood. The set design is credited to Les Gobruegge, Gene Nollmanwas, and William B. Majorand, with set decoration by Thomas L. Roysden. To decorate the interior sets, authentic 18th- and 19th-century furnishings were rented from private collectors, including the estate of Theodore Roosevelt. After completion, the set was bought by the producers of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, who used it as the fictional hotel The Carlton.

All interior scenes were filmed at the Paramount lot, except the ballroom scene. The ballroom and two driveway exteriors were filmed on location at a mansion in South Pasadena, California. This site was destroyed in a fire on October 5, 2005. The driveway and fountain were recreated on the Paramount lot and used for most shots, including the guests&#x27; arrivals. Exterior shots of the South Pasadena mansion were enhanced with matte paintings to make the house appear much larger; these were executed by matte artist Syd Dutton in consultation with Albert Whitlock.

Jonathan Lynn screened &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; for the cast as inspiration for how to deliver their lines. Madeline Kahn improvised her monologue about &quot;flames.&quot;

==Release==
The film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985. Each theater received one of the three endings, and some theaters announced which ending the viewer would see.

===Novelizations===
The novelization based on the screenplay is by Michael McDowell. Landis, Lynn, and Ann Matthews wrote the youth adaptation &quot;Clue: The Storybook&quot;. Both adaptations were published in 1985, and feature a fourth ending cut from the film: in a variation on the-butler-did-it trope, Wadsworth explains how he killed Boddy and the other victims, then reveals to the guests that they&#x27;ve all been poisoned, leaving no witnesses to his perfect crime. As Wadsworth proceeds to disable the phones, the police chief (having previously posed as an evangelist) returns with a squad of officers who disarm Wadsworth. He nonetheless manages to escape, and attempts to get away in a police car, only to crash after Dobermanns attack from the back seat.

===Home media===
The film was released to home video for both VHS and Betamax videocassette formats in Canada and the United States on August 20, 1986, and to other countries on February 11, 1991. It was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment in June 17, 2000, and on Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution on August 7, 2012.

On December 12, 2023, Shout! Factory released a 4K UHD Blu-ray collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;Clue.&quot; It includes new interviews with director Jonathan Lynn and production manager Jeffrey Chernov.

The home video, television broadcasts, and on-demand streaming by services such as Netflix include all three endings shown sequentially, with the first two characterized as possible endings but the third being the only true one. All Blu-ray and DVD versions offer viewers the option to watch the endings separately (chosen randomly by the player), and the &quot;home entertainment version&quot; ending with all three of them stitched together.

===Soundtrack===
La-La Land Records released the John Morris score as a limited-edition CD soundtrack in February 2011. For the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2015, Mondo issued a limited-edition 180-gram vinyl pressed on six different character-themed color variants. A vinyl reissue from Enjoy The Ride Records followed in 2022.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film initially received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned it, writing that the beginning &quot;is the only part of the film that is remotely engaging. After that, it begins to drag&quot;. Similarly, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, &quot;&quot;Clue&quot; offers a few big laughs early on followed by a lot of characters running around on a treadmill to nowhere.&quot; Siskel particularly criticized the decision to release the film to theaters with three separate endings, calling it a &quot;gimmick&quot; that would distract audiences from the rest of the film, and concluding, &quot;&quot;Clue&quot; is a movie that needs three different middles rather than three different endings.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that it has a &quot;promising&quot; cast but the &quot;screenplay is so very, very thin that [the actors] spend most of their time looking frustrated, as if they&#x27;d just been cut off right before they were about to say something interesting&quot;. On &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, both agreed that the &quot;A&quot; ending was the best while the &quot;C&quot; ending was the worst.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A robust ensemble of game actors elevate &quot;Clue&quot; above its schematic source material, but this farce&#x27;s reliance on novelty over organic wit makes its entertainment value a roll of the dice.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Clue&quot; has grossed $14.6 million in North America, just short of its $15 million budget.

==Remake==
Hasbro Entertainment established deals in April 2024 with TriStar Pictures and Sony Pictures Television for new screen adaptations of the board game. Screenwriter Shay Hatten has been in talks for the new film script.

Previous plans for a remake or reboot have languished for years. Initially Gore Verbinski was developing a new &quot;Clue&quot; film in 2009, which was dropped by Universal Studios in 2011. Hasbro Studios moved the project to 20th Century Fox by August 2016, envisioned as a &quot;worldwide mystery&quot; with action-adventure elements, potentially establishing a franchise with international appeal. Ryan Reynolds optioned a three-year first-look deal in January 2018, planning to star in the remake, with a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Jason Bateman was briefly attached to the film in September 2019, followed by James Bobin attached as director in February 2020, with Oren Uziel hired to rewrite the script in August 2022. Hasbro sought new rights deals for &quot;Clue&quot; in February 2024.

==Stage adaptations==

The screenplay was adapted from film to stage in 2017 by the original screenwriter Jonathan Lynn. &quot;&quot; premiered in 2017 at Bucks County Playhouse, adapted by Hunter Foster with additional material by Eric Price. It was directed by Foster and starred Sally Struthers and Erin Dilly. A revised adaptation by Sandy Rustin, incorporating material from Foster and Price, was first performed in 2020. Rustin&#x27;s adaptation was described as &quot;a welcome throwback to an era of physical comedy&quot;. The stage adaptations have been performed widely.

A national tour of the mystery-comedy play launched in 2024, directed by Casey Hushion.

==In other media==
The 2013 &quot;Psych&quot; episode &quot;100 Clues&quot; features &quot;Clue&quot; stars Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, and Lesley Ann Warren as suspects in a series of murders at a mansion. The episode, in addition to many jokes and themes in homage to the film, includes multiple endings in which the audience (separately for East and West Coast viewership) decides who is the real killer. The episode was dedicated to the memory of Madeline Kahn.

Warren guest starred on a 2019 episode of Mull&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Cool Kids&quot; as a love interest for his character. Her role announcement in November 2018 was initially touted by the press as a &quot;Clue&quot; reunion, though only Mull and Warren appear.

<text>Jennifer Jones (born Phylis Lee Isley; March 2, 1919 – December 17, 2009), also known as Jennifer Jones Simon, was an American actress and mental-health advocate. Over the course of her career that spanned more than five decades, she was nominated for an Academy Award five times, including one win for Best Actress, and a Golden Globe Award win for Best Actress in a Drama.

A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Jones worked as a model in her youth before transitioning to acting, appearing in two serial films in 1939. Her third role was a lead part as Bernadette Soubirous in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), which earned her the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress. She went on to star in several films that garnered her significant critical acclaim and a further three Academy Award nominations in the mid-1940s, including &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1945) and &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946).

In 1949, Jones married film producer David O. Selznick and appeared as the eponymous Madame Bovary in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s 1949 adaptation. She appeared in several films throughout the 1950s, including &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; (1952), John Huston&#x27;s adventure comedy &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953) and Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s drama &quot;Terminal Station&quot; (1953). Jones earned her fifth Academy Award nomination for her performance as a Eurasian doctor in &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; (1955). After Selznick&#x27;s death in 1965, Jones married industrialist Norton Simon and entered semiretirement. She made her final film appearance in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).

Jones suffered from mental-health problems during her life. After her 22 year-old daughter, Mary Jennifer Selznick, took her own life in 1976, Jones became deeply involved in mental health education. In 1980, she founded the Jennifer Jones Simon Foundation for Mental Health and Education. Jones enjoyed a quiet retirement, living the last six years of her life in Malibu, California, where she died of natural causes in 2009 at the age of 90.

==Biography==
===1919–1939: Early life===
Jones was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the daughter of Flora Mae (née Suber) and Phillip Ross Isley. Her father was originally from Georgia, and her mother was a native of Sacramento, California. She was an only child, and she was raised Catholic. Her parents, both aspiring stage actors, toured the Midwest in a traveling tent show that they owned and operated. Jones accompanied them, performing on occasion as part of the Isley Stock Company.

In 1925, Jones enrolled at Edgemere Public School in Oklahoma City, then attended Monte Cassino, a Catholic girls school and junior college in Tulsa. After graduating, she enrolled as a drama major at Northwestern University in Illinois, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority before transferring to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in September 1937. It was there that she met and fell in love with fellow acting student Robert Walker, a native of Ogden, Utah. They married on January 2, 1939.

Jones and Walker returned to Tulsa for a 13-week radio program arranged by her father and then moved to Hollywood. She landed two small roles, first in the 1939 John Wayne Western &quot;New Frontier&quot;, which she filmed in the summer of 1939 for Republic Pictures. Her second project was the serial titled &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s G-Men&quot; (1939), also for Republic. In both films, she was credited as Phylis Isley. After failing a screen test for Paramount Pictures, she became disenchanted with Hollywood and returned to New York City.

===1940–1948: Career beginnings===
Shortly after Jones married Walker, she gave birth to two sons: Robert Walker Jr. (1940–2019), and Michael Walker (1941–2007). While Walker found steady work in radio programs, Jones worked part-time modeling hats for the Powers Agency, and posing for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; while looking for acting jobs. When she learned of auditions for the lead role in Rose Franken&#x27;s hit play &quot;Claudia&quot; in the summer of 1941, she presented herself to David O. Selznick&#x27;s New York office but fled in tears after what she thought was a bad reading. However, Selznick had overheard her audition and was impressed enough to have his secretary call her back. Following an interview, she was signed to a seven-year contract.
She was carefully groomed for stardom and given a new name: Jennifer Jones. Director Henry King was impressed by her screen test as Bernadette Soubirous for &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), and she won the coveted role over hundreds of applicants. In 1944, on her 25th birthday, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Bernadette, her third screen role.

Simultaneously to her rise in prominence for &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;, Jones began an affair with producer Selznick. She separated from Walker in November 1943, co-starred with him in &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), and formally divorced him in June 1945. For her performance in &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;, she was nominated for her second Academy Award, this time for Best Supporting Actress. She earned a third successive Academy Award nomination for her performance with Joseph Cotten in &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1945).

Jones&#x27;s saintly image from her first starring role was starkly contrasted three years later when she was cast as a biracial woman in Selznick&#x27;s controversial &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), in which she portrayed a mixed-race indigenous (mestiza) orphan in Texas who falls in love with a white man (Gregory Peck). 

Also in 1946, she starred as the title character in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Cluny Brown&quot; as a working-class English woman who falls in love just before World War II. She next appeared in the fantasy film &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948), again costarring with Cotten. The film was based on the novella of the same name by Robert Nathan. However, it was a commercial failure, grossing only $1.5 million against a $4 million budget.

===1949–1964: Marriage to Selznick===

Jones married Selznick at sea on July 13, 1949, en route to Europe after a five-year relationship. Over the following two decades, she appeared in numerous films that he produced, and they established a working relationship. In 1949, Jones starred opposite John Garfield in John Huston&#x27;s adventure film &quot;We Were Strangers&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Jones&#x27;s performance was lacking, noting: &quot;There is neither understanding nor passion in the stiff, frigid creature she achieves.&quot; She was subsequently cast as the title character of Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1949), a role originally intended for Lana Turner that Turner declined. &quot;Variety&quot; deemed the film &quot;interesting to watch, but hard to feel,&quot; although it noted that &quot;Jones answers to every demand of direction and script.&quot; In 1950, Jones starred in the Powell and Pressburger-directed fantasy &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; as a superstitious gypsy woman in the English countryside.

Jones next starred in William Wyler&#x27;s drama &quot;Carrie&quot; (1952) with Laurence Olivier. Crowther criticized her performance, writing: &quot;Mr. Olivier gives the film its closest contact with the book, while Miss Jones&#x27; soft, seraphic portrait of Carrie takes it furthest away.&quot; Also in 1952, she costarred with Charlton Heston in &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot;, playing a &quot;femme fatale&quot; in rural North Carolina who becomes embroiled in a murder conspiracy after marrying a local man. The role was previously offered to Joan Fontaine, who felt that she was &quot;unsuited to play backwoods.&quot; In its review, &quot;Variety&quot; deemed the film a &quot;sordid drama [with] neither Jennifer Jones nor Charlton Heston gaining any sympathy in their characters.&quot;
In 1953, Jones was cast opposite Montgomery Clift in Italian director Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Terminal Station&quot; (), a drama set in Rome about a romance between an American woman and an Italian man. The film, produced by Selznick, had a troubled production history, and Selznick and De Sica clashed over the screenplay and tone of the film. Clift sided with De Sica and reportedly called Selznick &quot;an interfering fuck-face&quot; on set. Aside from the tensions between cast and crew, Jones was mourning the recent death of her first husband Robert Walker, and also missed her two sons, who were staying in Switzerland during production. &quot;Terminal Station&quot; was screened at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival and was released in a heavily truncated form in the United States with the title &quot;Indiscretion of an American Wife&quot;. Also in 1953, Jones teamed again with director John Huston to star in his film &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953), an adventure comedy costarring Humphrey Bogart. The film was a box-office flop and was critically panned upon release, and Bogart distanced himself from it. However, it was reevaluated in later years by critics such as Roger Ebert, who included it in his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot; and cited it as the first &quot;camp&quot; film. In August 1954, Jones gave birth to her third child, daughter Mary Jennifer Selznick.

Jones was cast as Chinese-born doctor Han Suyin in the drama &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; (1955), a role that brought her fifth Academy Award nomination. Crowther lauded her performance as &quot;... lovely and intense. Her dark beauty reflects sunshine and sadness.&quot; Next, she starred as a schoolteacher in &quot;Good Morning, Miss Dove&quot; (1955), followed by a lead role in &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot;, a drama about a World War II veteran.

In 1957, she starred as the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the historical drama &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, based on the 1930 play by Rudolf Besier. She next played the lead role in the Ernest Hemingway adaptation &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957). The film received mixed reviews, with &quot;Variety&quot; noting that &quot;the relationship between Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones never takes on real dimensions.&quot; Jones&#x27;s next project came five years later with the F. Scott Fitzgerald adaptation &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; (1962).

===1965–2009: Later life and activities===
Selznick died at age 63 on June 22, 1965, and after his death, Jones semiretired from acting. Her first role in four years was a lead part in the British drama &quot;The Idol&quot; (1966) as the mother of an adult son in Swinging Sixties London who has an affair with his best friend. 

In 1966, Jones made a rare theatrical appearance in the revival of Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;The Country Girl&quot;, costarring Rip Torn, at New York&#x27;s City Center. On November 9, 1967, the same day on which her close friend Charles Bickford died of a blood infection, Jones attempted suicide. Informing her physician of her intention to jump from a cliff overlooking Malibu Beach, she swallowed barbiturates before walking to the base of the cliff, where she was found unconscious amidst the rocky surf. According to biographer Paul Green, it was news of Bickford&#x27;s death that triggered Jones&#x27;s suicide attempt. She was hospitalized in a coma from the incident. She returned to film with &quot;Angel, Angel, Down We Go&quot; in 1969, about a teenage girl who uses her association with a rock band to manipulate her family.
On May 29, 1971, Jones married her third husband Norton Simon, a multimillionaire industrialist, art collector and philanthropist from Portland, Oregon. The wedding took place aboard a tugboat five miles off the English coast and was conducted by Unitarian minister Eirion Phillips. Years before, Simon had attempted to buy the portrait of Jones that was used in the film &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot;. Simon later met Jones at a party hosted by fellow industrialist and art collector Walter Annenberg. Jones&#x27;s last film appearance came in the disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). Her performance as a doomed guest in the building earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Early scenes in the film showed paintings lent to the production by the art gallery of Jones&#x27;s husband Simon.

On May 11, 1976, Jones&#x27;s 21-year-old daughter Mary, a student at Occidental College, committed suicide by jumping from the roof of a 22-floor apartment hotel in downtown Los Angeles. This led to Jones&#x27;s interest in mental health issues. In 1979, with husband Simon (whose son Robert died by suicide in 1969), she founded the Jennifer Jones Simon Foundation for Mental Health and Education, which she ran until 2003. One of Jones&#x27;s primary goals with the foundation was to destigmatize mental illness. In 1980, Jones said: &quot;I cringe when I admit I&#x27;ve been suicidal, had mental problems, but why should I? I hope we can reeducate the world to see there&#x27;s no more need for stigma in mental illness than there is for cancer.&quot; She also divulged that she had been a psychotherapy patient since age 24.

Jones spent the remainder of her life outside of the public eye. Four years before the death of her husband Simon in June 1993, he resigned as president of Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California, and Jones was appointed chairman of the board of trustees, president and executive officer. In 1996, she began working with architect Frank Gehry and landscape designer Nancy Goslee Power to renovate the museum and gardens. She remained active as the director of the museum until 2003, when she was awarded emerita status.

== Personal life ==
Jones was a registered Republican who supported Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign in the 1952 presidential election.

Jones suffered from shyness for much of her life and avoided discussing her past and personal life with journalists. She was also averse to discussing critical analysis of her work. Public discussion of her working relationship with Selznick often overshadowed her career. Biographer Paul Green contends that, while Selznick helped facilitate her career and sought roles for her, &quot;Jones excelled because she not only possessed outstanding beauty but she also possessed genuine talent.&quot;

==Death==

Jones enjoyed a quiet retirement, living with her eldest child, son Robert Walker Jr., and his family in Malibu for the last six years of her life. Jones&#x27;s younger son, actor Michael Ross Walker, died from cardiac arrest on December 23, 2007, at age 66, while Robert Jr. died on December 5, 2019, at age 79.

Jones participated in Gregory Peck&#x27;s AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony in 1989 and appeared at the 70th (1998) and 75th (2003) Academy Awards as part of the shows&#x27; tributes to past Oscar winners. In the last six years of her life, she granted no interviews and rarely appeared in public. She died of natural causes on December 17, 2009, at age 90. She was cremated and her ashes were interred with her second husband in the Selznick private room at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

Minor planet 6249 Jennifer is named in her honor.

<doc id="67376" wikidata="Q58559" url="?curid=67376" title="Pope Leo IX">
<text>Pope Leo IX (21 June 1002 – 19 April 1054), born Bruno von Egisheim-Dagsburg, was the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 12 February 1049 to his death in 1054. Leo IX is considered to be one of the most historically significant popes of the Middle Ages; he was instrumental in the precipitation of the Great Schism of 1054, considered the turning point in which the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches formally separated.

Leo IX favoured traditional morality in his reformation of the Catholic Church. One of his first public acts was to hold the Easter synod of 1049; he joined Emperor Henry III in Saxony and accompanied him to Cologne and Aachen. He also summoned a meeting of the higher clergy in Reims in which several important reforming decrees were passed. At Mainz, he held a council at which the Italian and French as well as the German clergy were represented, and ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor were present. Here too, simony and clerical marriage were the principal matters dealt with. He is regarded as a saint by the Catholic Church; his feast day is celebrated on 19 April.

==Early life==
Bruno was born to Count Hugh IV of Nordgau and Heilwig of Dabo and was a native of Egisheim, Upper Alsace (present-day Alsace, France). His father was a first cousin of Conrad II, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. At the age of five, Bruno was committed to the care of Berthold, Bishop of Toul, who had a school for the sons of the nobility.

In 1017, Bruno became a canon at St. Stephen&#x27;s in Toul. When, in 1024, his cousin Conrad succeeded Henry II as emperor, Bruno&#x27;s relatives sent him to the new king&#x27;s court &quot;to serve in his chapel&quot;.

Bruno was a deacon in 1026 when Conrad set out for Italy to make his authority respected in that portion of his dominions, and as Herimann, Bishop of Toul, was too old to lead his contingent into the peninsula, he entrusted the command of it to Bruno. While he was thus in the midst of arms, Bishop Herimann died and Bruno was at once elected to succeed him. Conrad, who destined him for higher things, was loath to allow him to accept that insignificant see. But Bruno induced the emperor to permit him to take the see. Consecrated in 1027, Bruno administered the Diocese of Toul for over twenty years, during a time of stress and trouble. He had to contend not merely with famine, but also with war, to which as a frontier town Toul was much exposed. Bruno rendered important political services to Conrad II, and afterwards to Emperor Henry III. He knew how to make peace, and, if necessary, to wield the sword in self-defence. Sent by Conrad to Robert the Pious, he established so firm a peace between France and the empire that it was not again broken even during the reigns of the sons of both Conrad and Robert. On the other hand, he held his episcopal city against Count Odo II of Blois, a rebel against Conrad, and &quot;by his wisdom and exertions&quot; added Burgundy to the empire.

Bruno became widely known as an earnest and reforming ecclesiastic by the zeal he showed in spreading the rule of the order of Cluny. It was whilst he was bishop that he was saddened by the death not merely of his father and mother, but also of two of his brothers. Bruno found some consolation in music, in which he proved himself highly proficient.

==Papacy==
On the death of Pope Damasus II in 1048, Bruno was selected as his successor by an assembly at Worms in December. Both the emperor and the Roman delegates concurred. However, Bruno apparently favoured a canonical election and stipulated as a condition of his acceptance that he should first proceed to Rome and be freely elected by the voice of the clergy and people of Rome. Setting out shortly after Christmas, he met with abbot Hugh of Cluny at Besançon, where he was joined by the young monk Hildebrand, who afterwards became Pope Gregory VII; arriving in pilgrim garb at Rome in the following February, he was received with much cordiality, and at his consecration assumed the name Leo IX.

===Theology===

Leo IX favoured celibacy for the clergy in his reformation of the Catholic Church. One of his first public acts was to hold the well-known Easter synod of 1049, at which celibacy of the clergy (down to the rank of subdeacon) was required anew. Also, the Easter synod was where the pope at least succeeded in making clear his own convictions against every kind of simony. The greater part of the year that followed was occupied by one of those progresses through Italy, Germany and France which form a marked feature in Leo IX&#x27;s pontificate. After presiding over a synod at Pavia, he joined Henry III in Saxony and accompanied him to Cologne and Aachen. He also summoned a meeting of the higher clergy in Reims in which several important reforming decrees were passed. At Mainz he held a council at which the Italian and French as well as the German clergy were represented, and ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor were present. Here too, simony and the marriage of the clergy were the principal matters dealt with.

After his return to Rome, Leo held another Easter synod on 29 April 1050. It was occupied largely with the controversy about the teachings of Berengar of Tours. In the same year he presided over provincial synods at Salerno, Siponto and Vercelli, and in September revisited his native Germany, returning to Rome in time for a third Easter synod at which the question of the reordination of those who had been ordained by simonists was considered. In 1052 he joined the emperor at Pressburg and vainly sought to secure the submission of the Hungarians. At Regensburg, Bamberg and Worms, the papal presence was celebrated with various ecclesiastical solemnities. In early 1053, Leo arbitrated a dispute between the archbishop of Carthage and the bishop of Gummi-Mahdia over ecclesiastical precedence.

===Relations with Constantinople===
Patriarch Michael I Cerularius of Constantinople, through Leo of Ohrid, Archbishop of Bulgaria, wrote to the pope denouncing the use of unleavened bread and fasting days in the Latin Church. Leo IX sent a letter to Michael I in 1054, citing a large portion of the Donation of Constantine, believing it was genuine. 

Leo assured Michael that the donation was completely genuine, not a fable, so only the apostolic successor to Peter possessed that primacy and was the rightful head of all the Church. Before his death, Leo IX had sent a legatine mission under Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida to Constantinople to negotiate with Patriarch Michael Cerularius in response to his actions concerning the Church in Constantinople. Humbert quickly disposed of negotiations by delivering a bull excommunicating the Patriarch. This act, although legally invalid due to the pope&#x27;s death at the time, was answered by the patriarch&#x27;s own bull of excommunication against Humbert and his associates and is popularly considered the official split between the Eastern and Western Churches. Afterwards, he closed down the Latin churches of Constantinople, stopped remembrance for the pope in the diptychs, and wrote letters to the other patriarchs against the pope. The patriarch of Antioch, Peter III, rejected most of Michael&#x27;s accusations against Rome and urged him to compromise. Despite this, the break began the Great East–West Schism.

===Conflict with the Normans===
In constant fear of attack from the Normans in the south of Italy, the Byzantines turned in desperation to the Normans&#x27; own spiritual chief, Pope Leo IX, and, according to William of Apulia, begged him &quot;to liberate Italy that now lacks its freedom and to force that wicked people, who are pressing Apulia under their yoke, to leave&quot;. After a fourth Easter synod in 1053, Leo IX set out against the Norman in the south with an army of Italians and Swabian mercenaries. &quot;As fervent Christians the Normans were reluctant to fight their spiritual leader and tried to sue for peace but the Swabians mocked them—battle was inevitable.&quot; Leo IX led the army himself, but his forces suffered total defeat at the Battle of Civitate on 15 June 1053. Nonetheless, on going out from the city to meet the victorious enemy he was received with every token of submission, pleas for forgiveness and oaths of fidelity and homage. From June 1053 to March 1054 the pope was nevertheless held hostage at Benevento, in honourable captivity, until he acknowledged the Norman conquests in Calabria and Apulia. He did not long survive his return to Rome, where he died on 19 April 1054.

<text>&#x27; (born &#x27;; 19 May 1890 – 2 September 1969), colloquially known as Uncle Ho () and by other aliases and sobriquets, was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician who served as the founder and first president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1945 until his death in 1969, and as its first prime minister from 1945 to 1955. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist, he founded the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930 and its successor Workers&#x27; Party of Vietnam (later the Communist Party of Vietnam) in 1951, serving as the party&#x27;s chairman until his death.

 was born in Nghệ An province in French Indochina, and received a French education. Starting in 1911, he worked in various countries overseas, and in 1920 was a founding member of the French Communist Party in Paris. After studying in Moscow, Hồ founded the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in 1925, which he transformed into the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930. On his return to Vietnam in 1941, he founded and led the independence movement against the Japanese, and in 1945 led the August Revolution against the monarchy and proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After the French returned to power, Hồ&#x27;s government retreated to the countryside and initiated guerrilla warfare from 1946.

Between 1953 and 1956, Hồ&#x27;s leadership saw the implementation of a land reform campaign, which included executions and political purges. The Việt Minh defeated the French in 1954 at the Battle of, ending the First Indochina War. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, Vietnam was divided into two de facto separate states, with the Việt Minh in control of North Vietnam, and anti-communists backed by the United States in control of South Vietnam. Hồ remained president and party leader during the Vietnam War, which began in 1955. He supported the Viet Cong insurgency in the south, overseeing the transport of troops and supplies on the Ho Chi Minh trail until his death in 1969. North Vietnam won in 1975, and the country was re-unified in 1976 as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Saigon – Gia Định, South Vietnam&#x27;s former capital, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honor.

The details of &#x27;s life before he came to power in Vietnam are uncertain. He is known to have used between 50 and 200 pseudonyms. Information on his birth and early life is ambiguous and subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places, and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely. Aside from being a politician, was a writer, poet, and journalist. He wrote several books, articles, and poems in Chinese, Vietnamese, and French.

==Early life==
Hồ Chí Minh was born as Nguyễn Sinh Cung in 1890 in the village of Làng Chùa or Hoàng Trù in Kim Liên commune, Nam Đàn district, Nghệ An province, in Central Vietnam which was then a French protectorate. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years: 1891, 1892, 1894 and 1895. He lived in his father Nguyễn Sinh Sắc&#x27;s village of Làng Sen in Kim Liên until 1895 when his father sent him to Huế for study. He had three siblings: his sister Bạch Liên (Nguyễn Thị Thanh), a clerk in the French Army; his brother Nguyễn Sinh Khiêm (Nguyễn Tất Đạt), a geomancer and traditional herbalist; and another brother (Nguyễn Sinh Nhuận), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Hồ) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vương Thúc Quý. He quickly mastered chữ Hán, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing. In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name at the age of 10: &quot;Nguyễn Tất Thành.&quot;

His father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe (Qui Nhơn). He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the cane as punishment for an infraction. His father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy, but he refused because it meant serving the French. This exposed Thành (Hồ) to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province. Nevertheless, he received a French education, attending &quot;Collège Quốc học&quot; (&quot;lycée&quot; or secondary education) in Huế in Central Vietnam. His disciples, Phạm Văn Đồng and Võ Nguyên Giáp, also attended the school, as did Ngô Đình Diệm, the future President of South Vietnam and political rival.

His early life is uncertain but there are some documents indicating activities regarding an early revolutionary spirit during French-occupied Vietnam, but conflicting sources remain. Previously, it was believed that Thành (Hồ) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-&quot;corvée&quot;) demonstration of poor peasants in Huế in May 1908, which endangered his student status at &quot;Collège Quốc học&quot;. However, a document from the Centre des archives d&#x27;Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to &quot;Collège Quốc học&quot; on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-&quot;corvée&quot; demonstration (9–13 April 1908).

==Overseas==
===In France===
In Saigon, he applied to work as a kitchen helper on a French merchant steamer, the &quot;Amiral de Latouche-Tréville&quot;, using the alias Văn Ba. The ship departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in Marseille, France on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for Le Havre and Dunkirk, returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial School but did not succeed. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visiting many countries from 1911 to 1917.

===In the United States===
While working as the cook&#x27;s helper on a ship in 1912, Thành (Hồ) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City (Harlem) and Boston, where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the Parker House Hotel. The only evidence that he was in the United States is a single letter to French colonial administrators dated 15 December 1912 and postmarked New York City (he gave his address as the poste restante in Le Havre and his occupation as a sailor) and a postcard to Phan Chu Trinh in Paris where he mentioned working at the Omni Parker House Hotel. Inquiries to the Parker House management revealed no records of his ever having worked there. It is believed that while in the US he made contact with Korean nationalists, an experience that developed his political outlook. Sophie Quinn-Judge states that this is &quot;in the realm of conjecture&quot;. He was also influenced by Pan-Africanist and black nationalist Marcus Garvey during his stay, and said he attended meetings of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.

===In Britain===

At various points from 1913 to 1919, Thành (Hồ) claimed to have lived in West Ealing and later in Crouch End, Hornsey. He reportedly worked as either a chef or dishwasher (reports vary) at the Drayton Court Hotel in West Ealing. Claims that he was trained as a pastry chef under Auguste Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, Westminster are not supported by documentary evidence. However, the wall of New Zealand House, home of the New Zealand High Commission which now stands on the site of the Carlton Hotel, displays a blue plaque. During 1913, Thành was also employed as a pastry chef on the Newhaven–Dieppe ferry route.

==Political education in France==
From 1919 to 1923, Thành (Hồ) began to show an interest in politics while living in France, being influenced by his friend and French Section of the Workers&#x27; International comrade Marcel Cachin. Thành claimed to have arrived in Paris from London in 1917, but the French police had only documents recording his arrival in June 1919. When he arrived, he met a scholar named Phan Châu Trinh as well as his friend Phan Văn Trường. In Paris he joined the &quot;Groupe des Patriotes Annamites&quot; (The Group of Vietnamese Patriots) that included Phan Chu Trinh, Phan Văn Trường, and Nguyễn An Ninh. They had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for Vietnamese independence under the pseudonym Nguyễn Ái Quốc (&quot;Nguyễn the Patriot&quot;) prior to Thành&#x27;s arrival in Paris. The group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the Vietnamese people in French Indochina to the Western powers at the Versailles peace talks, but they were ignored. Citing the principle of self-determination outlined before the peace accords, they requested the allied powers to end French colonial rule of Vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government.

Before the conference, the group sent their letter to allied leaders, including French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and United States President Woodrow Wilson. They were unable to obtain consideration at Versailles, but the episode would later help establish the future Hồ Chí Minh as the symbolic leader of the anti-colonial movement at home in Vietnam. Since Thành was the public face behind the publication of the document (although it was written by Phan Văn Trường), he soon became known as Nguyễn Ái Quốc, and first used the name in September during an interview with a Chinese newspaper correspondent. Many authors have stated that 1919 was a lost &quot;Wilsonian moment&quot;, where the future Hồ Chí Minh could have adopted a pro-American and less radical position if only President Wilson had received him. However, at the time of the Versailles Conference, Hồ Chí Minh was committed to a socialist program. While the conference was ongoing, Nguyễn Ái Quốc was already delivering speeches on the prospects of Bolshevism in Asia and was attempting to persuade French socialists to join Lenin&#x27;s Communist International. Upon hearing of the October 1920 death of Irish republican hunger striker (and Lord Mayor of Cork) Terence MacSwiney, Quốc (Hồ) was said to have burst into tears and said “a country with a citizen like this will never surrender”.
In December 1920, Quốc (Hồ) became a representative to the Congress of Tours of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International, voted for the Third International, and was a founding member of the French Communist Party. Taking a position in the Colonial Committee of the party, he tried to draw his comrades&#x27; attention towards people in French colonies including Indochina, but his efforts were often unsuccessful. While living in Paris, he reportedly had a relationship with a dressmaker named Marie Brière. As a French police document discovered in 2018, Quốc also had relations with the members of Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea like Kim Kyu-sik, Jo So-ang while in Paris.

During this period, he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as run his Vietnamese nationalist group. In May 1922, he wrote an article for a French magazine criticizing the use of English words by French sportswriters. The article implored Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré to outlaw such Franglais as &quot;le manager&quot;, &quot;le round&quot; and &quot;le knock-out&quot;. His articles and speeches caught the attention of Dmitry Manuilsky, who would soon sponsor his trip to the Soviet Union and under whose tutelage he would become a high-ranking member of the Soviet Comintern.

==In the Soviet Union and China==

In 1923, Quốc (Hồ) left Paris for Moscow carrying a passport with the name Chen Vang, a Chinese merchant, where he was employed by the Comintern, studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East and in January 1924, attended Lenin&#x27;s funeral. Hồ participated in the Fifth Comintern Congress in June 1924 before arriving in Canton (present-day Guangzhou), China in November 1924 using the name Ly Thuy. The Comintern assigned him to assist and interpret for Mikhail Borodin, who was the Comintern envoy to the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee there.

In Canton, Hồ organized the Association of Vietnamese Youth. He opened a political training school for Vietnamese revolutionaries, and in 1925–1926, he organized &quot;Youth Education Classes&quot; and occasionally gave socialist lectures to Vietnamese revolutionary young people living in Canton at the Whampoa Military Academy. These young people would become the seeds of a new revolutionary, pro-communist movement in Vietnam several years later. According to William Duiker, he lived with a Chinese woman, Zeng Xueming (Tăng Tuyết Minh), whom he married on 18 October 1926. When his comrades objected to the match, he told them: &quot;I will get married despite your disapproval because I need a woman to teach me the language and keep house&quot;. She was 21 and he was 36. They married in the same place where Zhou Enlai had married earlier and then lived in the residence of Borodin.

Hoàng Văn Chí, a Vietnamese anti-communist writer, argued that in June 1925 he betrayed Phan Bội Châu, the famous leader of a rival revolutionary faction and his father&#x27;s old friend, to French Secret Service agents in Shanghai for 100,000 piastres. A source states that he later claimed he did it because he expected Châu&#x27;s trial to stir up anti-French sentiment and because he needed the money to establish a communist organization. In &quot;Ho Chi Minh: A Life&quot;, William Duiker considered this hypothesis, but ultimately rejected it. Other sources claim that Nguyễn Thượng Huyện was responsible for Chau&#x27;s capture. Chau, sentenced to lifetime house arrest, never denounced Quốc.

After Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s 1927 anti-communist coup, Quốc (Hồ) left Canton again in April 1927 and returned to Moscow, spending part of the summer of 1927 recuperating from tuberculosis in Crimea before returning to Paris once more in November. He then returned to Asia by way of Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland, and Italy, where he sailed to Bangkok, Thailand, arriving in July 1928. &quot;Although we have been separated for almost a year, our feelings for each other do not have to be said to be felt&quot;, he reassured Zeng in an intercepted letter.

Quốc (Hồ) remained in Thailand, staying in the Thai village of Nachok until late 1929, when he moved on to India and then Shanghai. In Hong Kong in early 1930, he chaired a meeting with representatives from two Vietnamese communist parties to merge them into a unified organization, the Communist Party of Vietnam. He also founded the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). In June 1931, Hồ was arrested by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) as part of a joint operation between the French authorities in Indochina and the HKPF; scheduled to be extradited from Hong Kong to French Indochina, Hồ was successfully defended by British solicitor Frank Loseby. Eventually, after appeals to the British Privy Council, Hồ was reported as dead in 1932 to avoid being extradited to Indochina; it was ruled that, though he would be deported from Hong Kong as an undesirable, it would not be to a destination controlled by France. Hồ was eventually released and escorted to Shantou. He subsequently returned to the Soviet Union and studied and taught at the Lenin Institute in Moscow.

In this period Hồ reportedly lost his positions in the Comintern because of a concern that he had betrayed the organization. However, according to Ton That Thien&#x27;s research, he was a member of the inner circle of the Comintern, a protégé of Dmitry Manuilsky and a member in good standing of the Comintern throughout the Great Purge. Hồ was removed from control of the Party he had founded. At that time, the Comintern emphasized class struggle more than finding common ground with non-communists to oppose imperialism. ICP leadership who replaced criticized Hồ for what they described as his nationalist tendencies. In 1937, Japanese aggression in China and the Nazis&#x27; policies prompted the Comintern to emphasize working with anti-fascist groups among non-communists, and Hồ returned to the party&#x27;s favor. 

In 1938, Quốc (Hồ) returned to China and served as an advisor to the Chinese Communist armed forces. He was also the senior Comintern agent in charge of Asian affairs. He served in the Eighth Route Army branch office in Guilin. In 1939, he served under the command of Marshal Ye Jianying. When France was defeated by Germany in 1940, Hồ and his lieutenants, Võ Nguyên Giáp and Phạm Văn Đồng, saw this as an opportunity to advance their own cause.

In October 1940, Hồ and his supporters established the League for Vietnamese Independence (Việt Minh) in Guilin.

==Independence movement==
In 1941, Hồ Chí Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Việt Minh independence movement. Hồ and ICP founded a communist-led united front to oppose the Japanese.

The Japanese occupation of Indochina that year, the first step toward an invasion of the rest of Southeast Asia, created an opportunity for patriotic Vietnamese. The so-called &quot;men in black&quot; were a 10,000-member guerrilla force that operated with the Việt Minh. He oversaw many successful military actions against the Vichy France and the Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II, supported closely yet clandestinely by the United States Office of Strategic Services and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946–1954). He was jailed in China by Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s local authorities before being rescued by Chinese Communists. Following his release in 1943, he returned to Vietnam. It was during this time that he began regularly using the name Hồ Chí Minh, a Vietnamese name combining a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, ) with a given name meaning &quot;Bright spirit&quot; or &quot;Clear will&quot; (from Sino-Vietnamese : Chí meaning &quot;will&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; and Minh meaning &quot;bright&quot;). His new name was a tribute to General Hou Zhiming (侯志明), Chief Commissar of the 4th Military Region of the National Revolutionary Army, who helped release him from a KMT prison in 1943.
In April 1945, he met with the OSS agent Archimedes Patti and offered to provide intelligence, asking only for &quot;a line of communication&quot; between his Viet Minh and the Allies. The OSS agreed to this and later sent a military team of OSS members to train his men and Hồ Chí Minh himself was treated for malaria and dysentery by an OSS doctor.

Following the August Revolution organized by the Việt Minh, Hồ Chí Minh became Chairman of the Provisional Government (Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although he convinced Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate, his government was not recognized by any country. He repeatedly petitioned President Harry S. Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.

In 1946, future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and Hồ Chí Minh became acquainted when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. He offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam, which Ben-Gurion declined.

In 1946, when he traveled outside of the country, his subordinates imprisoned 2,500 non-Communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed or exiled in July 1946, notably, members of the Nationalist Party of Vietnam and the Dai Viet National Party after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the Viet Minh government. All rival political parties were hereafter banned and local governments were purged to minimize opposition later on. However, it was noted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam&#x27;s first Congress had over two-thirds of its members come from non-Việt Minh political factions, some without an election. Nationalist Party of Vietnam leader Nguyễn Hải Thần was named vice president. They also held four out of ten ministerial positions ().

===Birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam===
Following Emperor Bảo Đại&#x27;s abdication in August, Hồ Chí Minh read the Declaration of Independence of Vietnam on 2 September 1945 under the name of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In Saigon, with violence between rival Vietnamese factions and French forces increasing, the British commander, General Sir Douglas Gracey, declared martial law. On 24 September, the Việt Minh leaders responded with a call for a general strike.

In the same month, a force of 200,000 Chinese National Revolutionary Army troops arrived in Hanoi to accept the surrender of the Japanese occupiers in northern Indochina. Hồ Chí Minh made a compromise with their general, Lu Han, to dissolve the Communist Party and to hold an election that would yield a coalition government. When Chiang forced the French to give the French concessions in Shanghai back to China in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina, he had no choice but to sign an agreement with France on 6 March 1946 in which Vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union. The agreement soon broke down. The purpose of the agreement, for both the French and Vietminh, was for Chiang&#x27;s army to leave North Vietnam. Fighting broke out in the North soon after the Chinese left.

Historian Professor Liam Kelley of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on his &quot;Le Minh Khai&#x27;s Asian History Blog&quot; challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where Hồ Chí Minh said he &quot;would rather smell French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for a thousand,&quot; noting that Stanley Karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to him in his 1983 &quot;Vietnam: A History&quot; and that the original quote was most likely forged by the Frenchman Paul Mus in his 1952 book &quot;Vietnam: Sociologie d&#x27;une Guerre&quot;. Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and Hồ Chí Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam. The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged, while Hồ Chí Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.

The Việt Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of rival Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945–1946, and of the Trotskyists. Trotskyism in Vietnam did not rival the Party outside of the major cities, but particularly in the South, in Saigon-Cochinchina, they had been a challenge. From the outset, they had called for armed resistance to a French restoration and an immediate transfer of industry to workers and land to peasants. The French Socialist leader Daniel Guérin recalls that when in Paris in 1946 he asked Hồ Chí Minh about the fate of the Trotskyist leader Tạ Thu Thâu, Hồ Chí Minh had replied, &quot;with unfeigned emotion,&quot; that &quot;&#x27;Thâu was a great patriot and we mourn him&#x27;, but then a moment later added in a steady voice &#x27;All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.&#x27;&quot;

The Communists eventually suppressed all non-Communist parties, but they failed to secure a peace deal with France. In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the Dalat and Fontainebleau conferences, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by the French Navy only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The attack reportedly killed more than 6,000 Vietnamese civilians in Haiphong. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Hồ Chí Minh declared war against the French Union, marking the beginning of the Indochina War. The Vietnam National Army, mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked. They assaulted the French positions, smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper, destroying armored vehicles with &quot;lunge mines&quot; (a hollow-charge warhead on the end of a pole, detonated by thrusting the charge against the side of a tank; typically a suicide weapon) and Molotov cocktails, holding off attackers by using roadblocks, landmines and gravel. After two months of fighting, the exhausted Việt Minh forces withdrew after systematically destroying any valuable infrastructure. Hồ was mistakenly reported to be captured by a group of French soldiers, led by Jean Étienne Valluy at Việt Bắc, during Operation Léa. The person in question turned out to be a Việt Minh advisor who was killed trying to escape.

According to journalist Bernard Fall, Hồ decided to negotiate a truce after fighting the French for several years. When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Hồ expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of several Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. Hồ Chí Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.

In February 1950, after the Battle of Route Coloniale 4 successfully broke the French border blockade, he met with Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in Moscow after the Soviet Union recognized his government. They all agreed that China would be responsible for backing the Việt Minh. Mao Zedong&#x27;s emissary to Moscow stated in August that China planned to train 60,000–70,000 Viet Minh shortly. The road to the outside world was open for Việt Minh forces to receive additional supplies which would allow them to escalate the fight against the French regime throughout Indochina. At the outset of the conflict, Hồ reportedly told a French visitor: &quot;You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and I will win&quot;. In 1954, the First Indochina War came to an end after the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu, where more than 10,000 French soldiers surrendered to the Viet Minh. The subsequent Geneva Accords peace process partitioned North Vietnam at the 17th parallel.

Arthur Dommen estimates that the Việt Minh killed between 100,000 and 150,000 civilians during the war. Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000–250,000 civilian deaths.

==Becoming president==
The 1954 Geneva Conference concluded the war between France and the Việt Minh, allowing the latter&#x27;s forces to regroup in the North whilst anti-Communist groups settled in the South. Hồ&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Vietnam relocated to Hanoi and became the government of North Vietnam, a Communist-led one-party state. Following the Geneva Accords, there was to be a 300-day period in which people could freely move between the two regions of Vietnam, later known as South Vietnam and North Vietnam. During the 300 days, Ngô Đình Diệm and CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale staged a campaign to convince Northerners to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam&#x27;s Catholics, who were to provide Diệm&#x27;s power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan &quot;God has gone south&quot;. Between 800,000 and 1 million people migrated to the South, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the South.

All the parties at Geneva called for reunification elections, but they could not agree on the details. Recently appointed Việt Minh acting foreign minister Phạm Văn Đồng proposed elections under the supervision of &quot;local commissions&quot;. The United States, with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, suggested United Nations supervision. This plan was rejected by Soviet representative Vyacheslav Molotov, who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and non-communist members, which could determine &quot;important&quot; issues only by unanimous agreement. The negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification. North Vietnam argued that the elections should be held within six months of the ceasefire while the Western allies sought to have no deadline. Molotov proposed June 1955, then later softened this to any time in 1955 and finally July 1956. The Diệm government supported reunification elections, but only with effective international supervision, arguing that genuinely free elections were otherwise impossible in the totalitarian North.
By the afternoon of 20 July 1954, the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and the elections for a reunified government should be held in July 1956, two years after the ceasefire. The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam was only signed by the French and Việt Minh military commands, with no participation or consultation of the State of Vietnam. Based on a proposal by Chinese delegation head Zhou Enlai, an International Control Commission (ICC) chaired by India, with Canada and Poland as members, was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire. Because issues were to be decided unanimously, Poland&#x27;s presence in the ICC provided the Communists with effective veto power over supervision of the treaty. The unsigned Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference called for reunification elections, which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC. The Việt Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections, insisting that the ICC&#x27;s &quot;competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties&quot;. Of the nine nations represented, only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration. Undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith delivered a &quot;unilateral declaration&quot; of the United States position, reiterating: &quot;We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to ensure that they are conducted fairly&quot;.

Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including rent reduction and land reform, which were accompanied with executions of &quot;reactionary and evil landlords.&quot; During the land reform, testimonies by North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution per 160 village residents, which if extrapolated would indicate a nationwide total of nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions was widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although it was likely greater than 13,500. In early 1956, North Vietnam ended the land reform and initiated a &quot;correction of errors&quot; to rectify the mistakes and damage done. That year, Hồ Chí Minh apologised and acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform. As part of the campaign, as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957. By 1958, the correction campaign had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform.

==Vietnam War==

As early as June 1956, the idea of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government was presented at a Politburo meeting. In 1959, Hồ Chí Minh began urging the Politburo to send aid to the Việt Cộng in South Vietnam; a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; on the South was approved at a session in January 1959, and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. North Vietnam invaded Laos in July 1959, aided by the Pathet Lao, and used 30,000 men to build a network of supply and reinforcement routes running through Laos and Cambodia that became known as the Hồ Chí Minh trail. It allowed the North to send manpower and material to the Việt Cộng with much less exposure to South Vietnamese forces, achieving a considerable advantage. To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Việt Cộng was stressed in communist propaganda. North Vietnam created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 as a &quot;united front&quot;, or political branch of the Việt Cộng, intended to encourage the participation of non-Communists.

At the end of 1959, aware that the planned national elections would never be held and that Diệm intended to purge opposing forces (mostly ex-Việt Minh) from South Vietnamese society, Hồ Chí Minh informally chose Lê Duẩn to become the next party leader. This was interpreted by Western analysts as a loss of influence for Hồ, who was said to have preferred the more moderate Võ Nguyên Giáp for the position. From 1959 onward, the elderly Hồ became increasingly worried about the prospect of his death, and that year he wrote down his will. Hồ stepped down as General Secretary of the Vietnam Communist party in September 1960 and Lê Duẩn was officially named party leader, leaving Hồ to function in a secondary role as head of state and member of the Politburo. He nevertheless maintained considerable influence in the government. Lê Duẩn, Tố Hữu, Trường Chinh and Phạm Văn Đồng often shared dinner with Hồ, and all of them remained key figures throughout and after the war. In the early 1960s, the North Vietnamese Politburo was divided into the &quot;North First&quot; faction which favored focusing on the economic development of North Vietnam, and the &quot;South First&quot; faction, which favored a guerrilla war in South Vietnam to reunite the country within the short term. Between 1961 and 1963, 40,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated South Vietnam from the North.

In 1963, Hồ purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Diệm in hopes of achieving a negotiated peace. During the so-called &quot;Maneli Affair&quot; of 1963, a French diplomatic initiative was launched to achieve a federation of the two Vietnams, which would be neutral in the Cold War. The four principal diplomats involved in the Maneli affair were Ramchundur Goburdhun, the Indian Chief Commissioner of the ICC; Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC; Roger Lalouette, the French ambassador to South Vietnam; and Giovanni d&#x27;Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam. Maneli reported that Hồ was very interested in the signs of a split between President Diệm and President Kennedy and that his attitude was: &quot;Our real enemies are the Americans. Get rid of them, and we can cope with Diệm and Nhu afterward&quot;. Hồ and Maneli also discussed the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which passed through officially neutral Cambodia and Laos, saying &quot;Indochina is just one single entity&quot;.

At a meeting in Hanoi held in French, Hồ told Goburdhun that Diệm was &quot;in his way a patriot&quot;, noting that Diệm had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time Goburdhun met Diệm &quot;shake hands with him for me&quot;. The North Vietnamese Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, speaking on behalf of Hồ, told Maneli he was interested in the peace plan, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam &quot;we can agree with any Vietnamese&quot;. On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Ngô Đình Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man to Diệm to discuss the French peace plan. It remains unclear if the Ngo brothers were serious about the French peace plan or were merely using the possibility of accepting it to blackmail the United States into supporting them at a time when the Buddhist crisis had seriously strained relations between Saigon and Washington. Supporting the latter theory is the fact that Nhu promptly leaked his meeting with Maneli to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who publicized it in a column entitled &quot;Very Ugly Stuff&quot;. The possibility that the Ngo brothers might accept the peace plan contributed to the Kennedy administration&#x27;s plan to support a coup against them. On 1 November 1963, a coup overthrew Diệm, who was killed the next day together with his brother.

Diệm had followed a policy of &quot;deconstructing the state&quot; by creating several overlapping agencies and departments that were encouraged to feud with one another to disorganize the South Vietnamese state to such an extent that he hoped that it would make a coup against him impossible. When Diệm was overthrown and killed, without any kind of arbiter between the rival arms of the South Vietnamese state, regime authority in South Vietnam promptly disintegrated. The American Defense Secretary Robert McNamara reported after visiting South Vietnam in December 1963 that &quot;there is no organized government worthy of the name&quot; in Saigon. At a meeting of the plenum of the Politburo in December 1963, Lê Duẩn&#x27;s &quot;South first&quot; faction triumphed, with the Politburo passing a resolution calling for North Vietnam to complete the overthrow of the regime in Saigon as soon as possible; while the members of the &quot;North first&quot; faction were dismissed. As the South descended into chaos, whatever interest Hồ might have had in the French peace plan faded, as it became clear the Việt Cộng could overthrow the Saigon government. A CIA report from 1964 stated that factionalism in South Vietnam had reached &quot;almost the point of anarchy&quot; as various South Vietnamese leaders fought one another, making any sort of concerted effort against the Việt Cộng impossible; leading to much of the South Vietnamese countryside being rapidly taken over by communist guerilla forces.

As South Vietnam collapsed into factionalism and in-fighting while the Việt Cộng continued to win the war, it became increasingly apparent to President Lyndon Johnson that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam. Though Johnson did not wish to commit American forces until he had won the 1964 election, he decided to make his intentions clear to Hanoi. In June 1964, the &quot;Seaborn Mission&quot; began as J. Blair Seaborn, the Canadian commissioner to the ICC, arrived in Hanoi with a message from Johnson offering billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition in exchange for which North Vietnam would cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn also warned that North Vietnam would suffer the &quot;greatest devastation&quot; from American bombing, saying that Johnson was seriously considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Little came of the backchannel of the &quot;Seaborn Mission&quot; as the North Vietnamese distrusted Seaborn, who pointedly was never allowed to meet Hồ.

In late 1964, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam combat troops were sent southwest into officially neutral Laos and Cambodia. By March 1965, American combat troops began arriving in South Vietnam, first to protect the airbases around Chu Lai and Da Nang, later to take on most of the fight as &quot;[m]ore and more American troops were put in to replace Saigon troops who could not or would not, get involved in the fighting&quot;. As fighting escalated, widespread aerial and artillery bombardment all over North Vietnam by the United States Air Force and Navy began with Operation Rolling Thunder. On 8–9 April 1965, Hồ made a secret visit to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. It was agreed that no Chinese combat troops would enter North Vietnam unless the United States invaded North Vietnam, but that China would send support troops to North Vietnam to help maintain the infrastructure damaged by American bombing. There was deep distrust and fear of China within the North Vietnamese Politburo and the suggestion that Chinese troops, even support troops, be allowed into North Vietnam caused outrage in the Politburo. Hồ had to use all his moral authority to obtain Politburo&#x27;s approval.

According to Chen Jian, during the mid-to-late 1960s, Lê Duẩn permitted 320,000 Chinese volunteers into North Vietnam to help build infrastructure for the country, thereby freeing a similar number of PAVN personnel to go south. There are no sources from Vietnam, the United States, or the Soviet Union that confirm the number of Chinese troops stationed in North Vietnam. However, the Chinese government later admitted to sending 320,000 Chinese soldiers to Vietnam during the 1960s and spent over $20 billion to support Hanoi&#x27;s regular North Vietnamese Army and Việt Cộng guerrilla units.

To counter the American bombing, the entire population of North Vietnam was mobilized for the war effort, with vast teams of women being used to repair the damage to roads and bridges done by the aerial bombers, often at a speed that astonished the Americans. The bombing of North Vietnam proved to be the principal obstacle to opening peace talks, as Hồ repeatedly stated that no peace talks would be possible unless the United States unconditionally ceased bombing North Vietnam. Like many of the other leaders of the newly independent states of Asia and Africa, Hồ was extremely sensitive about threats, whether perceived or real, to his nation&#x27;s independence and sovereignty. Hồ regarded the American bombing as a violation of North Vietnam&#x27;s sovereignty, and he felt that to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to bomb North Vietnam should he not behave as they wanted him to do, would diminish North Vietnam&#x27;s independence.

In March 1966, a Canadian diplomat, Chester Ronning, arrived in Hanoi with an offer to use his &quot;good offices&quot; to begin peace talks. However, the Ronning mission foundered upon the bombing issue, as the North Vietnamese demanded an unconditional halt to the bombing, an undertaking that Johnson refused to give. In June 1966, Janusz Lewandowski, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC, was able via d&#x27;Orlandi to see Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the American ambassador to South Vietnam, with an offer from Hồ. Hồ&#x27;s offer for a &quot;political compromise&quot; as transmitted by Lewandowski included allowing South Vietnam to maintain its alliance with the U.S., instead of becoming neutral; having the Việt Cộng &quot;take part&quot; in negotiations for a coalition government, instead of being allowed to automatically enter a coalition government; and allowing a &quot;reasonable calendar&quot; for the withdrawal of American troops instead of an immediate withdrawal. Operation Marigold, as the Lewandowski channel came to be codenamed, almost led to American-North Vietnamese talks in Warsaw in December 1966; but such plans ultimately collapsed over the bombing issue.

In January 1967, General Nguyễn Chí Thanh, the commander of communist forces in South Vietnam, returned to Hanoi to present a plan that became the genesis of the Tet Offensive a year later. Thanh expressed much concern about the Americans invading Laos to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to preempt this possibility, urged an all-out offensive to win the war with a sudden blow. Lê&#x27; Duẩn supported Thanh&#x27;s plans, which were stoutly opposed by the Defense Minister, General Võ Nguyên Giáp, who preferred to continue with guerrilla war, arguing that superior American firepower would ensure the failure of Thanh&#x27;s proposed offensive. With the Politburo divided, it was agreed to study and debate the issue more.

In July 1967, Hồ Chí Minh and most of the Politburo of the Communist Party met in a high-profile conference, where they concluded that the war had fallen into a stalemate. The American military presence forced the PAVN to expend the majority of their resources on maintaining the Hồ Chí Minh trail, rather than reinforcing their comrades&#x27; ranks in the South. Hồ seems to have agreed to Thanh&#x27;s offensive because he wanted to see Vietnam reunified within his lifetime, and the increasingly ailing Hồ was painfully aware that he did not have much time left. With Hồ&#x27;s permission, the Việt Cộng planned a massive offensive that would commence on 31 January 1968, to take much of the South by force and deal a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Việt Cộng&#x27;s political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were &quot;on the ropes&quot;. The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of North Vietnam and the Hồ Chí Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, Hồ Chí Minh and his government&#x27;s strategy materialized: Hanoi&#x27;s terms would eventually be accepted not by engaging in conventional warfare against the might of the United States Army, but by wearing down American resolve through a prolonged guerilla conflict.

In early 1969, Hồ suffered a heart attack and was in increasingly bad health for the rest of the year. In July 1969, Jean Sainteny, a former French official in Vietnam who knew Hồ secretly relayed a letter written to him from President Richard Nixon. Nixon&#x27;s letter proposed working together to end this &quot;tragic war&quot;, but also warned that if North Vietnam made no concessions at the peace talks in Paris by 1 November, Nixon would resort to &quot;measures of great consequence and force&quot;. Hồ&#x27;s reply letter, which Nixon received on 30 August 1969, welcomed peace talks with the U.S. to look for a way to end the war but made no concessions, as Nixon&#x27;s threats made no impression on him.

==Personal life==
In addition to being a politician, Hồ Chí Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot. His father was a scholar and teacher who received a high degree in the Nguyễn dynasty Imperial examination. Hồ was taught to master Classical Chinese at a young age. Before the August Revolution, he often wrote poetry in Chữ Hán, the Vietnamese name for the Chinese writing system. One of those is &quot;Poems from the Prison Diary&quot;, written when he was imprisoned by the police of the Republic of China. This poetry chronicle is Vietnam National Treasure No. 10 and was translated into many languages. It is used in Vietnamese high schools. After Vietnam gained independence from France, the new government exclusively promoted Chữ Quốc Ngữ (Vietnamese writing system in Latin characters) to eliminate illiteracy. Hồ started to create more poems in the modern Vietnamese language for dissemination to a wider range of readers. From when he became president until the appearance of serious health problems, a short poem of his was regularly published in the Tết (Lunar new year) edition of &quot;Nhân Dân&quot; newspaper to encourage his people in working, studying or fighting Americans in the new year.

Because he was in exile for nearly 30 years, Hồ could speak fluently as well as read and write professionally in several different languages, including French, Russian, English, Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as his mother tongue Vietnamese. In addition, he was reported to speak conversational Esperanto. In the 1920s, he was bureau chief/editor of many newspapers which he established to criticize French Colonial Government of Indochina and serving communist propaganda purposes. Examples are &quot;Le Paria&quot; (The Pariah) first published in Paris 1922 or &quot;Thanh Nien&quot; (Youth) first published on 21 June 1925 (21 June was named by The Socialist Republic of Vietnam Government as &quot;Vietnam Revolutionary Journalism Day&quot;). In many state official visits to the Soviet Union and China, he often talked directly to their communist leaders in Russian and Mandarin without interpreters, especially about top-secret information. While being interviewed by Western journalists, he often spoke French, regardless of the language being spoken to him. He spoke Vietnamse with a strong accent from his birthplace in the central province of Nghệ An, but he could still be widely understood throughout the country.

As president, he held formal receptions for foreign heads of state and ambassadors at the Presidential Palace, but he did not personally live there. He ordered the building of a stilt house at the back of the palace, which is today known as the Presidential Palace Historical Site. His hobbies (according to his secretary Vũ Kỳ) included reading, gardening, feeding fish (many of which are still living), and visiting schools and children&#x27;s homes.

Hồ Chí Minh remained in Hanoi during his final years, demanding the unconditional withdrawal of all non-Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam. By 1969, with negotiations still dragging on, his health began to deteriorate from multiple health problems, including diabetes which prevented him from participating in further active politics. However, he insisted that his forces in the South continue fighting until all of Vietnam was reunited regardless of the length of time that it might take, believing that time was on his side.

Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s marriage has long been swathed in secrecy and mystery. He is believed by several scholars of Vietnamese history, to have married a Chinese midwife named Zeng Xueming in October 1926, although only being able to live with her for less than a year. Historian Peter Neville claimed that Hồ (at the time known as Ly Thuy) wanted to engage Zeng in the communist movements but she demonstrated a lack of ability and interest in it. In 1927, the mounting repression of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s KMT against the Chinese Communists compelled Hồ to leave for Hong Kong, and his relationship with Zeng appeared to have ended at that time. In addition to the marriage with Zeng Xueming, there is a number of published studies indicating that Hồ had a romantic relationship with Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai. As a young and high-spirited female revolutionary, Minh Khai was delegated to Hong Kong to serve as an assistant to Ho Chi Minh in April 1930 and quickly drew Hồ&#x27;s attention owing to her physical attractiveness. Hồ even approached the Far Eastern Bureau and requested permission to marry Minh Khai even though the previous marriage with Zeng remained legally valid. However, the marriage was unable to take place since Minh Khai had been detained by the British authorities in April 1931.

==Death==
With the outcome of the Vietnam war still in question, Hồ Chí Minh died of heart failure at his home in Hanoi at 9:47 on the morning of 2 September 1969; he was 79 years old. His embalmed body is currently on display in the President Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Ba Đình Square in Hanoi, despite his will which stated that he wanted to be cremated.

Due to the sensitivity of 2 September being Independence Day, the North Vietnamese government originally delayed announcing Hồ&#x27;s death until 3 September. A week of mourning for his death was decreed nationwide in North Vietnam from 4 to 11 September 1969. His funeral was attended by about 250,000 people and 5,000 official guests, which included many international mourners.

Representatives from 40 countries and regions were also presented. During the mourning period, North Vietnam received more than 22,000 condolences letters from 20 organizations and 110 countries across the world, such as France, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Zambia, China, the USSR and many others, mostly Socialist countries.

He was not initially replaced as president; instead, a &quot;collective leadership&quot; composed of several ministers and military leaders took over, known as the Politburo. During North Vietnam&#x27;s final campaign in 1975, a famous song written by composer was often sung by PAVN soldiers: &quot;&quot; (&quot;You are still marching with us, Uncle Hồ&quot;). 

During the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, several PAVN tanks displayed a poster with those same words on it. The day after the battle ended, on 1 May, veteran Australian journalist Denis Warner reported that &quot;When the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon yesterday, they were led by a man who wasn&#x27;t there&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Socialist Republic of Vietnam still praises the legacy of Uncle Hồ (&quot;Bác Hồ&quot;), the Bringer of Light (&quot;Chí Minh&quot;). Although Hồ Chí Minh wished for his body to be cremated and his ashes spread to North, Central, and South Vietnam, the body instead is embalmed on view in a mausoleum. His image is featured in many public buildings and schoolrooms, and other displays of reverence. There is at least one temple dedicated to him, built in then Việt Cộng-controlled Vĩnh Long shortly after his death in 1970.


In &quot;The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam&quot; (1982), Duiker suggests that Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s cult of personality is indicative of a larger legacy, one that drew on &quot;elements traditional to the exercise of control and authority in Vietnamese society.&quot; Duiker is drawn to an &quot;irresistible and persuasive&quot; comparison with China. As in China, leading party cadres were &quot;most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Hồ Chí Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families&quot; in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more &quot;Westernised&quot; coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule Cochinchina) and to be from &quot;commercial families without a traditional Confucian background&quot;.
In Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of Confucianism, condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism, and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism &quot;as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts&quot;, but its social prestige was &quot;essentially destroyed.&quot; In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the Bảo Đại) was replaced by the people&#x27;s republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (&quot;Gia Truong&quot;). The socialist conception of social equality destroyed the Confucian views of class.

Duiker argues many were to find the new ideology &quot;congenial&quot; precisely because of its similarities with the teachings of the old Master: &quot;the belief in one truth, embodied in quasi-sacred texts&quot;; in &quot;an anointed elite, trained in an all-embracing doctrine and responsible for leading the broad masses and indoctrinating them in proper thought and behavior&quot;; in &quot;the subordination of the individual to the community&quot;; and in the perfectibility, through corrective action, of human nature. All of this, Duiker suggests, was in some manner present in the aura of the new Master, Chi Minh, &quot;the bringer of light&quot;, &quot;Uncle Hồ&quot; to whom &quot;all the desirable qualities of Confucian ethics&quot; are ascribed. Under Hồ Chí Minh, Vietnamese Marxism developed, in effect, as a kind of &quot;reformed Confucianism&quot; revised to meet &quot;the challenges of the modern era&quot; and, not least among these, of &quot;total mobilization in the struggle for national independence and state power.&quot;

This &quot;congeniality&quot; with Confucian tradition was remarked on by Nguyen Khac Vien, a leading Hanoi intellectual of the 1960s and 70s. In &quot;Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam&quot; Nguyen Khac Vien, saw definite parallels between Confucian and party discipline, between the traditional scholar gentry and Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s party cadres.

A completely different form of the cult of Hồ Chí Minh (and one tolerated by the government with uneasiness) is his identification in Vietnamese folk religion with the Jade Emperor, who supposedly incarnated again on earth as Hồ Chí Minh. Today, Hồ Chí Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums. The first such medium was one Madam Lang in the 1990s, but the cult acquired a significant number of followers through another medium, Madam Xoan. She established on 1 January 2001 the Đạo Ngọc Phật Hồ Chí Minh (the Way of Hồ Chí Minh as the Jade Buddha), also known as Đạo Bác Hồ (the Way of Uncle Hồ) at đền Hòa Bình (the Peace Temple) in Chí Linh-Sao Đỏ district of Hải Dương province. She then founded the Peace Society of Heavenly Mediums (Đoàn đồng thiên Hòa Bình). Reportedly, the movement had around 24,000 followers by 2014.

The Vietnamese government&#x27;s attempts to immortalize Hồ Chí Minh were also met with significant controversies and opposition. The regime is sensitive to anything that might question the official hagiography. This includes references to Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s personal life that might detract from the image of the dedicated &quot;father of the revolution&quot;, the &quot;celibate married only to the cause of revolution&quot;. William Duiker&#x27;s &quot;Ho Chi Minh: A Life&quot; (2000) was candid on the matter of Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s liaisons. The government sought cuts in the Vietnamese translation and banned distribution of an issue of the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;, which carried a small item about the controversy.

Many authors writing on Vietnam argued on the question of whether Hồ Chí Minh was fundamentally a nationalist or a Communist.

===Depictions of Hồ Chí Minh===
Busts, statues, and memorial plaques and exhibitions are displayed in destinations on his extensive world journey in exile from 1911 to 1941 including France, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and Thailand.

Many activists and musicians wrote songs about Hồ Chí Minh and his revolution in different languages during the Vietnam War to demonstrate against the United States. Spanish songs were composed by Félix Pita Rodríguez, Carlos Puebla and Alí Primera. In addition, the Chilean folk singer Víctor Jara referenced Hồ Chí Minh in his anti-war song &quot;El derecho de vivir en paz&quot; (&quot;The Right to Live in Peace&quot;). Pete Seeger wrote &quot;Teacher Uncle Ho&quot;. Ewan MacColl produced &quot;The Ballad of Ho Chi Minh&quot; in 1954, describing &quot;a man who is the father of the Indo-Chinese people, And his name [it] is Ho Chi Minh.&quot; Russian songs about him were written by Vladimir Fere, and German songs about him were written by Kurt Demmler.

Various places, boulevards, and squares are named after him around the world, especially in Socialist states and former Communist states. In Russia, there is a Hồ Chí Minh square and monument in Moscow, a Hồ Chí Minh boulevard in Saint Petersburg, and a Hồ Chí Minh square in Ulyanovsk (the birthplace of Vladimir Lenin, a sister city of Vinh, the birthplace of Hồ Chí Minh). During the Vietnam War, the then-West Bengal government, in the hands of CPI(M), renamed Harrington Street to Ho Chi Minh Sarani, which is also the location of the consulate general of the United States in Kolkata. According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as many as 20 countries across Asia, Europe, America and Africa have erected monuments or statues in remembrance of Hồ Chí Minh.

==International influence==

Hồ Chí Minh is considered one of the most influential leaders in the world. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed him in the list of 100 Most Important People of the Twentieth Century (&quot;Time&quot; 100) in 1998. His thought and revolution inspired many leaders and people on a global scale in Asia, Africa and Latin America during the decolonization movement which occurred after World War II. As a communist, he was one of the few international figures who were relatively well regarded in the West, and did not face the same extent of international criticism as much as other Communist rulers and factions, even winning praise for his actions.

In 1987, UNESCO officially recommended that its member states &quot;join in the commemoration of the centenary of the birth of President Hồ Chí Minh by organizing various events as a tribute to his memory&quot;, considering &quot;the important and many-sided contributions of President Hồ Chí Minh to the fields of culture, education and the arts&quot; who &quot;devoted his whole life to the national liberation of the Vietnamese people, contributing to the common struggle of peoples for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress&quot;.

One of Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s works, &quot;The Black Race&quot;, much of it originally written in French, highlights his views on the oppression of peoples from colonialism and imperialism in 20 written articles. Other books such as &quot;Revolution&quot; which published selected works and articles of Hồ Chí Minh in English also highlighted Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s interpretation and beliefs in socialism and communism, and in fighting against what he perceived to be evils stemming from capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism.

<text>The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; a short time later. It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.

Ulam and Gardner emphasized the striking appearance in the spiral of prominent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines containing large numbers of primes. Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines is not unexpected, as lines in the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler&#x27;s prime-generating polynomial &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot; + 41, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with major unsolved problems in number theory such as Landau&#x27;s problems. In particular, no quadratic polynomial has ever been proved to generate infinitely many primes, much less to have a high asymptotic density of them, although there is a well-supported conjecture as to what that asymptotic density should be.

In 1932, 31 years prior to Ulam&#x27;s discovery, the herpetologist Laurence Klauber constructed a triangular, non-spiral array containing vertical and diagonal lines exhibiting a similar concentration of prime numbers. Like Ulam, Klauber noted the connection with prime-generating polynomials, such as Euler&#x27;s.

==Construction==
The Ulam spiral is constructed by writing the positive integers in a spiral arrangement on a square lattice:

and then marking the prime numbers:

In the figure, primes appear to concentrate along certain diagonal lines. In the 201×201 Ulam spiral shown above, diagonal lines are clearly visible, confirming the pattern to that point. Horizontal and vertical lines with a high density of primes, while less prominent, are also evident. Most often, the number spiral is started with the number 1 at the center, but it is possible to start with any number, and the same concentration of primes along diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines is observed. Starting with 41 at the center gives a diagonal containing an unbroken string of 40 primes (starting from 1523 southwest of the origin, decreasing to 41 at the origin, and increasing to 1601 northeast of the origin), the longest example of its kind.

==History==
According to Gardner, Ulam discovered the spiral in 1963 while doodling during the presentation of &quot;a long and very boring paper&quot; at a scientific meeting. These hand calculations amounted to &quot;a few hundred points&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Ulam, with collaborators Myron Stein and Mark Wells, used MANIAC II at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory to extend the calculation to about 100,000 points. The group also computed the density of primes among numbers up to 10,000,000 along some of the prime-rich lines as well as along some of the prime-poor lines. Images of the spiral up to 65,000 points were displayed on &quot;a scope attached to the machine&quot; and then photographed. The Ulam spiral was described in Martin Gardner&#x27;s March 1964 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and featured on the front cover of that issue. Some of the photographs of Stein, Ulam, and Wells were reproduced in the column.

In an addendum to the &quot;Scientific American&quot; column, Gardner mentioned the earlier paper of Klauber.
Klauber describes his construction as follows, &quot;The integers are arranged in triangular order with 1 at the apex, the second line containing numbers 2 to 4, the third 5 to 9, and so forth. When the primes have been indicated, it is found that there are concentrations in certain vertical and diagonal lines, and amongst these the so-called Euler sequences with high concentrations of primes are discovered.&quot;

==Explanation==
Diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines in the number spiral correspond to polynomials of the form
: formula_1
where &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are integer constants. When &quot;b&quot; is even, the lines are diagonal, and either all numbers are odd, or all are even, depending on the value of &quot;c&quot;. It is therefore no surprise that all primes other than 2 lie in alternate diagonals of the Ulam spiral. Some polynomials, such as formula_2, while producing only odd values, factorize over the integers formula_3 and are therefore never prime except possibly when one of the factors equals 1. Such examples correspond to diagonals that are devoid of primes or nearly so.

To gain insight into why some of the remaining odd diagonals may have a higher concentration of primes than others, consider formula_4 and formula_5. Compute remainders upon division by 3 as &quot;n&quot; takes successive values 0, 1, 2, ... For the first of these polynomials, the sequence of remainders is 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, ..., while for the second, it is 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, ... This implies that in the sequence of values taken by the second polynomial, two out of every three are divisible by 3, and hence certainly not prime, while in the sequence of values taken by the first polynomial, none are divisible by 3. Thus it seems plausible that the first polynomial will produce values with a higher density of primes than will the second. At the very least, this observation gives little reason to believe that the corresponding diagonals will be equally dense with primes. One should, of course, consider divisibility by primes other than 3. Examining divisibility by 5 as well, remainders upon division by 15 repeat with pattern 1, 11, 14, 10, 14, 11, 1, 14, 5, 4, 11, 11, 4, 5, 14 for the first polynomial, and with pattern 5, 0, 3, 14, 3, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 9, 3 for the second, implying that only three out of 15 values in the second sequence are potentially prime (being divisible by neither 3 nor 5), while 12 out of 15 values in the first sequence are potentially prime (since only three are divisible by 5 and none are divisible by 3).

While rigorously-proved results about primes in quadratic sequences are scarce, considerations like those above give rise to a plausible conjecture on the asymptotic density of primes in such sequences, which is described in the next section.

==Hardy and Littlewood&#x27;s Conjecture F==
In their 1923 paper on the Goldbach Conjecture, Hardy and Littlewood stated a series of conjectures, one of which, if true, would explain some of the striking features of the Ulam spiral. This conjecture, which Hardy and Littlewood called &quot;Conjecture F&quot;, is a special case of the Bateman–Horn conjecture and asserts an asymptotic formula for the number of primes of the form &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot;. Rays emanating from the central region of the Ulam spiral making angles of 45° with the horizontal and vertical correspond to numbers of the form 4&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; with &quot;b&quot; even; horizontal and vertical rays correspond to numbers of the same form with &quot;b&quot; odd. Conjecture F provides a formula that can be used to estimate the density of primes along such rays. It implies that there will be considerable variability in the density along different rays. In particular, the density is highly sensitive to the discriminant of the polynomial, &quot;b&quot;2 − 16&quot;c&quot;.
Conjecture F is concerned with polynomials of the form &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are integers and &quot;a&quot; is positive. If the coefficients contain a common factor greater than 1 or if the discriminant Δ = &quot;b&quot;2 − 4&quot;ac&quot; is a perfect square, the polynomial factorizes and therefore produces composite numbers as &quot;x&quot; takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... (except possibly for one or two values of &quot;x&quot; where one of the factors equals 1). Moreover, if &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are both even, the polynomial produces only even values, and is therefore composite except possibly for the value 2. Hardy and Littlewood assert that, apart from these situations, &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; takes prime values infinitely often as &quot;x&quot; takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This statement is a special case of an earlier conjecture of Bunyakovsky and remains open. Hardy and Littlewood further assert that, asymptotically, the number &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of primes of the form &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; and less than &quot;n&quot; is given by

: formula_6

where &quot;A&quot; depends on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; but not on &quot;n&quot;. By the prime number theorem, this formula with &quot;A&quot; set equal to one is the asymptotic number of primes less than &quot;n&quot; expected in a random set of numbers having the same density as the set of numbers of the form &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot;. But since &quot;A&quot; can take values bigger or smaller than 1, some polynomials, according to the conjecture, will be especially rich in primes, and others especially poor. An unusually rich polynomial is 4&quot;x&quot;2 − 2&quot;x&quot; + 41 which forms a visible line in the Ulam spiral. The constant &quot;A&quot; for this polynomial is approximately 6.6, meaning that the numbers it generates are almost seven times as likely to be prime as random numbers of comparable size, according to the conjecture. This particular polynomial is related to Euler&#x27;s prime-generating polynomial &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot; + 41 by replacing &quot;x&quot; with 2&quot;x&quot;, or equivalently, by restricting &quot;x&quot; to the even numbers. The constant &quot;A&quot; is given by a product running over all prime numbers,

: formula_7,

in which formula_8 is number of zeros of the quadratic polynomial modulo &quot;p&quot; and therefore takes one of the values 0, 1, or 2. Hardy and Littlewood break the product into three factors as

: formula_9.

Here the factor ε, corresponding to the prime 2, is 1 if &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; is odd and 2 if &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; is even. The first product index &quot;p&quot; runs over the finitely-many odd primes dividing both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. For these primes formula_10 since &quot;p&quot; then cannot divide &quot;c&quot;. The second product index formula_11 runs over the infinitely-many odd primes not dividing &quot;a&quot;. For these primes formula_8 equals 1, 2, or 0 depending on whether the discriminant is 0, a non-zero square, or a non-square modulo &quot;p&quot;. This is accounted for by the use of the Legendre symbol, formula_13. When a prime &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;a&quot; but not &quot;b&quot; there is one root modulo &quot;p&quot;. Consequently, such primes do not contribute to the product.

A quadratic polynomial with &quot;A&quot; ≈ 11.3, currently the highest known value, has been discovered by Jacobson and Williams.

==Variants==
Klauber&#x27;s 1932 paper describes a triangle in which row &quot;n&quot; contains the numbers (&quot;n&quot;  −  1)2 + 1 through &quot;n&quot;2. As in the Ulam spiral, quadratic polynomials generate numbers that lie in straight lines. Vertical lines correspond to numbers of the form &quot;k&quot;2 − &quot;k&quot; + &quot;M&quot;. Vertical and diagonal lines with a high density of prime numbers are evident in the figure.

Robert Sacks devised a variant of the Ulam spiral in 1994. In the Sacks spiral, the non-negative integers are plotted on an Archimedean spiral rather than the square spiral used by Ulam, and are spaced so that one perfect square occurs in each full rotation. (In the Ulam spiral, two squares occur in each rotation.) Euler&#x27;s prime-generating polynomial, &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot; + 41, now appears as a single curve as &quot;x&quot; takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This curve asymptotically approaches a horizontal line in the left half of the figure. (In the Ulam spiral, Euler&#x27;s polynomial forms two diagonal lines, one in the top half of the figure, corresponding to even values of &quot;x&quot; in the sequence, the other in the bottom half of the figure corresponding to odd values of &quot;x&quot; in the sequence.)

Additional structure may be seen when composite numbers are also included in the Ulam spiral. The number 1 has only a single factor, itself; each prime number has two factors, itself and 1; composite numbers are divisible by at least three different factors. Using the size of the dot representing an integer to indicate the number of factors and coloring prime numbers red and composite numbers blue produces the figure shown.

Spirals following other tilings of the plane also generate lines rich in prime numbers, for example hexagonal spirals.

<doc id="67379" wikidata="Q41309" url="?curid=67379" title="Franz Liszt">
<text>Franz Liszt (22 October 1811 – 31 July 1886) was a Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor and teacher of the Romantic period. With a diverse body of work spanning more than six decades, he is considered to be one of the most prolific and influential composers of his era, and his piano works continue to be widely performed and recorded.

Liszt achieved success as a concert pianist from an early age, and received lessons from esteemed musicians Carl Czerny and Antonio Salieri. He gained further renown for his performances during tours of Europe in the 1830s and 1840s, developing a reputation for technical brilliance as well as physical attractiveness. In a phenomenon dubbed &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, he rose to a degree of stardom and popularity among the public not experienced by the virtuosos who preceded him.

During this period and into his later life, Liszt was a friend, musical promoter and benefactor to many composers of his time, including Hector Berlioz, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Clara Schumann and Richard Wagner, among others. Liszt coined the terms &quot;transcription&quot; and &quot;paraphrase&quot;, and would perform arrangements of his contemporaries&#x27; music to popularise it. Alongside Wagner, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the New German School, a progressive group of composers involved in the &quot;War of the Romantics&quot; who developed ideas of programmatic music and harmonic experimentation.

Liszt taught piano performance to hundreds of students throughout his life, many of whom went on to become notable performers. He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work that influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated 20th-century ideas and trends. Among Liszt&#x27;s musical contributions were the concept of the symphonic poem, innovations in thematic transformation and Impressionism in music, and the invention of the masterclass as a method of teaching performance. In a radical departure from his earlier compositional styles, many of Liszt&#x27;s later works also feature experiments in atonality, foreshadowing developments in 20th-century classical music. Today he is best known for his original piano works, such as the Hungarian Rhapsodies, &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot;, &quot;Transcendental Études&quot;, &quot;La campanella&quot;, and the Piano Sonata in B minor.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Franz Liszt was born to Anna Liszt (née Maria Anna Lager) and Adam Liszt on 22 October 1811, in the village of Doborján () in Sopron County, in the Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire. Liszt&#x27;s father was a land steward in the service of Prince Nikolaus II Esterházy; a keen amateur musician, he played the piano, cello, guitar and flute, and knew Haydn and Hummel personally. A renowned child prodigy, Franz began to improvise at the piano from before the age of five, and his father diligently encouraged his progress. Franz also found exposure to music through attending Mass, as well as travelling Romani bands that toured the Hungarian countryside. His first public concert was in Sopron in 1820 at the age of nine; its success led to further appearances in Pressburg and for Prince Nikolaus&#x27; court in Eisenstadt. The publicity led to a group of wealthy sponsors offering to finance Franz&#x27;s musical education in Vienna.

There, Liszt received piano lessons from Carl Czerny, who in his own youth had been a student of Beethoven and Hummel. Czerny, already extremely busy, had only begrudgingly agreed to hear Liszt play, and had initially refused to entertain the idea of regular lessons. Being so impressed by the initial audition, however, Czerny taught Liszt regularly, free of charge, for the next eighteen months, at which point he felt he had nothing more to teach. Liszt remained grateful to his former teacher, later dedicating to him the &quot;Transcendental Études&quot; on their 1830 republication. Liszt also received lessons in composition from Antonio Salieri, the accomplished music director of the Viennese court who had previously taught Beethoven and Schubert. Like Czerny, Salieri was highly impressed by Liszt&#x27;s improvisation and sight-reading abilities.

Liszt&#x27;s public debut in Vienna on 1 December 1822 was a great success. He was greeted in Austrian and Hungarian aristocratic circles and met Beethoven and Schubert. To build on his son&#x27;s success, Adam Liszt decided to take the family to Paris, the centre of the artistic world. At Liszt&#x27;s final Viennese concert on 13 April 1823, Beethoven was reputed to have walked onstage and kissed Liszt on the forehead, to signify a kind of artistic christening. There is debate, however, on the extent to which this story is apocryphal. The family briefly returned to Hungary, and Liszt played a concert in traditional Hungarian dress, in order to emphasise his roots, in May 1823.

In 1824 a piece Liszt had written at the age of 11 – his Variation on a Waltz by Diabelli (S. 147) – appeared in of &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot; as his first published composition. This volume, commissioned by Anton Diabelli, includes 50 variations on his waltz by 50 different composers ( being taken up by Beethoven&#x27;s 33 variations on the same theme, which are now separately better known simply as his &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;). Liszt was the youngest contributor to the project, described in it as &quot;a boy of eleven years old&quot;; Czerny was also a participant.

=== Paris ===
Having made significant sums from his concerts, Liszt and his family moved to Paris in 1823, with the hope of his attending the Conservatoire de Paris. The director Luigi Cherubini refused his entry, however, as the Conservatoire did not accept foreigners. Nevertheless, Liszt studied under Anton Reicha and Ferdinando Paer, and gave a series of highly successful concerts debuting on 8 March 1824. Paer was involved in the Parisian theatrical and operatic scene, and through his connections Liszt staged his only opera, &quot;Don Sanche&quot;, which premiered shortly before his fourteenth birthday. The premiere was warmly received, but the opera only ran for four performances, and is now obscure. Accompanied by his father, Liszt toured France and England, where he played for King George IV.

Adam Liszt died suddenly of typhoid fever in the summer of 1827, and for the next eight years Liszt continued to live in Paris with his mother. He gave up touring, and in order to earn money, he gave lessons on piano and composition, often from early morning until late at night. His students were scattered across the city and he had to cover long distances. Because of this, he kept uncertain hours and also took up smoking and drinking, habits he would continue throughout his life. During this period Liszt fell in love with one of his pupils, Caroline de Saint-Cricq, the daughter of Charles X&#x27;s minister of commerce, Pierre de Saint-Cricq. Her father, however, insisted that the affair be broken off.

Liszt fell very ill, to the extent that an obituary notice was printed in a Paris newspaper, and he underwent a long period of religious doubts and introspection. He stopped playing the piano and giving lessons, and developed an intense interest in religion, having many conversations with Abbé de Lamennais and Chrétien Urhan, a German-born violinist who introduced him to the Saint-Simonists. Lamennais dissuaded Liszt from becoming a monk or priest. Urhan was an early champion of Schubert, inspiring Liszt&#x27;s own lifelong love of Schubert&#x27;s songs. Much of Urhan&#x27;s emotive music which moved beyond the Classical paradigm, such as &quot;Elle et moi, La Salvation angélique&quot; and &quot;Les Regrets&quot;, may have helped to develop Liszt&#x27;s taste and style.

During this period Liszt came into contact with many of the leading authors and artists of his day, including Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, George Sand and Alfred de Vigny. He composed practically nothing in the years between his father&#x27;s death and the July Revolution of 1830, which inspired him to sketch a symphony based on the events of the &quot;three glorious days&quot; (this piece was left unfinished, and later reworked as &quot;Héroïde funèbre&quot;). Liszt met Hector Berlioz on 4 December 1830, the day before the premiere of the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. Berlioz&#x27;s music made a strong impression on Liszt, and the two quickly became friends. Liszt also befriended Frédéric Chopin around this time.

After attending a concert featuring Niccolò Paganini in April 1832, Liszt resolved to become as great a virtuoso on the piano as Paganini was on the violin. He dramatically increased his practice, sometimes practising for up to fourteen hours a day, and in 1838 published the six &quot;Études d&#x27;exécution transcendante d&#x27;après Paganini&quot; (later revised as &quot;Grandes études de Paganini&quot;), aiming to represent Paganini&#x27;s virtuosity on the keyboard. The process of Liszt completely redeveloping his technique is often described as a direct result of attending Paganini&#x27;s concert, but it is likely that he had already begun this work previously, during the period 18281832.

=== Touring Europe ===
==== Affair with Countess Marie d&#x27;Agoult ====
In 1833, Liszt began a relationship with the Countess Marie d&#x27;Agoult, who was married to a French cavalry officer but living independently. In order to escape scandal they moved to Geneva in 1835; their daughter Blandine was born there on 18 December. Liszt taught at the newly founded Geneva Conservatoire and contributed essays for &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot; and the &quot;Revue et gazette musicale de Paris&quot;.

For the next four years, Liszt and the countess lived together. In 1835 and 1836 they travelled around Switzerland, and from August 1837 until November 1839 they toured Italy. It was these travels that later inspired the composer to write his cycle of piano collections entitled &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; (&quot;Years of Pilgrimage&quot;). Their daughter, Cosima, was born in Como on 24 December 1837, and their son Daniel on 9 May 1839 in Rome.

That autumn relations between them became strained. Liszt heard that plans for a Beethoven Monument in Bonn were in danger of collapse for lack of funds and pledged his support, raising funds through concerts. The countess returned to Paris with the children, while Liszt gave six concerts in Vienna, then toured Hungary. Liszt would later spend holidays with Marie and their children on the island of Nonnenwerth on the Rhine in the summers of 1841 and 1843. In May 1844, the couple finally separated.

==== The Ivory Duel ====

Swiss pianist Sigismond Thalberg moved to Paris in 1835 after several successful years of touring. His concerts there were extremely well received, and Liszt, at the time living in Geneva, received news of them from his friends in Paris. In the autumn of 1836 Liszt published an unfavourable review of several of Thalberg&#x27;s compositions in the &quot;Gazette musicale&quot;, calling them &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;mediocre&quot;. A published exchange of views ensued between Liszt and Thalberg&#x27;s supporter, the critic François-Joseph Fétis.

Liszt heard Thalberg perform for the first time at the Paris Conservatoire in February 1837, and to settle the disagreement the two pianists each arranged a performance for the public to compare them the following month. Liszt performed his own &quot;Grande fantaisie sur des motifs de Niobe&quot; and Weber&#x27;s &quot;Konzertstück in F minor&quot;. This was considered to be inconclusive, so the two agreed to perform at the same concert for comparison on 31 March, at the salon of the Princess of Belgiojoso, in aid of Italian refugees. Thalberg opened with his &quot;Fantasia on Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Moses&quot;&quot;, then Liszt performed his &quot;Niobe&quot; fantasy.

The result of this &quot;duel&quot; is disputed. Critic Jules Janin&#x27;s report in &quot;Journal des débats&quot; asserted that there was no clear winner: &quot;Two victors and no vanquished; it is fitting to say with the poet &#x27;&quot;. Belgiojoso declined to declare a winner, famously concluding that &quot;Thalberg is the first pianist in the worldLiszt is unique.&quot; The biographer Alan Walker, however, believes that &quot;Liszt received the ovation of the evening and all doubts about his supremacy were dispelled. As for Thalberg, his humiliation was complete. He virtually disappeared from the concert platform after this date.&quot;

==== Lisztomania ====
After his separation from Marie, Liszt continued to tour Europe. His concerts in Berlin in the winter of 18411842 marked the start of a period of immense public enthusiasm and popularity for his performances, dubbed &quot;Lisztomania&quot; by Heinrich Heine in 1844. In a fashion that has been described as similar to &quot;the mass hysteria associated with revivalist meetings or 20th-century rock stars&quot;, women fought over his cigar stubs and coffee dregs, and his silk handkerchiefs and velvet gloves, which they ripped to shreds as souvenirs. This atmosphere was fuelled in great part by the artist&#x27;s mesmeric personality and stage presence: he was regarded as handsome, and Heine wrote of his showmanship during concerts: &quot;How powerful, how shattering was his mere physical appearance&quot;.

It is estimated that Liszt appeared in public well over one thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.

Adding to his reputation was that Liszt gave away much of the proceeds of his work to charity and humanitarian causes. He donated large sums to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral and St. Stephen&#x27;s Basilica in Pest, and made private donations to public services such as hospitals and schools, as well as charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. After the Great Fire of Hamburg in May 1842, he gave concerts in aid of those left homeless.

During a tour of Ukraine in 1847, Liszt played in Kiev, where he met the Polish Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. For some time he had been considering retiring from the life of a travelling virtuoso to concentrate on composition, and at this point he made the decision to take up a court position in Weimar. Having known Liszt for only a few weeks, Carolyne resolved to join him there. After a tour of Turkey and Russia that summer, Liszt gave the final paid concert of his career at Elizabetgrad in September, then spent the winter with the princess at her estate in Woronińce. By retiring from the concert platform at the age of 35, while still at the height of his powers, Liszt succeeded in keeping the legend of his playing untarnished.

=== Weimar ===
In July 1848 Liszt settled in Weimar, where he had been appointed the honorary title of &quot;Kapellmeister Extraordinaire&quot; six years previously. He acted as the official court kapellmeister at the expense of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia until 1859, jointly with Hippolyte André Jean Baptiste Chélard until his retirement in 1852. During this period Liszt acted as conductor at court concerts and on special occasions at the theatre, arranged several festivals celebrating the work of Berlioz and Wagner, and produced the premiere of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. He gave lessons to a number of pianists, including the great virtuoso Hans von Bülow, who married Liszt&#x27;s daughter Cosima in 1857 (she would later marry Wagner). Liszt&#x27;s work during this period made Weimar a nexus for modern music.

As kapellmeister Liszt was required to submit every programme to the court Intendant for prior approval. This did not cause large problems until the appointment of Franz von Dingelstedt in 1857, who reduced the number of music productions, rejected Liszt&#x27;s choices of repertoire, and even organised a demonstration against Liszt&#x27;s 1858 premiere of . Faced with this opposition, Liszt resigned in 1858.

At first, after arriving in Weimar, Princess Carolyne lived apart from Liszt, in order to avoid suspicions of impropriety. She wished eventually to marry Liszt, but since her husband, Russian military officer Prince Nicholas von Sayn-Wittgenstein, was still alive, she had to convince the Roman Catholic authorities that her marriage to him had been invalid. Her appeal to the Archbishop of St Petersburg for an annulment, lodged before leaving Russia, was ultimately unsuccessful, and the couple abandoned pretence and began to live together in the autumn of 1848.

Nicholas was aware that the couple&#x27;s marriage had effectively ended, and Carolyne and Nicholas reached an agreement to annul in 1850 whereby the prince would receive some of Carolyne&#x27;s estates. However, this arrangement was struck down in 1851 by the consistory court of Zhytomyr. Throughout the decade the couple would continue to negotiate through the complex situation.

==== The New German School and the War of the Romantics ====

In 1859 Franz Brendel coined the name &quot;New German School&quot; in his publication , to refer to the musicians associated with Liszt while he was in Weimar. The most prominent members other than Liszt were Wagner and Berlioz (although Wagner rejected the label), and the group also included Peter Cornelius, Hans von Bülow and Joachim Raff. The School was a loose confederation of progressive composers, mainly grouped together as a challenge to supposed conservatives such as Mendelssohn and Brahms, and so the term is considered to be of limited use in describing a particular movement or set of unified principles. What commonalities the composers had were around the development of programmatic music, harmonic experimentation, wide-ranging modulation and formal innovations such as the use of leitmotifs and thematic transformation.

The disagreements between the two factions is often described as the &quot;War of the Romantics&quot;. The &quot;war&quot; was largely carried out through articles, essays and reviews. Each side claimed Beethoven as its predecessor. A number of festivals were arranged to showcase the music of the New German School, notably in Leipzig in 1859 and Weimar in 1861. The Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein, intrinsically linked to the School, was founded at this time, with Liszt becoming its honorary president in 1873. However, as most of Liszt&#x27;s work from the 1860s and 1870s received little attention, and Brendel and Berlioz died in the late 1860s, the focus of the progressive movement in music moved to Bayreuth with Wagner in the 1870s, who definitively moved on from the School and the .

=== Rome ===
After a visit to Rome and an audience with Pope Pius IX in 1860, Carolyne finally secured an annulment. It was planned that she and Liszt would marry in Rome, on 22 October 1861, Liszt&#x27;s 50th birthday. Liszt arrived in Rome on 21 October, but a Vatican official had arrived the previous day in order to stop the marriage. This was a result of the machinations of Cardinal Hohenlohe, who wanted to protect a complex inheritance agreement brokered by Tsar Alexander II. Carolyne subsequently gave up all attempts to marry Liszt, even after her husband&#x27;s death in 1864; she became a recluse, working for the rest of her life on a long work critical of the Catholic Church.

The 1860s were a period of great sadness in Liszt&#x27;s private life. On 13 December 1859, he lost his 20-year-old son Daniel to an unknown illness. On 11 September 1862 his 26-year-old daughter Blandine also died, having contracted sepsis after surgery on a breast growth which developed shortly after giving birth to a son she named in memory of Daniel. In letters to friends, Liszt announced that he would retreat to a solitary living.

He moved to the monastery , just outside Rome, where on 20 June 1863 he took up quarters in a small, spartan apartment. He had a piano in his cell, and he continued to compose. He had already joined the Third Order of Saint Francis previously, on 23 June 1857. On 25 April 1865 he received the tonsure at the hands of Cardinal Hohenlohe, who had previously worked against Carolyne&#x27;s efforts to secure an annulment; the two men became close friends. On 31 July 1865 Liszt received the four minor orders of porter, lector, exorcist and acolyte. After this ordination he was often called &quot; Liszt&quot;. On 14 August 1879, he was made an honorary canon of Albano.

In 1867 Liszt was commissioned to write a piece for the coronation ceremony of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth of Bavaria, and he travelled to Budapest to conduct it. The &quot;Hungarian Coronation Mass&quot; was performed on 8 June 1867, at the coronation ceremony in the Matthias Church by Buda Castle in a six-section form. After the first performance, the Offertory was added and, two years later, the Gradual.

=== &quot;Tripartite existence&quot; ===
Grand Duke Charles Alexander had been attempting to arrange Liszt&#x27;s return to Weimar ever since he had left, and in January 1869 Liszt agreed to a residency to give masterclasses in piano playing. He was based in the Hofgärtnerei (court gardener&#x27;s house), where he taught for the next seventeen years. From 1872 until the end of his life, Liszt made regular journeys between Rome, Weimar and Budapest, continuing what he called his (&quot;tripartite existence&quot;). It is estimated that he travelled at least 4,000 miles a year during this period in his life – an exceptional figure given his advancing age and the rigors of road and rail in the 1870s.

Liszt&#x27;s time in Budapest was the result of efforts from the Hungarian government in attracting him to work there. The plan of the foundation of the Royal Academy of Music was agreed upon by the Hungarian Parliament in 1873, and in March 1875 Liszt was nominated its president. The academy was officially opened on 14 November 1875 with Liszt&#x27;s colleague Ferenc Erkel as director and Kornél Ábrányi and Robert Volkmann on the staff. Liszt himself only arrived to deliver lessons in March 1876. From 1881 when in Budapest he would stay in an apartment in the Academy, where he taught pupils in much the same way as he did in Weimar. In 1925 the institution was renamed in honour of Liszt.

=== Final years ===
Liszt fell down a flight of stairs at the Hofgärtnerei in July 1881, and remained bedridden for several weeks after this accident. He had been in good health up to that point, but a number of ailments subsequently manifested, such as a cataract in the left eye, dental issues and fatigue. Since around 1877 he had become increasingly plagued by feelings of desolation, despair and preoccupation with death—feelings that he expressed in his works from this period. As he told Lina Ramann, &quot;I carry a deep sadness of the heart which must now and then break out in sound.&quot;

On 13 January 1886, while Claude Debussy was staying at the Villa Medici in Rome, Liszt met him there with Paul Vidal and Ernest Hébert, director of the French Academy. Liszt played &quot;Au bord d&#x27;une source&quot; from &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot;, as well as his arrangement of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot; for the musicians. Debussy in later years described Liszt&#x27;s pedalling as &quot;like a form of breathing.&quot;

Liszt travelled to Bayreuth in the summer of 1886. This was in order to support his daughter Cosima, who was running the festival but struggling to generate sufficient interest. The festival was dedicated to the works of her husband Richard Wagner, and had opened ten years previously; Wagner had died in 1883. Already frail, in his final week of life Liszt&#x27;s health deteriorated further, as he experienced a fever, cough and delirium. 

He died during the festival, near midnight on 31 July 1886, at the age of 74officially as a result of pneumonia, which he had contracted prior to arriving in Bayreuth, although the true cause of death may have been a heart attack. He was buried on 3 August 1886, in the , according to Cosima&#x27;s wishes; despite controversy over this as his final resting place, Liszt&#x27;s body was never moved.

==Relationships with other composers==
=== Hector Berlioz ===

Berlioz and Liszt first met on 4 December 1830, the day before the premiere of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. The two quickly became very close friends, exchanging intimate letters on their respective love lives, which also reveal that Liszt was aware of Berlioz&#x27;s fixation on suicide. Liszt acted as a witness at Berlioz&#x27;s wedding to Harriet Smithson in 1833, despite cautioning Berlioz against it, and they worked together at several concerts over the following three years, and again in 1841 and 1844. In Weimar the two composers revised &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, and Liszt organised a &quot;Berlioz Week&quot;, which included &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and part of &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, later dedicated to Liszt (in return, Liszt dedicated his &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; to Berlioz).

The orchestration of Berlioz had an influence on Liszt, especially with regards to his symphonic poems. Berlioz saw orchestration as part of the compositional process, rather than a final task to undertake after the music had already been written. Berlioz joined Liszt and Wagner as a figurehead of the New German School, but an unwilling one, as he was unconvinced by Wagner&#x27;s ideas about the &quot;music of the future&quot;.

=== Frédéric Chopin ===
Chopin and Liszt first met in the early 1830s, both moving in the same circles of artists residing in Paris. Liszt attended Chopin&#x27;s first Paris performance at the Salle Pleyel on 26 February 1832, which he admired greatly, and by mid-1833 the two had become close friends. They performed together a number of times, often for charity, and since Chopin only performed in public about 12 times, these events comprise a large proportion of his total appearances.

Their relationship cooled in the early 1840s, and several reasons have been suggested for this, including that Marie d&#x27;Agoult was infatuated with Chopin, or Liszt with George Sand, or that Liszt used Chopin&#x27;s home for a rendezvous with Marie Pleyel, the wife of Chopin&#x27;s friend Camille. The two musicians had very different personalities, with Liszt being extroverted and outgoing while Chopin was more introverted and reflective, so it is possible that the two never had an extremely close friendship to begin with, and the fact that they did not live physically close together would have been another barrier. On the topic, Liszt commented to Chopin&#x27;s biographer Frederick Niecks that Marie d&#x27;Agoult and George Sand had frequently disagreed, and the musicians had felt obliged to side with their respective partners. Alex Szilasi suggests that Chopin took offence at an equivocal 1841 review by Liszt, and was perhaps jealous of Liszt&#x27;s popularity, while Liszt in turn may have been jealous of Chopin&#x27;s reputation as a serious composer.

Very shortly after Chopin&#x27;s death in 1849, Liszt had a monument erected in his memory and began to write a biography. Chopin&#x27;s relatives and friends found the timing of this insensitive, and many declined to help with Liszt&#x27;s enquiries.

Scholars disagree on the extent to which Chopin and Liszt influenced each others&#x27; compositions. Charles Rosen identifies similarities between Chopin&#x27;s Étude Op. 10, No. 9 and the early version of Liszt&#x27;s Transcendental Étude No. 10, but Alan Walker argues that no such connection exists. Stylistic similarities between other studies, Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot; and Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Consolations&quot;, and even an influence on the ornamentation and fingering of Liszt&#x27;s works, have been proposed.

=== Robert and Clara Schumann ===
In 1837 Liszt wrote a positive review of Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Impromptus&quot; and piano sonatas no. 1 and no. 3. The two began to correspond, and the following year he met Schumann&#x27;s fiancée Clara Wieck, to whom he dedicated the early version of &quot;Grandes études de Paganini&quot;. Schumann in turn dedicated &quot;Fantasie in C&quot; to Liszt. The two met for the first time in Dresden in 1840.

Schumann resigned as editor of the music journal &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; in 1844, ten years after founding it. The journal was taken over the following year by Franz Brendel, who used it to publicise and support Liszt&#x27;s New German School, to Schumann&#x27;s chagrin. In 1848 Liszt attended a performance of the Piano Trio No. 1 being held in his honour in the Schumanns&#x27; home. Liszt arrived two hours late with Wagner (who had not been invited), derided the piece, and spoke ill of the recently deceased Mendelssohn. This upset the Schumanns, and Robert physically assaulted Liszt.

The relationship between Liszt and the couple remained frosty. Liszt dedicated his 1854 piano sonata to Robert, who had by that point been committed to a mental institution in Endenich. Clara asked for Liszt&#x27;s help that year in finding a performance venue in order to earn an income. Liszt arranged an all-Schumann concert with Clara as the star performer and published an extremely positive review, but Clara did not express any gratitude. In a posthumous edition of Robert&#x27;s works, Clara changed the dedication of the &quot;Fantasie&quot; from Liszt to herself. After Liszt&#x27;s death, she wrote in her diary &quot;He was an eminent keyboard virtuoso but a dangerous example for the young... As a composer he was terrible.&quot;

=== Richard Wagner ===
Wagner first met Liszt in Paris in 1841, while living in poverty after fleeing Riga to escape creditors. Liszt was at this point a famous pianist, whereas Wagner was unknown; unlike Wagner, Liszt did not remember the meeting. In 1844 Liszt attended a performance of Wagner&#x27;s first major success, the opera &quot;Rienzi&quot;, in Dresden. The two met in Berlin at the instigation of Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, and Wagner later sent Liszt the scores of &quot;Rienzi&quot; and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in an attempt to elicit approval. Liszt settled in Weimar in 1848, and the two grew close, Wagner still being located in Dresden. Wagner wrote to Liszt a number of times soliciting financial help.

In 1849 Liszt sheltered Wagner after the latter&#x27;s involvement in the failed May Uprising in Dresden. Liszt arranged a false passport and lent Wagner money to allow him to escape Germany for Switzerland, and for the next ten years continued to send money and visit, as well as petition officials for a pardon which eventually came in 1860.

To publicise Wagner&#x27;s music, Liszt staged &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in 1849, for the first time outside Dresden, and published two transcriptions from it, writing to Wagner &quot;Once and for all, number me in future among your most zealous and devoted admirers; near or far, count on me and make use of me.&quot; In 1850 he arranged the premiere of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, which Wagner dedicated to Liszt, and he also mounted performances of &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;. Liszt had intended to dedicate the 1857 &quot;Dante Symphony&quot; to Wagner, but upon being told this Wagner replied that, while a fine piece, he would prefer to receive money. Liszt was offended by this comment, and did not publish the dedication.
By 1864 Wagner had begun an affair with Liszt&#x27;s daughter Cosima, who was married to Liszt&#x27;s erstwhile pupil Hans von Bülow. Liszt disapproved of the relationship and broke off contact with the couple for a number of years, only learning of their 1870 marriage from the newspapers. Nevertheless the relationship recovered: Liszt contributed financially to the building of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1871, and he began to correspond with Wagner and Cosima again, frequently visiting their home Wahnfried. Liszt died in 1886 while at the latest incarnation of the Bayreuth Festival, dedicated to Wagner&#x27;s work, Wagner having died three years previously.

Similarities have been suggested between Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Faust Overture&quot; and Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot;, but Liszt claimed that the likenesses of the themes were coincidental. Scholars also note a similarity between the opening of Liszt&#x27;s song &quot;Lorelei&quot; and the famous &quot;Tristan chord&quot; from the opening of Wagner&#x27;s later opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, although there is no consensus on whether Wagner was influenced by the song. There are similarities in their musical languages, however, and Wagner once even commented to Cosima that he was looking at &quot;The Bells of the Strasbourg Cathedral&quot; to ensure he had not overtly plagiarised the work, the opening theme of &quot;Parsifal&quot; being very similar to that cantata. Both composers were also prominent members of the New German School.

== Pianist ==
At his performing peak Liszt was considered the greatest pianist of his time, and was perhaps one of the greatest who ever lived. His popularity during the &quot;Lisztomania&quot; period of the 1840s was unrivalled, and the critic Peter G. Davis has written that &quot;Perhaps [Liszt] was not the most transcendent virtuoso who ever lived, but his audiences thought he was, and no pianist since has seriously challenged the legend.&quot;

=== Performing style ===

Liszt&#x27;s performance style changed throughout his life, in his interpretive decisions as well as his physicality (the young Liszt was extremely animated at the keyboard, but in old age he was very still). No recordings of Liszt exist, so to get an impression of his style scholars must go by contemporary writings and the output of his pupils, while allowing for a certain amount of mythologising around his extraordinary talent.

From a young age Liszt had displayed an aptitude for improvisation and sight reading. Czerny observed that Liszt was a natural who played according to feeling&quot;one saw that Nature herself had formed a pianist.&quot; Liszt&#x27;s fourteen months under Czerny solidified his technical skills as he enthusiastically studied exercises and works. In later life, however, he would express the opinion that despite his work under Czerny his early training had been unfocused, and he had excelled mainly &quot;by force of personality&quot;. Reviews of his early concerts especially praise the brilliance, strength, and precision in his playing. At least one also mentions his ability to keep absolute tempo.

One of the most detailed descriptions of his playing from that time comes from the diary entries of Caroline Boissier-Butini, whose daughter Valerie was a pupil of Liszt&#x27;s from 1831 to 1832, when he was earning a living primarily as a teacher in Paris:

Boissier records that Liszt did not keep his hands &#x27;in a rounded position&#x27; nor were they &#x27;altogether flat&#x27;, but rather his fingers were &#x27;so flexible as to possess no fixed position&#x27;... Mme Boissier writes that Liszt&#x27;s &#x27;hand is never unwieldy, for he moves it with grace according to his fancy&#x27;, then she stresses that &#x27;he does not play with his arms or shoulders&#x27;. In a later lesson, Liszt instructed Valerie to play &#x27;without exception, entirely with a wrist action&#x27;... without any interference by the arm... Crucially, Liszt emphasised the role of the wrist, not the arm, in producing a full tone for individual notes, and did so not just in relation to octaves or chords.
During his performance career Liszt took unusually bold liberties with the score, changing tempo and adding embellishment at will. In one instance he decided on &quot;a sudden, drastic slowing down&quot; while performing the Scherzo movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Sixth Symphony. In a regretful letter to George Sand from 1837 Liszt admitted that he made such decisions to gain public acclaim:
[I]n order to wring bravos from the public that is always slow, in its awesome simplicity, to comprehend beautiful things, I had no qualms about changing the tempos of the pieces or the composers&#x27; intentions. In my arrogance I even went so far as to add a host of rapid runs and cadenzas, which, by securing ignorant applause for me, sent me off in the wrong directionone that I fortunately knew enough to abandon quickly... Now I no longer divorce a composition from the era in which it was written, and any claim to embellish or modernize the works of earlier periods seems just as absurd for a musician to make as it would be for an architect, for example, to place a Corinthian capital on the columns of an Egyptian temple.
Despite his apparent contrition, however, Liszt did continue to make large interpretive changes while performing, although he would be more concerned with fidelity to the score and composer&#x27;s intentions later in life. He would be more open to pupils revising his own compositions, and he himself often produced different versions of his works over the course of his lifetime. This attitude was in keeping with the shift in audience preferences that began in the 1830s, which started to favour a faithfully rendered memorised performance over the improvisation that Liszt employed in these years.

Certain information about Liszt&#x27;s style can be inferred from the writings of his many pupils. Musicologist Kenneth Hamilton identifies several themes which occurred through Liszt&#x27;s teachings, including avoiding excessive sentimentality, imagining the orchestration of the piece, flexibility of tempo, and the importance of a sense of music. Amy Fay studied under Liszt in his later life, 18691875, and her writings align with Boissier&#x27;s four decades earlier. She also notes that Liszt kept his fingers close to the keyboard to achieve a better legato, and that Liszt discouraged unnecessary hand movements, in contrast to his flamboyant gestures during his prime. Notes by his pupil Pauline Fichtener in the 1870s again stress freedom and flexibility of the wrist.

=== Concert repertoire ===
Up to 1840, most concerts featuring a solo pianist included other acts, such as an orchestra, singers and ballet. The increasing prominence of the solo piano virtuoso in the 1830s led to other acts on the bill being described as &quot;assistant artists&quot;, with Liszt declaring his pre-eminence in a letter to a friend dated June 1839: &quot;Le concert, c&#x27;est moi&quot;. Liszt is credited as the first pianist to give solo recitals in the modern sense of the word; the term was first applied to Liszt&#x27;s concert at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on 9 June 1840.

During his years as a travelling virtuoso Liszt performed an enormous amount of music, usually from memory. He was the first to include the full range of repertoire, from J. S. Bach to Chopin. His concerts included original compositions such as &quot;Grand galop chromatique&quot;, &quot;Fantaisie romantique sur deux mélodies suisses&quot; and &quot;Grande Valse di Bravura&quot;; and his transcriptions of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Schwanengesang&quot;, &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; by Berlioz and Beethoven&#x27;s sixth symphony. Liszt would champion Beethoven&#x27;s work throughout his life, and his concerts helped popularise the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; sonata and &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;.

=== Instruments ===
After arriving in Paris in 1823, Sébastien Érard presented Liszt with a grand piano featuring his newly patented double escapement mechanism, a key development in piano technology allowing for faster note repetition. Among the composer&#x27;s pianos in Weimar were an Érard, a Bechstein, the Beethovens&#x27; Broadwood grand and a Boisselot. It is known that Liszt used Boisselot pianos in his Portugal tour and then later in 1847 in a tour to Kiev and Odessa. Liszt kept the piano at his Villa Altenburg residence in Weimar.

The earliest records of Liszt playing the organ date from 1836. He developed an interest in J. S. Bach&#x27;s organ music in the early 1840s, probably due to Mendelssohn&#x27;s influence. Later, Liszt commissioned a &quot;piano-organ&quot; from the Paris company Alexandre Père et Fils. The instrument was made in 1854 under Berlioz&#x27;s supervision, using an 1853 Érard piano, and was a combination of piano and harmonium with three manuals and a pedal board. The company called it a &quot;Liszt piano-harmonium&quot; and installed it in Villa Altenburg in July 1854; the instrument is now exhibited in the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde collection in Vienna.

Liszt owned two other organs which were installed later in his Budapest residence. The first was a &quot;piano-orgue&quot;: this was a smaller version of Weimar&#x27;s instrument, a combination of a 1864 Érard piano and a harmonium, with two independent manuals, the upper for the piano and lower for the harmonium, built again by Alexandre Père et Fils in 1865. The second was a &quot;cabinet organ&quot;, a large concert harmonium built by the American company Mason &amp; Hamlin and given to Liszt in 1877.

== Works ==
Liszt was a prolific composer. He is best known for his piano music, which forms the majority of his oeuvre, but he also wrote for orchestra and for other ensembles. His piano works are often marked by their difficulty. Some of his works are programmatic, based on extra-musical inspirations such as poetry or art. Liszt is credited with the creation of the symphonic poem.

=== Keyboard music ===
==== Piano ====

The best-known portion of Liszt&#x27;s music is his original piano work. During the Weimar period he composed the first 15 Hungarian Rhapsodies, themselves revisions of his earlier Magyar Dalok/Rhapsódiák, which were influenced by the Romani bands he heard while visiting Hungary. &quot;Harmonies poétiques et religieuses&quot;, also the result of a long gestation, was published around the same time, and dedicated to Princess Carolyne. Likewise, the six &quot;Grandes Études de Paganini&quot; were revised from an earlier 1840 edition and published in 1851; these include the famous piece &quot;La campanella&quot;. Other notable pieces include the thoroughly revised collections of &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; (&quot;Years of Pilgrimage&quot;), inspired by his travels around Europe; the Piano Sonata in B minor, which has been described as &quot;one of the most original contributions to sonata form to come out of the 19th century&quot;; and the &quot;Transcendental Études&quot;, which are stylistically varied, technically difficult, and have been described as &quot;Liszt at his most Lisztian&quot;.

==== Organ ====
Liszt wrote his two largest organ works between 1850 and 1855 while he was living in Weimar, a city with a long tradition of organ music, most notably that of J. S. Bach. Humphrey Searle calls these worksthe &quot;Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale &quot;Ad nos, ad salutarem undam&quot;&quot; and the &quot;Fantasy and Fugue on the Theme B-A-C-H&quot;Liszt&#x27;s &quot;only important original organ works&quot;; Derek Watson considered them among the most significant organ works of the nineteenth century, heralding the work of such key organist-musicians as Reger, Franck and Saint-Saëns, among others. Liszt also wrote the monumental set of variations on the first section of the second movement chorus from Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12&quot; (which Bach later reworked as the &quot;&quot; in the Mass in B minor), which he composed after the death of his daughter in 1862. He also wrote a Requiem for organ solo, intended to be performed liturgically during the service of the spoken Requiem Mass.

==== Transcriptions and paraphrases ====
Liszt coined the terms &quot;transcription&quot; and &quot;paraphrase&quot;, the former being a faithful reproduction of the source material and the latter a more free reinterpretation. He wrote substantial quantities of both over the course of his life, and they form a large proportion of his total outputup to half of his solo piano output from the 1830s and 1840s is transcription and paraphrase, and of his total output only approximately a third is completely original. In the mid-19th century, orchestral performances were much less common than they are today and were not available at all outside major cities; thus, Liszt&#x27;s transcriptions played a major role in popularising a wide array of music such as Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies. Liszt&#x27;s transcriptions of Italian opera, Schubert songs and Beethoven symphonies are also significant indicators of his artistic development, the opera allowing him to improvise in concert and the Schubert and Beethoven influence indicating his compositional development towards the Germanic tradition. He also transcribed his own orchestral and choral music for piano in an attempt to make it better known.

In addition to piano transcriptions, Liszt also transcribed about a dozen works for organ, such as Otto Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical Festival Overture on the chorale &quot;Ein feste Burg&quot;&quot;, Orlando di Lasso&#x27;s motet &quot;Regina coeli&quot; and excerpts of Bach&#x27;s Cantata No. 21 and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

=== Songs ===
Today, Liszt&#x27;s songs are relatively obscure. There are 137 secular vocal pieces, 82 of which were original songs with piano accompaniment, mostly composed in the 1840s. In most cases the lyrics are in German, but there are also some in Italian and French, three in Hungarian and one in each of Russian and English. The influence of Italian opera can be seen in the songs&#x27; use of arioso and recitative styles. While in Weimar Liszt coached the Court Opera singers, and several prominent musicians sang his songs, including Rosa and Hans von Milde.

=== Program music ===
Liszt coined the term &quot;program music&quot; in an 1855 essay on Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, referring to pieces which are &quot;driven by an overarching poetic image or narrative&quot; (in the case of &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, the piece &quot;describes&quot; the scenes witnessed by the character Harold as he travels through Italy). This is presented in opposition to absolute music, which stands for itself and is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to the outside world. This was not a new ideasuch pieces had been written since the early 18th century, and Liszt himself had written works such as the early version of &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; which invoked his experiences travellingbut he presented the novel argument that program music was artistically superior, counter to the prevailing view that such work was unserious. This developed into the idea that the historical development of music as an art form was destined to move from absolute to representational: Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies had mostly been non-representational, but his ninth symphony had included some extramusical elements, and Berlioz had taken this further with &quot;Harold in Italy&quot; and &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. Wagner saw these developments as a stepping stone to the all-encompassing , and in this sense Liszt&#x27;s programmatic works were part of his vision of the &quot;Music of the Future&quot;.
Liszt&#x27;s main contribution to program music was his thirteen symphonic poems, one-movement orchestral works in which some extramusical program or idea provides a narrative or illustrative element. The first twelve of these were written between 1848 and 1858, and the most well-known are &quot;Les préludes&quot; and &quot;Mazeppa&quot;. The symphonic poems were poorly received by critics, especially in Weimar, where Liszt was residing at the timethey criticised Liszt&#x27;s compositional style as well as the whole idea of program music as the future of music.

Believing in the power of music to transcend people&#x27;s typical quotidian existence, with his program music Liszt attempted to &quot;elevate listeners to a higher realm of consciousness&quot;. He argued that its purpose was less to do with depicting a specific scene or experience, and more about allowing the listener to reach a higher state of existence. Such music would act as a more direct method of communication than language, allowing people to share exactly their own experiences. This view was endorsed by Franz Brendel, Wagner and Friedrich Theodor Vischer.

=== Late works ===

Liszt&#x27;s final period is considered to have started from about 1869, during which he wrote a number of short and independent works, such as the collection &quot;Weihnachtsbaum&quot; and a piano version of &quot;Via crucis&quot;, although he did continue to write transcriptions and paraphrases as well as sacred vocal music. Studies of his output from this period typically focus on pieces which display a willingness to push the boundaries of tonality and have an association with death and mourning, such as &quot;La lugubre gondola&quot; and &quot;Unstern!&quot;. The morbid focus on loss may be ascribed to Liszt&#x27;s mental state in his final decade, when he suffered episodes of depression. Many of these pieces remained unpublished in Liszt&#x27;s lifetime.

Liszt&#x27;s experimentation can be seen in his 1881 piece &quot;Nuages gris&quot;. Its key signature is G minor, but ends in an ambiguous tonality; its texture is generated by a collection of fragments rather than a distinct melody and harmony; and it uses chromaticism and dissonance such as the tritone. Additional examples include &quot;Czardas macabre&quot;, which repeatedly uses a single melodic motif and rhythm accompanied dissonantly or with open fifths, and &quot;Csárdás obstinée&quot;, which makes extensive use of false relations. Some of his sacred vocal music also shows this type of experimentation, such as &quot;Via crucis&quot;, which contains some movements without key signatures and with ambiguous tonality.

=== Writings ===
Liszt published a number of prose works and letters over the course of his life, including his 1863 &quot;Life of Chopin&quot;. Many scholars have doubted that he was their sole author, suggesting that the writings ascribed to Liszt were written partly or solely by Countess Marie d&#x27;Agoult or Princess Carolyne, but there is no consensus on this matter. It is known that the programs for some of his symphonic poems were ghost-written.

One of Liszt&#x27;s notable written works was his biography of Chopin, started less than a month after Chopin&#x27;s funeral. &quot;F. Chopin&quot; was serialised in the journal &quot;&quot; in 1851 and published in book form the following year, having been edited by Carolyne. The book was poorly received. Liszt had approached Chopin&#x27;s sister Ludwika and pupil Jane Stirling for information, but they had been uncooperative, finding the timing of his enquiries so soon after Chopin&#x27;s death to be insensitive. As a result the work contained several factual inaccuracies. Nevertheless George Sand, who features prominently in one of the chapters, admired the book. English translations garnered attention in the US and UK over the subsequent two decades, leading to a second edition in 1879. Once again Liszt asked Carolyne to help, but her contribution was so extensive that Liszt considered it over-involvement, going so far as to describe the book as having been &quot;written by Carolyne&quot;.

One significant essay by Liszt is (&quot;On the situation of artists&quot;), which was serialised in the Parisian &quot;Gazette musicale&quot; in 1835. This work calls for the reform of theatres: Liszt perceived the physical buildings to be unsafe and unpleasant, and their managers to be incompetent. He argues that they would book the cheapest variety of acts without concern for artistic merit, leading to subpar concert experiences. Furthermore, owners would blacklist performers who had appeared at a rival venue. Liszt was also concerned about the lack of professionalism of educational institutions, which were run by unqualified teachers and charged high tuition. In his view, their courses lacked rigour, and had an undue preference for older music over that of living composers.

During his Weimar years, Liszt wrote essays for audiences on &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Alfonso und Estrella&quot;. In addition he wrote the book (translated as &quot;The Gypsy in Music&quot;) about the Romani and their influence on Hungarian folk music. This work proved controversial in the country, with Hungarians disputing Liszt&#x27;s assertion that Romani communities were responsible for a large contribution to the native music. The second edition, published in 1881, contains antisemitic passages included by Princess Carolyne.

Liszt also worked until at least 1885 on a treatise on modern harmony entitled &quot;Sketches for a Harmony of the Future&quot;. Arthur Friedheim, a pupil of Liszt&#x27;s at the time, remembered seeing it among Liszt&#x27;s papers at Weimar. Liszt told Friedheim that the time was not yet ripe to publish the manuscript. This treatise has since been lost.

== Legacy ==
=== Compositions ===
Romantic music generally fell out of favour during the first half of the 20th century, as composers such as Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Bartók took the art form in new directions. Liszt&#x27;s music seemed &quot;flamboyant and excessive&quot; in contrast with their leaner styles, and his work had neither become part of the established canon nor received credit for being avant-garde. His piano music received attention from few pianists during this period, and only a few select popular pieces such as the &quot;Liebesträume&quot; and &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot; were published in collections. Two notable champions were Ferruccio Busoni, who delivered all-Liszt recitals in Berlin in 19041905 and 1911, and Humphrey Searle, who organised concerts of Liszt&#x27;s chamber and orchestral music in the 1930s and 1940s. Of his orchestral works, only &quot;Les préludes&quot; and the &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; were performed regularly.

During the Romantic Revival of the 1950s Liszt&#x27;s works and writings received greater attention, and scholars now appreciate the wide range and originality of his compositions. In the decades since, recordings of the vast majority of his output have become available, and a complete edition of scores is being published, to modernise the previous such collection published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in 19071936. Liszt competitions occur across the world, and Liszt societies promote his work.
Scholar James Deaville writes that &quot;few composers of the nineteenth century, except possibly Wagner, had the same influence upon succeeding generations as Liszt did. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to think of an innovative composer of the early twentieth century who was not influenced by Liszt&#x27;s music, especially in its departures from traditional harmonies and novel approaches to form and formal unity&quot;. Prokofiev admired Liszt&#x27;s concertos, which influenced his own, and Stravinsky remarked that he had &quot;admiration for the great Liszt whose immense talent in composition is underrated.&quot; Liszt&#x27;s piano music had a strong influence on the Impressionistic music of Debussy and Ravel; one example is Debussy&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;isle joyeuse&quot;, which has clear similarities with &quot;Les jeux d&#x27;eaux à la villa d&#x27;Este&quot;, a piece he heard Liszt perform in 1884. Liszt also had a marked influence on early 20th-century Hungarian composers, especially Kodály with his &quot;Psalmus Hungaricus&quot;, Dohnányi in his second string quartet, and Bartók, who admired Liszt&#x27;s works greatly. Liszt&#x27;s method of using Hungarian folk music in his compositions was developed further by these composers and their successors, who integrated such themes more subtly and valued the authenticity of the source material to a greater extent.

It is now held that many of Liszt&#x27;s late compositions, such as &quot;Nuages gris&quot;, &quot;Les jeux d&#x27;eaux à la villa d&#x27;Este&quot; and &quot;Czardas macabre&quot;, anticipated future developments. Their use of parallel fifths, the whole-tone scale, unresolved dissonances and parallel diminished and augmented triads, predates similar compositional techniques used by Ravel and Bartók. Liszt also pioneered a tonal language of building chords in fourths, which was a technique later used by Schoenberg. However, many of Liszt&#x27;s late works were not available until the publication of José Vianna da Motta&#x27;s final volume of Liszt&#x27;s solo pieces in 1927, so much of his more radical experimentation cannot have influenced composers before then.

Liszt&#x27;s invention of the symphonic poem had an impact across Europe from the last years of his life through to the 1920s. His friend Saint-Saëns wrote &quot;Le Rouet d&#x27;Omphale&quot; in 1869 and &quot;La jeunesse d&#x27;Hercule&quot; in 1877; Smetana, another friend, wrote &quot;Má vlast&quot; in the 1870s. Franck, d&#x27;Indy, Dvořák and Debussy all wrote symphonic poems in the 1880s and 1890s. Sibelius was introduced to the music of Liszt through his teacher Martin Wegelius, and the influence of Liszt&#x27;s symphonic poems is seen in Sibelius&#x27; &quot;Kullervo&quot; and &quot;En saga&quot;. Richard Strauss also wrote his notable collection of tone poems around this time, and these are similarly indebted to Liszt.

Liszt is also credited with several proto-cinematic innovations which anticipate Wagner&#x27;s more widely-recognised status as the &#x27;father of cinema&#x27;, such as audio-visual performance practices and cinematic listening.

=== Teaching ===

From 1827 until the last month of his life, Liszt gave lessons in composition and piano playing. He wrote in 1829 that his schedule was &quot;so full of lessons that each day, from half-past eight in the morning till 10 at night, I have scarcely breathing time&quot;. Estimates of the total number of pupils he taught range as high as over 400, although some of these may only have had one lesson, or perhaps even none at all.

In Weimar Liszt pioneered the concept of the masterclass, in which he would instruct each pupil in turn while the others observed. Students from this time included Karl Tausig, Hans von Bülow, Karl Klindworth and Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff. Members of these classes would also accompany Liszt to concerts and other events. In later years some in Weimar would criticise the masterclasses as a vanity club more interested in praising Liszt than in learning pianistic excellence, although Carl Lachmund commented that the success of many of its pupils, such as Arthur Friedheim, Moriz Rosenthal, Frederic Lamond and Alexander Siloti, proved the groups&#x27; effectiveness.

Liszt offered his students little technical advice, expecting them to &quot;wash their dirty linen at home&quot;, as he phrased it. Instead, he focused on musical interpretation with a combination of anecdote, metaphor, and wit. He advised one student tapping out the opening chords of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein&quot; Sonata, &quot;Do not chop beefsteak for us.&quot; To another who blurred the rhythm in Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Gnomenreigen&quot;: &quot;There you go, mixing salad again.&quot; Liszt also wanted to avoid creating carbon copies of himself, believing instead in preserving his pupils&#x27; artistic individuality. This was in contrast to his contemporaries, who focused on drilling students in a uniform approach.

Liszt did not charge for lessons. He was troubled when German newspapers revealed that pedagogue Theodor Kullak had earned more than one million marks from teaching: &quot;As an artist, you do not rake in a million marks without performing some sacrifice on the altar of Art&quot;. He wrote an open letter to Kullak&#x27;s sons, published in the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, urging them to create an endowment for needy musicians, as Liszt himself frequently did.

<text>Pope Damasus II (; died 9 August 1048, born Poppo de&#x27; Curagnoni) was the Bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 17 July 1048 to his death on 9 August that same year. He was the second of the German pontiffs nominated by Emperor Henry III. A native of Bavaria, he was the third German to become pope and had one of the shortest papal reigns.

Upon the death of Clement II, envoys from Rome were sent to the emperor to ascertain who should be named pope. Henry named the bishop of Brixen, Poppo de&#x27; Curagnoni. While the envoys were away, the former pope Benedict IX reasserted himself and with the assistance of the disaffected Margrave Boniface III of Tuscany once again assumed the papacy. Henry ordered Boniface to escort Poppo to Rome, but Boniface declined, pointing out that the Romans had already enthroned Benedict. Enraged, the emperor ordered the margrave to depose Benedict or suffer the consequences. Poppo became pope in mid-July but died less than a month later, in Palestrina.

== Early life ==

Poppo was a younger son of a Bavarian noble family. He became the bishop of Brixen in Tyrol in 1040, upon nomination by King Henry III. He was already consecrated by 16 January 1040. Poppo was also a key advisor to King Henry III of Germany and travelled with him to Italy for his imperial coronation in 1046.

== Imperial intervention ==

In 1046, the city of Rome was in chaos. It had three popes, Benedict IX, Sylvester III, and Gregory VI, one at St. Peter&#x27;s, one at the Lateran, and a third at S. Maria Maggiore. There was street fighting between inhabitants of the city proper and the inhabitants of the Trastevere region. Pope Gregory VI&#x27;s archdeacon, Peter, took matters into his own hands, summoned a Roman synod, and sent representatives to the Emperor Henry III, begging for aid to restore order. Henry, who was looking forward to his imperial coronation in Rome, needed one, clear, universally acknowledged pope to perform the ceremony. He left Augsburg, therefore, and was in Verona in the second week of September 1046. There he held a military review. He then moved to Pavia, where he was in residence by 25 October 1046, and where he held both a &quot;synodale concilium&quot; and a &quot;populare iudicium&quot;. One of the bishops present at the synod was Poppo of Brixen. On 25 November, the King was in Lucca, and on 1 December at San Genesio, near San Miniato. Finally he reached Sutri, only 56 km (35 mi) from Rome. There he summoned a synod on 20 December 1046, which came to be attended by 1046 bishops and by the Roman clergy. The three papal claimants were ordered to appear, and Gregory VI and Sylvester III did so. Gregory was compelled to recite the circumstances of his election, which seemed to many of the bishops to be simoniacal; realizing the depth of his difficulties, Gregory resigned his papal office and claims. Sylvester was deposed, and ordered to a monastery. Benedict had already fled to his relatives in Tusculum. The imperial party then moved on to Rome, where another synod was held on 23 and 24 December. The once deposed, and anathematized, Benedict IX, was again deposed, as were the other two already deposed claimants, and the throne of Peter declared vacant. Henry acknowledged the right of the Romans to elect their own bishop, absent an emperor. but the Roman senators begged the emperor to give them a suitable candidate. Henry first named Bishop Adalbert of Hamburg and Bremen, but he declined. Then the King named Bishop Suidger of Bamberg in Bavaria, who was elected on Christmas Eve as Clement II. Both pope and emperor were crowned next day. Clement died less than ten months later, on 9 October 1047, at the abbey of S. Tommaso near Pesaro.

== Imperial nomination of Poppo==

Henry III in 1046 had displayed his imperial power by intervening against Pope Gregory VI and installing Clement II, The Roman &quot;plebs&quot;, acknowledging that power, sent an embassy to the emperor, which found Henry, who had been engaged in an indecisive campaign in Frisia, in his palace at Pöhlde in Saxony shortly before Christmas Day of 1047. They notified the emperor of Clement&#x27;s death and asked him, in his capacity as patricius of the Romans, to appoint a successor. The envoys, following their instructions, suggested as a suitable candidate Halinard, Archbishop of Lyon, who was a fluent speaker of Italian, and was well respected in Rome.

Henry was unwilling to rush matters, and so asked Wazo of Liège, the most independent bishop within the empire, who ought to be made pope. After careful consideration, Wazo declared that the most appropriate candidate for the vacant papal throne was the man the emperor had removed – Gregory VI. Wazo&#x27;s deliberations had taken time, and Henry soon lost patience. Henry instead appointed Poppo, bishop of Brixen in Tyrol, a proud man of distinguished learning who had taken part in the Synod of Sutri. This decision antagonized the Romans, who were still pushing for Halinard to become the new pope. Nevertheless, Henry sent the Roman envoys back to Rome with presents to prepare for the arrival of their new pope.

==Arrival in Italy==
During the envoys’ absence, imperial authority in Rome became virtually extinguished as the Tusculan faction reasserted its power. A former pope, Benedict IX, residing at Tusculum, had been watching the situation in Rome intently, and had decided that now was his opportunity to reclaim the papal throne. He approached the Margrave Boniface III of Tuscany for help, and Boniface, who did not like the emperor, was easily convinced to help anyone who would disrupt Henry&#x27;s authority. After Benedict had used his extensive supply of gold to gain a large number of followers, the margrave&#x27;s influence enabled him to occupy the papal throne for over eight months, from 8 November 1047 until 17 July 1048.

In the meantime, Henry was marching down towards Italy with Poppo, accompanying him at least as far as Ulm, where they were in residence on 25 January 1048. Here it came to light that the papal exchequer was close to bankrupt, and so Poppo was allowed to retain the revenues of his see. In addition, a deed was drawn up on 25 January 1048 that granted Poppo an important forest in the valley of Puster, some 75 km east of Brixen. Having done this, and unable to leave Germany in case there might be an uprising during his absence, Henry III directed Margrave Boniface of Tuscany to conduct the pope-designate to Rome in person, and in the emperor&#x27;s name to arrange for the enthroning of the new pope.

Given his role in the usurpation by Benedict IX, and his attitude towards Henry III, it is unsurprising that Boniface at first refused, advising Poppo when he entered Tuscany, &quot;I cannot go to Rome with you. The Romans have again installed Benedict, and he has won over the whole city to his cause. Besides, I am now an old man.&quot; Having nowhere to turn, and unable to proceed, Poppo had no choice but to turn around and return to Germany, where he informed Henry of what had transpired.

==Papal coronation==
Upon receiving the news, Henry was furious. Poppo was quickly sent back to Boniface, carrying with him a letter from the emperor which ordered Boniface to arrange the expulsion of Benedict and the enthroning of his successor. Henry was simple and direct. &quot;Learn, you who have restored a pope who was canonically deposed, and who have been led by love of money to despise my commands; learn that, if you do not amend your ways, I will soon come and make you.&quot; These threats soon reduced Boniface to obedience. He sent a body of troops into Rome and forcibly expelled Benedict from the city.

After Benedict IX&#x27;s removal, Poppo entered the city, as the Romans, with demonstrations of joy, welcomed the bishop who would be pope. He was enthroned at the Lateran as Pope Damasus II on 17 July 1048. His pontificate, however, was of short duration. Rumors circulated that he had been poisoned, allegedly by a man named Gerhard Brazutus, a friend of Benedict IX and a follower of Hildebrand. However, the source for this information is suspect. He retired to Palestrina. After a brief reign of twenty-three days, he died on 9 August 1048. A modern conjecture is that he died of malaria.

Pope Damasus II was buried in San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, according to Onuphrio Panvinio, the 16th century &quot;scriptor&quot; in the Vatican Library. The sarcophagus in which Damasus&#x27; body had been placed, and which was moved at least twice, was large and &quot;adorned with reliefs representing a vineyard, with cupids as the wine gatherers.&quot;

<text>West Africa, also known as Western Africa, is the westernmost region of Africa. The United Nations defines Western Africa as the 16 countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo, as well as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (United Kingdom Overseas Territory). The population of West Africa is estimated at around million people as of , and at 381,981,000 as of 2017, of which 189,672,000 were female and 192,309,000 male. The region is demographically and economically one of the fastest growing on the African continent.

Early history in West Africa includes a number of prominent regional powers that dominated different parts of both the coastal and internal trade networks, such as the Mali and Gao Empires. West Africa sat at the intersection of trade routes between Arab-dominated North Africa and further south on the continent, the source of specialized goods such as gold, advanced iron-working, and ivory. After European exploration encountered rich local economies and kingdoms, the Atlantic slave trade built on already existing slave systems to provide labor for colonies in the Americas. After the end of the slave trade in the early 19th century, European nations, especially France and Britain, continued to exploit the region through colonial relationships. For example, they continued exporting a number of extractive goods, including labor-intensive agricultural crops like cocoa and coffee, forestry products like tropical timber, and mineral resources like gold. Since independence, many West African countries, such as the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal, have played important roles in the regional and global economies.

West Africa has a rich ecology, with strong biodiversity and several distinct regions. The area&#x27;s climate and ecology are heavily influenced by the dry Sahara to the north and east, which provides dry winds during the Harmattan, as well as the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west, which provides seasonal monsoons. This mixture of climates gives West Africa a rich and diverse array of biomes, from biodiversity-rich tropical forests to drylands supporting rare and endangered fauna such as pangolins, rhinoceros, and elephants. Because of the pressure for economic development, many of these ecologies are threatened by processes like deforestation, biodiversity loss, overfishing, pollution from mining, plastics and other industries, and extreme changes resulting from climate change in West Africa.

==History==

The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods: first, its prehistory, in which the first human settlers arrived, developed agriculture, and made contact with peoples to the north; the second, the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-Africa, and extra-Africa trade, and developed centralized states; third, major polities flourished, which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans; fourth, the colonial period, in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the entire region; and fifth, the post-independence era, in which the current nations were formed.

===Prehistory===

West African populations were considerably mobile and interacted with one another throughout the population history of West Africa. Acheulean tool-using archaic humans may have dwelled throughout West Africa since at least between 780,000 BP and 126,000 BP (Middle Pleistocene). During the Pleistocene, Middle Stone Age peoples (e.g., Iwo Eleru people, possibly Aterians), who dwelled throughout West Africa between MIS 4 and MIS 2, were gradually replaced by incoming Late Stone Age peoples, who migrated into West Africa as an increase in humid conditions resulted in the subsequent expansion of the West African forest. West African hunter-gatherers occupied western Central Africa (e.g., Shum Laka) earlier than 32,000 BP, dwelled throughout coastal West Africa by 12,000 BP, and migrated northward between 12,000 BP and 8000 BP as far as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania.

During the Holocene, Niger-Congo speakers independently created pottery in Ounjougou, Mali – the earliest pottery in Africa – by at least 9400 BCE, and along with their pottery, as well as wielding independently invented bows and arrows, migrated into the Central Sahara, which became their primary region of residence by 10,000 BP. The emergence and expansion of ceramics in the Sahara may be linked with the origin of Round Head and Kel Essuf rock art, which occupy rockshelters in the same regions (e.g., Djado, Acacus, Tadrart). Hunters in the Central Sahara farmed, stored, and cooked undomesticated central Saharan flora, underwent domestication of antelope, and domesticated and shepherded Barbary sheep. After the Kel Essuf Period and Round Head Period of the Central Sahara, the Pastoral Period followed. Some of the hunter-gatherers who created the Round Head rock art may have adopted pastoral culture, and others may have not. As a result of increasing aridification of the Green Sahara, Central Saharan hunter-gatherers and cattle herders may have used seasonal waterways as the migratory route taken to the Niger River and Chad Basin of West Africa. In 2000 BCE, &quot;Thiaroye Woman&quot;, also known as the &quot;Venus of Thiaroye&quot;, may have been the earliest statuette created in Sub-Saharan West Africa; it may have particularly been a fertility statuette, created in the region of Senegambia, and may be associated with the emergence of complexly organized pastoral societies in West Africa between 4000 BCE and 1000 BCE. Though possibly developed as early as 5000 BCE, Nsibidi may have also developed in 2000 BCE, as evidenced by depictions of the West African script on Ikom monoliths at Ikom, in Nigeria. Migration of Saharan peoples south of the Sahelian region resulted in seasonal interaction with and gradual absorption of West African hunter-gatherers, who primarily dwelt in the savannas and forests of West Africa. In West Africa, which may have been a major regional cradle in Africa for the domestication of crops and animals, Niger-Congo speakers domesticated the helmeted guineafowl between 5500 BP and 1300 BP; domestication of field crops occurred throughout various locations in West Africa, such as yams (d. praehensilis) in the Niger River basin between eastern Ghana and western Nigeria (northern Benin), rice (oryza glaberrima) in the Inner Niger Delta region of Mali, pearl millet (cenchrus americanus) in northern Mali and Mauritania, and cowpeas in northern Ghana. After having persisted as late as 1000 BP, or some period of time after 1500 CE, remaining West African hunter-gatherers, many of whom dwelt in the forest-savanna region, were ultimately acculturated and admixed into the larger groups of West African agriculturalists, akin to the migratory Bantu-speaking agriculturalists and their encounters with Central African hunter-gatherers.

===Empires===


The development of the region&#x27;s economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form, beginning with Dhar Tichitt that began in 1600 B.C. followed by Djenné-Djenno beginning in 300 B.C. This was then succeeded by the Ghana Empire that first flourished roughly between the 2nd and 12th centuries C.E., which later gave way to the Mali Empire. In current-day Mauritania, there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C., and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mandé peoples. Also, based on the archaeology of the city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania, the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052.

Three great kingdoms were identified in &quot;Bilad al-Sudan&quot; by the ninth century. They included Ghana, Gao and Kanem.

The Sosso Empire sought to fill the void but was defeated () by the Mandinka forces of Sundiata Keita, founder of the new Mali Empire. The Mali Empire continued to flourish for several centuries, most particularly under Sundiata&#x27;s grandnephew Musa I, before a succession of weak rulers led to its collapse under Mossi, Tuareg and Songhai invaders. In the 15th century, the Songhai would form a new dominant state based on Gao, in the Songhai Empire, under the leadership of Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed.

Meanwhile, south of Sudan, strong city-states arose in Igboland, such as the 10th-century Kingdom of Nri, which helped birth the arts and customs of the Igbo people, Bono State in the 11th century, which gave birth to the numerous Akan States, while Ife rose to prominence around the 12th century. Further east, Oyo arose as the dominant Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy as a dominant Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria.

The Kingdom of Nri was a West African medieval state in present-day southeastern Nigeria and a subgroup of the Igbo people. The Kingdom of Nri was unusual in the history of world government in that its leader exercised no military power over his subjects. The kingdom existed as a sphere of religious and political influence over a third of Igboland and was administered by a priest-king called an Eze Nri. The Eze Nri managed trade and diplomacy on behalf of the Nri people and possessed divine authority in religious matters.

The Oyo Empire was a Yoruba empire of what is today Western, North Central Nigeria and Southern Republic of Benin. Established in the 14th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Yoruba, wealth gained from trade and its powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin to the west.

The Benin Empire was a post-classical empire located in what is now southern Nigeria. Its capital was Edo, now known as Benin City, Edo. It should not be confused with the modern-day country called Benin, formerly called Dahomey. The Benin Empire was &quot;one of the oldest and most highly developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa, dating perhaps to the eleventh century CE&quot;. The Benin Empire was governed by a sovereign Emperor with hundreds of thousands of soldiers and a powerful council rich in resources, wealth, ancient science and technology with cities described as beautiful and large as Haarlem. &quot;Olfert Dapper, a Dutch writer, describing Benin in his book &quot;Description of Africa&quot; (1668) &quot;. Its craft was the most adored and treasured bronze casting in the history of Africa. It was annexed by the British Empire in 1897 during the invasion and scramble of Africa.

===European contact and enslavement===
Portuguese traders began establishing settlements along the coast in 1445, followed by the French, English, Spanish, Danish and Dutch; the African slave trade began not long after, which over the following centuries would debilitate the region&#x27;s economy and population. The slave trade also encouraged the formation of states such as the Bono State, Bambara Empire and Dahomey, whose economic activities include but not limited to exchanging slaves for European firearms.

===Colonialism===
In the early 19th century, a series of Fulani reformist jihads swept across Western Africa. The most notable include Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s Fulani Empire, which replaced the Hausa city-states, Seku Amadu&#x27;s Massina Empire, which defeated the Bambara, and El Hadj Umar Tall&#x27;s Toucouleur Empire, which briefly conquered much of modern-day Mali.

However, the French and British continued to advance in the Scramble for Africa, subjugating kingdom after kingdom. With the fall of Samory Ture&#x27;s established Wassoulou Empire in 1898 and the Ashanti queen Yaa Asantewaa in 1902, most West African military resistance to colonial rule resulted in failure.

Part of the West African regions underwent an increase in the numeracy level throughout the 19th century. The reason for such a growth was predetermined by a number of factors. Namely, the peanut production and trade, which was boosted by the demand of the colonial states. Importantly, the rise of numeracy was higher in the regions which were less hierarchical and had less dependence on the slavery trade (e.g. Sine and Salum). Whereas areas with the opposite trends illustrated opposite tendencies (e.g. central and northern Senegal). Those patterns were further even more stimulated by the French colonial campaign.

Britain controlled the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria throughout the colonial era, while France unified Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Ivory Coast, and Niger into French West Africa. Portugal founded the colony of Guinea-Bissau, while Germany claimed Togoland, but was forced to divide it between France and Britain following First World War due to the Treaty of Versailles. Only Liberia retained its independence, at the price of major territorial concessions.

===Postcolonial era===

Following World War II, nationalist movements arose across West Africa. In 1957, Ghana, under Kwame Nkrumah, became the first West African colony to achieve its independence, followed the next year by France&#x27;s colonies (Guinea in 1958 under the leadership of President Ahmed Sekou Touré); by 1974, West Africa&#x27;s nations were entirely autonomous.

Since independence, many West African nations have been submerged under political instability, with notable civil wars in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast, and a succession of military coups in Ghana and Burkina Faso.

Since the end of colonialism, the region has been the stage for some brutal conflicts, including:
* Nigerian Civil War
* First Liberian Civil War
* Second Liberian Civil War
* Guinea-Bissau Civil War
* Ivorian Civil War
* Sierra Leone Rebel War
* Mali War

==Geopolitical division==
Geopolitically, the United Nations definition of subregion Western Africa includes the preceding states with the addition of Mauritania (which withdrew from ECOWAS in 1999), comprising an area of approximately 6.1 million square km. The UN region also includes the United Kingdom Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha in the south Atlantic Ocean.
===Area===
In the United Nations scheme of African regions, the region of Western Africa includes 16 states and the United Kingdom Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal and the Niger are mostly in the Sahel, a transition zone between the Sahara desert and the Sudanian Savanna; Benin, Ivory Coast, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria compose most of Guinea, the traditional name for the area near the Gulf of Guinea; Mauritania lies in the Maghreb, the northwestern region of Africa that has historically been inhabited by West African groups such as the Fulani, Soninke, Wolof, Serer and Toucouleur people, along with Arab-Berber Maghrebi people such as the Tuareg; Cape Verde is an island country in the Atlantic Ocean; and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha consists of eight main islands located in four different parts of the Atlantic. Due to Mauritania&#x27;s increasingly close ties to the Arab World and its 1999 withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in modern times it is often considered, especially in Africa, as now part of western North Africa.

==Environment==
===Nature===

Before European colonisation, West African countries such as those from the Senegambia region (Senegal and the Gambia) used to have a diverse wildlife including lions, hippopotamus, elephants, antelopes, leopards etc. However, during colonization, the European colonizers such as the French and British killed most of the wildlife particularly the lions, using their body parts as trophies. By the turn of the 20th century, the Senegambia region had lost most of its lion population and other exotic animals due to poaching. By the 1930s, the Gambian elephant population became extinct. That phenomenon was not only limited to the Senegambia region but affected much of West Africa as the region lost much of its &quot;natural resources once tied so closely to its cultural identity. Poaching has stolen most of its wildlife.&quot; The British issued poaching licenses, and although they would later try to reverse the damage that had been done by attempting to preserve what was left of the local wildlife, but by that time, it was too late. During the 1930s, the elephant population in the Gold Coast was about 300, and Sierra Leone between 500 and 600. Although a small number of elephants survived in Nigeria, hunting, agricultural expansion and clearing of forest in that country drastically affected its wildlife population, particularly elephants.

Despite the historical damage that has been done to the region&#x27;s wildlife populations, there are still some protected nature reserves within the region. Some of these include:

* The Bandia Nature Reserve in Senegal (French: &quot;Réserve de Bandia&quot;), animal life includes: giraffes, zebras, rhinos, a variety of antelopes, buffaloes, monkeys, crocodiles, tortoises. apes and a variety of exotic birds.
* The Yankari National Park in Nigeria, animal life includes: the African bush elephant, olive baboon, patas monkey, Tantalus monkey, roan antelope, western hartebeest, West African lion, African buffalo, waterbuck, bushbuck and hippopotamus.
#The Ankasa Conservation Area in Ghana, animal life includes the elephant, bongo, leopard, chimpanzee, Diana monkey, and other primates.
* The Mole National Park is Ghana&#x27;s biggest wildlife refuge. It is home to over 83 mammal species including about 800 resident elephants, buffalo, hippos, and warthogs as well as various fauna and flora.

West Africa is also home to several baobab trees and other plant life. Some baobab trees are several centuries old and form part of the local folklore, for example, a mythical baobab tree named &quot;Ngoye njuli&quot; in Senegal which is regarded as a sacred site by the Serer. The tree itself is rather majestic and looks like a huge phallus and a deformed animal or thing is protruding from it. It is said to be the dwelling place of a pangool. Ngoye njuli is protected by the Senegalese authorities and attracts visitors. In West Africa, as in other parts of Africa where the baobab tree is found, the leaves are mixed with couscous and eaten, the bark of the tree is used to make ropes, and the fruit and seeds are used for drinks and oils.
===Deforestation===
West Africa is greatly affected by deforestation and has one of the worst deforestation rate. Even &quot;the beloved baobab tree&quot; which is viewed as sacred by some West African cultures are under threat due to climate change, urbanization and population growth. &quot;Huge swaths of forest are being razed to clear space for palm oil and cocoa plantations. Mangroves are being killed off by pollution. Even wispy acacias are hacked away for use in cooking fires to feed growing families.&quot; Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, have lost large areas of their rainforest. In 2005, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ranked Nigeria as the state with the worst deforestation rate in the entire world. Causes include logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of fuelwoods.

According to a ThoughtCo publication authored Steve Nix (2018), almost 90 percent of West Africa&#x27;s original rainforest has been destroyed, and the rest is &quot;heavily fragmented and in a degraded state, being poorly used.&quot;

=== Overfishing ===
Overfishing is a major issue in West Africa. Besides reducing fish stocks in the region, it also threatens food security and the livelihoods of many coastal communities that largely depend on artisanal fishing. The overfishing generally comes from foreign trawlers operating in the region.

To combat the overfishing, Greenpeace has recommended countries reduce the number of registered trawlers operating in African waters, increase the monitoring and control and set up regional fisheries organizations. Some steps have already been taken in the form of WARFP (the World Bank&#x27;s West Africa Regional Fisheries Program which empowers west-African countries (i.e. Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cape Verde, and Senegal) with information, training and monitoring systems. Furthermore, Liberia enacted a fisheries regulations Act in 2010 and installed a satellite-based monitoring system and Senegal enacted a fisheries code in 2015. In Cape Verde, the fishermen communities of Palmiera and Santa Maria have organized themselves to protect fishing zones. Mozambique finally created a conservation area, including a coastline.
===Geography and climate===
West Africa, broadly defined to include the western portion of the Maghreb (Western Sahara, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), occupies an area in excess of 6,140,000 km2, or approximately one-fifth of Africa. The vast majority of this land is plains lying less than 300 meters above sea level, though isolated high points exist in numerous states along the southern shore of West Africa.

The northern section of West Africa (narrowly defined to exclude the western Maghreb) is composed of semi-arid terrain known as Sahel, a transitional zone between the Sahara and the West Sudanian savanna. Forests form a belt between the savannas and the southern coast, ranging from 160 km to 240 km in width.

The northwest African region of Mauritania periodically suffers country-wide plagues of locusts which consume water, salt and crops on which the human population relies.

====Background====
West Africa is west of an imagined north-south axis lying close to 10° east longitude. The Atlantic Ocean forms the western as well as the southern borders of the West African region. The northern border is the Sahara Desert, with the Ranishanu Bend generally considered the northernmost part of the region. The eastern border is less precise, with some placing it at the Benue Trough, and others on a line running from Mount Cameroon to Lake Chad.

Colonial boundaries are reflected in the modern boundaries between contemporary West African states, cutting across ethnic and cultural lines, often dividing single ethnic groups between two or more states.

In contrast to most of Central, Southern, and Southeast Africa, West Africa is not populated by Bantu-speaking peoples.

=== Climate change ===

==Transport==

===Rail transport===

A Trans-ECOWAS project, established in 2007, plans to upgrade railways in this zone. One of the goals of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is the development of an integrated railroad network. Aims include the extension of railways in member countries, the interconnection of previously isolated railways and the standardization of gauge, brakes, couplings, and other parameters. The first line would connect the cities and ports of Lagos, Cotonou, Lomé and Accra and would allow the largest container ships to focus on a smaller number of large ports, while efficiently serving a larger hinterland. This line connects gauge and systems, which would require four rail dual gauge, which can also provide standard gauge.

===Road transport===
The &quot;Trans–West African Coastal Highway&quot; is a transnational highway project to link 12 West African coastal states, from Mauritania in the north-west of the region to Nigeria in the east, with feeder roads already existing to two landlocked countries, Mali and Burkina Faso.

The eastern end of the highway terminates at Lagos, Nigeria. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) consider its western end to be Nouakchott, Mauritania, or to be Dakar, Senegal, giving rise to these alternative names for the road:
* Nouakchott–Lagos Highway
* Lagos–Nouakchott Highway
* Dakar–Lagos Highway
* Lagos–Dakar Highway
* Trans-African Highway 7 in the Trans-African Highway network

===Air transport===
The capitals&#x27; airports include:
*Cadjehoun Airport (COO) International; Cotonou, Benin
*Ouagadougou Airport (OUA); Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
*Amílcar Cabral International Airport (SID); Praia, Cape Verde
*Banjul International Airport (BJL) International; Banjul, Gambia
*Kotoka International Airport (ACC); Accra; Ghana
*Conakry International Airport (CKY); Conakry, Guinea
*Osvaldo Vieira International Airport (OXB); Bissau, Guinea-Bissau
*Port Bouet Airport (ABJ); Abidjan, Ivory Coast
*Roberts International Airport (ROB); Monrovia, Liberia
*Bamako–Sénou International Airport (BKO); Bamako, Mali
*Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport (NKC); Nouakchott, Mauritania
*Diori Hamani International Airport (NIM); Niamey, Niger
*Murtala Muhammed International Airport (LOS); Lagos, Nigeria
*Saint Helena Airport; Jamestown, Saint Helena
*Blaise Diagne International Airport (DSS); Dakar, Senegal
*Lungi International Airport (FNA); Freetown, Sierra Leone
*Lomé–Tokoin Airport (LFW); Lomé, Togo

Of the sixteen, the most important hub and entry point to West Africa are Kotoka International Airport, and Murtala Muhammed International Airport, offering many international connections.

==Health==

West Africa has made considerable improvement in the health outcomes of its populations, despite the challenges posed by pervasive poverty, epidemic diseases, and food insecurity. The traditional communicable diseases of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are still the major reasons for mortality. Primary health care is the best answer to curing diseases, as it provides the basic preventive strategies and it reduce the rate of child and maternal morbidity and mortality—two of the most preventable outcomes that can prolong life expectancy at birth. Recently, mental health problems are on the rise in West Africa, as they are in many other world regions. However, the subject is largely a taboo, and professional treatment is still rare.

==Culture==

Despite the wide variety of cultures in West Africa, from Nigeria through to Senegal, there are general similarities in dress, cuisine, music and culture that are not shared extensively with groups outside the geographic region. This long history of cultural exchange predates the colonization era of the region and can be approximately placed at the time of the Ghana Empire (proper: Wagadou Empire), Mali Empire or perhaps before these empires. West Africa varies a series of tribes and cultures that have combined a diverse regional subculture.

===Art===
===Traditional architecture===

The main traditional styles of building (in conjunction with modern styles) are the distinct Sudano-Sahelian style in inland areas, and the coastal forest styles more reminiscent of other sub-Saharan areas. They differ greatly in construction due to the demands made by the variety of climates in the area, from tropical humid forests to arid grasslands and deserts. Despite the architectural differences, buildings perform similar functions, including the compound structure central to West African family life or the strict distinction between the private and public worlds needed to maintain taboos or social etiquette.

===Clothing===
In contrast to other parts of the continent south of the Sahara Desert, the concepts of hemming and embroidering clothing have been traditionally common to West Africa for centuries, demonstrated by the production of various breeches, shirts, tunics and jackets. As a result, the people of the region&#x27;s diverse nations wear a wide variety of clothing with underlying similarities. Typical pieces of West African formal attire include the knee-to-ankle-length, flowing Boubou robe, Dashiki, and Senegalese Kaftan (also known as &quot;Agbada&quot; and &quot;Babariga&quot;), which has its origins in the clothing of nobility of various West African empires in the 12th century. Traditional half-sleeved, hip-long, woven smocks or tunics (known as &quot;fugu&quot; in Gurunsi, &quot;riga&quot; in Hausa) – worn over a pair of baggy trousers—are another popular garment. In the coastal regions stretching from southern Ivory Coast to Benin, a huge rectangular cloth is wrapped under one arm, draped over a shoulder, and held in one of the wearer&#x27;s hands—coincidentally, reminiscent of Romans&#x27; togas. The best-known of these toga-like garments is the Kente (made by the Akan people of Ghana and Ivory Coast), who wear them as a gesture of national pride.

===Cuisine===


Scores of foreign visitors to West African nations (e.g., traders, historians, emigrants, colonists, missionaries) have benefited from its citizens&#x27; generosity, and even left with a piece of its cultural heritage, via its foods. West African cuisines have had a significant influence on those of Western civilization for centuries; several dishes of West African origin are currently enjoyed in the Caribbean (e.g., the West Indies and Haiti); Australia; the USA (particularly Louisiana, Virginia, North and South Carolina); Italy; and other countries. Although some of these recipes have been altered to suit the sensibilities of their adopters, they retain a distinct West African essence.

West African cuisines include fish (especially among the coastal areas), meat, vegetables, and fruits—most of which are grown by the nation&#x27;s local farmers. In spite of the obvious differences among the various local cuisines in this multinational region, the foods display more similarities than differences. The small difference may be in the ingredients used. Most foods are cooked via boiling or frying. Commonly featured, starchy vegetables include yams, plantains, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Rice is also a staple food, as is the Serer people&#x27;s sorghum couscous (called &quot;Chereh&quot; in Serer) particularly in Senegal and the Gambia. Jollof rice—originally from the Kingdom of Jolof (now part of modern-day Senegal) but has spread to the Wolofs of Gambia—is also enjoyed in many Western nations, as well; Mafé (proper: &quot;Tigh-dege-na&quot; or &quot;Domodah&quot;) from Mali (via the Bambara and Mandinka)—a peanut-butter stew served with rice; Akara (fried bean balls seasoned with spices served with sauce and bread) from Nigeria is a favorite breakfast for Gambians and Senegalese, as well as a favorite side snack or side dish in Brazil and the Caribbean just as it is in West Africa. It is said that its exact origin may be from Yorubaland in Nigeria. Fufu (from the Twi language, a dough served with a spicy stew or sauce for example okra stew etc.) from Ghana is enjoyed throughout the region and beyond even in Central Africa with their own versions of it. Dishes such as taguella, eghajira, etc. are popular among the Tuareg people.

===Recreation and sports===
The board game oware is quite popular in many parts of Southern Africa. The word &quot;Oware&quot; originates from the Akan people of Ghana. However, virtually all African peoples have a version of this board game. The major multi-sport event of West Africa is the ECOWAS Games which commenced at the 2012 ECOWAS Games.

Football is also a pastime enjoyed by many, either spectating or playing. The major national teams of West Africa, the Ghana national football team, the Ivory Coast national football team, and the Nigeria national football team regularly win the Africa Cup of Nations. Major football teams of West Africa are Asante Kotoko SC and Accra Hearts of Oak SC of the Ghana Premier League, Enyimba International of the Nigerian Premier League and ASEC Mimosas of the Ligue 1 (Ivory Coast). The football governing body of West Africa is the West African Football Union (WAFU) and the major tournament is the West African Club Championship and WAFU Nations Cup, along with the annual individual award of West African Footballer of the Year.

===Music===

Mbalax, Highlife, Fuji, Afrobeat, and Afrobeats are modern musical genres of West Africa and its diaspora.
Traditional folk music is also well-preserved. Some types of folk music are religious in nature such as the &quot;Tassou&quot; tradition used in Serer religion.

====Griot artists====
Griot artists and praise-singing is an important musical tradition related to the oral history of West African culture. Traditionally, musical and oral history as conveyed over generations by griots are typical of West African culture in Mande, Wolof, Songhay, Serer and, to some extent, Fula areas in the far west. A hereditary caste occupying the fringes of society, the griots were charged with memorizing the histories of local rulers and personages and the caste was further broken down into music-playing griots (similar to bards) and non-music-playing griots. Like Praise-singers, the griot&#x27;s main profession was musical acquisition and prowess, and patrons were the sole means of financial support. Modern griots enjoy higher status in the patronage of rich individuals in places such as Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and Guinea, and to some extent make up the vast majority of musicians in these countries. Examples of modern popular griot artists include Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Mamadou Diabate, Sona Jobareteh, and Toumani Diabate.

In other areas of West Africa, primarily among the Hausa, Mossi, Dagomba and Yoruba in the area encompassing Burkina Faso, northern Ghana, Nigeria and Niger, the traditional profession of non-hereditary praise-singers, minstrels, bards and poets play a vital role in extending the public show of power, lineage and prestige of traditional rulers through their exclusive patronage. Like the griot tradition, praise singers are charged with knowing the details of specific historical events and royal lineages, but more importantly need to be capable of poetic improvisation and creativity, with knowledge of traditional songs directed towards showing a patron&#x27;s financial and political or religious power. Competition between Praise-singing ensembles and artists is high, and artists responsible for any extraordinarily skilled prose, musical compositions, and panegyric songs are lavishly rewarded with money, clothing, provisions and other luxuries by patrons who are usually politicians, rulers, Islamic clerics and merchants; these successful praise-singers rise to national stardom. Examples include Mamman Shata, Souley Konko, Fati Niger, Saadou Bori and Dan Maraya. In the case of Niger, numerous praise songs are composed and shown on television in praise of local rulers, Islamic clerics, and politicians.

===Theatre===
===Film industry===

Nollywood of Nigeria, is the main film industry of West Africa. The Nigerian cinema industry is the second largest film industry in terms of number of annual film productions, ahead of the American film industry in Hollywood. Senegal and Ghana also have long traditions of producing films. The late Ousmane Sembène, the Senegalese film director, producer and writer is from the region, as is the Ghanaian Shirley Frimpong-Manso.

==Religion==
===Islam===
Islam is the predominant religion of the West African interior and the far west coast of the continent (71% of West Africans); and was introduced to the region by traders in the 9th century. Islam is the religion of the region&#x27;s biggest ethnic groups by population. Islamic rules on livelihood, values, dress and practices had a profound effect on the populations and cultures in their predominant areas, so much so that the concept of tribalism is less observed by Islamized groups like the Wolof, Hausa, Fula, Songhai, Zarma or Soninke, than they are by non-Islamized groups. Ethnic intermarriage and shared cultural icons are established through a superseded commonality of belief or community, known as ummah. Traditional Muslim areas include Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Guinea, Niger; the upper coast of Sierra Leone and inland Liberia; the western, northern and far-eastern regions of Burkina Faso; and the northern halves of the coastal nations of Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Ivory Coast.

===African traditional===
Traditional African religions (noting the many different belief systems) are the oldest belief systems among the populations of this region, and include Akan religion, Yoruba religion, Odinani-Igbo, and Serer religion. They are spiritual creeds that also perform other functions such as preserving the historical and cultural heritage of the people, and &quot;West African tribal groups&quot; blend social and religious rituals together to the point where there is usually not &quot;much distinction&quot; between them. Although traditional beliefs vary from one place to the next, there are more similarities than differences.

Most traditional religious organizations &quot;do not have a formal hierarchy of priests.&quot; Group rituals are usually overseen by tribal elders who, &quot;within many cultures&quot;, &quot;serve as the main religious figures and determine the time, nature, and intricacies of rituals&quot;, or shaman priests who can use magic to heal, control fate, and connect to the spirit world.

===Christianity===
In 2010, around 20% of West Africans identified as Christians. Christianity was largely introduced from the late 19th century onward, when missionaries from European countries brought the religion to the region. West African Christians are predominantly Roman Catholic or Anglican; some Evangelical churches have also been established. Christianity has become the predominant religion in the central and southern part of Nigeria, southern Ivory Coast, and the coastal regions stretching from southern Ghana to coastal parts of Sierra Leone. Like Islam, elements of traditional African religion are mixed with Christianity.

==Demographics and languages==
Native West Africans primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly, though not exclusively, to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found in West Africa. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sudan/Sahel, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, most prominently including the Hausa, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of the Sahel bordering Central Africa. In Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, the nomadic Tuareg speak the Tuareg language, a Berber language. The population of West Africa is estimated at million people as of . 

Colonial languages also play a pivotal cultural and political role, being adopted as the official languages of most countries in the region, as well as &quot;linguae franca&quot; in communication between the region&#x27;s various ethnic groups. For historical reasons, Western European languages such as French, English and Portuguese predominate in Southern and Coastal subregions, whilst Arabic (in its Maghrebi varieties) spreads inland northwards.

==Economic and regional organizations==
=== Economic Community of West Africa ===
=== West African Monetary Union ===
The West African Monetary Union (or UEMOA from its name in French, &quot;Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine&quot;) is limited to the eight, mostly Francophone countries that employ the CFA franc as their common currency. The Liptako–Gourma Authority of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso seeks to jointly develop the contiguous areas of the three countries.

===Women&#x27;s peace movement===
Since the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 in 2000, women have been engaged in rebuilding war-torn Africa. Starting with the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace and Women in Peacebuilding Network (WIPNET), the peace movement has grown to include women across West Africa.

Established on 8 May 2006, Women Peace and Security Network – Africa (WIPSEN-Africa), is a women-focused, women-led Pan-African non-governmental organization based in Ghana. The organization focuses on empowering women to have a role in political and peace governance in Africa. It has a presence in Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Regional leaders of nonviolent resistance include Leymah Gbowee, Comfort Freeman, and Aya Virginie Toure.

&quot;Pray the Devil Back to Hell&quot; is a documentary film about the origin of this peace movement. The film has been used as an advocacy tool in post-conflict zones like Sudan and Zimbabwe, mobilizing African women to petition for peace and security.

<doc id="67396" wikidata="Q42106" url="?curid=67396" title="Synonym">
<text>A synonym is a word, morpheme, or phrase that means precisely or nearly the same as another word, morpheme, or phrase in a given language. For example, in the English language, the words &quot;begin&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;commence&quot;, and &quot;initiate&quot; are all synonyms of one another: they are &quot;synonymous&quot;. The standard test for synonymy is substitution: one form can be replaced by another in a sentence without changing its meaning. 

Words may often be synonymous in only one particular sense: for example, &quot;long&quot; and &quot;extended&quot; in the context &quot;long time&quot; or &quot;extended time&quot; are synonymous, but &quot;long&quot; cannot be used in the phrase &quot;extended family&quot;. 

Synonyms with exactly the same meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. The former are sometimes called cognitive synonyms and the latter, near-synonyms, plesionyms or poecilonyms.

==Lexicography==
Some lexicographers claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because etymology, orthography, phonic qualities, connotations, ambiguous meanings, usage, and so on make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: &quot;feline&quot; is more formal than &quot;cat&quot;; &quot;long&quot; and &quot;extended&quot; are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a &quot;long arm&quot; is not the same as an &quot;extended arm&quot;). Synonyms are also a source of euphemisms.

Metonymy can sometimes be a form of synonymy: &quot;the White House&quot; is used as a synonym of &quot;the administration&quot; in referring to the U.S. executive branch under a specific president. Thus, a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word &quot;metonym&quot; is a hyponym of the word &quot;synonym&quot;.

The analysis of synonymy, polysemy, hyponymy, and hypernymy is inherent to taxonomy and ontology in the information science senses of those terms. It has applications in pedagogy and machine learning, because they rely on word-sense disambiguation.

==Etymology==
The word is borrowed from Latin &#x27;, in turn borrowed from Ancient Greek &#x27; (), composed of &#x27; ( &#x27;together, similar, alike&#x27;) and &quot;--&quot; (), a form of &#x27; ( &#x27;name&#x27;).

==Sources==

Synonyms are often from the different strata making up a language. For example, in English, Norman French superstratum words and Old English substratum words continue to coexist. Thus, today there exist synonyms like the Norman-derived &quot;people&quot;, &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;archer&quot;, and the Saxon-derived &quot;folk&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;bowman&quot;. For more examples, see the list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English.

Loanwords are another rich source of synonyms, often from the language of the dominant culture of a region. Thus, most European languages have borrowed from Latin and ancient Greek, especially for technical terms, but the native terms continue to be used in non-technical contexts. In East Asia, borrowings from Chinese in Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese often double native terms. In Islamic cultures, Arabic and Persian are large sources of synonymous borrowings.

For example, in Turkish, &#x27; and &#x27; both mean &#x27;black&#x27;, the former being a native Turkish word, and the latter being a borrowing from Persian. In Ottoman Turkish, there were often three synonyms: water can be &#x27; (Turkish), &#x27; (Persian), or &quot;&quot; (Arabic): &quot;such a triad of synonyms exists in Ottoman for every meaning, without exception&quot;. As always with synonyms, there are nuances and shades of meaning or usage.

In English, similarly, there often exist Latin (L) and Greek (Gk) terms synonymous with Germanic ones: &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;notion&quot; (L), &quot;idea&quot; (Gk); &quot;ring&quot;, &quot;circle&quot; (L), &quot;cycle&quot; (Gk). English often uses the Germanic term only as a noun, but has Latin and Greek adjectives: &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;manual&quot; (L), &quot;chiral&quot; (Gk); &quot;heat&quot;, &quot;thermal&quot; (L), &quot;caloric&quot; (Gk). Sometimes the Germanic term has become rare, or restricted to special meanings: &quot;tide&quot;, &quot;time&quot;/&quot;temporal&quot;, &quot;chronic&quot;.

Many bound morphemes in English are borrowed from Latin and Greek and are synonyms for native words or morphemes: &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;pisci-&quot; (L), &quot;ichthy-&quot; (Gk).

Another source of synonyms is coinages, which may be motivated by linguistic purism. Thus, the English word &quot;foreword&quot; was coined to replace the Romance &quot;preface&quot;. In Turkish, &quot;&quot; was coined to replace the Arabic-derived &quot;mektep&quot; and &quot;mederese&quot;, but those words continue to be used in some contexts.

==Uses==

Synonyms often express a nuance of meaning or are used in different registers of speech or writing.

Various technical domains may employ synonyms to convey precise technical nuances.

Some writers avoid repeating the same word in close proximity, and prefer to use synonyms: this is called elegant variation. Many modern style guides criticize this.

== Examples ==

Synonyms can be any part of speech, as long as both words belong to the same part of speech. Examples:

*noun: &quot;drink&quot; and &quot;beverage&quot;
*verb: &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;purchase&quot;
*adjective: &quot;big&quot; and &quot;large&quot;
*adverb: &quot;quickly&quot; and &quot;speedily&quot;
*preposition: &quot;on&quot; and &quot;upon&quot;

Synonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words: &quot;pupil&quot; as the &quot;aperture in the iris of the eye&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;student&quot;. Similarly, &quot;he expired&quot; means the same as &quot;he died&quot;, yet &quot;my passport has expired&quot; cannot be replaced by &quot;my passport has died&quot;.

A thesaurus or synonym dictionary lists similar or related words; these are often, but not always, synonyms.

* The word poecilonym is a rare synonym of the word &quot;synonym&quot;. It is not entered in most major dictionaries and is a curiosity or piece of trivia for being an autological word because of its meta quality as a synonym of &quot;synonym&quot;.
* Antonyms are words with opposite or nearly opposite meanings. For example: &quot;hot&quot; ↔ &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;large&quot; ↔ &quot;small&quot;, &quot;thick&quot; ↔ &quot;thin&quot;, &quot;synonym&quot; ↔ &quot;antonym&quot; 
* Hypernyms and hyponyms are words that refer to, respectively, a general category and a specific instance of that category. For example, &quot;vehicle&quot; is a hypernym of &quot;car&quot;, and &quot;car&quot; is a hyponym of &quot;vehicle&quot;.
* Homophones are words that have the same pronunciation but different meanings. For example, &quot;witch&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are homophones in most accents (because they are pronounced the same).
* Homographs are words that have the same spelling but different meanings. For example, one can &quot;record&quot; a song or keep a &quot;record&quot; of documents.
* Homonyms are words that have the same pronunciation and spelling but different meanings. For example, &quot;rose&quot; (a type of flower) and &quot;rose&quot; (past tense of &quot;rise&quot;) are homonyms.

<doc id="67397" wikidata="Q23430" url="?curid=67397" title="Ulaanbaatar">
<text>Ulaanbaatar is the capital and most populous city of Mongolia. It has a population of 1.6 million, and it is the coldest capital city in the world by average yearly temperature. The municipality is located in north central Mongolia at an elevation of about in a valley on the Tuul River. The city was founded in 1639 as a nomadic Buddhist monastic centre, changing location 28 times, and was permanently settled at its modern location in 1778.

During its early years, as Örgöö (anglicized as Urga), it became Mongolia&#x27;s preeminent religious centre and seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. Following the regulation of Qing-Russian trade by the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727, a caravan route between Beijing and Kyakhta opened up, along which the city was eventually settled. With the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the city was a focal point for independence efforts, leading to the proclamation of the Bogd Khanate in 1911 led by the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, or Bogd Khan, and again during the communist revolution of 1921. With the proclamation of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic in 1924, the city was officially renamed Ulaanbaatar and declared the country&#x27;s capital. Modern urban planning began in the 1950s, with most of the old ger districts replaced by Soviet-style flats. In 1990, Ulaanbaatar was the site of large demonstrations that led to Mongolia&#x27;s transition to democracy and a market economy. Since 1990, an influx of migrants from the rest of the country has led to an explosive growth in its population, a major portion of whom live in ger districts, which has led to harmful air pollution in winter.

Governed as an independent municipality, Ulaanbaatar is surrounded by Töv Province, whose capital Zuunmod lies south of the city. With a population of just over 1.6 million , it contains almost half of the country&#x27;s total population. As the country&#x27;s primate city, it serves as its cultural, industrial and financial heart and the center of its transport network.

==Names and etymology==
The city at its establishment in 1639 was referred to as (). This name was eventually adapted as in the West. By 1651, it began to be referred to as (), and by 1706 it was referred to as (). The Chinese equivalent, (, ), was rendered into Western languages as &quot;Kulun&quot; or &quot;Kuren&quot;.

Other names include (), or simply (), itself a term originally referring to an &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;.

Upon independence in 1911, with both the secular government and the Bogd Khan&#x27;s palace present, the city&#x27;s name was changed to ().

When the city became the capital of the new Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic on 29 October 1924, its name was changed to &quot;Ulaanbaatar&quot; (). At the meeting of the 1st Great People&#x27;s Khural in 1924, the majority of delegates voted in favor of renaming the capital of Mongolia to Bator-khoto (&quot;City of the Hero,&quot; or &quot;City of the Hero,&quot; implicitly referring to the figure of Genghis Khan). Nevertheless, at the insistence of the Comintern representative, Soviet-Kazakhstan political figure T. R. Ryskulov, who previously had no connection to Mongolia, the city was named Ulan Bator Khoto (&quot;City of the Red Hero&quot;). After the vote, he gave a speech:Genghis Khan was a national hero, but he was a conqueror. Present-day People&#x27;s Mongolia has no imperialistic goals; it wants to liberate itself and develop independently, along revolutionary lines. Therefore, the name Ulaanbaatar-Khoto will be a revolutionary name, and it will be understandable to everyone. The prefix Ulan (&quot;red&quot;) gives this name a revolutionary character, symbolizing the revolutionary steadfastness of the Mongolian people in their struggle for independence.In the Western world, Ulaanbaatar continued to be generally known as Urga or Khuree until 1924, and afterward as Ulan Bator (). This form was defined two decades before the Mongolian name got its current Cyrillic spelling and transliteration (1941–1950); however, the name of the city was spelled &quot;Ulaanbaatar koto&quot; during the decade in which Mongolia used the Latin alphabet.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Human habitation at the site of Ulaanbaatar dates from the Lower Paleolithic, with a number of sites on the Bogd Khan, Buyant-Ukhaa and Songinokhairkhan mountains, revealing tools which date from 300,000 years ago to 40,000–12,000 years ago. These Upper Paleolithic people hunted mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, the bones of which are found abundantly around Ulaanbaatar.

===Before 1639===

A number of Xiongnu-era royal tombs have been discovered around Ulaanbaatar, including the tombs of Belkh Gorge near Dambadarjaalin monastery and tombs of Songinokhairkhan. Located on the banks of the Tuul River, Ulaanbaatar has been well within the sphere of Turco-Mongol nomadic empires throughout history.

Wang Khan, Toghrul of the Keraites, a Nestorian Christian monarch whom Marco Polo identified as the legendary Prester John, is said to have had his palace here (the Black Forest of the Tuul River) and forbade hunting in the holy mountain Bogd Uul. The palace is said to be where Genghis Khan stayed with Yesui Khatun before attacking the Tangut in 1226.

During the Mongol Empire (1206–1368) and Northern Yuan dynasty (1368–1635) the main, natural route from the capital region of Karakorum to the birthplace and tomb of the Khans in the Khentii mountain region (Ikh Khorig) passed through the area of Ulaanbaatar. The Tuul River naturally leads to the north-side of Bogd Khan Mountain, which stands out as a large island of forest positioned conspicuously at the south-western edge of the Khentii mountains. As the main gate and stopover point on the route to and from the holy Khentii mountains, the Bogd Khan Mountain saw large amounts of traffic going past it and was protected from early times. Even after the Northern Yuan period it served as the location of the annual and triannual Assembly of Nobles (&quot;Khan Uuliin Chuulgan&quot;).

===Mobile monastery===
Founded in 1639 as a yurt monastery as Örgöö (), the settlement was first located at Lake Shireet Tsagaan nuur ( directly east of the imperial capital Karakorum) in what is now Burd sum, Övörkhangai, around south-west from the present site of Ulaanbaatar, and was intended by the Mongol nobles to be the seat of Zanabazar, the first Jebtsundamba Khutughtu. Zanabazar returned to Mongolia from Tibet in 1651, and founded seven &quot;aimags&quot; (monastic departments) in Urga, later establishing four more.

As a mobile monastery-town, Örgöö was often moved to various places along the Selenge, Orkhon and Tuul rivers, as supply and other needs would demand. During the Dzungar wars of the late 17th century, it was even moved to Inner Mongolia. As the city grew, it moved less and less.

The movements of the city can be detailed as follows: Shireet Tsagaan Nuur (1639), Khoshoo Tsaidam (1640), Khentii Mountains (1654), Ogoomor (1688), Inner Mongolia (1690), Tsetserlegiin Erdene Tolgoi (1700), Daagandel (1719), Usan Seer (1720), Ikh Tamir (1722), Jargalant (1723), Eeven Gol (1724), Khujirtbulan (1729), Burgaltai (1730), Sognogor (1732), Terelj (1733), Uliastai River (1734), Khui Mandal (1736), Khuntsal (1740), Udleg (1742), Ogoomor (1743), Selbe (1747), Uliastai River (1756), Selbe (1762), Khui Mandal (1772) and Selbe (1778).

In 1778, the city moved from Khui Mandal and settled for good at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers, and beneath Bogd Khan Uul, at that time also on the caravan route from Beijing to Kyakhta.

One of the earliest Western mentions of Urga is the account of the Scottish traveller John Bell in 1721:
By Zanabazar&#x27;s death in 1723, Urga was Mongolia&#x27;s preeminent monastery in terms of religious authority. A council of seven of the highest-ranking lamas (&quot;Khamba Nomon Khan&quot;, &quot;Ded Khamba&quot; and five &quot;Tsorj&quot;) made most of the city&#x27;s religious decisions. It had also become Outer Mongolia&#x27;s commercial center. From 1733 to 1778, Urga moved around the vicinity of its present location. In 1754, the Erdene Shanzodba Yam of Urga was given authority to supervise the administrative affairs of the Bogd&#x27;s subjects. It also served as the city&#x27;s chief judicial court. In 1758, the Qianlong Emperor appointed the Khalkha Vice General Sanzaidorj as the first Mongol amban of Urga, with full authority to &quot;oversee the Khuree and administer well all the Khutugtu&#x27;s subjects&quot;.

In 1761, a second amban was appointed for the same purpose, a Manchu one. A quarter-century later, in 1786, a decree issued in Peking gave right to the Urga ambans to decide the administrative affairs of Tusheet Khan and Setsen Khan territories. With this, Urga became the highest civil authority in the country. Based on Urga&#x27;s Mongol governor Sanzaidorj&#x27;s petition, the Qianlong Emperor officially recognized an annual ceremony on Bogd Khan Mountain in 1778 and provided the annual imperial donations. The city was the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktus, two Qing ambans, and a Chinese trade town grew &quot;four trees&quot; east of the city center at the confluence of the Uliastai and Tuul rivers.
By 1778, Urga may have had as many as ten thousand monks, who were regulated by a monastic rule, Internal Rule of the Grand Monastery or &quot;Yeke Kuriyen-u Doto&#x27;adu Durem&quot;. For example, in 1797 a decree of the 4th Jebtsundamba forbade &quot;singing, playing with archery, myagman, chess, usury and smoking&quot;). Executions were forbidden where the holy temples of the Bogd Jebtsundama could be seen, so capital punishment took place away from the city.

In 1839, the 5th Bogd Jebtsundamba moved his residence to Gandan Hill, an elevated position to the west of the Baruun Damnuurchin markets. Part of the city was moved to nearby Tolgoit. In 1855, the part of the camp that moved to Tolgoit was brought back to its 1778 location, and the 7th Bogd Jebtsundamba returned to the Zuun Khuree. The Gandan Monastery flourished as a center of philosophical studies.
===Urga and the Kyakhta trade===
Following the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727, Urga (Ulaanbaatar) was a major point of the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China – mostly Siberian furs for Chinese cloth and later tea. The route ran south to Urga, southeast across the Gobi Desert to Kalgan, and southeast over the mountains to Peking. Urga was also a collection point for goods coming from further west. These were either sent to China or shipped north to Russia via Kyakhta, because of legal restrictions and the lack of good trade routes to the west.

By 1908, there was a Russian quarter with a few hundred merchants and a Russian club and informal Russian mayor. East of the main town was the Russian consulate, built in 1863, with an Orthodox church, a post office and 20 Cossack guards. It was fortified in 1900 and briefly occupied by troops during the Boxer Rebellion. There was a telegraph line north to Kyakhta and southeast to Kalgan and weekly postal service along these routes.

Beyond the Russian consulate was the Chinese trading post called Maimaicheng, and nearby the palace of the Manchu viceroy. With the growth of Western trade at the Chinese ports, the tea trade to Russia declined, some Chinese merchants left, and wool became the main export. Manufactured goods still came from Russia, but most were now brought from Kalgan by caravan. The annual trade was estimated at 25 million rubles, nine-tenths in Chinese hands and one-tenth in Russian.

The Moscow trade expedition of the 1910s estimated the population of Urga at 60,000, based on Nikolay Przhevalsky&#x27;s study in the 1870s.

The city&#x27;s population swelled during the Naadam festival and major religious festivals to more than 100,000. In 1919, the number of monks had reached 20,000, up from 13,000 in 1810.

=== Independence and Niislel Khüree ===
In 1910, the &quot;amban&quot; Sando went to quell a major fight between Gandan lamas and Chinese traders started by an incident at the Da Yi Yu shop in the Baruun Damnuurchin market district. He was unable to bring the lamas under control, and was forced to flee back to his quarters. In 1911, with the Qing dynasty in China headed for total collapse, Mongolian leaders in Ikh Khüree for Naadam met in secret on Mount Bogd Khan Uul and resolved to end 220 years of Manchu control of their country.

On 29 December 1911, the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was declared ruler of an independent Mongolia and assumed the title Bogd Khan. Khüree as the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu was the logical choice for the capital of the new state. However, following the tripartite Kyakhta agreement of 1915, Mongolia&#x27;s status was effectively reduced to mere autonomy.

In 1919, Mongolian nobles, over the opposition of the Bogd Khan, agreed with the Chinese resident Chen Yi on a settlement of the &quot;Mongolian question&quot; along Qing-era lines, but before this settlement could be put into effect, Khüree was occupied by the troops of Chinese warlord Xu Shuzheng, who forced the Mongolian nobles and clergy to renounce autonomy completely.

The city changed hands twice in 1921. First, on 4 February, a mixed Russian/Mongolian force led by White Russian warlord Roman von Ungern-Sternberg captured the city, freeing the Bogd Khan from Chinese imprisonment and killing a part of the Chinese garrison. Baron Ungern&#x27;s capture of Urga was followed by the clearing out of Mongolia&#x27;s small gangs of demoralized Chinese soldiers and, at the same time, looting and murder of foreigners, including a vicious pogrom that killed off the Jewish community.

On 22 February 1921, the Bogd Khan was once again elevated to Great Khan of Mongolia in Urga. However, at the same time that Baron Ungern was taking control of Urga, a Soviet-supported Communist Mongolian force led by Damdin Sükhbaatar was forming in Russia, and in March they crossed the border. Ungern and his men rode out in May to meet Red Russian and Red Mongolian troops, but suffered a disastrous defeat in June.

In July 1921, the Communist Soviet-Mongolian army became the second conquering force in six months to enter Urga, and Mongolia came under the control of Soviet Russia. On 29 October 1924, the town was renamed &quot;Ulaanbaatar&quot;. On the session of the 1st Great People&#x27;s Khuraldaan of Mongolia in 1924, a majority of delegates had expressed their wish to change the capital city&#x27;s name to &quot;Baatar Khot&quot; (). However, under pressure from Turar Ryskulov, a Kazakh Soviet activist of the Communist International, the city was named &quot;Ulaanbaatar Khot&quot; ().

===Socialist era===

During the socialist period, especially following the Second World War, most of the old ger districts were replaced by Soviet-style blocks of flats, often financed by the Soviet Union. Urban planning began in the 1950s, and much of the city core today is a result of construction between 1960 and 1985.

The Trans-Mongolian Railway, connecting Ulaanbaatar with Moscow and Beijing, was completed in 1956, and cinemas, theaters, museums and other modern facilities were erected. Most of the temples and monasteries of pre-socialist Khüree were destroyed following the anti-religious purges of the late 1930s. The Gandan monastery was reopened in 1944 when the U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace asked to see a monastery during his visit to Mongolia.

===Contemporary era===
Ulaanbaatar and chiefly Sükhbaatar Square was a major site of demonstrations that led to Mongolia&#x27;s transition to democracy and market economy in 1990. Starting on 10 December 1989, protesters outside the Youth Culture Center called for Mongolia to implement perestroika and glasnost in their full sense. After months of large-scale demonstrations and hunger strikes, the governing Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party resigned on 9 March 1990. The provisional government announced Mongolia&#x27;s first free elections, which were held in July 1990, paving the way for the new constitution of 1992 and the dissolution of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic.

Since Mongolia&#x27;s transition to a market economy in 1990, the city has experienced rapid growth. From a population of 535,000 in 1990, it had grown to 1 million inhabitants by 2007, and 1.5 million by 2021, or about half the entire country&#x27;s population. Much of this rapid population rise is attributed to migration from rural areas, as herder families abandon their traditional lifestyles in search of opportunities in the city. Much of these new arrivals settle in ger districts without plumbing, sanitation, central heating, and basic services. This rise in population, including the formation of new settlement areas, has not been accompanied with appropriate investment in infrastructure and services, hampering development and causing a myriad of problems.

Ulaanbaatar was the scene of riots in 2008 after supporters of the opposition parties disputed the ruling Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party&#x27;s claim of victory after the parliamentary elections. A four-day state of emergency was declared, the capital was placed under a curfew, and alcohol sales banned with no further riots taking place. This was the first deadly riot in modern Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s history.

In April 2013, Ulaanbaatar hosted the 7th Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies, and has also lent its name to the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security.

Chinggis Khaan International Airport in south of Ulaanbaatar was opened to the public on 4 July 2021 as the main airport of the city.

Since the 2010s Ulaanbaatar has seen a construction boom filling the city with high-rise offices and apartment blocks.

====Demolition of historic buildings====
Since 2013, a number of landmark buildings and structures have been demolished in Ulaanbaatar, despite considerable public outcry. This includes the White Gate at Nisekh in September 2013, the Memorial Museum of Victims of Political Repression in October 2019, the Natural History Museum in December 2019, Buildings #3 and #6 of the National University of Mongolia, and the main building of the University of Finance and Economics in 2023.

The 2019 Mongolian government budget originally included items for the demolition of a number of historic neoclassical buildings in the heart of Ulaanbaatar, including the Natural History Museum, Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, Drama Theatre and National Library. The decision was met by a public outcry and criticism from the Union of Mongolian Architects, which demanded that the buildings be preserved and restored. In January 2020, culture minister Yondonperenlein Baatarbileg denied that the government intended to demolish buildings other than the Natural History Museum, and stated that the government planned to renovate them instead.

==Geography==
Ulaanbaatar is located at about above mean sea level, slightly east of the center of Mongolia, on the Tuul River, a sub-tributary of the Selenge, in a valley at the foot of Bogd Khan Mountain. Bogd Khan Mountain is a broad, heavily forested mountain rising to the south of Ulaanbaatar. It forms the boundary between the steppe zone to the south and the forest-steppe zone to the north. Traditionally, Ulaanbaatar is said to be surrounded by four peaks, clockwise from west: Songino Khairkhan, Chingeltei, Bayanzurkh, and finally Bogd Khan Mountain.

The forests of the mountains surrounding Ulaanbaatar are composed of evergreen pines, deciduous larches and birches, while the riverine forest of the Tuul River is composed of broad-leaved, deciduous poplars, elms and willows. Ulaanbaatar lies at roughly the same latitude as Vienna, Munich, Orléans and Seattle. It lies at roughly the same longitude as Chongqing, Hanoi and Jakarta.

=== Climate ===
Owing to its high elevation, its relatively high latitude, its location hundreds of kilometres from any coast, and the effects of the Siberian anticyclone, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest national capital in the world, with a monsoon-influenced, cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha &quot;BSbc&quot;, USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 3b). Aside from precipitation and from a thermal standpoint, the city is on the boundary between humid continental (&quot;Dwb&quot;) and subarctic (&quot;Dwc&quot;). This is due to its mean temperature for the month of May.

The city features brief, warm summers and long, bitterly cold and dry winters. The coldest January temperatures, usually at the time just before sunrise, are between with no wind, because of temperature inversion. Most of the annual precipitation of falls from May to September. The highest recorded annual precipitation in the city was at the Khureltogoot Astronomical Observatory on Bogd Khan Mountain. Ulaanbaatar has an average annual temperature of , making it the coldest capital in the world (almost as cold as Nuuk, Greenland, but Greenland is not independent). Nuuk has a tundra climate with consistent cold temperatures throughout the year. Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s annual average is brought down by its cold winter temperatures even though it is significantly warm from late April to early October.

The city lies in the zone of discontinuous permafrost, which means that building is difficult in sheltered locations that preclude thawing in the summer, but easier on more exposed ones where soils fully thaw. Suburban residents live in traditional yurts that do not protrude into the soil. Extreme temperatures in the city range from in January 1957 to in July 1988.

=== Cityscape ===

The city&#x27;s inner core consists of a central district built in 1940s- and 1950s-style Soviet architecture, surrounded by and mingled with residential concrete towerblocks and large ger districts. Starting after the fall of communism, many of the towerblocks&#x27; ground floors were modified and upgraded to small shops, and many new buildings have been erected—some illegally, as some private companies erect buildings without legal licenses/permits. Since the 2010s, a construction boom has been ongoing, leading to many high-rise apartment and office blocks in the inner core as well as new settlement areas.
Sükhbaatar Square, in the government district, is the center of Ulaanbaatar and contains in the middle a statue of revolutionary hero Damdin Sükhbaatar on horseback; and in the north side a statue of Chinggis Khan. To the north is the Government Palace, while Peace Avenue (&quot;Enkh Taivny Urgon Chuloo&quot;), the main thoroughfare through town, runs along the south side of the square.

Major landmarks include the Gandantegchinlen Monastery, the socialist monument complex at Zaisan Memorial with its views over the city, the Bogd Khan&#x27;s Winter Palace, and the Choijin Lama Temple. Mongolia&#x27;s tallest building is the Shangri-La Hotel complex at 91.5 m.

Important shopping districts include the 3rd Microdistrict Boulevard (simply called &quot;Khoroolol&quot; or &quot;the District&quot;), Peace Avenue around the State Department Store (simply called &quot;Ikh Delguur&quot; or &quot;Great Store&quot;) and the Narantul Market area (simply called &quot;Zakh&quot; or &quot;the Market&quot;).

Ulaanbaatar presently has multiple cinemas, one modern ski resort, two large indoor stadiums, several large department stores and one large amusement park. Food, entertainment and recreation venues are steadily increasing in variety. International food chains such as KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Round Table Pizza, Cinnabon, and hotel chains such as Ramada, Kempinski, and Shangri-La have opened branches in the city.

=== Parks ===
A number of national parks and protected areas officially belong to the city. Gorkhi-Terelj National Park, a nature preserve with many tourist facilities, is approximately from Ulaanbaatar. The Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue is east of the city center.

Bogd Khan Uul, which dominates the south, is a strictly protected area with a length of and width of , covering an area of . Nature conservation dates back to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries when the Tooril Khan of the Mongolian Ancient Keraite Aimag – who prohibited logging and hunting activities – claimed the Bogd Khan as a holy mountain. The ruins of Manjusri Monastery are located on the southern flank of Bogd Khan Mountain and is a popular destination for outings.

The National Amusement Park is an amusement park located in the downtown section, south of Shangri-La Hotel. It is also a popular place for young people to hang out. This small amusement park features rides, games and paddle boats. Its original Artificial Lake Castle was built in 1969.

The National Garden Park, in the southeastern outskirts of the city, opened in 2009 and has become a popular summer destination for residents. It has a total area of 55 hectares, with over 100,000 trees planted. The park is geared towards becoming an educational center for healthy, responsible living as well as environmental education.

== Demographics ==
As Mongolia&#x27;s primate city, Ulaanbaatar has been the focal point for urbanization and migration from rural areas. With a population of 400 thousand in 1979, it has experienced rapid growth, reaching 1 million inhabitants around 2007. Population growth in the 2010s averaged 2.7% a year, representing a two-fold fall from the previous decade. In 2020, the city&#x27;s population was recorded as 1,466,125.

Two-thirds of the city&#x27;s inhabitants live in ger districts, areas with inadequate infrastructure, sanitation, and public services.

64.6% of the population was reported to have been born in Ulaanbaatar. The foreign-born population was recorded as 17,456 in 2020.

=== Religion ===

Ulaanbaatar has a long tradition of Buddhism, having been initially founded and settled as a monastic center. Prominent places of worship in the city include the Gandantegchinlen Monastery and Choijin Lama Temple. In modern times, it has become a multifaith center, having added multiple Christian churches (such as the Orthodox Holy Trinity Church, as well as the Catholic Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral) and Islamic mosques.

According to the 2020 national census, 46.3% of the population over 15 years of age identified as being irreligious, while 53.7% identified as being religious, a decrease of 7.7 percentage points in religiosity since the 2010 census.

Of the people identifying as religious, responses included Buddhism (89.1%), Shamanism (5.4%), Christianity (3.3%), and Islam (0.9%). Muslims in Ulaanbaatar are mostly the ethnic Kazakhs minority who reside in Nalaikh.

==Governance==

Ulaanbaatar is treated as an independent first-level region, separate from the surrounding Töv Aimag. It is governed by the Ulaanbaatar City Council with 45 members, elected every four years. The Prime Minister of Mongolia appoints the Governor of the Capital City and Mayor of Ulaanbaatar with four-year terms upon the city council&#x27;s nomination.

=== Districts ===

The city is divided into nine districts (): Baganuur, Bagakhangai, Bayangol, Bayanzürkh, Chingeltei, Khan Uul, Nalaikh, Songino Khairkhan and Sükhbaatar. Each district is subdivided into khoroos, of which there are 204. Each district also serves as a constituency that elects one or more representatives into the State Great Khural, the national parliament.

Although administratively part of Ulaanbaatar, Nalaikh and Baganuur are separate cities. Bagakhangai and Baganuur are noncontiguous exclaves, the former located within the Töv Province, the latter on the border between Töv and Khentii provinces.

=== Municipal symbols ===
The official emblem of Ulaanbaatar is the , a mythical bird in both Buddhist and Hindu scriptures, referred to as the &quot;Khangar&#x27;d&quot; (, ) by Mongols.

The &quot;garuḍa&quot; appears on Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s emblem. In its right hand is a key, a symbol of prosperity and openness, and in its left is a lotus flower, a symbol of peace, equality and purity. In its talons it is holding a snake, a symbol of evil of which it is intolerant. On the &#x27;s forehead is the soyombo symbol, which is featured on the flag of Mongolia. The city&#x27;s flag is sky blue representing the eternal sky and has the in the center.

==Economy==
The largest corporations and conglomerates of Mongolia are almost all headquartered in Ulaanbaatar. In 2017 Ulaanbaatar had five billionaires and 90 multimillionaires with net worth above 10 million dollars. Major Mongolian companies include MCS Group, Gatsuurt LLC, Genco, MAK, Altai Trading, Tavan Bogd Group, Mobicom Corporation, Bodi, Shunkhlai, Monnis and Petrovis. While not on the level of multinational corporations, most of these companies are multi-sector conglomerates with far-reaching influence in the country.

Ulaanbaatar (Urga) has been a key location where the economic history and wealth creation of the nation has played out. Unlike the highly mobile dwellings of herders nomadizing between winter and summer pastures, Urga was set up to be a semi-permanent residence of the high lama Zanabazar. It stood in one location (Khoshoo Tsaidam) from 1640 to 1654, an unusually long period of 15 years, before Zanabazar moved it east to the foot of Mount Saridag in the Khentii Mountains. Here he set about building a permanent monastery town with stone buildings. Urga stayed at Mount Saridag for a full 35 years and was indeed assumed to be permanent there when Oirats suddenly invaded the region in 1688 and burnt down the city. With a major part of his life&#x27;s work destroyed, Zanabazar had to take the mobile portion of Urga and flee to Inner Mongolia.

More than half the wealth created in Urga in the period from 1639 to 1688 is thought to have been lost in 1688. Only in 1701 did Urga return to the region and start a second period of expansion, but it had to remain mobile until the end of the 70-year-long Dzungar-Qing Wars in 1757. After settling down in its current location in 1778, Urga saw sustained economic growth, but most of the wealth went to the Buddhist clergy, nobles as well as the temporary Shanxi merchants based in the eastern and western China-towns of Urga. There were numerous companies called &quot;puus&quot; () and temple treasuries called &quot;jas&quot; (), which functioned as businesses, but none of these survived the Communist period. During the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, private property was only marginally tolerated, while most assets were state-owned. The oldest companies still operating in Ulaanbaatar date to the early MPR. Only the Gandantegchinlen Monastery has been operating non-stop for 205 years (with a 6-year gap during World War II), but whether it can be seen as a business is still debated.

As the main industrial center of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar produces a variety of consumer goods and is responsible for about two-thirds of Mongolia&#x27;s total gross domestic product (GDP).

The transition to a market economy in 1990 has so far correlated with an increase in GDP, leading to a shift towards service industries (which now make up 43% of the city&#x27;s GDP) along with rapid urbanization and population growth.

Mining is the second-largest contributor to Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s GDP, at 25%. North of the city are several gold mines, including the Boroo Gold Mine, and foreign investment in the sector has allowed for growth and development. However, in light of a noticeable drop in GDP during the financial crisis of 2008, as demand for mining exports dropped, there has been movement towards diversifying the economy.

== Culture ==

===Arts===
Ulaanbaatar features a mix of traditional and western-style theatres, offering world-class performances. Many of the traditional folklore bands play regularly around the world, including in New York, London and Tokyo. The Ulaanbaatar Opera House, situated in the center of the city, hosts concerts and musical performances as well as opera and ballet performances, some in collaboration with world ballet houses such as the Boston Theatre.

The Mongolian State Grand National Orchestra was established in 1945. It has the largest orchestra of traditional instruments in the country, with a repertoire going beyond national music, encompassing dozens of international musical pieces.

The Tumen Ekh Ensemble comprises artists who perform all types of Mongolian song, music and dance. They play traditional instruments, including the morin khuur (horsehead fiddle), and perform Mongolian long song, epic and eulogy songs, a shaman ritual dance, an ancient palace dance and a Tsam mask dance.

The Morin Khuur Ensemble of Mongolia is part of the Mongolian State Philharmonic, based at Sükhbaatar Square. It is a popular ensemble featuring the national string instrument, the morin khuur, and performs various domestic and international works.

===Monasteries===

Among the notable older monasteries is the Choijin Lama Monastery, a Buddhist monastery that was completed in 1908. It escaped the destruction of Mongolian monasteries when it was turned into a museum in 1942.

Another is the Gandan Monastery, which dates to the 19th century. Its most famous attraction is a 26.5-meter-high golden statue of Migjid Janraisig. These monasteries are among the very few in Mongolia to escape the wholesale destruction of Mongolian monasteries under Khorloogiin Choibalsan.

===Museums===
Ulaanbaatar has several museums dedicated to Mongolian history and culture. The Mongolian Natural History Museum features many dinosaur fossils and meteorites found in Mongolia.

The National Museum of Mongolia includes exhibits from prehistoric times through the Mongol Empire to the present. The Zanabazar Museum of Fine Arts has a large collection of Mongolian art, including works of the 17th-century sculptor/artist Zanabazar, as well as Mongolia&#x27;s most famous painting, &quot;One Day In Mongolia&quot; by Baldugiin &quot;Marzan&quot; Sharav.
The Mongolian Theatre Museum presents the history of the performing arts in Mongolia.

Pre-1778 artifacts that have never left the city since its founding include the Vajradhara statue made by Zanabazar himself in 1683 (the city&#x27;s main deity, kept at the Vajradhara temple); an ornate throne presented to Zanabazar by the Kangxi Emperor (before 1723); a sandalwood hat presented to Zanabazar by the Dalai Lama (c. 1663); Zanabazar&#x27;s large fur coat, also presented by the Kangxi Emperor; and a great number of original statues made by Zanabazar (e.g., the Green Tara).

The Mongolian Military Museum features two permanent exhibition halls, commemorating the war history of the country from prehistoric times to the modern era. In the first hall, one can see various tools and weapons from the Paleolithic age to the times of the Manchu empire. The second hall showcases the modern history of the Mongolian military, from the Bogd Khan period (1911–1924) up until Mongolia&#x27;s recent military involvement in peacekeeping operations.

The Ulaanbaatar City Museum offers a view of Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s history through old maps and photos. Among the permanent items is a huge painting of the capital as it looked in 1912, showing major landmarks such as Gandan Monastery and the Green Palace. Part of the museum is dedicated to special photo exhibits that change frequently. The Mongolian Railway History Museum is an open-air museum that displays six types of locomotives used during a 65-year period of Mongolian rail history.

The International Intellectual Museum displays a comprehensive collection of complex wooden toys that visitors can assemble.

The Memorial Museum of Victims of Political Repression – dedicated to those fallen under the Communist purge that took the lives of over 32,000 statesmen, herders, scholars, politicians and lamas in the 1930s – told about one of the most tragic periods in Mongolia&#x27;s 20th-century history. The small building had fallen into serious disrepair and was demolished on 7 October 2019, despite public outcry in favor of renovation.

==Education==
Ulaanbaatar is home to most of Mongolia&#x27;s major universities, among them the National University of Mongolia, Mongolian University of Science and Technology, Mongolian University of Life Sciences, Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences, Mongolian National University of Education, Mongolian State University of Arts and Culture and the University of Finance and Economics.

The American School of Ulaanbaatar and the International School of Ulaanbaatar are examples of Western-style K-12 education in English for Mongolian nationals and foreign residents.

=== Libraries ===
The National Library of Mongolia is located in Ulaanbaatar and includes an extensive historical collection, items in non-Mongolian languages and a special children&#x27;s collection.

The Metropolitan Central Library of Ulaanbaatar, sometimes also referred to as the Ulaanbaatar Public Library, is a public library with a collection of about 500,000 items. It has 232,097 annual users and a total of 497,298 loans per year. It does charge users a registration fee of 3800 to 4250 tugrik, or about US$3.29 to 3.68. The fees may be the result of operating on a budget under $176,000 per year. They also host websites on classical and modern Mongolian literature and food, in addition to providing free internet access.

In 1986, the Ulaanbaatar government created a centralized system for all public libraries in the city, known as the Metropolitan Library System of Ulaanbaatar (MLSU). This system coordinates management, acquisitions, finances and policy among public libraries in the capital, in addition to providing support to school and children&#x27;s libraries. Other than the Metropolitan Central Library, the MLSU has four branch libraries. They are in the Chingeltei District (established in 1946), in the Khan-Uul District (established in 1948), in the Bayanzurkh District (established in 1968) and in the Songino-Khairkhan District (established in 1991). There is also a Children&#x27;s Central Library, which was established in 1979.

It is a collection of 45 newspaper titles with a particular focus on the years after the fall of communism in Mongolia. The project was supported by the British Library&#x27;s Endangered Archives Programme. The Metropolitan Central Library in Ulaanbaatar maintains a digital monthly news archive.

===Special libraries===
The American Center for Mongolian Studies (ACMS) operates a research library with 1,500 volumes related to Mongolia in numerous languages. It also hosts an online library that includes special reference resources and access to digital databases, including a digital book collection.

There is a Speaking Library at School #116 for the visually impaired, funded by the Zorig Foundation, and the collection is largely based on materials donated by Mongolian National Radio.

The Mongolia-Japan Center for Human Resources Development maintains a library in Ulaanbaatar consisting of about 7,800 items, with a strong focus on both aiding Mongolians studying Japanese and books in Japanese about Mongolia.

==Sport==

The National Sports Stadium is the main sporting venue, notable as the host of the yearly Naadam festival. Other venues include the multi-purpose Buyant Ukhaa Sport Palace, AIC Steppe Arena for indoor skating, and Bökhiin Örgöö for Mongolian wrestling. Sky Resort is a popular destination for skiing and features a golf course.

Ulaanbaatar has hosted the 2019 FIBA 3x3 U18 World Cup and the 2023 East Asian Youth Games.

Ulaanbaatar City FC is a professional football club based in the city and currently competes in Mongolian Premier League.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transport ===
Ulaanbaatar serves as the country&#x27;s primary road, air, and rail hub. Transport within Ulaanbaatar is conducted through private cars, public transport (buses, trolleybuses, and taxis), as well as informal taxis and minivans. As of 2021, the total number of registered vehicles in the city was 662,644.

==== Public transport ====

Buses are the main form of public transport in Ulaanbaatar. As of 2021, 950 buses from 19 companies served 105 routes and 1169 bus stops. Daily ridership is 480-500 thousand. The bus fleet consists of 18 articulated buses, 1129 high capacity buses, 42 trolleybuses, 46 medium capacity buses, and 46 small capacity buses.

In 2021, public transport usage totaled 147 million passengers, with 61% of the population using public transport.

In July 2015, a smart card system was rolled out for bus fare payments (U Money) - previously the bus network had conductors from which tickets would be bought using cash. As of 2021, fares are 100-200₮ for children and 300-500₮ for adults.

8 companies operate 372 official taxis within the city as of 2021, down from 566 official taxis in 2019. Usage of unofficial taxis and ride-sharing apps (UBCab) is common.

==== Road ====
As of 2024, the city had 1253 km of paved roads, and its periphery (ger districts) are disproportionally underserved by paved roads. 720,000 vehicles were registered in the city as of 2023.

The city&#x27;s traffic is concentrated around its main thoroughfares — Peace Avenue (), Ikh Toiruu, Narnii Zam, and Chinggis Avenue (&quot;Chinggisiin örgön chölöö&quot;).

Congestion is a major problem in Ulaanbaatar, with average peak hour driving speeds in the city being 8.9 km/h in 2021. In the same year, city residents spent an average of 2.5 hours a day stuck in traffic. Recent studies predict rush hour speeds plummeting to just 5 km/hr by 2025. Another major problem is flooding, with only 16% of paved roads having a drainage system.

==== Rail ====

The Trans-Mongolian Railway crosses the city center in a roughly east-to-west direction, with the main railway hub being Ulaanbaatar railway station.

==== Air ====
Ulaanbaatar is served by Chinggis Khaan International Airport, located south of the city in Sergelen, Töv, which functions as the country&#x27;s main air hub. It replaced the former Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport in 2021 and features flights to destinations in Europe, Asia, and domestic aimag centers. The airport is accessible from Ulaanbaatar via highway with taxis and shuttles operating along the route.

There are 6 helipads in the city.

==== Future proposals ====
Due to worsening congestion and growth, a number of proposals have been made to improve the city&#x27;s transport infrastructure, such as the short-lived Ulaanbaatar Railbus, and the proposed subway system. On 4 April 2024, the construction of a cable car from Yaarma to the Kharkhorin bus station began.

=== Energy ===
Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s electricity is mainly supplied through its four thermal power plants utilizing coal, the largest being Thermal Power Plant No. 4. Aside from generating electricity, they also supply hot water throughout the city and heat buildings during the winter months from September to April. Ger districts surrounding the city are not connected to the central heating system, therefore having to rely on burning coal and other materials for heat.

In 2019, the government banned the burning of raw coal within Ulaanbaatar, instead distributing coke briquettes, claiming fuel efficiency and less smoke pollution. Results have been inconclusive since the switch to briquettes, though as of 2023 smoke is still a major concern in winter.

=== Water ===
Ulaanbaatar relies entirely on groundwater recharged directly from the Tuul River. Water provisioning is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Authority, a municipal agency.

==Pollution==

Air pollution is a serious problem in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter. Concentrations of certain types of particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) regularly exceed World Health Organization recommended maximum levels by more than a dozen times. They also exceed the concentrations measured in northern Chinese industrial cities. During the winter months, smoke regularly obscures vision, and even led to problems with air traffic at the former airport.

Sources of the pollution are mainly the simple stoves used for heating and cooking in the city&#x27;s ger districts, but also the local coal-fueled power plants. The problem is compounded by Ulaanbaatar&#x27;s location in a valley between relatively high mountains, which shield the city from the winter winds and thus obstruct air circulation.

<text>The grapefruit (Citrus&quot; × &quot;paradisi) is a subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively large, sour to semi-sweet, somewhat bitter fruit. The flesh of the fruit is segmented and varies in color from pale yellow to dark red.

Grapefruits originated in Barbados in the 18th century. They are a citrus hybrid that was created through an accidental cross between the sweet orange (&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;sinensis&quot;) and the pomelo (&quot;C. maxima&quot;), both of which were introduced to the Caribbean from Asia in the 17th century. It has also been called the &#x27;forbidden fruit&#x27;. In the past it was called the &quot;pomelo&quot;, but that term is now mostly used as the common name for &quot;Citrus maxima&quot;.

Grapefruit–drug interactions are common, as the juice contains furanocoumarins that interfere with the metabolism of many drugs. This can prolong and intensify the effects of those drugs, leading to multiple side-effects such as abnormal heart rhythms, bleeding inside the stomach, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.

== Description ==

The evergreen grapefruit trees usually grow to around tall, although they may reach . The leaves are up to long, thin, glossy, and dark green. They produce white flowers with four or five petals. The fruit is yellow-orange skinned and generally an oblate spheroid in shape; it ranges in diameter from . Its flesh is segmented and acidic, varying in color depending on the cultivars, which include white, pink, and red pulps of varying sweetness (generally, the redder varieties are the sweetest).

=== Varieties ===

White grapefruit varieties include Camulos, Cecily, Duncan, Frost Marsh, Genetic Dwarf Marsh, Hall, Jochimsen, Marsh seedy, Nicholson navel, Perlis, Reed Marsh, Tetraploid, Warren Marsh, and Whitney Marsh. 

Red or pink grapefruit varieties include Flame, Foster Pink, Henderson Ruby, Hudson Foster, Marsh Pink, Ray Ruby, Redblush, Rio Red, Shambar, and Star Ruby.

The 1929 &#x27;Ruby Red&#x27; (or &#x27;Redblush&#x27;) patent was associated with real commercial success, which came after the discovery of a red grapefruit growing on a pink variety. The Texas Legislature designated this variety the official &quot;State Fruit of Texas&quot; in 1993.

Using radiation to trigger mutations, new varieties were developed to retain the red tones that typically faded to pink. The &#x27;Rio Red&#x27; variety is a 1984 registered Texas grapefruit with registered trademarks &quot;Rio Star&quot; and &quot;Ruby-Sweet&quot;, also sometimes promoted as &quot;Reddest&quot; and &quot;Texas Choice&quot;. The &#x27;Rio Red&#x27; is a mutation-bred variety that was developed by treatment of bud sticks with thermal neutrons. Its improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.

The &#x27;Star Ruby&#x27; is the darkest of the red varieties. Developed from an irradiated &#x27;Hudson&#x27; grapefruit (&#x27;Hudson&#x27; being a limb sport of &#x27;Foster&#x27;, itself a limb sport of the &#x27;Walters&#x27;), it has found limited commercial success because it is more difficult to grow than other varieties.

== As food ==

=== Nutrition ===

Raw white grapefruit is 90% water, 8% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw grapefruit provides of food energy and is a rich source of vitamin C (37% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).

=== Culinary ===

Like other citrus fruits, grapefruits are sour because of their citric acid content; grapefruit juice contains about half the citric acid content of lemon juice, and nearly 50% more than orange juice. In Costa Rica, especially in Atenas, grapefruit are often cooked with sugar to balance their sourness, rendering them as sweets; or they are stuffed with &quot;dulce de leche&quot; as a dessert. In Haiti, grapefruit is used primarily for its juice (&quot;jus de Chadèque&quot;), but also is used to make jam (&quot;confiture de Chadèque&quot;).

Grapefruit varieties are differentiated by the flesh color of fruit they produce. Common varieties are yellow and pink pulp colors. Flavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour to sweet and tart, resulting from composition of sugars (mainly sucrose), organic acids (mainly citric acid), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes providing aromas. Grapefruit mercaptan, a sulfur-containing terpene, is one of the aroma compounds influencing the taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.

== Drug interactions ==

Grapefruit and grapefruit juice interact with many drugs, resulting in numerous adverse effects including bone marrow suppression, nephrotoxicity, abnormal heart rhythm, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, dizziness, and respiratory depression, according to the drug involved.

One interaction occurs from grapefruit furanocoumarins, such as bergamottin and 6&#x27;,7&#x27;-dihydroxybergamottin, which occur in both flesh and peel. Furanocoumarins inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme (among others from the cytochrome P450 enzyme family responsible for metabolizing 90% of drugs). The action of the CYP3A4 enzyme itself is to metabolize many medications. If a drug&#x27;s breakdown for removal is lessened, then the level of that drug in the blood may become and remain high, leading to adverse effects. On the other hand, some drugs must be metabolized to become active, and inhibiting CYP3A4 may lead to reduced drug effects.

Another effect is that grapefruit compounds may inhibit the absorption of drugs in the intestine. If a drug is not absorbed, then not enough of it is in the blood to have a therapeutic effect. Each affected drug has either a specific increase of effect or decrease.

One whole grapefruit or a glass of of grapefruit juice is enough to cause drug overdose toxicity. Typically, drugs that are incompatible with grapefruit are marked as such on the container or package insert.
== Production ==

In 2022, world production of grapefruits (combined with pomelos) was 9.8 million tonnes, led by China with 53% of the world total with Vietnam as a secondary producer (table).

=== Pests and diseases ===

Grapefruits are hosts for fruit flies (family Tephritidae) such as &quot;A. suspensa&quot;, which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled grapefruits, sometimes causing serious damage in plantations in the Americas. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Citrus swallowtail, &quot;Papilio demodocus&quot;, is a minor pest of &quot;Citrus&quot; plantations. Grapefruits are subject to several diseases of &quot;Citrus&quot; trees, including citrus tristeza virus, citrus canker (caused by a bacterium, &quot;Xanthomonas&quot;), and the vector-transmitted citrus greening disease, where the vector is a psyllid bug, and the pathogen is a bacterium, &quot;Liberibacter&quot;.

== History ==

Grapefruit originated as a natural hybrid. One ancestor of the grapefruit was the Jamaican sweet orange (&quot;Citrus sinensis&quot;), itself an ancient hybrid of Asian origin; the other was the Indonesian pomelo (&quot;C. maxima&quot;). The pomelo was the female ancestor; the sweet orange, itself a hybrid, was the male. Both &quot;C. sinensis&quot; and &quot;C. maxima&quot; were present in the West Indies by 1692. One story of the fruit&#x27;s origin is that a 17th-century trader named &#x27;Captain Shaddock&#x27; brought pomelo seeds to Jamaica and bred the first fruit, which were then called &quot;shaddocks&quot;. The grapefruit then probably originated as a naturally occurring hybrid between the two plants some time after they had been introduced there.

A hybrid fruit, called &quot;forbidden fruit&quot;, was first documented in 1750 (along with 14 other citrus fruits including the guiney orange) by a Welshman, the Rev. Griffith Hughes, in his &quot;The Natural History of Barbados&quot;. However, Hughes&#x27;s forbidden fruit may have been a plant distinct from grapefruit although still closely related to it.

In 1814, the British naturalist and plantation owner John Lunan published the term &quot;grapefruit&quot; to describe a similar Jamaican citrus plant. Lunan reported that the name was due to its similarity in taste to the grape (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;). An alternative explanation is that this name may allude to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to bunches of grapes.

In 1830, the Jamaican version of the plant was given the botanical name &quot;Citrus paradisi&quot; by the Scottish physician and botanist James Macfadyen. Macfadyen identified two varieties – one called &quot;forbidden fruit&quot;, the other &quot;Barbadoes Grape Fruit&quot;. Macfadyen distinguished between the two plants by fruit shape with the Barbados grapefruit being piriform (pear shaped) while the forbidden fruit was &quot;maliformis&quot;. Macfadyen&#x27;s and Hughes&#x27;s descriptions differ, so it is not clear that the two reports are describing the same plant. It has been suggested that Hughes&#x27;s golden orange may actually have been a grapefruit, while his forbidden fruit was a different variety that may since have been lost. A citrus called &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; or &quot;shaddette&quot; has been discovered in Saint Lucia; it may be the plant described by Hughes and Macfadyen.

The name &quot;grape-fruit&quot; was used during the 19th century to refer to pomelos. It was brought to Florida by the French businessman Count Odet Philippe in 1823, in what is now known as Safety Harbor. Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984). Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s, at which point its official name was altered to &quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;paradisi&quot;, the × identifying it as a hybrid. An early pioneer in the American citrus industry was Kimball C. Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur who founded the Atwood Grapefruit Company in the late 19th century. The Atwood Grove became the largest grapefruit grove in the world, with a yearly output of 80,000 boxes of fruit. There, pink grapefruit was discovered in 1906.
