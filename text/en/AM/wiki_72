<text>The Natural Colour System (NCS) is a proprietary perceptual color model. It is based on the color opponency hypothesis of color vision, first proposed by German physiologist Ewald Hering. The current version of the NCS was developed by the Swedish Colour Centre Foundation, from 1964 onwards. The research team consisted of Anders Hård, Lars Sivik and Gunnar Tonnquist, who in 1997 received the AIC Judd award for their work. The system is based entirely on the phenomenology of human perception and not on color mixing. It is illustrated by a color atlas, marketed by NCS Colour AB in Stockholm.

== Definition ==
The NCS states that there are six elementary color percepts of human vision—which might coincide with the psychological primaries—as proposed by the hypothesis of color opponency: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. The last four are also called unique hues. In the NCS all six are defined as elementary colors, irreducible qualia, each of which would be impossible to define in terms of the other elementary colors. All other experienced colors are considered composite perceptions, i.e. experiences that can be defined in terms of similarity to the six elementary colors. E.g. a saturated pink would be fully defined by its visual similarity to red, blue, black and white.

Colors in the NCS are defined by three values, expressed in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (&quot;s&quot;, = relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), chromaticness (&quot;c&quot;, = relative visual similarity to the &quot;strongest&quot;, most saturated, color in that hue triangle), and hue (&quot;Φ&quot;, = relative similarity to one or two of the chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). This means that a color can be expressed as either Y (yellow), YR (yellow with a red component), R (red), RB (red with a blue component), B (blue), etc. No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no &quot;redgreen&quot; or &quot;yellowblue&quot;. The blackness and the chromaticness together add up to less than or equal to 100%. The remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness (&quot;w&quot;). Achromatic colors, i.e. colors that lack chromatic contents (ranging from black, to grey and finally white), have their hue component replaced with a capital &quot;N&quot;, for example &quot;NCS S 9000-N&quot; (a more or less complete black). NCS color notations are sometimes prepended by a capital &quot;S&quot;, which denotes that the current version of the NCS color standard was used to specify the color.

In summary, the NCS color notation for S 2030-Y90R (light, pinkish red) is described as follows.

: formula_1

with

: formula_2

=== Saturation and lightness ===
In addition to the above values &quot;s&quot; (blackness), &quot;w&quot; (whiteness), &quot;c&quot; (chromaticness) and &quot;Φ&quot; (hue), the NCS system can also describe the two perceptual quantities saturation and lightness. NCS saturation (&quot;m&quot;) refers to a color&#x27;s relation between its chromaticness and whiteness (regardless of hue), defined as the ratio between the chromaticness and the sum of its whiteness and chromaticness formula_3. The NCS saturation ranges between 0 and 1.

For the example color of S 2030-Y90R, the saturation is calculated as 
: formula_4

NCS lightness (&quot;v&quot;) is a color&#x27;s perceptual characteristic to contain more of the achromatic elementary colors black or white than another color. NCS lightness values varies from 0 for the elementary color black (S) to 1 for the elementary color white (W). For achromatic colors, that is any black, gray or white with no chromatic component (&quot;c&quot; = 0), lightness is defined as 
: formula_5

For chromatic colors, the NCS lightness is determined by comparing the chromatic color to a reference scale of achromatic colors (&quot;c&quot; = 0), and is determined to have the same lightness value &quot;v&quot; as the sample on the reference scale to which it has the least noticeable edge-to-edge difference.

=== Examples ===
Two examples of NCS color notation—the yellow and blue shades of the Swedish flag:
* Yellow – NCS 0580-Y10R (nuance = 5% blackness, 80% chromaticness, hue = 90% yellow + 10% red. Strong, very slightly blackish yellow with a slight orangish tinge)
* Blue – NCS 4055-R95B (nuance = 40% blackness, 55% chromaticness, hue = 5% red + 95% blue. Somewhat dark, medium strong blue with a very slight purplish tinge)
The NCS is represented in nineteen countries and is the reference norm for color designation in Sweden (since 1979), Norway (since 1984), Spain (since 1994) and South Africa (since 2004). It is also one of the standards used by the International Colour Authority, a leading publisher of color trend forecasts for the interior design and textile markets.

== NCS 1950 Standard Colors ==

In order to be able to manufacture physical representations of the NCS color space (such as color atlases), a reduced set of colors had to be selected that would illustrate the system well. Originally developed in 1979 as part of becoming the Swedish national color standard by the SIS (Swedish Standards Institute), the Natural Color System was described in an atlas containing 1412 colors. In 1984, an additional 118 colors were added for a total of 1530 colors. Eleven years later, in 1995, a second edition of the NCS Color Samples was released containing 1750 standard colors. In 2004, 200 more colors (184 light colors and 16 in the blue-green space) were added, resulting in the NCS 1950 standard colors. Colors that have a representation in the NCS 1950 samples are denoted with a leading capital &quot;S&quot;, for example NCS S 1070-Y10R (a chromatic, slightly reddish yellow).

== Comparisons to other color systems ==
The most important difference between NCS and most other color systems resides in their starting points. The aim of NCS is to define colors from their visual appearance, as they are experienced by human consciousness. Other color models, such as CMYK and RGB, are based on an understanding of physical processes, how colors can be achieved or &quot;made&quot; in different media.

According to the opponent process hypothesis, the underlying physiological mechanisms involved in color opponency include the bipolar and ganglion cells in the retina, which process the signal originated by the retinal cones before it is sent to the brain. Models like RGB are based on what happens at the lower, retinal cone level, and thus are fitted for presenting self-illuminated, dynamic images as done by TV sets and computer displays; see additive color. The NCS model, for its part, describes the organization of the color sensations as perceived at the upper, brain level, and thus is much better fitted than RGB to deal with how humans experience and describe their color sensations (hence the &quot;natural&quot; part of its name). More problematic is the relation with the CMYK-model which is generally seen as a correct prediction of the behavior of mixing pigments, as a system of subtractive color. The NCS coincides with the CMYK as regards the green-yellow-red segment of the color circle, but differs from it in seeing the saturated subtractive primary colors magenta and cyan as complex sensations of a &quot;redblue&quot; and a &quot;greenblue&quot; respectively and in seeing green, not as a secondary color mix of yellow and cyan, but as a unique hue. The NCS explains this by assuming that the behavior of paint is partly counterintuitive to human phenomenology. Observing that the mix of yellow and &quot;greenblue&quot; (cyan) paint results in a green color, would thus be at odds with the intuition of human perception, because green would be perceived as an elementary hue while yellow and the presumed blue component of &quot;greenblue&quot; are by the NCS considered to be mutually excluding percepts.

Hering argued that yellow is not a &quot;redgreen&quot; but a unique hue. Colorimetrist Jan Koenderink, in a critique of Hering&#x27;s system, considered it inconsistent not to apply the same argument to the other two subtractive primaries (or additive secondaries), cyan and magenta, and see them as unique hues as well, not a &quot;greenblue&quot; or a &quot;redblue&quot;. He also pointed out the difficulty within a four color theory that the primaries would not be equally spaced in the color circle; and the problem that Hering does not account for the fact that cyan and magenta are lighter than green, blue and red, whereas this is, in his view, elegantly explained within the CMYK-model. He concluded that Hering&#x27;s scheme fitted common language better than color experience.

<doc id="71920" wikidata="Q155483" url="?curid=71920" title="House of Orange-Nassau">
<text>The House of Orange-Nassau (, ) is the current reigning house of the Netherlands. A branch of the European House of Nassau, the house has played a central role in the politics and government of the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, particularly since William the Silent organised the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, which after the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) led to an independent Dutch state. William III of Orange led the resistance of the Netherlands and Europe to Louis XIV of France and orchestrated the Glorious Revolution in England that established parliamentary rule. Similarly, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was instrumental in the Dutch resistance during World War II.

Several members of the house served during the Eighty Years war and after as stadtholder (&quot;governor&quot;; Dutch: &quot;stadhouder&quot;) during the Dutch Republic. However, in 1815, after a long period as a republic, the Netherlands became a monarchy under the House of Orange-Nassau.

The dynasty was established as a result of the marriage of Henry III of Nassau-Breda from Germany and Claudia of Chalon-Orange from French Burgundy in 1515. Their son René of Chalon inherited in 1530 the independent and sovereign Principality of Orange from his mother&#x27;s brother, Philibert of Chalon. As the first Nassau to be the Prince of Orange, René could have used &quot;Orange-Nassau&quot; as his new family name. However, his uncle, in his will, had stipulated that René should continue the use of the name Chalon-Orange. After René&#x27;s death in 1544, his cousin William of Nassau-Dillenburg inherited all of his lands. This &quot;William I of Orange&quot;, in English better known as William the Silent, became the founder of the House of Orange-Nassau.

== Origins ==

Nassau Castle was founded around 1100 by Dudo, Count of Laurenburg, the founder of the House of Nassau. In 1120, Dudo&#x27;s sons and successors, Counts Rupert I and Arnold I, established themselves at Nassau Castle, taking for themselves the title &quot;Count of Nassau&quot;. In 1255 the Nassau possessions were split between Walram and Otto, the sons of Count Henry II. The descendants of Walram were known as the Walram Line, and they became Dukes of Nassau and, in 1890, Grand Dukes of Luxembourg. This line also included Adolph of Nassau, who was elected King of the Romans in 1292. The descendants of Otto became known as the Ottonian Line, and they inherited parts of the County of Nassau, as well as properties in France and the Netherlands.

The House of Orange-Nassau stems from the younger Ottonian Line. The first of this line to establish himself in the Netherlands was John I, Count of Nassau-Siegen, who married Margaret of the Mark. The real founder of the Nassau fortunes in the Netherlands was John&#x27;s son, Engelbert I. He became counsellor to the Burgundian Dukes of Brabant, first to Anton of Burgundy, and later to his son Jan IV of Brabant. He also would later serve Philip the Good. In 1403, he married the Dutch noblewoman Johanna van Polanen and so inherited lands in the Netherlands, with the Barony of Breda as the core of the Dutch possessions and the family fortune.

A nobleman&#x27;s power was often based on his ownership of vast tracts of land and lucrative offices. It also helped that much of the lands that the House of Orange-Nassau controlled sat under one of the commercial and mercantile centres of the world (see below under Lands and Titles). The importance of the family grew throughout the 15th and 16th centuries as they became councilors, generals and stadholders of the Habsburgs (see armorial of the great nobles of the Burgundian Netherlands and list of knights of the Golden Fleece). Engelbert II of Nassau served Charles the Bold and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, who had married Charles&#x27;s daughter Mary of Burgundy. In 1496, he was appointed stadtholder of Flanders and by 1498 he had been named President of the Grand Conseil. In 1501, Maximilian named him Lieutenant-General of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. From that point forward (until his death in 1504), Engelbert was the principal representative of the Habsburg Empire to the region. Hendrik III of Nassau-Breda was appointed stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland by Charles of Ghent in the beginning of the 16th century. Hendrik was succeeded by his son René of Chalon in 1538, who had inherited the title of Prince of Orange and the principality of that name from his maternal uncle Philibert of Chalon. In 1544, René died in battle aged 25. His possessions, including the principality and title, passed by his will as sovereign prince to his paternal cousin, William I of Orange. From then on, the family members called themselves &quot;Orange-Nassau.&quot;

== Eighty Years&#x27; War ==
Although Charles V pretended to resist the Protestant Reformation, he ruled the Dutch territories wisely with moderation and regard for local customs, and he did not persecute his Protestant subjects on a large scale. His son Philip II inherited his antipathy for the Protestants but not his moderation. Under the reign of Philip, a true persecution of Protestants was initiated and taxes were raised to an outrageous level. Discontent arose and William of Orange (with his vague Lutheran childhood) stood up for the Protestant (mainly Calvinist) inhabitants of the Netherlands. Things went badly after the Eighty Years&#x27; War started in 1568, but luck turned to his advantage when Protestant rebels attacking from the North Sea captured Brielle, a coastal town in present-day South Holland in 1572. Many cities in Holland began to support William. During the 1570s he had to defend his core territories in Holland several times, but in the 1580s the inland cities in Holland were secure. William of Orange was considered a threat to Spanish rule in the area and was assassinated in 1584 by a hired killer sent by Philip.

William was succeeded by his second son Maurits, a Protestant who proved an excellent military commander. His abilities as a commander and the lack of strong leadership in Spain after the death of Philip II (1598) gave Maurits excellent opportunities to conquer large parts of the present-day Dutch territory. In 1585 Maurits was elected stadtholder of the provinces of Holland and Zealand as his father&#x27;s successor and as a counterpose to Elizabeth&#x27;s delegate, the Earl of Leicester. In 1587 he was appointed captain-general (military commander-in-chief) of the armies of the Dutch Republic. In the early years of the 17th century there arose quarrels between stadtholder and oligarchist regents—a group of powerful merchants led by Johan van Oldebarnevelt—because Maurits wanted more powers in the Republic. Maurits won this power struggle by arranging the judicial murder of Oldebarnevelt.

== 17th century ==
=== Expansion of dynastic power ===
Maurice died unmarried in 1625 and left no legitimate children. He was succeeded by his half-brother Frederick Henry (Dutch: &quot;Frederik Hendrik&quot;), youngest son of William I. Maurits urged his successor on his deathbed to marry as soon as possible. A few weeks after Maurits&#x27;s death, he married Amalia van Solms-Braunfels.
Frederick Henry and Amalia were the parents of a son and several daughters. These daughters were married to important noble houses such as the house of Hohenzollern, but also to the Frisian Nassaus, who were stadtholders in Friesland. His only son, William, married Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the eldest daughter of Charles I of England. These dynastic moves were the work of Amalia.

=== Exile and resurgence ===
Frederick Henry died in 1647 and his son succeeded him. As the Treaty of Munster was about to be signed, thereby ending the Eighty Years&#x27; War, William tried to maintain the powers he had in wartime as military commander. These would necessarily be diminished in peacetime as the army would be reduced, along with his income. This met with great opposition from the regents. When Andries Bicker and Cornelis de Graeff, the great regents of the city of Amsterdam refused some mayors he appointed, he besieged Amsterdam. The siege provoked the wrath of the regents. William died of smallpox on November 6, 1650, leaving only a posthumous son, William III (*November 14, 1650). Since the Prince of Orange upon the death of William II, William III, was an infant, the regents used this opportunity to leave the stadtholdership vacant. This inaugurated the era in Dutch history that is known as the First Stadtholderless Period. A quarrel about the education of the young prince arose between his mother and his grandmother Amalia (who outlived her husband by 28 years). Amalia wanted an education which was pointed at the resurgence of the House of Orange to power, but Mary wanted a pure English education. The Estates of Holland, under Jan de Witt and Cornelis de Graeff, meddled in the education and made William a &quot;child of state&quot; to be educated by the state. The doctrine used in this education was keeping William from the throne. William became indeed very docile to the wishes of the regents and the Estates.

The Dutch Republic was attacked by France and England in 1672. The military function of stadtholder was no longer superfluous, and with the support of the Orangists, William was restored, and he became the stadtholder. William successfully repelled the invasion and seized royal power. He became more powerful than his predecessors from the Eighty Years&#x27; War. In 1677, William married his cousin Mary Stuart, the daughter of the future king James II of England. In 1688, William embarked on a mission to depose his Catholic father-in-law from the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. He and his wife were crowned the King and Queen of England on April 11, 1689. With the accession to the thrones of the three kingdoms, he became one of the most powerful sovereigns in Europe, and the only one to defeat Louis XIV of France. William III died childless after a riding accident on March 8, 1702, leaving the main male line of the House of Orange extinct, and leaving Scotland, England and Ireland to his sister-in-law Queen Anne.

=== Position in the Dutch Republic in the 17th century ===
The house of Orange-Nassau was relatively unlucky in establishing a hereditary dynasty in an age that favoured hereditary rule. The Stuarts and the Bourbons came to power at the same time as the Oranges, the Vasas and Oldenburgs were able to establish a hereditary kingship in Sweden and Denmark, and the Hohenzollerns were able to set themselves on a course to the rule of Germany. The House of Orange was no less gifted than those houses, in fact, some might argue more so, as their ranks included some the foremost statesmen and captains of the time. A 104 years separated the death of William the Silent from the accession of his great-grandson, William III, as King of England. Although the institutions of the United Provinces became more republican and entrenched as time went on, William the Silent had been offered the countship of Holland and Zealand, and only his assassination prevented his accession to those offices. This fact did not go unforgotten by his successors.

The Prince of Orange was also not just another noble among equals in the Netherlands. First, he was the traditional leader of the nation in war and in rebellion against Spain. He was uniquely able to transcend the local issues of the cities, towns and provinces. He was also a sovereign ruler in his own right (see Prince of Orange article). This gave him a great deal of prestige, even in a republic. He was the center of a real court like the Stuarts and Bourbons, French speaking, and extravagant to a scale. It was natural for foreign ambassadors and dignitaries to present themselves to him and consult with him as well as to the States General to which they were officially credited. The marriage policy of the princes, allying themselves twice with the Royal Stuarts, also gave them acceptance into the royal caste of rulers.

Besides showing the relationships among the family, the family tree below also points out an extraordinary run of bad luck. In the 211 years from the death of William the Silent to the conquest by France, there was only one time that a son directly succeeded his father as Prince of Orange, Stadholder and Captain-General without a minority (William II). When the Oranges were in power, they also tended to settle for the actualities of power, rather than the appearances, which increasingly tended to upset the ruling regents of the towns and cities. On being offered the dukedom of Gelderland by the States of that province, William III let the offer lapse as liable to raise too much opposition in the other provinces.
The house of Orange was also related by marriage to several of these key European dynasties of the time, Stuart, Bourbon, and Palatine, Hannover and Hohenzollern. These alliances had consequences for all of them. William III used his double relationship with the Stuarts to justify his co-equal status with his wife on the English throne after the Glorious Revolution. As an arrière petit fils de France, albeit in the female line, he felt doubly insulted by his cousin Louis XIV&#x27;s occupation and seizure of his sovereign principality of Orange. His death without children of his own ensured the passing of Orange to a Dutch cousin and years of squabbles over the same, while securing the British throne to the more distantly related House of Hanover.

== 18th century ==
=== Second Stadtholderless period ===

The regents found that they had suffered under the powerful leadership of William III as the ruler of the Netherlands and king in the British Isles and they left the stadtholdership vacant for the second time. As William III died childless in 1702 the principality became a matter of dispute between Prince John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz of the Frisian Nassaus and King Frederick I of Prussia, who both claimed the title Prince of Orange. Both descended from Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. The King of Prussia was his grandson through his mother, Countess Luise Henriette of Nassau. Frederick Henry in his will had appointed this line as successor in case the main House of Orange-Nassau were to die out. John William Friso was a great-grandson of Frederick Henry (through Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau, another daughter) and was appointed heir in William III&#x27;s will. The principality was captured by the forces of King Louis XIV of France under François Adhémar de Monteil, Count of Grignan, in the Franco-Dutch War in 1672, and again in August 1682. With the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the wars of Louis XIV, the territory was formally ceded to France by Frederick I in 1713. John William Friso drowned in 1711 in the Hollands Diep near Moerdijk, and he left his posthumously born son William IV, Prince of Orange. That son succeeded at that time his father as stadtholder in Friesland (as the stadtholdership had been hereditary in that province since 1664), and Groningen. William IV was proclaimed the stadtholder of Guelders, Overijssel, and Utrecht in 1722. When the French invaded Holland in 1747, William IV was appointed stadtholder in Holland and Zeeland as well in the Orangist revolution. The position of stadtholder was made hereditary in both the male and the female lines in all provinces at the same time.

=== Hereditary territories in Germany ===

After the Nassau-Dietz branch took over, the House of Orange-Nassau had acquired the following territories by the end of the 18th century in the Holy Roman Empire, located in present-day Germany:
* County of Nassau-Dillenburg, elevated to principality in 1654
* County of Nassau-Siegen, elevated to principality
* County of Nassau-Dietz, elevated to principality
* County of Nassau-Hadamar, elevated to principality
* Fief Beilstein
* Fief Spiegelberg
* Amt Nassau (shared with Nassau-Usingen)
* Amt Kirrberg (shared with Nassau-Usingen)
* Grund Seel and Burbach (shared with Nassau-Weilburg)
* Amt Camberg (shared with the Electorate of Trier)
* Amt Wehrheim (shared with the Electorate of Trier)
* Ems custody (shared with Hesse-Darmstadt)

Around 1742, William IV of Orange established the Hochdeutsche Hofdepartement, an administrative centre located in The Hague inside the Dutch Republic, which looked after the family&#x27;s possessions in Germany.

=== End of the stadtholdership ===
William IV died in 1751, leaving his three-year-old son, William V, as the stadtholder. Since William V was still a minor, the regents reigned for him. He grew up to be an indecisive person, a character defect which would come to haunt William V his whole life.
His marriage to Wilhelmina of Prussia relieved this defect to some degree. In 1787, Willem V survived an attempt to depose him by the Patriots (anti-Orangist revolutionaries) after the Kingdom of Prussia intervened. When the French invaded Holland in 1795, William V was forced into exile, and he was never to return alive to Holland.

After 1795, the House of Orange-Nassau faced a difficult period, surviving in exile at other European courts, especially those of Prussia and Britain. Following the recognition of the Batavian Republic by the 1801 Oranienstein Letters, William V&#x27;s son William VI renounced the stadtholdership in 1802. In return, he received a few territories like the Free Imperial City of Dortmund, Corvey Abbey and Diocese of Fulda from First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte of the French Republic (Treaty of Amiens), which was established as the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. William V died in 1806.

== Monarchy since 1813 ==

===United Kingdom of the Netherlands===
After a repressed Dutch rebel action, Prussian and Cossack troops drove out the French in 1813, with the support of the Patriots of 1785. A provisional government was formed, most of whose members had helped drive out William V 18 years earlier. However, they were realistic enough to accept that any new government would have to be headed by William V&#x27;s son, William Frederick (William VI). All agreed that it would be better in the long term for the Dutch to restore William themselves rather than have him imposed by the allies.
At the invitation of the provisional government, William Frederick returned to the Netherlands on November 30. This move was strongly supported by the United Kingdom, which sought ways to strengthen the Netherlands and deny future French aggressors easy access to the Low Countries&#x27; Channel ports. The provisional government offered William the crown. He refused, believing that a stadholdership would give him more power. Thus, on December 6, William proclaimed himself hereditary sovereign prince of the Netherlands—something between a kingship and a stadholdership. In 1814, he was awarded sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège as well. On March 15, 1815, with the support of the powers gathered at the Congress of Vienna, William proclaimed himself King William I. He was also made grand duke of Luxembourg, and (to assuage French sensitivity by distancing the title from the now-defunct principality) the title &#x27;Prince of Orange&#x27; was changed to &#x27;Prince of Oranje&#x27;.
The two countries remained separate, though they shared a common monarch via a personal union. William had thus fulfilled the House of Orange&#x27;s three-century quest to unite the Low Countries.

The institution of the monarch in the Netherlands is considered an office under the Constitution of the Netherlands. There are none of the religious connotations to the office as in some other monarchies. A Dutch sovereign is inaugurated rather than crowned in a coronation ceremony. It was initially more of a crowned/hereditary presidency, and a continuation of the status quo ante of the pre-1795 hereditary stadholderate in the Republic. In practice, the current monarch has considerably less power than the stadtholder.

As king of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, William tried to establish one common culture. This provoked resistance in the southern parts of the country, which had been culturally separate from the north since 1581. He was considered an enlightened despot.

The Prince of Orange held rights to Nassau lands (Dillenburg, Dietz, Beilstein, Hadamar, Siegen) in central Germany. On the other hand, the King of Prussia, Frederick William III—brother-in-law and first cousin of William I, had beginning from 1813 managed to establish his rule in Luxembourg, which he regarded as his inheritance from Anne, Duchess of Luxembourg who had died over three centuries earlier. At the Congress of Vienna, the two brothers-in-law agreed to a trade—Frederick William received William I&#x27;s ancestral lands while William I received Luxembourg. Both got what was geographically nearer to their centre of power.

In 1830, most of the southern portion of William&#x27;s realm—the former Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric—declared independence as Belgium. William fought a disastrous war until 1839 when he was forced to settle for peace. With his realm halved, he decided to abdicate in 1840 in favour of his son, William II. Although William II shared his father&#x27;s conservative inclinations, in 1848 he accepted an amended constitution that significantly curbed his own authority and transferred the real power to the States General. He took this step to prevent the Revolutions of 1848 from spreading to his country.

===William III and the risk of extinction===

William II died in 1849. He was succeeded by his son, William III. A rather conservative, even reactionary man, William III was sharply opposed to the new 1848 constitution. He continually tried to form governments that were dependent on his support, even though it was prohibitively difficult for a government to stay in office against the will of Parliament. In 1868, he tried to sell Luxembourg to France, which was the source of a quarrel between Prussia and France.

William III had a rather unhappy marriage with Sophie of Württemberg, and his heirs died young. This raised the possibility of the extinction of the House of Orange-Nassau. After the death of Queen Sophie in 1877, William remarried to 20-year-old Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1879; he was 41 years older than her. On 31 August 1880, Queen Emma gave birth to their daughter and the royal heiress, Wilhelmina. There were considerably more concerns over the royal dynasty&#x27;s future, when Wilhelmina&#x27;s marriage with Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (since 1901) repeatedly resulted in miscarriages. Had the House of Orange died out, the throne would likely have passed to Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, leading the Netherlands into an undesirably strong influence from the German Empire that would threaten Dutch independence. Not just Socialists, but now also Anti-Revolutionary politicians including Prime Minister Abraham Kuyper and Liberals such as Samuel van Houten advocated the restoration of the Republic in Parliament in case the marriage remained childless. The birth of Princess Juliana in 1909 put the question to rest.

=== Monarchy in modern times ===

Wilhelmina was queen of the Netherlands for 58 years, from 1890 to 1948. Because she was only 10 years old in 1890, her mother, Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, was the regent until Wilhelmina&#x27;s 18th birthday in 1898. Since females were not allowed to hold power in Luxembourg, due to Salic law, Luxembourg passed to the House of Nassau-Weilburg, a collateral line to the House of Orange-Nassau. For a time, it appeared that the Dutch royal family would die with Wilhelmina. Her half-brother, Prince Alexander, had died in 1884, and no royal babies were born from then until Wilhelmina gave birth to her only child, Juliana, in 1909. The Dutch royal house remained quite small until the later 1930s and the early 1940s, during which time Juliana gave birth to four daughters. Although the House of Orange died out in its male line with the death of Queen Wilhelmina, it continued in the female line as can be seen in other modern European monarchies, the name &quot;Orange&quot; continues to be used by the Dutch royalty and as evidenced in many patriotic songs, such as &quot;Oranje boven&quot;.

The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, during her reign, and the country was not invaded by Germany, as neighbouring Belgium was.

Nevertheless, Queen Wilhelmina became a symbol of the Dutch resistance during World War II. The moral authority of the Monarchy was restored because of her rule. After 58 years on the throne as the Queen, Wilhelmina decided to abdicate in favour of her daughter, Juliana. Juliana had the reputation of making the monarchy less &quot;aloof&quot;, and under her reign the Monarchy became known as the &quot;cycling monarchy&quot;. Members of the royal family were often seen riding bicycles through the cities and the countryside under Juliana.

A royal marriage controversy occurred in 1966 when Juliana&#x27;s eldest daughter, the future Queen Beatrix, decided to marry Claus von Amsberg, a German diplomat. The marriage of a member of the royal family to a German was quite controversial in the Netherlands, which had suffered under Nazi German occupation in 1940–45. This reluctance to accept a German consort probably was exacerbated by von Amsberg&#x27;s former membership in the Hitler Youth under the Nazi regime in his native country, and also his following service in the German Wehrmacht. Beatrix needed permission from the government to marry anyone if she wanted to remain heiress to the throne, but after some argument, it was granted. As the years went by, Prince Claus was fully accepted by the Dutch people. In time, he became one of the most popular members of the Dutch monarchy, and his death in 2002 was widely mourned.

On April 30, 1980, Queen Juliana abdicated in favour of her daughter, Beatrix. In the early years of the twenty-first century, the Dutch monarchy remained popular with a large part of the population. Beatrix&#x27;s eldest son, Willem-Alexander, was born on April 27, 1967; the first immediate male heir to the Dutch throne since the death of his great-granduncle, Prince Alexander, in 1884. Willem-Alexander married Máxima Zorreguieta, an Argentine banker, in 2002; the first commoner ever to marry an heir apparent to the Dutch throne. They are parents of three daughters: Catharina-Amalia, Alexia, and Ariane. After a long struggle with neurological illness, Queen Juliana died on March 20, 2004, and her husband, Prince Bernhard, died on December 1 of that same year.

Upon Beatrix&#x27;s abdication on April 30, 2013, the Prince of Orange was inaugurated as King Willem-Alexander, becoming the Netherlands&#x27; first male ruler since 1890. His eldest daughter, Catharina-Amalia, as heiress apparent to the throne, became Princess of Orange in her own right.

===Net worth===

Unlike other royal houses, there has always been a separation in the Netherlands between what was owned by the state and used by the House of Orange in their offices as monarch, or previously, stadtholder, and the personal investments and fortune of the House of Orange.

As monarch, the King or Queen has use of, but not ownership of, the Huis ten Bosch as a residence and Noordeinde Palace as a work palace. In addition, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam is also at the disposal of the monarch (although it is only used for state visits and is open to the public when not in use for that purpose). Soestdijk Palace was sold to private investors in 2017.
The crown jewels, comprising the crown, orb and sceptre, Sword of State, royal banner, and ermine mantle have been placed in the Crown Property Trust. The trust also holds the items used on ceremonial occasions, such as the carriages, table silver, and dinner services. The Royal House is also exempt from income, inheritance, and personal tax.

The House of Orange has long had the reputation of being one of the wealthier royal houses in the world, largely due to their business investments in Royal Dutch Shell, Philips electronics company, KLM-Royal Dutch Airlines, and the Holland-America Line. How significant these investments are is a matter of conjecture, as their private finances, unlike their public stipends as monarch, are not open to public scrutiny.

As late as 2001, the fortune of the Royal Family was estimated by various sources (&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine) at $3.2 billion. Most of the wealth was reported to come from the family&#x27;s longstanding stake in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. At one time, the Oranges reportedly owned as much as 25% of the oil company; their stake is in 2001 was estimated at a minimum of 2%, worth $2.7 billion on the May 21 cutoff date for the Billionaires issue. The family also was estimated to have a 1% stake in financial services firm ABN-AMRO.

The royal family&#x27;s fortune seems to have been hit by declines in real estate and equities after 2008. They were also rumored to have lost up to $100 million when Bernard Madoff&#x27;s Ponzi scheme collapsed, though the royal house denies the allegations. In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Queen Beatrix&#x27;s wealth at US$300 million. This could also have been due to splitting the fortune between Queen Beatrix and her 3 sisters, as there is no right of the eldest to inherit the whole property. A surge in export revenue, recovery in real estate and strong stock market have helped steady the royal family&#x27;s fortunes, but uncertainty over the new government and future austerity measures needed to bring budget deficits in line may dampen future prospects. In July 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated her net worth at $200 million This estimate was unchanged in April 2011.

== Royal family versus royal house ==
 

Under Dutch law, there is a distinction between the royal family and the Dutch royal house. Whereas &#x27;royal family&#x27; refers to the entire Orange-Nassau family, only a small subgroup of it constitutes the royal house. By the Royal House Membership Act 2002, membership of the royal house is limited to:

The royal house and family is the Orange-Nassau family. 

* (Article 1) the reigning monarch (King or Queen);
* (Article 1a) the members of the royal family in the line of succession to the Dutch throne, limited to the second degree of sanguinity reckoned from the reigning monarch;
* (Article 1b) the heir presumptive of the reigning monarch;
* (Article 1c) the former monarch (upon abdication);
* (Article 2) the spouses of the above, even if the above die.
* (Article 3) H.R.H. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, (for whom an exception was made);

Members of the Royal House lose their membership (and thereby, designation as prince or princess of the Netherlands) if they lose the membership of the Royal House on the succession of a new monarch (not being in the second degree of sanguinity to the monarch anymore, Article 1a), or by royal decree approved by the Council of State (Article 5). This last scenario could happen, for example, if a royal house member marries without the consent of the Dutch Parliament. For example, this happened with Prince Friso in 2004, when he married Mabel Wisse Smit.

==Family tree==

===Origins of the Nassaus===

The lineage of the House of Nassau can be traced back to the 10th century.

A detailed family tree can be found here. A detailed family tree of the House of Orange-Nassau from the 15th century can be found on the Dutch Wikipedia at Dutch monarchs family tree.
===Orange and Nassau Family Tree===

The main house of Orange-Nassau also spawned several illegitimate branches. These branches contributed to the political and economic history of England and the Netherlands. Justinus van Nassau was the only extramarital child of William of Orange. He was a Dutch army commander known for unsuccessfully defending Breda against the Spanish, and the depiction of his surrender on the famous picture by Diego Velázquez, &quot;The Surrender of Breda&quot;. Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd was a younger illegitimate son of Prince Maurice and Margaretha van Mechelen. His descendants were later created Counts of Nassau-LaLecq. One of his sons was the famous general Henry de Nassau, Lord of Overkirk, King William III&#x27;s Master of the Horse, and one of the most trusted generals of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. His descendants became the Earls of Grantham in England. Frederick van Nassau, Lord of Zuylestein, an illegitimate son of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, gave rise to the Earls of Rochford in England. The 4th earl of Rochford was a famous English diplomat and a statesman.

===Royal House of Orange-Nassau=== 

In 1815, William VI of Orange became King of the Netherlands. This summary genealogical tree shows how the current Royal house of Orange-Nassau is related:

==Coats of Arms==


The gallery below show the coats of arms used by members of the house of Orange-Nassau. Their growing complexity and use of crowns shows how arms are used to reflect the growing political position and royal aspirations of the family. A much more complete armorial is given at the Armorial of the House of Nassau, and another one at Wapen van Nassau, Tak van Otto at the Dutch Wikipedia.

The ancestral coat of arms of the Ottonian line of the house of Nassau is shown right. Their distant cousins of the Walramian line added a red coronet to distinguish them. There is no specific documentation in the literature on the origin of the arms. The lion was always a popular noble symbol, originating as a symbol of nobility, power, and royal aspirations in western culture going all the way back to Hercules. The lion was also heavily used as a heraldic symbol in border territories and neighbouring countries of the Holy Roman Empire and France. It was in all likelihood a way of showing independence from the Holy Roman Emperor, who used an eagle in his personal arms and the King of France, who used the famous Fleur-de-lis. The lion was so heavily used in the Netherlands for various provinces and families (see Leo Belgicus) that it became the national arms of the Dutch Republic, its successor Kingdom of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Blue, because of its nearness to purple, which in the northern climes tended to fade (red was the other choice), was also a popular color for those with royal aspirations. The billets could have been anything from blocks of wood to abstractions of the reenforcements holding the shield together. The fact that these were arms were very similar to those of the counts of Burgundy (Franche-Comté) did not seem to cause too much confusion.

Henry III of Nassau-Breda came to the Netherlands in 1499 as heir to his uncle, Engelbrecht II of Nassau-Breda. His and his uncle&#x27;s arms are shown below. When Philbert, prince of Orange died in 1530, his sister&#x27;s son René of Breda inherited the Princedom of Orange on condition that he used the name and coat of arms of the Chalon-Orange family. History knows him therefore as René of Chalon instead of as &quot;René of Nassau-Breda.&quot; The 1st and 4th grand quarters show the arms of the Chalons-Arlay (the gold bend) princes of Orange (the bugle). The blue and gold cross is the arms of Jeanne of Geneva, who married one of the Chalons princes. The 2nd and 3rd show the quarterings of Brittany and Luxembourg-St. Pol. The inescutcheon overall is his paternal arms quartered of Nassau and Breda. William the Silent&#x27;s father, William the Rich, was rich only in children. He bore the arms shown below. Clockwise from upper left they displayed the arms of Nassau (1st quarter), Katzenelenbogen (3rd quarter), Dietz (2nd quarter), Vianden (4th quarter).
The princes of Orange in the 16th and 17th century used the following sets of arms. On becoming prince of Orange, William placed the Chalon-Arlay arms in the center (&quot;as an inescutcheon&quot;) of his father&#x27;s arms. He used these arms until 1582 when he purchased the marquisate of Veere and Vlissingen. It had been the property of Philip II since 1567, but had fallen into arrears to the province. In 1580 the Court of Holland ordered it sold. William bought it as it gave him two more votes in the States of Zeeland. He owned the government of the two towns, and so could appoint their magistrates. He already had one as First Noble for Philip William, who had inherited Maartensdijk. This made William the predominant member of the States of Zeeland. It was a smaller version of the countship of Zeeland (&amp; Holland) promised to William, and was a potent political base for his descendants. William then added the shield of Veere and Buren to his arms as shown in the arms of Frederick Henry, William II and William III with the arms of the marquisate in the top center, and the arms of the county of Buren in the bottom center. William also started the tradition of keeping the number of billets in the upper left quarter for Nassau at 17 to symbolize the original 17 provinces of the Burgundian/Habsburg Netherlands, which he always hoped would form one united nation.

When John William Friso became Prince of Orange, he used the arms below. However, he was never recognized outside of Holland and areas friendly to Holland as Prince of Orange. His son, William IV, recognized as Prince of Orange, seems to have used the original arms of William the Silent. When the princes of Orange fled the Netherlands during the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland, and when France occupied the Netherlands, they were compensated by Napoleon with the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda. These principalities were confiscated when Napoleon invaded Germany (1806) and William VI supported his Prussian relatives. He succeeded his father as prince of Orange later that year, after William V&#x27;s death. The house of Orange-Nassau also had several illegitimate lines (see below) who based their arms on the arms of Nassau-Dillenburg.

When William VI of Orange returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and was proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands, he quartered the former Arms of the Dutch Republic (1st and 4th quarter) with the &quot;Chalon-Orange&quot; arms (2nd and 3rd quarter), which had come to symbolize Orange. As an in escutcheon he placed his ancestral arms of Nassau. When he became King in 1815, he combined the Dutch Republic Lion with the billets of the Nassau arms and added a royal crown to form the Coat of arms of the Netherlands. In 1907, Queen Wilhelmina replaced the royal crown on the lion and the shield bearers of the arms with a coronet.

Wilhelmina further decreed that in perpetuity her descendants should be styled &quot;princes and princesses of Orange-Nassau&quot; and that the name of the house would be &quot;Orange-Nassau&quot; (in Dutch &quot;Oranje-Nassau&quot;). Only those members of the members of the Dutch Royal Family that are designated to the smaller &quot;Royal House&quot; can use the title of prince or princess of the Netherlands. Since then, individual members of the House of Orange-Nassau are also given their own arms by the reigning monarch, similar to the United Kingdom. This is usually the royal arms, quartered with the arms of the principality of Orange, and an in escutcheon of their paternal arms.

As sovereign Princes, the princes of Orange used an independent prince&#x27;s crown or the princely hat. Sometimes, only the coronet part was used (see, here and here). After the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and as the principality of Orange had been incorporated into France by Louis XIV, they used the Dutch Royal Crowns. The full coats of arms of the princes of Orange, later Kings of the Netherlands, incorporated the arms above, the crown, 2 lions as supporters and the motto &quot;Je maintiendrai&quot; (&quot;I will maintain&quot;), the latter taken from the Chalons princes of Orange, who used &quot;Je maintiendrai Chalons&quot;.

Traditionally, members of the Nassau family were buried in Breda; but because that city was in Spanish hands when William died, he was buried in a new crypt in the New Church, Delft. The monument on his tomb was originally very modest, but it was replaced in 1623 by a new one, made by Hendrik de Keyser and his son Pieter. Since then, most of the members of the House of Orange-Nassau, including all Dutch monarchs, have been buried in that church. His great-grandson William the Third, King of England and Scotland and Stadtholder in the Netherlands, was buried in Westminster Abbey.

* Burial Monument to William the Silent 
* Crypt of the Frisian Nassaus in Leeuwarden
* Crypt of the Nassau-LaLecqs in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel 
* Original Crypt of Netherland Nassaus in Breda
* Crypt of Engelbrecht II van Nassau in Breda
* Crypt of the Nassau-Bergens in Bergen 
* Crypt of the Nassau-Siegens in Siegen

In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1956 science fiction novel &quot;Double Star&quot;, the House of Orange reigns over – but does not rule over – an empire of humanity that spans the entire Solar System.

<text>An image is a visual representation. An image can be two-dimensional, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or three-dimensional, such as a carving or sculpture. Images may be displayed through other media, including a projection on a surface, activation of electronic signals, or digital displays; they can also be reproduced through mechanical means, such as photography, printmaking, or photocopying. Images can also be animated through digital or physical processes.

In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s). In optics, the term &quot;image&quot; (or &quot;optical image&quot;) refers specifically to the reproduction of an object formed by light waves coming from the object.

A &quot;volatile image&quot; exists or is perceived only for a short period. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode-ray tube. A &quot;fixed image&quot;, also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile.

A mental image exists in an individual&#x27;s mind as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image does not need to be real; it may be an abstract concept such as a graph or function or an imaginary entity. For a mental image to be understood outside of an individual&#x27;s mind, however, there must be a way of conveying that mental image through the words or visual productions of the subject.

==Characteristics==
=== Two-dimensional images ===
The broader sense of the word &#x27;image&#x27; also encompasses any two-dimensional figure, such as a map, graph, pie chart, painting, or banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, or the graphic arts (such as lithography or etching). Additionally, images can be rendered automatically through printing, computer graphics technology, or a combination of both methods.

A two-dimensional image does not need to use the entire visual system to be a visual representation. An example of this is a grayscale (&quot;black and white&quot;) image, which uses the visual system&#x27;s sensitivity to brightness across all wavelengths without taking into account different colors. A black-and-white visual representation of something is still an image, even though it does not fully use the visual system&#x27;s capabilities.

On the other hand, some processes can be used to create visual representations of objects that are otherwise inaccessible to the human visual system. These include microscopy for the magnification of minute objects, telescopes that can observe objects at great distances, X-rays that can visually represent the interior structures of the human body (among other objects), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET scans), and others. Such processes often rely on detecting electromagnetic radiation that occurs beyond the light spectrum visible to the human eye and converting such signals into recognizable images.

=== Three-dimensional images ===
Aside from sculpture and other physical activities that can create three-dimensional images from solid material, some modern techniques, such as holography, can create three-dimensional images that are reproducible but intangible to human touch. Some photographic processes can now render the illusion of depth in an otherwise &quot;flat&quot; image, but &quot;3-D photography&quot; (stereoscopy) or &quot;3-D film&quot; are optical illusions that require special devices such as eyeglasses to create the illusion of depth.

=== Moving images ===

&quot;Moving&quot; two-dimensional images are actually illusions of movement perceived when still images are displayed in sequence, each image lasting less, and sometimes much less, than a fraction of a second. The traditional standard for the display of individual frames by a motion picture projector has been 24 frames per second (FPS) since at least the commercial introduction of &quot;talking pictures&quot; in the late 1920s, which necessitated a standard for synchronizing images and sounds. Even in electronic formats such as television and digital image displays, the apparent &quot;motion&quot; is actually the result of many individual lines giving the impression of continuous movement.

This phenomenon has often been described as &quot;persistence of vision&quot;: a physiological effect of light impressions remaining on the retina of the eye for very brief periods. Even though the term is still sometimes used in popular discussions of movies, it is not a scientifically valid explanation. Other terms emphasize the complex cognitive operations of the brain and the human visual system. &quot;Flicker fusion&quot;, the &quot;phi phenomenon&quot;, and &quot;beta movement&quot; are among the terms that have replaced &quot;persistence of vision&quot;, though no one term seems adequate to describe the process.

== Cultural and other uses ==
Image-making seems to have been common to virtually all human cultures since at least the Paleolithic era. Prehistoric examples of rock art—including cave paintings, petroglyphs, rock reliefs, and geoglyphs—have been found on every inhabited continent. Many of these images seem to have served various purposes: as a form of record-keeping; as an element of spiritual, religious, or magical practice; or even as a form of communication. Early writing systems, including hieroglyphics, ideographic writing, and even the Roman alphabet, owe their origins in some respects to pictorial representations.

=== Meaning and signification ===
Images of any type may convey different meanings and sensations for individual viewers, regardless of whether the image&#x27;s creator intended them. An image may be taken simply as a more or less &quot;accurate&quot; copy of a person, place, thing, or event. It may represent an abstract concept, such as the political power of a ruler or ruling class, a practical or moral lesson, an object for spiritual or religious veneration, or an object—human or otherwise—to be desired. It may also be regarded for its purely aesthetic qualities, rarity, or monetary value. Such reactions can depend on the viewer&#x27;s context. A religious image in a church may be regarded differently than the same image mounted in a museum. Some might view it simply as an object to be bought or sold. Viewers&#x27; reactions will also be guided or shaped by their education, class, race, and other contexts.

The study of emotional sensations and their relationship to any given image falls into the categories of aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While such studies inevitably deal with issues of meaning, another approach to signification was suggested by the American philosopher, logician, and semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce.

&quot;Images&quot; are one type of the broad category of &quot;signs&quot; proposed by Peirce. Although his ideas are complex and have changed over time, the three categories of signs that he distinguished stand out:

# The &quot;icon,&quot; which relates to an object by resemblance to some quality of the object. A painted or photographed portrait is an icon by virtue of its resemblance to the painting&#x27;s or photograph&#x27;s subject. A more abstract representation, such as a map or diagram, can also be an icon.
# The &quot;index,&quot; which relates to an object by some real connection. For example, smoke may be an index of fire, or the temperature recorded on a thermometer may be an index of a patient&#x27;s illness or health.
# The &quot;symbol,&quot; which lacks direct resemblance or connection to an object but whose association is arbitrarily assigned by the creator or dictated by cultural and historical habit, convention, etc. The color red, for example, may connote rage, beauty, prosperity, political affiliation, or other meanings within a given culture or context; the Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman claimed that his use of the color in his 1972 film &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; came from his personal visualization of the human soul.

A single image may exist in all three categories at the same time. The Statue of Liberty provides an example. While there have been countless two-dimensional and three-dimensional &quot;reproductions&quot; of the statue (i.e., &quot;icons&quot; themselves), the statue itself exists as

* an &quot;icon&quot; by virtue of its resemblance to a human woman (or, more specifically, previous representations of the Roman goddess Libertas or the female model used by the artist Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi).
* an &quot;index&quot; representing New York City or the United States of America in general due to its placement in New York Harbor, or with &quot;immigration&quot; from its proximity to the immigration center at Ellis Island.
* a &quot;symbol&quot; as a visualization of the abstract concept of &quot;liberty&quot; or &quot;freedom&quot; or even &quot;opportunity&quot; or &quot;diversity&quot;.

=== Critiques of imagery ===
The nature of images, whether three-dimensional or two-dimensional, created for a specific purpose or only for aesthetic pleasure, has continued to provoke questions and even condemnation at different times and places. In his dialogue, &quot;The Republic&quot;, the Greek philosopher Plato described our apparent reality as a copy of a higher order of universal forms. As copies of a higher reality, the things we perceive in the world, tangible or abstract, are inevitably imperfect. Book 7 of &quot;The Republic&quot; offers Plato&#x27;s &quot;Allegory of the Cave,&quot; where ordinary human life is compared to being a prisoner in a darkened cave who believes that shadows projected onto the cave&#x27;s wall comprise actual reality. Since art is itself an imitation, it is a copy of that copy and all the more imperfect. Artistic images, then, not only misdirect human reason away from understanding the higher forms of true reality, but in imitating the bad behaviors of humans in depictions of the gods, they can corrupt individuals and society.

Echoes of such criticism have persisted across time, accelerating as image-making technologies have developed and expanded immensely since the invention of the daguerreotype and other photographic processes in the mid-19th century. By the late 20th century, works like John Berger&#x27;s &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot; and Susan Sontag&#x27;s &quot;On Photography&quot; questioned the hidden assumptions of power, race, sex, and class encoded in even realistic images, and how those assumptions and such images may implicate the viewer in the voyeuristic position of a (usually) male viewer. The documentary film scholar Bill Nichols has also studied how apparently &quot;objective&quot; photographs and films still encode assumptions about their subjects.

Images perpetuated in public education, media, and popular culture have a profound impact on the formation of such mental images:

=== Religious critiques ===
Despite, or perhaps because of, the widespread use of religious and spiritual imagery worldwide, the making of images and the depiction of gods or religious subjects has been subject to criticism, censorship, and criminal penalties. The Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) all have had admonitions against the making of images, even though the extent of that proscription has varied with time, place, and sect or denomination of a given religion. In Judaism, one of the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai forbids the making of &quot;any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under earth.&quot; In Christian history, periods of iconoclasm (the destruction of images, especially those with religious meanings or connotations) have broken out from time to time, and some sects and denominations have rejected or severely limited the use of religious imagery. Islam tends to discourage religious depictions, sometimes quite rigorously, and often extends that to other forms of realistic imagery, favoring calligraphy or geometric designs instead. Depending on time and place, photographs and broadcast images in Islamic societies may be less subject to outright prohibition. In any religion, restrictions on image-making are especially targeted to avoid depictions of &quot;false gods&quot; in the form of idols. In recent years, militant extremist groups such as the Taliban and ISIS have destroyed centuries-old artifacts, especially those associated with other religions.

===In culture===
Virtually all cultures have produced images and applied different meanings or applications to them. The loss of knowledge about the context and connection of an image to its object is likely to result in different perceptions and interpretations of the image and even of the original object itself.

Through human history, one dominant form of imagery has been in relation to religion and spirituality. Such images, whether in the form of idols that are objects of worship or that represent some other spiritual state or quality, have a different status as artifacts when copies of such images sever links to the spiritual or supernatural. The German philosopher and essayist Walter Benjamin brought particular attention to this point in his 1935 essay &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.&quot;

Benjamin argues that the mechanical reproduction of images, which had accelerated through photographic processes in the previous one hundred years or so, inevitably degrades the &quot;authenticity&quot; or quasi-religious &quot;aura&quot; of the original object. One example is Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, originally painted as a portrait, but much later, with its display as an art object, it developed a &quot;cult&quot; value as an example of artistic beauty. Following years of various reproductions of the painting, the portrait&#x27;s &quot;cult&quot; status has little to do with its original subject or the artistry. It has become famous for being famous, while at the same time, its recognizability has made it a subject to be copied, manipulated, satirized, or otherwise altered in forms ranging from Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;L.H.O.O.Q&quot;. to Andy Warhol&#x27;s multiple silk-screened reproductions of the image.

In modern times, the development of &quot;non-fungible tokens&quot; (NFTs) has been touted as an attempt to create &quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;unique&quot; images that have a monetary value, existing only in digital format. This assumption has been widely debated.

==Other considerations==
The development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of sound art have led to considering the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis.

===Still or moving===

A &quot; is a single image. This phrase is used in photography, visual media, and the computer industry to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a standard.

A &quot; is typically a movie (film) or video, including digital video. It could also be an animated display, such as a zoetrope.

A still frame is a still image derived from one frame of a moving one. In contrast, a film still is a photograph taken on the set of a movie or television program during production, used for promotional purposes.

In image processing, a picture function is a mathematical representation of a two-dimensional image as a function of two spatial variables. The function f(x,y) describes the intensity of the point at coordinates (x,y).

=== Literature ===

In literature, a &quot;mental image&quot; may be developed through words and phrases to which the senses respond. It involves picturing an image mentally, also called imagining, hence imagery. It can both be figurative and literal.

<doc id="71930" wikidata="Q15684" url="?curid=71930" title="Segovia">
<text>Segovia ( , , ) is a city in the autonomous community of Castile and León, Spain. It is the capital and most populated municipality of the Province of Segovia. Segovia is in the Inner Plateau (&quot;Meseta central&quot;), near the northern slopes of the Sistema Central range and on a bend of the Eresma river.

The city is famous for its historic buildings including three main landmarks: its midtown Roman aqueduct, its cathedral (one of the last ones to be built in Europe following a Gothic style), and the medieval castle, which served as one of the templates for Walt Disney&#x27;s Cinderella Castle. The city center was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.

==Etymology==
The name of Segovia is of Celtiberian origin. Although historians have linked its old name to &quot;&quot;, the recent discovery of the original Roman city in the nearby village of Saelices discarded this possibility. The name of &quot;Segovia&quot; is mentioned by Livy in the context of the Sertorian War.

Under the Romans and Moors, the city was called Sego([u])via (, Ptolomeo ii. 6. § 56) and () respectively.

==Geography==
===Location===

Segovia is located near the Eresma rivercourse (a second-order tributary of the Douro), close to the northwestern slope of the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains, a subrange of the Sistema Central.

The main route of the Camino de Santiago de Madrid passes through the city.

===Climate===
Segovia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;), resulting from the high altitude and the distance from the coast. The average annual temperature is , with an average low in January of and an average high in July of . The annual precipitation range from 400 to 500 mm per year in the lower plains, and can reach above 1000 mm in the nearby mountainous area of Sierra de Guadarrama, as rainfall and snowfall is more frequent up the mountains. Decent showers coming from summer thunderstorms help the mountainous area of the province to be rainier than average than most of the central Spanish plateau, which gives the area lush vegetation. All of this make the province a damp corner in the context of the region. The predominant forms of vegetation in the mountainous areas include pine, evergreen, oak, beech and juniper.

===Population centers===
Aside from the main city, there are a number of other villages within the municipality of Segovia.
* Fuentemilanos
* Hontoria
* Madrona
* Revenga, established in 1983 as a &quot;minor local entity&quot; (Spanish: &quot;&quot;), a category of sub-municipal entities in Spain.
* Zamarramala
* Torredondo
* Perogordo

==History==
The first recorded mention of a settlement in what is today Segovia was a Celtic possession. Control later passed into the hands of the Romans. The city is a possible site of the battle in 75 BC where Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius was victorious over Quintus Sertorius and Hirtuleius. Hirtuleius died in the fighting.

During the Roman period the settlement belonged to one of numerous contemporary Latin convents. It is believed that the city was abandoned after the Islamic invasion of Spain centuries later. After the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI of León and Castile, the son of King Alfonso VI, Segovia was resettled with Christians from the north of the Iberian peninsula and beyond the Pyrenees, providing it with a significant sphere of influence whose boundaries crossed the Sierra de Guadarrama and the Tagus.

Segovia&#x27;s position on trading routes made it an important centre of trade in wool and textiles. The end of the Middle Ages saw something of a golden age for Segovia, with a growing Jewish population and the creation of a foundation for a powerful cloth industry. Several splendid works of Gothic architecture were also completed during this period. Notably, Isabella I was proclaimed queen of Castile in the church of San Miguel de Segovia on December 13, 1474.
Segovienne was a local flannel cloth used for upholstery in the 14th to 17th centuries. It was a twilled weave structure with a hairy surface produced by using Spanish wool.
Like most Castilian textile centres, Segovia joined the Revolt of the Comuneros under the command of Juan Bravo. Despite the defeat of the Communities, the city&#x27;s resultant economic boom continued into the sixteenth century, its population rising to 27,000 in 1594. Then, as well as almost all the cities of Castile, Segovia entered a period of decline. Only a century later in 1694, the population had been reduced to only 8,000 inhabitants. In the early eighteenth century, Segovia attempted to revitalize its textile industry, with little success. In the second half of the century, Charles III made another attempt to revive the region&#x27;s commerce; it took the form of the Royal Segovian Wool Manufacturing Company (1763). However, the lack of competitiveness of production caused the crown withdraw its sponsorship in 1779. In 1764, the Royal School of Artillery, the first military academy in Spain, was opened. This academy remains present in the city today. In 1808, Segovia was sacked by French troops during the War of Independence. During the First Carlist War, troops under the command of Don Carlos, Count of Molina unsuccessfully attacked the city. During the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, Segovia experienced a demographic recovery that was the result of relative economic stability.

==Demographics==
The population growth experienced during the nineteenth century accelerated steadily beginning around 1920: 16,013 inhabitants recorded that year, 33,360 in 1960, and 53,237 in 1981. Since the 1980s growth has slowed markedly: 55,586 in 2004 and 56,047 in 2007.

As of 1 January 2019, there were 11% of inhabitants who were foreigners – 4.478% coming from other countries in Europe, 2.37% being Africans, 3.7% being from the Americas, and 0.435% being Asians.

==Heritage==
===World Heritage City===
In 1985 the old city of Segovia and its Aqueduct were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The old city contains a multitude of historic buildings both civil and religious, including a large number of buildings of Jewish origin, notably within the old Jewish Quarter. One of the most historically important Jewish sites is the Jewish cemetery, .
Among the most important monuments in the city are:

*The Aqueduct of Segovia, located in Plaza del Azoguejo, is the defining historical feature of the city, dating from the late 1st or early 2nd century AD. Like a number of other aqueducts in Spain, Segovia&#x27;s Roman-built aqueduct receives attention for being one of the &quot;extraordinary engineering accomplishments&quot; existing in the country, wrote Alejandro Lapunzina in &quot;Reference Guides to National Architecture: Architecture of Spain&quot;. It is still used to deliver drinking water. &quot;The aqueduct of Segovia is – because of its long span, architectural beauty, uncharacteristic slenderness, and dramatic presence in the center of a dense urban fabric – the most impressive Roman structure in Spain, and one of the most famous among the numerous aqueducts built by the Romans throughout their vast Empire,&quot; Lapunzina wrote. It consists of about 25,000 granite blocks held together without any mortar, and spans 818 meters with more than 170 arches, the highest being 29 metres high.

*The Alcazar of Segovia, the royal palace built on a stone peninsula between the rivers Eresma and Clamores, is documented for the first time in 1122, although it may have existed earlier. It was one of the favored residences of the kings of Castile, built in the transition from Romanesque architecture to Gothic and Mudéjar. The building is structured around two courtyards and has two towers, and a keep. It was a favourite residence of Alfonso X the Wise and Henry IV, and Isabella the Catholic was crowned Queen of Castile in Segovia&#x27;s Plaza Mayor. Devastated by a fire in 1862, it was later rebuilt. It now houses the General Militar de Segovia archive and museum of the Royal School of Artillery, managed by the Board of the Alcazar.
*The Segovia Cathedral, the last Gothic cathedral built in Spain. It is considered a masterpiece of Basque-Castilian Gothic architecture and is known as &quot;The Lady of Cathedrals.&quot; Juan Gil de Hontañón, Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón, and other masters of Spanish architecture worked on the construction. It was consecrated in 1768 and is 105 meters long, 50 metres wide and 33 m high in the nave, has 18 chapels and has three doors: El Perdón, San Frutos and San Geroteo.
*The Walls of Segovia existed when Alfonso VI of León and Castile retook the city from the Arabs. Alfonso had them enlarged, and also increased its perimeter to 3 kilometres, with eight towers, five gates, and several doors. It was built mainly of granite blocks but also reused gravestones from the old Roman necropolis. The wall encircles the historic quarter and currently has three gates: San Cebrián; Santiago, built in the Mudéjar style; and San Andrés, gateway to the Jewish quarter; and the breaches of Consuelo, San Juan, the Sun, and the Moon.

===Religious architecture===

===Urban sculpture===
Urban sculpture in Segovia feature works depicting illustrious figures linked to the city, but there are also several works of a religious nature. One of the most iconic sculptures of the Loba Capitolina sits in front of the aqueduct. A copy of the Capitoline wolf is preserved in the Capitoline Museum and was a gift that Rome gave to the city in 1974 during the events of the bimillennial anniversary of the aqueduct.

Until a few decades ago, a monument dedicated to the artist Daniel Zuloaga, which was installed in 1924, could be seen in the Plaza de la Merced, but it was relocated to the Plaza de Colmenares. Currently located in the center of the Plaza de la Merced, looking towards the church of San Andrés is a bust of the poet Rubén Darío, sculptor Santiago de Santiago, which was donated by the Nicaragua government to the city in 1973. Letters related to the bust are also found in the Promenade Lounge, the famous poet José Rodas was first installed in 1927 in the plaza of the gardens, and moved to its present site in 1960 by the Segovian sculptor Aniceto Marinas. There is also a tribute to Antonio Machado; the poet Segovia also took refuge here from 1919 to 1932, a sculpture honoring him is located in the garden of his home museum, and was done by Emiliano Barral.

Religious figures such as Domingo de Soto, Pius XII, Saint Anthony Mary Claret, Saint John of the Cross have their own urban sculptures, including the first work of Ortega and several from José María García Moro, a prosperous Segovia sculptor who also created the Monument to the Youth located on the Plaza del Conde de Cheste. A few peasants have been recognized on the streets or town squares, as is the case for Aniceto Marinas, who dedicated a monument in 1943 to his friend and partner Mariano Benlliure.

In the field of arms is the monument to Daoíz and Velarde, Aniceto Marina&#x27;s work. By the same artist is the sculpture dedicated to the list of people associated with the comunero Juan Bravo, made in 1921 and located in the heart of the city at the Square of the Sirens, the name given to two statues that top the stairs representing the mythological beings, which were made by Francisco Bellver in 1852. Other sculptures in the city include one devoted to physician Andrés Laguna made by the Segovian Florentino Trapero and located at Plaza de los Huertos, the bust of Lope de la Calle Martín, president of the provincial council, that was made by Emiliano Barral and can be seen in the square of San Facundo, or the monument &quot;El Favorito&quot; by Toribio García de Andrés in the early 20th century.

In addition to this series of monuments and sculptures some other religious images worth mentioning can be found in the quieter corners of the city. The most significant of these is the Virgin of the Aqueduct, located in the central niche of the monument at the Plaza del Azoguejo since the 16th century; it memorializes Colmenares. A series of virgins can also be found at the Fuencisla on Velarde Street, the los Remedios in front of San Juan Gate, the Socorro at the San Andrés Gate and the del Carmen on the street of its own name, among others.

Segovia also has a work by Luis Sanguino, who lives in the city. It is &quot;El Mesonero Mayor de Castilla&quot; (&quot;The Elder Hotelkeeper of Castile&quot;), at the Plaza del Santo Espíritu.

===Parks and gardens===
* The Alcazar Gardens was built in the plaza where the Old Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace existed before and was created on the occasion of the marriage of Philip II to Anne of Austria in 1570, removing the ruins that still existed. This, however, was not fully realized until the visit of Ferdinand VI in the 18th century. Between 1816 and 1817 the first trees were planted, and enclosed with the fence that currently exists. They were destroyed by the fire suffered by the palace in 1862, and recovered again in 1882.
* The Garden of la Merced was the first public garden carried out by the city within the city walls. Named after the former Mercy convent that was located in the same place and came into existence in the middle 19th century with the planting of trees and installation of a fountain, later replaced by the current, broader and statelier plaza. There is also a child&#x27;s playground available.

<text>Andrés Segovia Torres, 1st Marquis of Salobreña (21 February 1893 – 2 June 1987), was a Spanish virtuoso classical guitarist. Many professional classical guitarists were either students of Segovia or students of Segovia&#x27;s students.
Segovia&#x27;s contribution to the modern-romantic repertoire included not only commissions but also his own transcriptions of classical or baroque works. He is remembered for his expressive performances: his wide palette of tone, and his distinctive musical personality, phrasing and style.

== Early life ==
Segovia was born on 21 February 1893 in Linares, Jaén. He was sent at a very young age to live with his uncle Eduardo and aunt María. Eduardo arranged for Segovia&#x27;s first music lessons with a violin teacher after he had recognised that Segovia had an aptitude for music. That proved to be an unhappy introduction to music for the young Segovia because of the teacher&#x27;s strict methods, and Eduardo stopped the lessons. His uncle decided to move to Granada to allow Segovia to obtain a better education. After arriving in Granada, Segovia recommenced his musical studies. Segovia was aware of flamenco during his formative years as a musician but stated that he &quot;did not have a taste&quot; for the form and chose instead the works of Fernando Sor, Francisco Tárrega, and other classical composers. Tárrega agreed to give the self-taught Segovia some lessons but died before they could meet, and Segovia states that his early musical education involved the &quot;double function of professor and pupil in the same body&quot;.

== Career ==
Segovia&#x27;s first public performance was in Granada at the age of 16 in 1909. A few years later he played his first professional concert in Madrid, which included works by Francisco Tárrega and his own guitar transcriptions of Johann Sebastian Bach. Despite the discouragement of his family, who wanted him to become a lawyer, and criticism by some of Tárrega&#x27;s pupils for his idiosyncratic technique, he continued to pursue his studies of the guitar diligently.

He played again in Madrid in 1912, at the Paris Conservatory in 1915 and in Barcelona in 1916 and made a successful tour of South America in 1919. Segovia&#x27;s arrival on the international stage coincided with a time when the guitar&#x27;s fortunes as a concert instrument were being revived, largely through the efforts of Miguel Llobet. It was in that changing milieu that Segovia, thanks to his strength of personality and artistry, coupled with developments in recording and broadcasting, succeeded in making the guitar more popular again.

In 1921 in Paris, Segovia met Alexandre Tansman, who later wrote a number of guitar works for Segovia, among them Cavatina, which won a prize at the Siena International Composition contest in 1952. In 1921, he also met Agustín Barrios in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Segovia was impressed by Barrios&#x27;s Bach-inspired and arguably magnum opus &quot;La Catedral&quot;.

At Granada in 1922, he became associated with the Concurso de Cante Jondo, promoted by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. The aim of the &quot;classicising&quot; &quot;Concurso&quot; was to preserve flamenco in its purity from being distorted by modern popular music. Segovia had already developed as a fine &quot;tocador&quot; of flamenco guitar, yet his direction was now classical. Invited to open the &quot;Concurso&quot; held at the Alhambra, he played &quot;Homenaje a Debussy&quot; by Falla.
In 1923, Segovia visited Mexico for the first time. There Manuel Ponce was so impressed with the concert that he wrote a review in &quot;El Universal&quot;. Later Ponce went on to write many works for Segovia, including numerous sonatas.

In 1924, Segovia, visited the German luthier Hermann Hauser Sr. after Segovia heard some of Hauser&#x27;s instruments played in a concert in Munich. In 1928, Hauser provided Segovia with one of the guitars, which Segovia used during his tour of the United States and in other concerts up to 1933. Segovia ordered a further guitar from Hauser and after receiving it passed on the 1928 model to his American representative and close friend Sophocles Papas, who in his turn gave it to his student, the famous jazz and classical guitarist Charlie Byrd, who used it on several records.

Segovia&#x27;s first American tour was arranged in 1928 when Fritz Kreisler, the Viennese violinist who privately played the guitar, persuaded Francis Charles Coppicus from the Metropolitan Musical Bureau to present the guitarist in New York.

After Segovia&#x27;s debut tour in the US in 1928 the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos composed his now well-known Twelve Études (Portuguese: &quot;Doze estudos&quot;; French: &quot;Douze études&quot;; German: &quot;Zwölf Studien&quot;) and later dedicated them to Segovia. Their relationship proved to be lasting, and Villa-Lobos continued to write for Segovia. He also transcribed numerous classical pieces himself and revived the pieces transcribed by predecessors like Tárrega.
In 1932, Segovia met and befriended the composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco in Venice. Since Castelnuovo-Tedesco did not play the guitar, Segovia provided him with guitar compositions (Ponce&#x27;s &quot;Folias&quot; variations and Sor&#x27;s &quot;Mozart Variations&quot;), which he could study. Castelnuovo-Tedesco composed a large number of works for the guitar, many of them dedicated to Segovia. The Concerto Op. 99 of 1939 was the first guitar concerto of the 20th century and Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#x27;s last work in Italy before he emigrated to the United States. It was premiered by Segovia in Uruguay in 1939.

In 1935, he gave his first public performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Chaconne&quot;, a difficult piece for any instrument. He moved to Montevideo and performed many concerts in South America in the 1930s and the early 1940s.

After World War II, Segovia began to record more frequently and performed regular tours of Europe and America and would maintain that schedule for 30 years. In 1954, Joaquín Rodrigo dedicated &quot;Fantasía para un gentilhombre&quot; (&quot;Fantasy for a Gentleman&quot;) to Segovia. Segovia won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance, Instrumentalist for his recording &quot;Segovia Golden Jubilee&quot;.

John W. Duarte dedicated his English Suite Op. 31 to Segovia and his wife, Emilia Magdalena del Corral Sancho, on the occasion of their marriage in 1962. Segovia told the composer &quot;You will be astonished at the success it will have&quot;.

In recognition of his contributions to music and the arts, Segovia was ennobled on 24 June 1981 by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of &quot;Marqués de Salobreña&quot; (English: Marquis of Salobreña) in the nobility of Spain.

Segovia continued performing into his old age, and lived in semi-retirement during his seventies and eighties on the Costa del Sol. Two films were made of his life and work, one when he was 75 and the other when he was 84. They are available on DVD under the titles &quot;Andrés Segovia—in Portrait&quot;. His final RCA LP (ARL1-1602), &quot;Reveries&quot;, was recorded in Madrid in June 1977.

In 1984, Segovia was the subject of a 13-part series broadcast on National Public Radio, &quot;Segovia!&quot; The series was recorded on location in Spain, France and the United States. Hosted by Oscar Brand, the series was produced by Jim Anderson, Robert Malesky and Larry Snitzler.

Segovia died on 2 June 1987 in Madrid of a heart attack at the age of 94. He is buried at Casa Museo Andrés Segovia in Linares.

== Technique ==
The right hand is responsible for the guitar&#x27;s musical sound and so in examining the technique, the way the right hand is placed in relation to the strings is most important. For several years, it was thought among the guitar community that Segovia plucked the strings with a combination of fingertip and nail, as stated by Christopher Parkening, but Segovia plucked the strings only with the nails. When asked which technique he used, he replied that it was &quot;the only one there is: nails. Because they bring timbre differences and colour variation and give sonorous volume to the guitar.&quot; His right hand was placed so that the nails were perpendicular to the strings. That way, the nail alone would press the string. At the same time, it was thought that was the only way to avoid unpleasant noise coming from the low strings (E, A and D) of the guitar when they were plucked.

Segovia created a strong bass sound with his right thumb in spite of his technique, largely because of the flexibility that he had in his thumb, which helped to create a very strong and voluminous sound in the bass notes.

Another innovation that separated Segovia from the Tárrega school was the search for the tension in the strings by placing his right hand further to the right side. That way, he could obtain colour variation but also an especially strong, round and voluminous sound, which was very helpful for giving concerts in big halls (the technique was later used by Narciso Yepes). Before Segovia, guitarists from the Tárrega school played the guitar with the hand right over the soundhole and thus created a mellow sound but could not fill the whole space of a large concert hall.

After World War II, Segovia became among the first to endorse nylon strings, instead of catgut strings. That advancement allowed for greater tonal stability and was the final ingredient in the standardization of the instrument.

== Repertoire ==
Segovia&#x27;s repertoire consisted of three principal pillars: first, contemporary works, including concertos and sonatas, usually specifically written for Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships, notably Federico Moreno Torroba, Federico Mompou, and Joaquín Rodrigo, the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and the great Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos; second, transcriptions, usually made by Segovia himself, of classical works originally written for other instruments (e.g., lute, harpsichord, piano, violin, cello) by Johann Sebastian Bach, Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, and many other prominent composers; third, traditional classical guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco Tárrega. Segovia&#x27;s influence enlarged the repertoire, mainly as a commissioner or dedicatee of new works, as a transcriber, and as a composer with such works as his &quot;Estudio sin luz&quot;.

Segovia&#x27;s main musical aesthetic preferences were music of the early 20th century (and turn of the century) especially in the Spanish romantic-modern and nationalist style. That is perhaps best typified by Segovia&#x27;s own work &quot;Estudio sin Luz&quot;. Many works of that and similar styles were written especially for him and formed part of his core repertoire: particularly the guitar works of Federico Moreno Torroba (1891–1982), such as the &quot;Sonatina&quot;, which was first performed by Segovia in Paris in 1925.

Segovia was selective and performed only works with which he identified personally. He was known to reject atonal works or those that he considered too radical even if they were dedicated to him; he rejected Frank Martin&#x27;s &quot;Quatre pièces brèves&quot;, Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;Segoviana&quot;, etc. Even though rejected by Segovia, all of those works are today published and available.

=== Teaching ===
Segovia viewed teaching as vital to his mission of propagating the guitar and gave master classes throughout his career. His most famous master classes took place at &quot;Música en Compostela&quot;, in the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela.

Segovia also taught at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena for numerous years, where he was aided by Alirio Díaz.

His teaching style is a source of controversy among some of his former students, who considered it to be dogmatically authoritarian. One of Segovia&#x27;s most celebrated former students of the classical guitar, John Williams, has said that Segovia bullied students into playing only his style and stifled the development of their own styles. Williams has also said that Segovia was dismissive of music that did not have what Segovia considered the correct classical origins, such as South American music with popular roots. He was also critical of Williams&#x27; work with the group Sky for the same reasons.

=== Legacy ===
Segovia can be considered a catalytic figure in granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation. Federico Moreno Torroba said, &quot;The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is Andrés Segovia.&quot; He can be credited to have dignified the classical guitar as a legitimate concert instrument before the discerning music public, which had hitherto viewed the guitar merely as a limited if sonorous parlour instrument.

In Linares, the Segovia Museum &quot;Fundación Andrés Segovia&quot; was established in May 1995, and Linares (Segovia&#x27;s birthplace) also has a bronze statue in his honour, created by Julio López Hernández and unveiled on 25 May 1984.

Segovia influenced a generation of classical guitarists who built on his technique and musical sensibility, including Christopher Parkening, Julian Bream, John Williams and Oscar Ghiglia, all of whom have acknowledged their debt to him. Further, Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar, including several transcriptions of Bach, particularly an extraordinarily-demanding classical guitar transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004). During his lifetime, guitarists were eager to claim association with Segovia, who suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as has been claimed. He once said, &quot;All over the world I have &#x27;pupils&#x27; I have never met.&quot;

His editions of works originally written for guitar include newly-fingered and occasionally-revised versions of works from the standard repertoire (most famously, his edition of a selection of twenty &quot;estudios&quot; by Fernando Sor, the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of every serious student&#x27;s technique since its publication in 1945 although somewhat ironically, Segovia, in the preface to that work, disparaged Sor as &quot;not among the vigorous talents&quot;) as well as compositions written for him, including by Heitor Villa-Lobos, Federico Mompou, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.

* The main-belt asteroid 3822 Segovia was named in his memory in 1989.
* A competition co-sponsored by the European Guitar Teachers Association is named after Segovia.

== Awards ==
Segovia was awarded many prizes and honours, including doctorates &quot;honoris causa&quot;, from ten universities. On 24 June 1981, he was ennobled by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of &quot;Marqués de Salobreña&quot; (English: Marquis of Salobreña) in the nobility of Spain in recognition of his contributions to music and the arts. He received the Danish Sonning Award in 1974, the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1985, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986.

== Personal life ==
Segovia&#x27;s first wife was Adelaida Portillo (marriage in 1918). Segovia&#x27;s second wife (marriage in 1935) was the pianist Paquita Madriguera, who also made some piano roll recordings. From 1944, he maintained a romantic relationship with Brazilian singer and guitarist Olga Praguer Coelho, which was to last for over a decade. In 1962 Segovia married Emilia Magdalena Corral Sancho. They had one son, Carlos Andrés Segovia, the current Marquis of Salobreña.

<text>Pluto is an American cartoon character created by Walt Disney and Norm Ferguson. He is a yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dog with black ears. Unlike most Disney characters, Pluto is not anthropomorphic beyond some characteristics such as facial expression. He is Mickey Mouse&#x27;s pet. Officially a mixed-breed dog, he made his debut as a bloodhound in the Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;The Chain Gang&quot;. Together with Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, and Goofy, Pluto is one of the &quot;Sensational Six&quot;—the biggest stars in the Disney universe. Though all six are non-human animals, Pluto alone is not dressed as a human.

Pluto debuted in animated cartoons and appeared in 24 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; films before receiving his own series in 1937. All together Pluto appeared in 89 short films between 1930 and 1953. Several of these were nominated for an Academy Award, including &quot;The Pointer&quot; (1939), &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Rights&quot; (1946), &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Blue Note&quot; (1947), and &quot;Mickey and the Seal&quot; (1948). One film starring him, &quot;Lend a Paw&quot; (1941), won the award in 1942. Because Pluto does not speak, his films generally rely on physical humor. This made Pluto a pioneering figure in character animation, by expressing personality through animation rather than dialogue.

Like all of Pluto&#x27;s co-stars, the dog has appeared extensively in comics over the years, first making an appearance in 1931. He returned to theatrical animation in 1990 with &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; and has also appeared in several direct-to-video films. Pluto also appears in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (2006–2016), &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; (2017–2021), &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (2013–2019) and its successor &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot; (2020–2023), &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; (2021–present) and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse+&quot; (2025–present).

In 1998, Disney&#x27;s copyright on Pluto, set to expire at the end of 2005, was extended by the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Disney, along with other studios, lobbied for passage of the act to preserve their copyrights on characters such as Pluto for 20 additional years. Under current US copyright law, Pluto&#x27;s earliest appearances will become public domain at the start of 2026. However Pluto, like all Disney characters, will remain trademarked by Disney, and trademarks do not expire unless the rights holder stops using it.

==Origin==
The character of Pluto originated with animator Norm Ferguson, who came to the Disney Studio in 1929. Ferguson is credited with introducing the animation principle of &quot;follow through and overlapping action&quot;: where different parts of the body move at different times and speeds compared to the main action. Ferguson first introduced this technique in the Silly Symphony short &quot;Frolicking Fish&quot; (released May 8, 1930): where he animated a trio of dancing fish, and offset the movement of their fins, having them &quot;drag&quot; along with the main body&#x27;s movement. This gave the characters a more flowing and natural movement compared to most other animation of that time. Walt Disney was so impressed with Ferguson&#x27;s work on &quot;Frolicking Fish&quot;, that he ordered all of his animators study the scene.

Shortly after completing his work on &quot;Frolicking Fish&quot;, Disney assigned Ferguson to work on the Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;The Chain Gang&quot; (released on September 5, 1930); where Mickey is portrayed as a prisoner who escapes from jail, and is perused by two nameless bloodhounds. Ferguson was tasked with animating a scene where Mickey runs towards the camera and is followed by the two bloodhounds, who sniff Mickey&#x27;s trail, look up, snort and bark at the camera. According to Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, when describing this scene to Ferguson, Disney would reminisce about different dogs he grew up with as a child, and act out their mannerisms (much to the staff&#x27;s amusement), to which Ferguson would then translate into his animation.

When animating the scene, Ferguson applied his principle of &quot;follow through and overlapping action&quot; to the jowls of the dogs, which gave them surprisingly lifelike movement for the time. As animation historian Michael Barrier writes of the scene: 
Upon reviewing the scene, Disney was so impressed by Ferguson&#x27;s animation on the dogs, he decided to develop one of them into a recurring character. Ferguson&#x27;s dog character next appeared in &quot;The Picnic&quot; (released on October 23 of that same year), however he was portrayed as Minnie&#x27;s dog, and was named &quot;Rover&quot;. In his third appearance, &quot;The Moose Hunt&quot; (released on May 3, 1931), he appeared as Mickey&#x27;s pet, and was finally given the name &quot;Pluto&quot;. Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen claimed they changed the name to Pluto because: &quot;We thought the name [Rover] was too common, so we had to look for something else. ... We changed it to &quot;Pluto the Pup&quot; ... but I don&#x27;t honestly remember why.&quot; Some Disney animators reportedly believed that Disney chose the name &quot;Pluto&quot; to capitalize on the then-newly-named ninth planet of Pluto. However, animation historian John Canemaker states that Disney chose the name simply because he once had a dog named Pluto.

While other animators would handle the character of Pluto - Ferguson became the Pluto specialist at the Disney Studio. Over the next few years, Ferguson would continue to develop and refine the character of Pluto, ultimately crystalizing with &quot;Playful Pluto&quot; (1934), in which Ferguson animated a scene where Pluto gets a piece of flypaper stuck to his rear end. While the sequence storyboarded by Webb Smith, Ferguson padded the scene and added extra bits of comic business. The scene was considered a major landmark in the development of character animation. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston described the scene as: 

Following the circulation of Art Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;Character Analysis of the Goof&quot; around the Disney studio, Ferguson wrote a 4-Page character bible on Pluto that was published on Jan 4, 1936, and detailed Pluto&#x27;s body construction, facial expressions, mannerisms and personality.

==Characterization==
Unlike Mickey&#x27;s other animal friends, such as Goofy (who is also a dog), Pluto is a relatively normal animal, with few anthropomorphic traits apart from his facial expressions. Pluto usually doesn&#x27;t speak in English, walk upright or wear clothing. A significant departure from this was his speaking role in &quot;The Moose Hunt&quot; (1931), which was produced before Pluto&#x27;s characterization had been clearly defined. As Pluto made more appearances, it became common that he would mostly speak in barks and grunts like most dogs. Other ways of communicating Pluto&#x27;s thoughts occur through his facial expressions, and sometimes through the use of a shoulder angel/devil who speak directly to Pluto. (&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Elephant&quot;, &quot;Lend a Paw&quot;).

Pluto is generally a cheerful and adventurous dog, although he can be given to sheer panic when confronted with something unknown. Common themes in Pluto&#x27;s stories involve him becoming jealous of Mickey getting another pet (&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Elephant&quot;, &quot;Lend a Paw&quot;, &quot;Mickey and the Seal&quot;), Pluto accidentally and unwittingly swallowing something and panicking when he realizes it (&quot;Playful Pluto&quot;, &quot;Donald and Pluto&quot;), Pluto getting entangled with something inanimate like a piece of flypaper (&quot;Beach Picnic&quot;, &quot;Playful Pluto&quot;), or Pluto being pestered by a smaller animal (&quot;Private Pluto&quot;, &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Rights&quot;). In many of his appearances with Mickey, Pluto will get himself into trouble and cause Mickey to get angry at him. Mickey, however, often cheers up quickly, often telling Pluto &quot;Aw, I can&#x27;t be mad at ya.&quot;.

Pluto sometimes appears with other regular animal characters. His friends include Fifi the Peke, Dinah the Dachshund, and Ronnie the St. Bernard Puppy. Other animals he is less friendly with include Salty the Seal, Butch the Bulldog, Figaro the Kitten, Chip &#x27;n Dale, Peg Leg Pete, Spike the Bee, Bent-Tail the Coyote, Milton the Cat, and other characters. In Disney&#x27;s 1937 animated short &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Quin-puplets&quot;, Pluto has five sons, one of them returning in the 1942 short &quot;Pluto Junior&quot;. In the 1946 animated short &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Kid Brother&quot;, Pluto has a younger brother named K.B.

==Appearances==
Pluto first and most often appears in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; series of cartoons. On rare occasions, he is paired with Donald Duck (&quot;Donald and Pluto&quot;, &quot;Beach Picnic&quot;, &quot;Window Cleaners&quot;, &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Dog Laundry&quot;, &amp; &quot;Put-Put Troubles&quot;).

The first cartoons to feature Pluto as a solo star were two &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; shorts, &quot;Just Dogs&quot; (1932) and &quot;Mother Pluto&quot; (1936). In 1937, Pluto appeared in &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Quin-Puplets&quot; which was the first installment of his own film series, then headlined &quot;Pluto the Pup&quot;. However, they were not produced on a regular basis until 1940, by which time the name of the series was shortened to &quot;Pluto&quot;.

His first comics appearance was in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip in July 1931, two months after the release of &quot;The Moose Hunt&quot;. In 1938, Pluto headlined in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip, in an adaptation of his &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short, &quot;Mother Pluto&quot;. Pluto was later featured in several sequences of the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strip in 1939 and 1940.

&quot;Pluto Saves the Ship&quot;, a comic book published in 1942, was one of the first Disney comics prepared for publication outside newspaper strips. However, not counting a few cereal giveaway mini-comics in 1947 and 1951, he did not have his own comics title until 1952.

In 1936, Pluto was featured in the picture book &quot;Mickey Mouse and Pluto the Pup&quot; by Whitman Publishing.

Pluto ran his own neighborhood in Disney&#x27;s Toontown Online until its closedown. It was called the Brrrgh and it was always snowing there except during Halloween. During April Toons Week, a weekly event that was very silly, Pluto switched playgrounds with Minnie (all other characters did this as well), and he actually talked in Minnie&#x27;s Melodyland.

Pluto has also appeared in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; (2006–2016), &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (2013–2019), &quot;Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures&quot; (2017–2021), and &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot; (2020-present) and &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; (2021–present). Curiously enough, however, Pluto was the only standard Disney character not included when the whole gang was reunited for the 1983 featurette &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, although he did return in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990) and &quot;Runaway Brain&quot; (1995). He also had a cameo at the ending of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988). In 1996, he made a cameo in the &quot;Quack Pack&quot; episode &quot;The Really Mighty Ducks&quot;.

===Video games===
Pluto appeared as a non-playable character in &quot;Mickey Mania&quot; (1994).

Pluto also appears in &quot;Disney Golf&quot; for the PlayStation 2. In the event that the player&#x27;s golf ball goes out of bounds or hits a water hazard, Pluto will come and look for the player&#x27;s golf ball.

In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series, Pluto is still Mickey&#x27;s pet and acts as somewhat of a messenger, assisting in his master&#x27;s plans. For most of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Pluto stays by Kairi&#x27;s side (even when she has been kidnapped), as he has apparently taken a liking to her. Strangely, throughout the series, Pluto appears and disappears at random moments.

Pluto is a playable character in the world builder game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, being a premium character to unlock in the main storyline of the game.

===Disney parks===
In the various Disney theme park resorts around the world, Pluto is a meetable character just like many of his film co-stars. Pluto, however, uncharacteristically walks on two legs in this capacity out of necessity. Adults and children are able to meet, play with, and get autographs and pictures with Pluto and his friends at all Disney parks. Shirts, hats, toys and other various types of merchandise featuring Pluto are available.

<text>Agere Systems, Inc. was an integrated circuit components company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Spun out of Lucent Technologies in 2002, Agere was merged into LSI Corporation in 2007. LSI was in turn acquired by Avago Technologies in 2014. In early 2016, Avago acquired the former Broadcom Corporation, and took on the name Broadcom Inc.

==History==
Agere was incorporated on August 1, 2000, as a subsidiary of Lucent Technologies and then spun off on June 1, 2002. The name &quot;Agere&quot; was that of a Texas-based electronics company that Lucent had acquired in 2000, although the pronunciations of the company names are different. The Texas company was pronounced with three syllables and a hard &quot;g&quot;: . The company name was pronounced with two syllables and a hard &quot;g&quot;: . Agere is a Latin verb meaning &quot;to act&quot;, &quot;to do&quot;, or &quot;to make&quot;.

===Microsoft suit===
In 2007, Agere Systems sued Microsoft for theft of key technology used in Internet telephony. 

The allegations concern meetings between Agere and Microsoft in 2002 and 2003, where the companies discussed selling Agere&#x27;s stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation technology to Microsoft. This technology is used to improve the sound of telephone and teleconference communications over the Internet. Just before the agreement was to be signed, Microsoft ended the discussions saying that it made a significant breakthrough in its own, heretofore undisclosed research program, and no longer needed Agere&#x27;s technology.

Apart from the main office in Allentown, the company also maintained offices and facilities in:
* Reading, Pennsylvania, USA: The &quot;Reading Works&quot; facility, formerly Lucent/AT&amp;T and Bell Labs. Closed in 2003.
* Orlando, Florida, USA: The &quot;Orlando Plant&quot; was Agere&#x27;s newest wholly owned wafer fabrication facility in the world. Opened in 1984 by AT&amp;T, it was known for a time in the late 1990s as &quot;Cirent Semiconductor&quot; as it was operated as a joint venture between Lucent Technologies and Cirrus Logic Corporation. The Orlando Plant was also home to Bell Labs&#x27; Advanced Development and Research Facility (ADRF). Closed in 2005.
* Dallas, Texas, USA: Agere Optoelectronics South (OES), formerly Hermann Technologies. Acquired in 2000, closed in 2002.
* Irwindale, California, USA: Acquired by Emcore Corporation.
* Whitefield, India: Located in Bangalore, involved in ASIC design and software development.
* Raanana, Israel: This office was based on Modem-Art, a developer of advanced processor technology for 3G/UMTS mobile devices, which Agere acquired in 2005.
* China: Shanghai and Shenzhen.
* Nieuwegein, Netherlands: This former NCR / AT&amp;T / Lucent Technologies division known under the name WCND (Wireless Communication Network Division) was active in the development of Wi-Fi technology and closed in December 2004.
* Ascot, Berkshire, UK: R&amp;D and engineering site developing processor technology for GSM/GPRS/EDGE.
* Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain: Wafer fab. Manufacturing of 0.3, 0.35 and 0.5 micron CMOS devices. Closed in 2001.

While they are botanically fruits—classified as berries—they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish. Other varieties of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; are categorized as &quot;chili peppers&quot; when they are cultivated for their pungency, including some varieties of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;.

Peppers are native to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. Pepper seeds were imported to Spain in 1493 and then spread through Europe and Asia. Preferred growing conditions for bell peppers include warm, moist soil in a temperature range of .

==Nomenclature==

The name pepper was given by Europeans when Christopher Columbus brought the plant back to Europe. At that time, black pepper (peppercorns), from the unrelated plant &quot;Piper nigrum&quot; originating from India, was a highly prized condiment. The name &quot;pepper&quot; was applied in Europe to all known spices with a hot and pungent taste and was therefore extended to genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; when it was introduced from the Americas. The most commonly used name of the plant family &quot;chile&quot; is of Mexican origin, from the Nahuatl word &quot;chilli&quot;.

The terms bell pepper (US, Canada, Philippines), pepper or sweet pepper (UK, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Zimbabwe), and capsicum (Australia, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) are often used for any of the large bell-shaped peppers, regardless of their color. The fruit is simply referred to as a &quot;pepper&quot;, or additionally by color (&quot;green pepper&quot; or red, yellow, orange, purple, brown, black). In the Midland region of the U.S., bell peppers, either fresh or when stuffed and pickled, are sometimes called mangoes.

In some languages, the term paprika, which has its roots in the word for pepper, is used for both the spice and the fruit – sometimes referred to by their color (for example &quot;groene paprika&quot;, &quot;gele paprika&quot;, in Dutch, which are green and yellow, respectively). The bell pepper is called &quot;パプリカ&quot; (&quot;papurika&quot;) or &quot;ピーマン&quot; (&quot;pīman&quot;, from French &quot;piment&quot; pronounced with a silent &#x27;t&#x27;) in Japan. In Switzerland, the fruit is mostly called &quot;peperone&quot;, which is the Italian name of the fruit. In France, it is called &quot;poivron&quot;, with the same root as &quot;poivre&quot; (meaning &quot;pepper&quot;) or &quot;piment&quot;. In Spain it is called &quot;pimiento morrón&quot;, the masculine form of the traditional spice, &quot;pimienta&quot; and &quot;morrón&quot; (snouted) referring to its general shape. In South Korea, the word &quot;피망&quot; (&quot;pimang&quot; from the French &quot;piment&quot;) refers to green bell peppers, whereas &quot;파프리카&quot; (&quot;papeurika&quot;, from &quot;paprika&quot;) refers to bell peppers of other colors. In Sri Lanka, both the bell pepper and the banana pepper are referred to as a &quot;capsicum&quot; since the bell pepper has no Sinhalese translation. In Argentina and Chile, it is called &quot;morrón&quot;.
==Colors==

The most common colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. Other colors include brown, white, lavender, and dark purple, depending on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers, although the &quot;Permagreen&quot; variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. Therefore, mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Like the tomato, bell peppers are botanical fruits and culinary vegetables. Pieces of bell pepper are commonly used in garden salads and as toppings on pizza. There are many varieties of stuffed peppers prepared using hollowed or halved bell peppers. Bell peppers (and other cultivars of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;) may be used in the production of the spice paprika.

===Nutrition===
A raw red bell pepper is 94% water, 5% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat. A 100 gram (3.5 ounce) reference amount supplies 26 calories, and is a rich source of vitamin C containing 158% of the Daily Value (DV) vitamin A (20%), and vitamin B6 (23% DV), with moderate contents of riboflavin (12%), folate (12% DV), and vitamin E (11% DV). A red bell pepper supplies twice the vitamin C and eight times the vitamin A content of a green bell pepper.

The bell pepper is the only member of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; that does not produce capsaicin, a lipophilic chemical that can cause a strong burning sensation when it comes in contact with mucous membranes. Bell peppers are thus scored in the lowest level of the Scoville scale, meaning that they are not spicy. This absence of capsaicin is due to a recessive form of a gene that eliminates the compound and, consequently, the &quot;hot&quot; taste usually associated with the rest of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;. This recessive gene is overwritten in the Mexibelle pepper, a hybrid variety of bell pepper that produces small amounts of capsaicin (and is thus mildly pungent). Conversely, a mutant strain of habanero has been bred to create a heatless version called the &#x27;Habanada&#x27;. Sweet pepper cultivars produce non-pungent capsaicinoids. 

== Production ==
In 2020, global production of bell peppers was 36 million tonnes, led by China with 46% of the total, and secondary production by Mexico, Indonesia, and Turkey. The United States ranks 5th in total production, as it produces approximately 1.6 billion pounds annually.

<doc id="71944" wikidata="Q18175531" url="?curid=71944" title="Kidney bean">
<text>The kidney bean is a variety of the common bean (&quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;) named for its resemblance to a human kidney.

==Classification==
There are different classifications of kidney beans, such as:

*Red kidney bean (also known as: common kidney bean, rajma in India, surkh (red) lobia in Pakistan).
*Light speckled kidney bean (and long shape light speckled kidney bean).
*Red speckled kidney bean (and long shape light speckled kidney bean).
*White kidney bean (also known as cannellini in Italy and the UK, lobia in India, or safaid (white) lobia in Pakistan).

==Nutrition==
Kidney beans, cooked by boiling, are 67% water, 23% carbohydrates, 9% protein, and contain negligible fat. In a 100-gram reference amount, cooked kidney beans provide of food energy, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, folate (33% DV), iron (22% DV), and phosphorus (20% DV), with moderate amounts (10–19% DV) of thiamine, copper, magnesium, and zinc (11–14% DV).

==Dishes==

Red kidney beans are commonly used in chili con carne and are used in the cuisine of India, where the beans are known as &quot;rajma&quot; and Pakistan where they are called surkh lobia. Red kidney beans are used in southern Louisiana for the classic Monday Creole dish of red beans and rice. The smaller, darker red beans are also used, particularly in Louisiana families with a recent Caribbean heritage. In Jamaica, they are referred to as red peas. Small kidney beans used in La Rioja, Spain, are called &quot;caparrones&quot;. In the Netherlands and Indonesia, kidney beans are usually served as a soup called &quot;brenebon&quot;. In the Levant, a common dish consisting of kidney bean stew usually served with rice is known as &quot;fasoulia.&quot; To make bean paste, kidney beans are generally prepared from dried beans and boiled until they are soft, at which point the dark red beans are pulverized into a dry paste.

==Toxicity==

Red kidney beans contain relatively high amounts of phytohemagglutinin and thus are more toxic than most other bean varieties if not soaked and then boiled for at least 10 minutes. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin. Cooking at the lower temperature of , such as in a slow cooker, is insufficient to denature the toxin and has been reported to cause food poisoning. Canned red kidney beans, though, are safe to eat straight from the can, as they are cooked prior to being shipped. As few as five raw beans or a single undercooked kidney bean can cause severe nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pains.

<text>Tok Pisin ( , ; ), often referred to by English speakers as New Guinea Pidgin or simply Pidgin, is an English creole language spoken throughout Papua New Guinea. It is an official language of Papua New Guinea and the most widely used language in the country. In parts of the southern provinces of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro, and Milne Bay, the use of Tok Pisin has a shorter history and is less universal, especially among older people. 

Between five and six million people use Tok Pisin to some degree, though not all speak it fluently. Many now learn it as a first language, in particular the children of parents or grandparents who originally spoke different languages (for example, a mother from Madang and a father from Rabaul). Urban families in particular, and those of police and defence force members, often communicate among themselves in Tok Pisin, either never gaining fluency in a local language () or learning a local language as a second (or third) language after Tok Pisin (and possibly English). Over the decades, Tok Pisin has increasingly overtaken Hiri Motu as the dominant lingua franca among town-dwellers. Perhaps one million people now use Tok Pisin as a primary language. Tok Pisin is slowly &quot;crowding out&quot; other languages of Papua New Guinea.

==Name==
 originates from English &quot;talk&quot;, but has a wider application, also meaning &#x27;word, speech, language&#x27;. derives from the English word &quot;pidgin&quot;; the latter, in turn, may originate in the word &quot;business&quot;, which is descriptive of the typical development and use of pidgins as inter-ethnic trade languages.

While Tok Pisin&#x27;s name in the language is , it is also called &quot;New Guinea Pidgin&quot; in English. Papua New Guinean anglophones often call Tok Pisin &quot;Pidgin&quot; when speaking English. This usage of &quot;Pidgin&quot; differs from the term &quot;pidgin (language)&quot; as used in linguistics. &quot;Tok Pisin&quot; is not a pidgin in the latter sense, since it has become a first language for many people (rather than simply a &quot;lingua franca&quot; to facilitate communication with speakers of other languages). As such, it is considered a creole in linguistic terminology.

==Classification==
The Tok Pisin language is a result of Pacific Islanders intermixing, when people speaking numerous different languages were sent to work on plantations in Queensland and various islands (see South Sea Islander and blackbirding). The labourers began to develop a pidgin, drawing vocabulary primarily from English, but also from German, Malay, Portuguese, and their own Austronesian languages (perhaps especially Kuanua, that of the Tolai people of East New Britain).

This English-based pidgin evolved into Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (where the German-based creole Unserdeutsch was also spoken). It became a widely used lingua franca and language of interaction between rulers and ruled, and among the ruled themselves who did not share a common vernacular. Tok Pisin and the closely related Bislama in Vanuatu and Pijin in the Solomon Islands, which developed in parallel, have traditionally been treated as varieties of a single Melanesian Pidgin English or &quot;Neo-Melanesian&quot; language. The flourishing of the mainly English-based Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (despite the language of the metropolitan power being German) contrasts with Hiri Motu, the lingua franca of Papua, which was derived not from English but from Motu, the vernacular of the indigenous people of the Port Moresby area.

==Official status==
Along with English and Hiri Motu, Tok Pisin is one of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s three official languages. It is frequently the language of debate in the national parliament. Most government documents are produced in English, but public information campaigns are often partially or entirely in Tok Pisin. While English is the main language in the education system, some schools use Tok Pisin in the first three years of elementary education to promote early literacy.

==Regional variations==
There are considerable variations in vocabulary and grammar in various parts of Papua New Guinea, with distinct dialects in the New Guinea Highlands, the north coast of Papua New Guinea, and islands outside of New Guinea. For example, Pidgin speakers from Finschhafen speak rather quickly and often have difficulty making themselves understood elsewhere. The variant spoken on Bougainville and Buka is moderately distinct from that of New Ireland and East New Britain but is much closer to that than it is to the Pijin spoken in the rest of the Solomon Islands. 

There are 4 sociolects of Tok Pisin:
# (meaning &quot;talk of the remote areas&quot;) or (meaning &quot;talk of the people of the remote areas&quot;)
# (meaning &quot;language of the villages&quot;), the traditional rural Tok Pisin
# (meaning &quot;talk of the schools&quot;) or (meaning &quot;talk of the Towns&quot;), the urban Tok Pisin
# (meaning &quot;language of the colonizers&quot;, unsystematically simplified English with some Tok Pisin words

==Alphabet==
Tok Pisin&#x27;s alphabet has 21 letters, five of which are vowels, and four digraphs. The letters are (vowels in bold):
:a, b, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y

Three of the digraphs (, , and ) denote diphthongs, while the fourth, , is used for both and .

==Phonology==
Tok Pisin has a smaller number of phonemes than its lexifier language, English. It has around 24 core phonemes: 5 vowels and around 19 consonants. This varies with the local substrate languages and the speaker&#x27;s level of education. More educated speakers, and/or those where the substrate language(s) have larger phoneme inventories, may have as many as 10 distinct vowels.

Nasal plus plosive offsets lose the plosive element in Tok Pisin; e.g., English &quot;hand&quot; becomes Tok Pisin . Furthermore, voiced plosives become voiceless at the ends of words, so that English &quot;pig&quot; is rendered as in Tok Pisin.

===Consonants===

*Voiced plosives are pronounced by many speakers (especially of Melanesian backgrounds) as prenasalized plosives.
*, , and can be either dental or alveolar consonants, while is only alveolar.
*In most Tok Pisin dialects, the phoneme is pronounced as the alveolar tap or flap, . There can be variation between and .
*The labiodental fricatives may be marginal, with contrastive use present only in heavily Anglicized varieties. The use of vs. is variable. There is also variation between and in some words, such as / &#x27;five&#x27;.
*Likewise, there may be marginal use of .

===Vowels===
Tok Pisin has five pure vowels:
==Grammar==
The verb has a suffix, (&lt; Eng. &quot;him&quot;) to indicate transitivity (, &quot;look&quot;; , &quot;see&quot;). But some verbs, such as &quot;eat&quot;, can be transitive without it. Tense is indicated by the separate words Future (&lt; Eng. &quot;by and by&quot;) and (past) (&lt; Eng. &quot;been&quot;). The present progressive tense is indicated by the word ; e.g., &quot;He is eating&quot;.

The noun does not indicate number, though pronouns do.

Adjectives usually take the suffix (now often pronounced , though more so for pronouns, and for adjectives; from &quot;fellow&quot;) when modifying nouns; an exception is &quot;little&quot;. It is also found on numerals and determiners:
:Tok Pisin: → Eng. &quot;one&quot;
:Tok Pisin: → Eng. &quot;two&quot;
:Tok Pisin: → Eng. &quot;this bloke&quot;

Pronouns show person, number, and clusivity. The paradigm varies depending on the local languages; dual number is common, while the trial is less so. The largest Tok Pisin pronoun inventory is:

Reduplication is very common in Tok Pisin. Sometimes it is used as a method of derivation; sometimes words just have it. Some words are distinguished only by reduplication: &quot;ship&quot;, &quot;sheep&quot;.

There are only two proper prepositions: 
* the genitive preposition (etym. &lt; Eng. &quot;belong&quot;), which is equivalent to &quot;of&quot;, &quot;from&quot; and some uses of &quot;for&quot;: e.g. &quot;your key&quot;; &quot;They are from Gordon&#x27;s&quot;.
* the oblique preposition (etym. &lt; Eng. &quot;along&quot;), which is used for various other relations (such as locative or dative): e.g. . &quot;We went to the black market&quot;.

Some phrases are used as prepositions, such as &#x27;, &quot;in the middle of&quot;.

Several of these features derive from the common grammatical norms of Austronesian languages, usually in a simplified form. Other features, such as word order, are closer to English.

Sentences with a 3rd-person subject often put the word immediately before the verb. This may or may not be written separate from the verb, occasionally written as a prefix. Although the word is thought to be derived from &quot;he&quot; or &quot;is&quot;, it is not itself a pronoun or a verb but a grammatical marker used in particular constructions, e.g., is &quot;car forbidden here&quot;, i.e., &quot;no parking&quot;.

===Tense and aspect===
Past tense: marked by (&lt; Eng. &quot;been&quot;):
: Tok Pisin: 
: English: &quot;And the prime minister spoke thus.&quot;

Continuative same tense is expressed through: verb + .
: Tok Pisin: .
: English: &quot;He/She is sleeping.&quot;

Completive or perfective aspect expressed through the word (&lt; Eng. &quot;finish&quot;):
: Tok Pisin: 
: English: &quot;He had got out of the boat.&quot;

Transitive words are expressed through (&lt; Eng. &quot;him&quot;):
: Tok Pisin: 
: English: &quot;Finish your story now!&quot;

Future is expressed through the word &quot;&quot; (&lt; Eng. &quot;by and by&quot;):
: Tok Pisin: 
: English: &quot;If you take just any nails that happen to be around, those will rust.&quot;

==Development of Tok Pisin==
Tok Pisin developed out of regional dialects of the local inhabitants&#x27; languages and English, brought into the country when English speakers arrived. Four phases in Tok Pisin&#x27;s development were laid out by Loreto Todd.
# Casual contact between English speakers and local people developed a marginal pidgin.
# Pidgin English was used between the local people. The language expanded from the users&#x27; mother tongue.
# As the interracial contact increased, the vocabulary expanded according to the dominant language.
# In areas where English was the official language, a depidginization occurred (Todd, 1990).

Tok Pisin is also known as a &quot;mixed&quot; language. This means that it consists of characteristics of different languages. Tok Pisin obtained most of its vocabulary from English (i.e., English is its lexifier). The origin of the syntax is a matter of debate. Edward Wolfers claimed that the syntax is from the substratum languages—the languages of the local peoples. Derek Bickerton&#x27;s analysis of creoles, on the other hand, claims that the syntax of creoles is imposed on the grammarless pidgin by its first native speakers: the children who grow up exposed to only a pidgin rather than a more developed language such as one of the local languages or English. In this analysis, the original syntax of creoles is in some sense the default grammar humans are born with.

Pidgins are less elaborated than non-Pidgin languages. Their typical characteristics found in Tok Pisin are:

#A smaller vocabulary which leads to metaphors to supply lexical units:
#*Smaller vocabulary:
#*: = &quot;election&quot; (n) and &quot;vote&quot; (v)
#*: = &quot;heavy&quot; (adj) and &quot;weight&quot; (n)
#*Metaphors:
#*: (screw of the arm) = &quot;elbow&quot;
#*: (screw of the leg) = &quot;knee&quot; (Just almost always indicates the knee. In liturgical contexts, is &quot;kneel.&quot;)
#*: (grass of the head) = &quot;hair&quot; (Hall, 1966: 90f) (Most commonly just —see note on above.)
#*Periphrases:
#*: (literally &quot;first child of Mrs Queen&quot;) = King Charles III, then known through his relation to the Queen.
#A reduced grammar: lack of copula, determiners; reduced set of prepositions, and conjunctions
#Less differentiated phonology: and are not distinguished in Tok Pisin (they are in free variation). The sibilants , , , , , and are also not distinguished.
#:All of the English words &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;peach&quot;, &quot;feast&quot;, &quot;piss&quot;, and &quot;peace&quot; would have been realised in Tok Pisin as . In fact, the Tok Pisin means &quot;fish&quot; (and usually has a sound closer to [], almost like the English word &quot;piss&quot;). English &quot;piss&quot; was reduplicated to keep it distinct: thus means &quot;urine&quot; or &quot;to urinate&quot;.
#:Likewise, in Tok Pisin could have represented English &quot;ship&quot;, &quot;jib&quot;, &quot;jeep&quot;, &quot;sieve&quot;, &quot;sheep&quot;, or &quot;chief&quot;. In fact, it means &quot;ship&quot;.

==Vocabulary==
Many words in the Tok Pisin language are derived from English (with Australian influences), indigenous Melanesian languages, and German (part of the country was under German rule until 1919). Some examples:
* = &quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;beginning&quot; (from &quot;ass&quot;/&quot;arse&quot;). = &quot;his birthplace&quot;. = &quot;the stump of a tree&quot;.

* = &quot;small boy&quot;; by extension, &quot;young man&quot; (probably from the English jocular/affectionate usage &quot;monkey&quot;, applied to mischievous children, although a derivation from the German , meaning &quot;little man&quot;, has also been suggested)

<text>In Nazi German terminology,  () were &quot;people whose language and culture had German origins but who did not hold German citizenship.&quot; The term is the nominalised plural of &quot;&quot;, with denoting a singular female, and , a singular male. The words &quot;Volk&quot; and &quot;völkisch&quot; conveyed the meanings of &quot;folk&quot;.

Ethnic Germans living outside Germany shed their identity as &quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot; (Germans abroad), and morphed into the in a process of self-radicalisation. This process gave the Nazi regime the nucleus around which the new Volksgemeinschaft was established across the German borders.

 were further divided into &quot;racial&quot; groupsminorities within a state minoritybased on special cultural, social, and historic criteria elaborated by the Nazis.

==Origin of the term &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;==
According to the historian Doris Bergen, Adolf Hitler coined the definition of which appeared in a 1938 memorandum of the German Reich Chancellery. That document defined as &quot;people whose language and culture had German origins but who did not hold German citizenship&quot;. After 1945, the Nazi citizenship laws of 1935 ()and the associated regulations that referred to the National Socialist concepts of blood and race in connection with the concept of &quot;volksdeutsch&quot;were rescinded in Germany.

For Adolf Hitler and the other ethnic Germans of his time, the term &quot;&quot; also carried overtones of blood and race not captured in the common English translation &quot;ethnic Germans&quot;. According to German estimates in the 1930s, about 30 million and Auslandsdeutsche (German citizens residing abroad) lived outside the Reich. A significant proportion of them were in Eastern Europe – i.e., Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states, and Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, where many were located in villages along the Danube and in Russia.

The Nazi goal of expansion assigned the a special role in German plans, to bring them back to German citizenship and to elevate them to power over the native populations in those areas. The Nazis detailed such goals in .
In some areas, such as in Poland, Nazi authorities compiled specific lists and registered people as ethnic Germans in the &quot;Deutsche Volksliste&quot;.

==Historical background==
In the sixteenth century Vasili III invited small numbers of craftsmen, traders and professionals to settle in Russia from areas that would later become Germany so that Muscovy could exploit their skills. These settlers (many of whom intended to stay only temporarily) were generally confined to the German Quarter in Moscow (which also included Dutch, British and other western or northern European settlers whom the Russians came to indiscriminately refer to as &quot;Germans&quot;). They were only gradually allowed in other cities, so as to prevent the spread of alien ideas to the general population.

In his youth, Peter the Great spent much time in the &#x27;German&#x27; quarter. When he became Tsar, he brought more German experts (and other foreigners) into Russia, and particularly into government service, in his attempts to westernise the empire. He also brought in German engineers to supervise the construction of the new city of Saint Petersburg.

Catherine the Great, herself ethnically German, invited Germanic farmers to immigrate and settle in Russian lands along the Volga River. She guaranteed them the right to retain their language, religion and culture.

Also in other areas with an ethnic German minority people of other than German descent assimilated with the ethnic German culture and formed then a part of the minority. Examples are people of Baltic and Scandinavian descent, who assimilated into the minority of the Baltic Germans. Jews of Posen province, Galicia, Bukovina and Bohemia, with their Yiddish culture derived in part from their German heritage, often mingled into the ethnic German culture, thus forming part of the various ethnic German minorities. But anti-Semitic Nazis later rejected Jewish ethnic Germans and all Jewish German citizens as &#x27;racially&#x27; German.

Ethnic Germans were also sent in organised colonisation attempts aiming at Germanisation of conquered Polish areas. Frederick the Great (reigned 1740–1786) settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia, acquired in the First Partition of Poland of 1772, with the intention of replacing the Polish nobility. He treated the Poles with contempt and likened the &quot;slovenly Polish trash&quot; in newly occupied West Prussia to Iroquois, the historic Native American confederacy based in what is now the state of New York.

Prussia encouraged a second round of colonisation with the goal of Germanisation after 1832. Prussia passed laws to encourage Germanisation of the Prussian Partition including the provinces of Posen and West Prussia in the late 19th century. The Prussian Settlement Commission relocated 154,000 colonists, including locals.

===Treaty of Versailles===
The reconstitution of Poland following the Treaty of Versailles (1919) made ethnic German minorities of some Prussian provinces of the German Empire citizens of the Polish nation state. Ethnic German inhabitants of provinces of the dissolved Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as Bukovina Germans, Danube Swabians, Sudeten Germans and Transylvanian Saxons, became citizens of newly established Slavic or Magyar nation-states and of Romania. Tensions between the new administration and the ethnic German minority arose in the Polish Corridor. The Austrian Germans also found themselves not allowed to join Germany as German Austria was strictly forbidden to join Germany as well as the name &quot;German Austria&quot; was forbidden so the name was changed back to just &quot;Austria&quot; and the First Austrian Republic was created in 1919.

==The Nazi era before World War II==
During the Nazi years, the German Nazis used the term &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, by which they meant racially German since they believed in a German &#x27;race&#x27; or &#x27;Volk&#x27;, to refer to foreign nationals of some German ethnicity living in countries newly occupied by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. Prior to World War II, more than 10 million ethnic Germans lived in Central and Eastern Europe. They constituted an important minority far into Russia. Because of widespread assimilation some people whom the Nazis called Volksdeutsche could no longer speak German and in fact were culturally regionalized as Poles, Hungarians, Romanians, Czechs, Slovaks, etc.

===Pre-war relations with the Nazis===
In 1931, prior to its rise to power, the Nazi party established the Auslandsorganisation der NSDAP/AO (Foreign Organisation of the Nazi Party), whose task it was to disseminate Nazi propaganda among the ethnic German minorities viewed as Volksdeutsche in Nazi ideology. In 1936, the government set up the &quot;Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle&quot; (Ethnic Germans&#x27; Liaison Office), commonly known as VoMi, under the jurisdiction of the SS as the liaison bureau. It was headed by SS-Obergruppenführer Werner Lorenz.

According to the historian Valdis Lumans,
:&quot;[one of Himmler&#x27;s goals was] centralising control over the myriad of groups and individuals inside the Reich promoting the Volksdeutsche cause. Himmler did not initiate the process but rather discovered it in progress and directed it to its conclusion and to his advantage. His principal instrument in this effort was an office from outside the SS, a Nazi party organ, the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi), translated as the Ethnic German Liaison Office.&quot;

===Internal propaganda===
Nazi propaganda used the existence of ethnic Germans who they called in foreign lands before and during the war, to help justify the aggression of Nazi Germany. The annexation of Poland was presented as necessary to protect the ethnic German minorities there. Massacres of ethnic Germans, such as Bloody Sunday, or alleged atrocities, were used in such propaganda, and the film &quot;Heimkehr&quot; drew on such putative events as the rescue of by the arrival of German tanks. &quot;Heimkehr&quot;&#x27;s introduction explicitly states that hundreds of thousands of Poles of German ethnicity suffered as the characters in the film did.

&quot;Menschen im Sturm&quot; reprised &quot;Heimkehr&quot;&#x27;s effort to justify the invasion of Slavonia, using many of the same atrocities. In &quot;The Red Terror&quot;, a Baltic German is able to avenge her family&#x27;s deaths, but commits suicide after, unable to live with meaning in the Soviet Union. &quot;Flüchtlinge&quot; depicted the sufferings of Volga German refugees in Manchuria, and how a heroic blond leader saved them; it was the first movie to win the state prize. &quot;Frisians in Peril&quot; depicted the suffering of a village of Volga Germans in the Soviet Union; it also depicted the murder of a young woman for an affair with a Russianin accordance with Nazi principle of Rassenschandeas an ancient German custom.

Sexual contact between what the Nazis viewed as different &#x27;races&#x27; followed by remorse and guilt was also featured in &quot;Die goldene Stadt&quot;, where the Sudeten German heroine faces not persecution but the allure of the big city; when she succumbs, in defiance of blood and soil, she is seduced and abandoned by a Czech, and such a relationship leads to her drowning herself.

===Collaboration with the Nazis===
Before and during World War II, some ethnic Germans gathered around local Nazi organizations (sponsored financially by the German Foreign Office), actively supported the Nazis in countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia. During the social and economic tensions of the Great Depression, some had begun to feel aggrieved with their minority status. They participated in espionage, sabotage and other Fifth column means in their countries of origin, trained and commanded by Abwehr. In November 1938 Nazi Germany organized German paramilitary units made out German minority members in Polish Pomerania that were to engage in diversion, sabotage as well as political murder and ethnic cleansing upon German invasion of Poland. Reich intelligence was actively recruiting ethnic Germans and the Nazi secret service &quot;SicherheitsDienst&quot; (SD) was forming them as early as October 1938 into armed unit that were to serve Nazi Germany.
Historian Matthias Fiedler typified ethnic German collaborationists as former &quot;nobodies&quot; whose major occupation was the expropriation of Jewish property. Heinrich Himmler remarked that whatever objections ethnic Germans might have against serving in the Waffen-SS, they would be forced into conscription in any case. According to head of recruitment for the Waffen SS, Gottlob Berger, no one in Germany or elsewhere cared for what happened with the ethnic Germans anyway, making forced recruitment easy to force upon ethnic German communities.

Among the indigenous populations in the Nazi-occupied lands, became a term of ignominy.

During the early years of the Second World War (i.e., before the US entered the war), a small number of Americans of German origin returned to Germany; generally they were immigrants or children of immigrants, rather than descendants of migrations more distant in time. Some of these enlisted and fought in the German army. 

==During World War II==
Ethnic Germans throughout Europe benefited financially during World War II from the Nazi policies of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and profited from the expulsion and murder of their non-German neighbors throughout Eastern Europe. For example, in Ukraine the directly participated in the Holocaust and were involved in deportation of local farmers and their families; figures like Arthur Boss from Odessa (Blobel&#x27;s right-hand man) or the Becker brothers became an integral part of the Nazi Holocaust machine.

===&#x27;Volksdeutsche&#x27; in German-occupied western Poland===
In September 1939 in German occupied Poland, an armed ethnic German militia called &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; (Self-Defence) was created. It organised the mass murder of Polish elites in Operation Tannenberg. At the beginning of 1940, the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; organization was disbanded, and its members transferred to various units of the SS, Gestapo and the German police. Throughout the invasion of Poland, some ethnic German minority groups assisted Nazi Germany in the war effort: they committed sabotage, diverted regular forces and committed numerous atrocities against civilian population.

After Germany occupied western Poland, it established a central registration bureau, called the German People&#x27;s List (&quot;Deutsche Volksliste&quot;, DVL), whereby Poles of German ethnicity were registered as . The German occupants encouraged such registration, in many cases forcing it or subjecting Poles of German ethnicity to terror assaults if they refused. Those who joined this group were given benefits including better food, as well as a better social status.

The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle organised large-scale looting of property and redistributed goods to the Volksdeutsche. They were given apartments, workshops, farms, furniture, and clothing confiscated from Jews and Poles. In turn, hundreds of thousands of the Volksdeutsche joined the German forces, either willingly or under compulsion.

During World War II, the Polish citizens of German ancestry that identified with the Polish nation faced the dilemma whether to register in the Deutsche Volksliste. Many families had lived in Poland for centuries and more-recent immigrants had arrived over 30 years before the war. They faced the choice of registering and being regarded as traitors by the Poles, or not signing and being treated by the Nazi occupation as traitors to the Germanic race. Polish Silesian Catholic Church authorities, led by bishop Stanisław Adamski and with agreement from the Polish Government in Exile, advised Poles to sign up to the Volksliste in order to avoid atrocities and mass murder that happened in other parts of the country.

In occupied Poland, &quot;Volksdeutscher&quot; enjoyed privileges and were subject to conscription, or draft, into the German army. In occupied Pomerania, the Gauleiter of the Danzig-West Prussia region Albert Forster ordered a list of people considered of German ethnicity to be made in 1941. Due to insignificant voluntary registrations by February 1942, Forster made signing the &quot;Volksliste&quot; mandatory and empowered local authorities to use force and threats to implement the decree. Consequently, the number of signatories rose to almost a million, or about 55% of the 1944 population.

The special case of Polish Pomerania, where terror against civilians was particularly intense, and where, unlike in rest of occupied Poland, signing of the list was mandatory for many people, was recognised by the Polish Underground State and other anti-Nazi resistance movements, which tried to explain the situation to other Poles in underground publications.

The Deutsche Volksliste categorised non-Jewish Poles of German ethnicity into one of four categories:

* Category I: Persons of German descent committed to the Reich before 1939.
* Category II: Persons of German descent who had remained passive.
* Category III: Persons of German descent who had become partly &quot;Polonised&quot;, e.g., through marrying a Polish partner or through working relationships (especially Silesians and Kashubians).
* Category IV: Persons of German ancestry who had become &quot;Polonised&quot; but were supportive of &quot;Germanisation&quot;.

Volksdeutsche of statuses 1 and 2 in the Polish areas annexed by Germany numbered 1 million, and Nos. 3 and 4 numbered 1.7 million. In the General Government there were 120,000 Volksdeutsche. Volksdeutsche of Polish ethnic origins were treated by the Poles with special contempt.

Because of actions by some and particularly the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, after the end of the war, the Polish authorities tried many for high treason. In the postwar period, many other ethnic Germans were expelled to the west and forced to leave everything. In post-war Poland, the word is regarded as an insult, synonymous with &quot;traitor&quot;.

In some cases, individuals consulted the Polish resistance first, before signing the Volksliste. There were who played important roles in intelligence activities of the Polish resistance, and were at times the primary source of information for the Allies. Particularly in Polish Pomerania and Polish Silesia, many of the people who were forced to sign the Volksliste played crucial roles in the anti-Nazi underground, which was noted in a memo to the Polish Government in Exile which stated &quot;In Wielkopolska there&#x27;s bitter hatred of the while in Silesia and Polish Pomerania it&#x27;s the opposite, the secret organization depends in large measure on the &quot; (the memo referred to those of Category III, not I and II). In the turmoil of the postwar years, the Communist government did not consider this sufficient mitigation. It prosecuted many double-agent and sentenced some to death.

=== Volksdeutsche in the territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939–1940 ===

The secret protocols of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact created domestic problems for Hitler. Supporting the Soviet invasion became one of the most ideologically difficult aspects of the countries&#x27; relationship. The secret protocols caused Hitler to hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, who had lived in the Baltic countries for centuries and now classified as Volksdeutsche, while officially condoning the invasions. When the three Baltic countries, not knowing about the secret protocols, sent letters protesting the Soviet invasions to Berlin, Ribbentrop returned them.

In August 1940, Soviet Foreign minister Molotov told the Germans that, with the government change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by September 1. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them North Bukovina. Germany wanted guarantees of the safety of property of ethnic Germans, security for the 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and North Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.

In October 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union negotiated about the Volksdeutsche in Soviet-occupied territories and their property. Instead of permitting full indemnification, the Soviets put restrictions on the wealth that the Volksdeutsche could take with them and limited the totals that the Soviets would apply to the Reich&#x27;s clearing accounts. The parties discussed total compensation of between and for the Volksdeutsche, while the Soviets requested for their property claims in German-occupied territories. The two nations reached general agreement on German shipments of 10.5-cm flak cannons, gold, machinery and other items.

On 10 January 1941, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement to settle all of the open disputes which the Soviets had argued. The agreement covered protected migration to Germany within two and a half months of Volksdeutsche, and similar migration to the Soviet Union of ethnic Russians, Baltic and &quot;White Russian&quot; &quot;nationals&quot; from German-held territories. In many cases, the resulting population transfers resulted in resettlement of Volksdeutsche on land previously held by ethnic Poles or Jews in now German-occupied territories. The agreement formally defined the border between Germany and the Soviet Union areas between the Igorka River and the Baltic Sea.

===After the German invasion of the USSR===

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the government granted the Volga Germans an autonomous republic. Joseph Stalin abolished the Volga German ASSR after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR. Most of Soviet Germans in the USSR were deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia by Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of August 28, 1941, and from the beginning of 1942 those Soviet Germans who were deemed suitable for hard work (men aged from 15 to 55 and women from 16 to 45) were mobilised for forced labour into &quot;Working columns&quot; where they lived in a prison-like environment, and sometimes, together with regular inmates, were put in prison camps. Hundreds of thousands died or became incapacitated due to the harsh conditions.

===Volksdeutsche in Hungary===
A significant portion of in Hungary joined the SS, which was a pattern repeated also in Romania (with 54,000 locals serving in the SS by the end of 1943). The majority of 200,000 from the area of Danube who served with the SS were from Hungary. As early as 1942, some 18,000 Hungarian Germans joined the SS. they have been called Danube Swabians. After World War II, approximately 185,000 in the Volksbund fled from the region. They were called &#x27;Svabo&#x27; by their Serbian, Hungarian, Croatian, and Romanian neighbors. Most of the Danube Swabians who were not members in the so-called &quot;Volksbund&quot; were expelled to Allied-occupied Germany and Allied-occupied Austria in 1946–1948, following the Potsdam Agreement.

===Volksdeutsche in Romania===
After Romania acquired parts of Soviet Ukraine, the Germans there came under the authority of the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, which deployed SS personnel to several settlements. They eventually contained German mayors, farms, schools and ethnic German paramilitary groups functioning as police called &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; (&quot;Self-protection&quot;). German colonists and &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; forces engaged in extensive acts of ethnic cleansing, massacring Jewish and Roma populations.

In the German colony of Shonfeld, Romas were burned in farms. During the winter of 1941/1942, German &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; units participated in the shooting, together with Ukrainian People&#x27;s Militia and Romanian gendarmes, of some 18,000 Jews. In the camp of Bogdanovka, tens of thousands of Jews were subject to mass shootings, barn burnings and killing by hand grenades.

Heinrich Himmler was sufficiently impressed by the Volksdeutsche communities and the work of the Selbstschutz to order that these methods be copied in Ukraine.

===&#x27;Volksdeutsche&#x27; in Serbia and Croatia ===

In the former Yugoslavia, the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen was formed with about 50,000 ethnic Germans from the Banat region of Serbia. It was conspicuous in its operations against the Yugoslav Partisans and civilian population. About 100,000 ethnic Germans from the Nazi-conquered former Yugoslavia joined the German Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, the majority conscripted involuntarily as judged by the Nuremberg Trials. Yet &quot;[a]fter the initial rush of Volksdeutsche to join, voluntary enlistments tapered off, and the new unit did not reach division size. Therefore, in August 1941, the SS discarded the voluntary approach, and after a favourable judgement from the SS court in Belgrade, imposed a mandatory military obligation on all Volksdeutsche in Serbia-Banat, the first of its kind for non-Reich Germans.&quot;In the former Yugoslavia a majority of ethnic Germans became members of the &quot;Schwäbisch-Deutscher Kulturbund&quot; (Swabian German Cultural Association), and reprisals on this group by Tito&#x27;s partisans resulted in many immediate revenge killings in 1944 and incarceration of approximately 150,000 ethnic Germans in 1945.

==Expulsion and exodus from Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the war==


Most ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from European countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary) under the Potsdam Agreement from 1945 to 1948 towards the end and after the war. Those who became ethnic Germans, by registering in the Deutsche Volksliste and Reichsdeutsche, retained German citizenship during the years of Allied military occupation. Citizenship was further retained after the establishment of East Germany and West Germany in 1949, and later in the reunified Germany. In 1953 the Federal Republic of Germany – by its Federal Expellee Law – naturalised many more East European nationals of German ethnicity, who were neither German citizens nor had enrolled in any &#x27;Volksliste&#x27;, but had been stranded as refugees in West Germany and fled or were expelled due to their German or alleged German ethnicity.

An estimated 12 million people fled or were expelled from the Soviet Union and non-German-speaking Central Europe, many of them being &#x27;Volksdeutsche&#x27;. Most left the Soviet-occupied territories of Central and Eastern Europe; they comprised the largest migration of any European people in modern history. The then three Allies had agreed to the expulsions during negotiations in the midst of war. The western powers hoped to avoid ethnic Germans being an issue again in Central and Eastern Europe. The three Allies at the Conference of Potsdam considered the &quot;transfer&quot; of &quot;German populations&quot; from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary an effort to be undertaken (see article 12 of the Potsdam Agreement), although they asked a halt because of the inflicted burden for the Allies to feed and house the destitute expellees and to share that burden among the Allies. France, which was not represented in Potsdam, rejected the decision of the Three of Potsdam and did not absorb expellees in its zone of occupation. The three Allies had to accept the reality on the ground, since expulsions of Volksdeutsche and Central and Eastern European nationals of German or alleged German ethnicity who never had enrolled as Volksdeutsche, were going on already.

Local authorities forced most of the remaining ethnic Germans to leave between 1945 and 1950. Remnants of the ethnic German community survive in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia. A significant ethnic German community has continued in Siebenbürgen (Transylvania) in Romania and in Oberschlesien (Upper Silesia) but most of it migrated to West Germany throughout the 1980s. There are also remnant German populations near Mukachevo in western Ukraine.

==Legacy==
The term Volksdeutsche is generally avoided today due to its usage by the Nazis.

Instead, ethnic Germans of foreign citizenship living outside of Germany are called &quot;Deutsche Minderheit&quot; (meaning &quot;German minority&quot;), or names more closely associated with their earlier places of residence, such as &quot;Wolgadeutsche&quot; or Volga Germans, the ethnic Germans living in the Volga basin in Russia; and Baltic Germans, who generally called themselves Balts, and &quot;Estländer&quot; in Estonia. They were relocated to German-occupied Poland during World War II by an agreement between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and most were expelled to the West after the war, under the Potsdam Agreement.

<text>John Arthur Johnson (March 31, 1878 – June 10, 1946), nicknamed the &quot;Galveston Giant&quot;, was an American boxer who, at the height of the Jim Crow era, became the first black world heavyweight boxing champion (1908–1915). His 1910 fight against James J. Jeffries was dubbed the &quot;fight of the century&quot;. Johnson defeated Jeffries, who was white, triggering dozens of race riots across the U.S. According to filmmaker Ken Burns, &quot;for more than thirteen years, Jack Johnson was the most famous and the most notorious African American on Earth&quot;. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential boxers in history. Transcending boxing, he became part of the culture and history of racism in the United States. 

In 1912, Johnson opened a successful and luxurious &quot;black and tan&quot; (desegregated) restaurant and nightclub, which in part was run by his wife, a white woman. Major newspapers of the time soon claimed that Johnson was attacked by the government only after he became famous as a black man married to a white woman, and was linked to other white women. Johnson was arrested on charges of violating the Mann Act—forbidding one to transport a woman across state lines for &quot;immoral purposes&quot;—a racially motivated charge that embroiled him in controversy for his relationships, including marriages. Sentenced to a year in prison, Johnson fled the country and fought boxing matches abroad for seven years until 1920, when he served his sentence at the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth.

Johnson continued taking paying fights for many years, and operated several other businesses, including lucrative endorsement deals. He died in a car crash in 1946 at the age of 68. In 2018, Johnson was posthumously pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump.

==Early life==
Johnson was born on March 31, 1878, the third child of nine born to Henry and Tina Johnson, former slaves who worked service jobs as a janitor and a dishwasher. His father had served as a civilian teamster of the Union&#x27;s 38th Colored Infantry. He was described by his son as the &quot;most perfect physical specimen that he had ever seen&quot;, although Henry had been left with an atrophied right leg from his service in the American Civil War. 

Growing up in Galveston, Texas, Johnson attended five years of school. As a young man, Johnson was frail, though, like all of his siblings, he was expected to work.

Although Johnson grew up in the South, he said that segregation was not an issue in the somewhat secluded city of Galveston, as everyone living in the 12th Ward was poor and went through the same struggles. Johnson remembers growing up with a &quot;gang&quot; of white boys, in which he never felt victimized or excluded. Remembering his childhood, Johnson said: &quot;As I grew up, the white boys were my friends and my pals. I ate with them, played with them and slept at their homes. Their mothers gave me cookies, and I ate at their tables. No one ever taught me that white men were superior to me.&quot;

 Jack Johnson&#x27;s mother Tina was a huge influence in Jack&#x27;s life. When Jack was younger he was known as a coward, and his sister Lucy would protect him. After Jack came home bruised and crying, his mom warned him that if he were to get beat at school, then she would whip him worse at home. Her method was to scare him and for him to learn the lesson that he needed to protect himself. The lesson was received by Jack, as he never lost a fight to a schoolboy again.

After Johnson quit school, he began a job working at the local docks. He made several other attempts at working other jobs around town until one day he made his way to Dallas, finding work at the race track exercising horses. Jack stuck with this job until he found a new apprenticeship with a carriage painter by the name of Walter Lewis. Lewis enjoyed watching friends spar, and Johnson began to learn how to box. Johnson later declared that it was thanks to Lewis that he became a boxer. 

At 16, Johnson moved to New York City and found living arrangements with Barbados Joe Walcott, a welterweight fighter from the West Indies. Johnson again found work exercising horses for the local stable, until he was fired for exhausting a horse. On his return to Galveston, he was hired as a janitor at a gym owned by German-born heavyweight fighter Herman Bernau. Johnson eventually saved enough money to buy boxing gloves, sparring every chance he got.

At one point, Johnson was arrested for brawling with a man named Davie Pearson, a &quot;grown and toughened&quot; man who accused Johnson of turning him in to the police over a game of craps. When both of them were released from jail, they met at the docks, and Johnson beat Pearson before a large crowd. Johnson then fought in a summer boxing league against a man named John &quot;Must Have It&quot; Lee. Because prizefighting was illegal in Texas, the fight was broken up and moved to the beach, where Johnson won his first fight and a prize of one dollar and fifty cents.

==Boxing career==
Johnson made his debut as a professional boxer on November 1, 1898, in Galveston, when he knocked out Charley Brooks in the second round of a 15-round bout, billed for &quot;The Texas State Middleweight Title&quot;. In his third pro fight on May 8, 1899, he faced &quot;Klondike&quot; (John W. Haynes, or Haines), an African American heavyweight known as &quot;The Black Hercules&quot;, in Chicago. Klondike (so called as he was considered a rarity, like the gold in the Klondike), who had declared himself the &quot;Black Heavyweight Champ&quot;, won on a technical knockout (TKO) in the fifth round of a scheduled six-rounder. The two fighters met twice again in 1900, with the first rematch resulting in a draw, as both fighters were on their feet at the end of 20 rounds. Johnson won the third fight by a TKO when Klondike refused to come out for the 14th round. Johnson did not claim Klondike&#x27;s unrecognized title.

===Johnson vs. Choynski===

On February 25, 1901, Johnson fought Joe Choynski in Galveston. Choynski, a popular and experienced heavyweight, knocked out Johnson in the third round. Prizefighting was illegal in Texas at the time and they were both arrested. Bail was set at $5,000, nearly $200,000 in 2023, which neither could afford. The sheriff permitted both fighters to go home at night so long as they agreed to spar in the jail cell. Large crowds gathered to watch the sessions. After 23 days in jail, their bail was reduced to an affordable level and a grand jury refused to indict either man. Johnson later stated that he learned his boxing skills during that jail time. The two would remain friends.

Johnson attested that his success in boxing came from the coaching he received from Choynski. The aging Choynski saw natural talent and determination in Johnson and taught him the nuances of defense, stating: &quot;A man who can move like you should never have to take a punch&quot;.

===Top contender===
Johnson beat former black heavyweight champion Frank Childs on October 21, 1902. Childs had twice won the black heavyweight title and continued to claim that he was the true black champion despite having lost his title in a bout with George Byers and then, after retaking the title from Byers, losing it again to Denver Ed Martin. He also claimed the unrecognized black heavyweight title as well. Johnson won by a TKO in the 12th round of the scheduled 20-rounder, when Childs&#x27;s seconds signaled he could not go on, claiming a dislocated elbow. The defeat by Johnson forever ended Childs&#x27;s pretensions to the black heavyweight crown.

===World colored heavyweight champ===

By 1903, though Johnson&#x27;s official record showed him with nine wins against three losses, five draws and two no contests, he had won at least 50 fights against both white and black opponents. Johnson won his first title on February 3, 1903, beating Denver Ed Martin on points in a 20-round match for the World Colored Heavyweight Championship. Johnson held the title until it was vacated when he won the world heavyweight title from Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia on Boxing Day 1908. His reign of 2,151 days was the third longest in the 60-year-long history of the colored heavyweight title. Only Harry Wills at 3,103 days and Peter Jackson at 3,041 days held the title longer. A three-time colored heavyweight champion, Wills held the title for a total of 3,351 days.

Johnson defended the colored heavyweight title 12 times, which was second only to the 26 times Wills defended the title. While colored champ, he defeated colored ex-champs Denver Ed Martin and Frank Childs again and beat future colored heavyweight champs Sam McVey three times and Sam Langford once. He beat Langford on points in a 15-rounder and never gave him another shot at the title, when he was either colored champ or the world heavyweight champ.

===Johnson vs. Jeanette &amp; Langford===
Johnson fought Joe Jeanette a total of seven times, all during his reign as colored champion before he became the world&#x27;s heavyweight champion, winning four times and drawing twice (three of the victories and one draw were newspaper decisions). In their first match in 1905, they had fought to a draw, but in their second match on November 25, 1905, Johnson lost as he was disqualified in the second round of a scheduled six-round fight. Johnson continued to claim the title because of the disqualification.

After Johnson became the first African-American Heavyweight Champion of the World on December 26, 1908, his World Colored Heavyweight Championship was vacated. Jeanette fought Sam McVey for the title in Paris on February 20, 1909, and was beaten, but he later took the title from McVey in a 49-round bout on April 17 of that year in Paris for a $6,000 purse. Sam Langford subsequently claimed the title during Jeanette&#x27;s reign after Johnson refused to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against him. Eighteen months later, Jeanette lost the title to Langford.

During his reign as world champion, Johnson never again fought Jeanette, despite numerous challenges, and avoided Langford, who won the colored title a record five times. In 1906 Jack Johnson fought Sam Langford. Langford took severe punishment and was knocked down 3 times; however, he lasted the 15-round distance.

On November 27, 1945, Johnson finally stepped back into the ring with Joe Jeanette. The 67-year-old Johnson squared off against the 66-year-old Jeanette in an exhibition held at a New York City rally to sell war bonds. Fellow former colored heavyweight champ Harry Wills also participated in the exhibition.

===World heavyweight champion===
Johnson&#x27;s efforts to win the world heavyweight title were initially thwarted, as at the time world heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries refused to face him, and retired instead. However, Johnson did fight former champion Bob Fitzsimmons in July 1907, and knocked him out in two rounds.

Johnson finally won the world heavyweight title on December 26, 1908, a full six years after lightweight champion Joe Gans became the first African American boxing champion. Johnson&#x27;s victory over the reigning world champion, Canadian Tommy Burns, at the Sydney Stadium in Australia, came after following Burns around the world for two years and taunting him in the press for a match. Burns agreed to fight Johnson only after promoters guaranteed him $30,000. The fight lasted fourteen rounds before being stopped by the police in front of over 20,000 spectators, and Johnson was named the winner.
After Johnson&#x27;s victory over Burns, racial animosity among whites ran so deep that some, including renowned American author Jack London, called for a &quot;Great White Hope&quot; to take the title away from Johnson. While Johnson was heavyweight champion, he was covered more in the press than all other notable black men combined. The lead-up to the bout was peppered with racist press against Johnson. An editorial in the &quot;New York Times&quot; (&quot;Pugilists as Race Champions&quot;) expressed a concern that the fight would &quot;have the deplorable effect of intensifying racial antagonisms and of making race problems more difficult of solution&quot;: If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbors. If the negro loses, the members of his race will be taunted and irritated [provoked] because of their champion&#x27;s downfall.As title holder, Johnson thus had to face a series of fighters each billed by boxing promoters as a &quot;great white hope&quot;, often in exhibition matches. In 1909, he beat Tony Ross, Al Kaufman, and the middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel.

Ketchel and Johnson were friends. The match with Ketchel was originally thought to have been an exhibition, and in fact it was fought by both men that way, until the 12th round, when Ketchel threw a right to Johnson&#x27;s head, knocking him down. Quickly regaining his feet, and very annoyed, Johnson immediately dashed straight at Ketchell and threw a single punch, an uppercut, a punch for which he was famous, to Ketchel&#x27;s jaw, knocking him out. The punch knocked out Ketchell&#x27;s front teeth; Johnson can be seen on film removing them from his glove, where they had been embedded.

===&quot;Fight of the Century&quot;===

In 1910, former undefeated heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries came out of retirement to challenge Johnson, saying &quot;I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a Negro&quot;. He had not fought in six years and he also had to lose well over 100 pounds to get back to his championship fighting weight. Efforts to persuade Jeffries to &quot;retrieve the honor of the white race&quot; began immediately after the Burns–Johnson fight. Initially Jeffries had no interest in the fight, being quite happy as an alfalfa farmer. On October 29, 1909, Johnson and Jeffries signed an agreement to &quot;box for the heavyweight championship of the world&quot; and called promoters to bid for the right to orchestrate the event.

In early December 1909, Johnson and Jeffries selected a bid from the nation&#x27;s top boxing promoters — Tex Rickard and John Gleason. The bid guaranteed a purse of $101,000 () to be divided 75 percent to the winner and 25 percent to the loser, as well as two-thirds of the revenues collected from the sales of the right to film the fight (each boxer received one third of the equity rights). Although it was well understood that a victory for Jeffries was likely to be more profitable than a victory for Johnson, there were no doubts that either way the event would produce record profits. Legal historian Barak Orbach argues that in &quot;an industry that promoted events through the dramatization of rivalries, a championship contest between an iconic representative of the white race and the most notorious [black fighter] was a gold mine&quot;.
Jeffries mostly remained hidden from media attention until the day of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. John L. Sullivan, who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he would only lose if he had a lack of skill on the day of the fight. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, &quot;It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible&quot;. While his wife added, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband&#x27;s welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s words were &quot;May the best man win&quot;.

Racial tension was brewing in the lead up to the fight and to prevent any harm from coming to either boxer, guns were prohibited within the arena along with the sale of alcohol and anyone who was under the effects of alcohol. Apples and all other potential weapons were barred. Behind the racial attitudes which were being instigated by the media was a major investment in gambling for the fight, with 10–7 odds in favor of Jeffries.

The fight took place on July 4, 1910, in front of 20,000 people, at a ring which was built just for the occasion in downtown Reno, Nevada. Jeffries proved unable to impose his will on the younger champion and Johnson dominated the fight. By the 15th round, after Jeffries had been knocked down twice for the first time in his career, Jeffries&#x27; corner threw in the towel to end the fight and prevent Jeffries from having a knockout on his record.

Johnson later remarked he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an uppercut and saw the look on Jeffries face, stating, &quot;I knew what that look meant. The old ship was sinking&quot;. Afterwards, Jeffries was humbled by the loss and what he had seen of Johnson in their match. &quot;I could never have whipped Johnson at my best&quot;, Jeffries said. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t have hit him. No, I couldn&#x27;t have reached him in 1,000 years&quot;.

The &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; earned Johnson $65,000 (over $ million in dollars) and silenced the critics, who had belittled Johnson&#x27;s previous victory over Tommy Burns as &quot;empty&quot;, claiming that Burns was a false champion since Jeffries had retired undefeated. John L. Sullivan commented after the fight that Johnson won deservedly, fairly and convincingly,

====Riots and aftermath====
The outcome of the fight triggered race riots that evening—the Fourth of July—all across the United States, from Texas and Colorado to New York and Washington, D.C. Johnson&#x27;s victory over Jeffries had dashed white dreams of finding a &quot;great white hope&quot; to defeat him. Many whites felt humiliated by the defeat of Jeffries.

Black Americans, on the other hand, were jubilant and celebrated Johnson&#x27;s great victory as a victory for racial advancement. Black poet William Waring Cuney later highlighted the black reaction to the fight in his poem &quot;My Lord, What a Morning&quot;.

Race riots, initiated by whites and blacks, erupted in New York, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Atlanta, St. Louis, Little Rock and Houston. In all, riots occurred in more than 25 states and 50 cities. At least twenty people were killed in the riots and hundreds more were injured.

====Film of the bout====
&quot;The Johnson–Jeffries Fight&quot; film received more public attention in the United States than any other film to date and for the next five years, until the release of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. In the United States, many states and cities banned the exhibition of the Johnson–Jeffries film. The movement to censor Johnson&#x27;s victory took over the country within three days after the fight.

Two weeks after the match former President Theodore Roosevelt, an avid boxer and fan, wrote an article for &quot;The Outlook&quot; in which he supported banning not just moving pictures of boxing matches, but a complete ban on all prize fights in the US. He cited the &quot;crookedness&quot; and gambling that surrounded such contests and that moving pictures have &quot;introduced a new method of money getting and of demoralization&quot;. The controversy surrounding the film motivated Congress to ban distribution of all prizefight films across state lines in 1912; the ban was lifted in 1940.

In 2005, the film of the Jeffries–Johnson &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; was entered into the United States National Film Registry as being worthy of preservation.

The six fights for which the major films were made, starring Johnson, were
# Johnson–Burns, released in 1908
# Johnson–Ketchel, released in 1909
# Johnson–Jeffries, released in 1910
# Johnson–Flynn, released in 1912
# Johnson–Moran, released in 1914
# Johnson–Willard, released in 1915

===Maintaining the Color Bar===
The color bar remained in effect even under Johnson. Once he was the world&#x27;s heavyweight champ, Johnson did not fight a black opponent for the first five years of his reign. He denied matches to black heavyweights Joe Jeanette, one of his successors as colored heavyweight champ, Sam Langford, who beat Jeanette for the colored title and the young Harry Wills, who was colored heavyweight champ during the last year of Johnson&#x27;s reign as world&#x27;s heavyweight champ.

Blacks were not given a chance at the title because Johnson maintained that he could make more money fighting white boxers. In August 1913, as Johnson neared the end of his reign as world heavyweight champ, there were rumors that he had agreed to fight Langford in Paris for the title, but it did not happen. Johnson alleged that Langford was unable to raise the $30,000 for his guarantee.

Because black boxers with the exception of Johnson had been barred from fighting for the heavyweight championship, Johnson&#x27;s refusal to fight African-Americans offended the African-American community since the opportunity to fight top white boxers was rare. Jeanette criticized Johnson, saying, &quot;Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people.&quot;

====Johnson v. Johnson====
When Johnson finally agreed to take on a black opponent in late 1913, it was not Sam Langford the current colored heavyweight champ that he gave the title shot to. Instead, Johnson chose to take on Battling Jim Johnson, a lesser-known boxer who in 1910 had lost to Langford and had a draw and loss via KO to Sam McVey, the former colored champ. Battling Jim fought former colored champ Joe Jeanette four times between July 19, 1912, and January 21, 1913, and lost all four fights. The only fighter of note who he did beat during that period was the future colored champ Big Bill Tate, whom he KO-ed in the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout. It was Tate&#x27;s third pro fight.

In November 1913, the International Boxing Union had declared the world heavyweight title held by Jack Johnson to be vacant. The fight, scheduled for 10 rounds, was held on December 19, 1913, in Paris. It was the first time in history that two blacks had fought for the world heavyweight championship.

While the Johnson v. Johnson fight had been billed as a world heavyweight title match, in many ways, it resembled an exhibition. A sportswriter from the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; at the fight reported that the crowd became unruly when it was apparent that neither boxer was putting up a fight.

Jack Johnson, the heavyweight champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, met in a 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested throughout that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson&#x27;s left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that it was observed that he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.

Because of the draw, Jack Johnson kept his championship. After the fight, he explained that his left arm was injured in the third round and he could not use it.

===Title loss===

On April 5, 1915, Johnson lost his title to Jess Willard, a working cowboy from Kansas who started boxing when he was 27 years old. With a crowd of 25,000 at Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba, Johnson was knocked out in the 26th round of the scheduled 45 round fight. Johnson, although having won almost every round, began to tire after the 20th round, and was visibly hurt by heavy body punches from Willard in rounds preceding the 26th-round knockout.

Johnson is said by many a year after the fight to have spread rumors that he took a dive, but Willard is widely regarded as having won the fight outright. Many people thought Johnson purposely threw the fight because Willard was white, in an effort to have his Mann Act charges dropped. Willard ironically responded, &quot;If he was going to throw the fight, I wish he&#x27;d done it sooner. It was hotter than hell out there.&quot;

===Post-championship===
After losing his world heavyweight championship, Johnson never again fought for the world or colored heavyweight crowns. His popularity remained strong enough that he recorded for Ajax Records in the 1920s. Johnson continued fighting, but age was catching up with him. He fought professionally until 1938 at age 60 when he lost 7 of his last 9 bouts, losing his final fight to Walter Price by a 7th-round TKO. It is often suggested that any bouts after the age of 40—which was a very venerable age for boxing in those days—not be counted on his actual record, since he was performing in order to make a living.

He also indulged in what was known as &quot;cellar&quot; fighting, where the bouts, unadvertised, were fought for private audiences, usually in cellars or other unrecognized places. There are surviving photographs of one of these fights. Johnson made his final ring appearance at age 67 on November 27, 1945, fighting three one-minute exhibition rounds against two opponents, Joe Jeanette and John Ballcort, in a benefit fight card for U.S. War Bonds.

==Boxing style==
Throughout his career, Johnson built a unique fighting style of his own, which was not customary in boxing during this time. Though he would typically strike first, he would fight defensively, waiting for his opponents to tire out, becoming more aggressive as the rounds went on. He often fought to punish his opponents over the course of the bout rather than going for the knockout, and would continuously dodge their punches. He would then quickly strike back with a blow of his own. Johnson often made his fights look effortless, and as if he had much more to offer, but when pushed he could also display some powerful moves and punches. There are films of his fights in which he can be seen holding up his opponent, who otherwise might have fallen, until he recovered.

==Personal life==

Johnson earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and had several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to an auto race at the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn dirt track. Oldfield easily defeated Johnson. Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket, he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he could not make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change as he was going to make his return trip at the same speed. In 1920, Johnson opened the Club Deluxe, a Black and Tan night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.

Johnson&#x27;s behavior was looked down upon by some in the African-American community, especially by the black scholar Booker T. Washington, who said it &quot;is unfortunate that a man with money should use it in a way to injure his own people, in the eyes of those who are seeking to uplift his race and improve its conditions, I wish to say emphatically that Jack Johnson&#x27;s actions did not meet my personal approval and I am sure they do not meet with the approval of the colored race.&quot;

Johnson flouted conventions regarding the social and economic &quot;place&quot; of blacks in American society. As a black man, he broke a powerful taboo in consorting with white women and would verbally taunt men (both white and black) inside and outside the ring. When asked the secret of his staying power by a reporter who had watched a succession of women parade into, and out of, the champion&#x27;s hotel room, Johnson supposedly said &quot;Eat jellied eels and think distant thoughts&quot;.

In 1911, Johnson, through an acquaintance, attempted to become a Freemason in Dundee, Scotland. He was initiated as an Entered Apprentice at Forfar and Kincardine Lodge No 225 in the city. However, there was some opposition to his membership from within the lodge, but mainly from the Grand Lodge who tried to stop the initiation from going ahead due to most Grand Lodges in the USA threatening to withdraw their Scottish Grand Lodge representation if it did. The Forfarshire Lodge was suspended by the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and Johnson&#x27;s fees were returned to him and his admission was ruled illegal.

In July 1912, Johnson opened an interracial nightclub in Chicago called Café de Champion.

Johnson wrote two memoirs of his life: &quot;Mes combats&quot; in 1914 and &quot;Jack Johnson in the Ring and Out&quot; in 1927.

In 1943, Johnson attended at least one service at the Pentecostal Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, California. In a public conversion, while Detroit, Michigan, burned in race riots, he professed his faith to Christ in a service conducted by evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. She embraced him as &quot;he raised his hand in worship&quot;.

===Marriages===
Johnson engaged in various relationships, including three documented marriages. All of his documented wives were white. At the height of his career, Johnson was excoriated by the press for his flashy lifestyle and for having married white women.

According to Johnson&#x27;s 1927 autobiography, he married Mary Austin, a black woman from Galveston, Texas. No record exists of this marriage.

While in Philadelphia in 1903, Johnson met Clara Kerr, a black prostitute. According to Johnson&#x27;s autobiography, Kerr left him for Johnson&#x27;s friend, a racehorse trainer named William Bryant. They stole Johnson&#x27;s jewelry and clothing when they left. Johnson tracked the couple down and had Kerr arrested on burglary charges. Johnson and Kerr reconciled for a while before she left him again.

During a three-month tour of Australia in 1907, Johnson had a brief affair with Alma &quot;Lola&quot; Toy, a white woman from Sydney. Johnson confirmed to an American journalist that he intended to marry Toy. When &quot;The Referee&quot; printed Johnson&#x27;s plans to marry Toy, it caused controversy in Sydney. Toy demanded a retraction and later won a libel lawsuit from the newspaper.

After returning from Australia, Johnson said that &quot;the heartaches which Mary Austin and Clara Kerr caused me led me to forswear colored women and to determine that my lot henceforth would be cast only with white women.&quot;

Johnson met Etta Terry Duryea, a Brooklyn socialite and former wife of Clarence Duryea, at a car race in 1909. In 1910, Johnson hired a private investigator to follow Duryea after suspecting she was having an affair with his chauffeur. On Christmas Day, Johnson confronted Duryea and beat her to the point of hospitalization. They reconciled and were married on January 18, 1911. Prone to depression, her condition worsened due to Johnson&#x27;s abuse and infidelity in addition to the hostile reaction to their interracial relationship. Duryea attempted suicide twice before she died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on September 11, 1912.

In the summer of 1912, Johnson met Lucille Cameron, an 18-year-old prostitute from Minneapolis who relocated to Chicago, at his nightclub Café de Champion. Johnson hired her as his stenographer, but shortly after Duryea&#x27;s funeral, they were out in public as a couple. They married on December 3, 1912, at 3:00 p.m. Cameron filed for divorce in 1924 due to his infidelity.

Johnson met Irene Pineau at the race track in Aurora, Illinois, in 1924. After she divorced her husband the following year, they were married in Waukegan in August 1925. Johnson and Pineau were together until his death in 1946. When asked by a reporter at Johnson&#x27;s funeral what she had loved about him, she replied: &quot;I loved him because of his courage. He faced the world unafraid. There wasn&#x27;t anybody or anything he feared.&quot;

===Prison sentence===

On October 18, 1912, Johnson was arrested on the grounds that his relationship with Lucille Cameron violated the Mann Act against &quot;transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes&quot; due to her being an alleged prostitute. Her mother also swore that her daughter was insane. Cameron, soon to become his second wife, refused to cooperate and the case fell apart.

Less than a month later, Johnson was arrested again on similar charges. This time, the woman, another alleged prostitute named Belle Schreiber, with whom he had been involved in 1909 and 1910, testified against him. In the courtroom of Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the future Commissioner of Baseball who perpetuated the baseball color line until his death, Johnson was convicted by an all-white jury in June 1913, although the incidents used to convict him took place before passage of the Mann Act. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.

Johnson skipped bail and left the country, joining Lucille in Montreal on June 25, before fleeing to France. To flee to Canada, Johnson posed as a member of a black baseball team. They lived in exile in Europe, South America, and Mexico for the next seven years. Johnson returned to the U.S. on July 20, 1920. He surrendered to federal agents at the Mexican border and was sent to the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, to serve his sentence in September 1920. He was released on July 9, 1921.

==== Presidential pardon ====
President Donald Trump granted Johnson a posthumous presidential pardon after recurring proposals to grant one had not been acted on by previous administrations. In April 2018, Trump announced that he was considering granting a full pardon to Johnson on the advice of actor Sylvester Stallone. Trump pardoned Johnson on May 24, 2018, 105 years after his conviction, during a ceremony which included special guests Sylvester Stallone (actor), Deontay Wilder (then current WBC Champion), Lennox Lewis (WBC Former Champion), Mauricio Sulaiman (WBC President), Linda Bell Haywood (Johnson&#x27;s great-great niece), and Hector Sulaiman (President of the Board of Advisors of Scholas Occurrentes).

WBC president Jose Sulaiman had reached out to presidential administrations dating back to Ronald Reagan&#x27;s requesting a pardon. A bill which requested that President George W. Bush pardon Johnson passed the House in 2008, but failed to pass in the Senate. In April 2009, Senator John McCain, along with Representative Peter King, film maker Ken Burns, and Johnson&#x27;s great-niece, Linda Haywood, requested a presidential pardon for Johnson from President Barack Obama. In July of that year, Congress passed a resolution calling on President Obama to issue a pardon.

In 2016, another petition for Johnson&#x27;s pardon was issued by McCain, King, Senator Harry Reid, and Congressman Gregory Meeks to President Obama, marking the 70th anniversary since the boxer&#x27;s death. This time, the petitioners cited a provision of the Every Student Succeeds Act, signed by the president in December 2015, in which Congress expressed that this boxing great should receive a posthumous pardon, and a vote by the United States Commission on Civil Rights passed unanimously a week earlier in June 2016 to &quot;right this century-old wrong.&quot;

Mike Tyson, Harry Reid, and John McCain lent their support to the campaign, starting a Change.org petition asking President Obama to posthumously pardon the world&#x27;s first African American heavyweight boxing champion for his racially motivated 1913 felony conviction.

===Monkey wrench===
A persistent hoax on social media claims that Johnson invented the monkey wrench and it was named a &quot;monkey&quot; wrench as a racial slur. Johnson did receive a patent for improvements which he made to the monkey wrench, but the name &quot;monkey wrench&quot; and the first patent for it predate his birth by over 35 years.

==Death==
On June 10, 1946, Johnson and a friend were en route to New York from Texas and visited a segregated diner; when the diner refused to serve him, Johnson drove away angrily with his friend in the passenger seat. The car collided with a telegraph pole on U.S. Highway 1 near Franklinton, North Carolina. While his friend survived the crash, Johnson suffered fatal injuries and died later that day at St. Agnes Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina, which was the nearest black hospital, at 6:10 pm. He was 68 years old.

Johnson was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago next to his first wife, Etta Duryea Johnson, who committed suicide in 1912. His grave was initially unmarked, but was later marked with a large tombstone which says only &quot;Johnson&quot;. An additional marker was added after filmmaker Ken Burns released a film about Johnson&#x27;s life in 2005. Johnson&#x27;s new, smaller gravestone reads: &quot;Jack / John A. Johnson. 18781946. First black heavyweight champion of the world.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s signature is on the back of the stone.

==Legacy==
Johnson was an inaugural 1954 inductee to &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987), and was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2005, the United States National Film Preservation Board deemed the film of the 1910 Johnson-Jeffries fight &quot;historically significant&quot; and put it in the National Film Registry.

During his boxing career, Jack Johnson fought 114 fights, winning 80 matches, 45 by knockouts. He also had the longest professional career of any world heavyweight boxing champion, having boxed for over 33 years from 1897 to 1931 (12,231 days). This record was beaten by Roy Jones Jr. in 2023, who has boxed for more than 33 years since 1989 (12,384 days).

Muhammad Ali often spoke of how he was influenced by Jack Johnson. Ali identified with Johnson because he felt America ostracized him in the same manner because of his opposition to the Vietnam War and affiliation with the Nation of Islam.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Jack Johnson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. In 2012, the City of Galveston dedicated a park in Johnson&#x27;s memory as Galveston Island&#x27;s most famous native son. The park, called Jack Johnson Park, includes a life-size, bronze statue of Johnson.

Actor and professional wrestler Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson&#x27;s surname is an homage to Jack Johnson; his father, professional wrestler Rocky Johnson, was born with the surname &quot;Bowles&quot; and chose his ring name in honor of the boxer before making it his legal name.

===Popular culture===
The first filmed fight of Johnson&#x27;s career was his bout with Tommy Burns, which was turned into a contemporary documentary, &quot;The Burns-Johnson Fight&quot;, in 1908.

Folksinger and blues singer Lead Belly referenced Johnson in a song about the &quot;Titanic&quot;: &quot;Jack Johnson wanna get on board, Captain said I ain&#x27;t hauling no coal. Fare thee, Titanic, fare thee well. When Jack Johnson heard that mighty shock, mighta seen the man do the Eagle rock. Fare thee, Titanic, fare thee well&quot; (The Eagle Rock was a popular dance at the time). In 1969, American folk singer Jaime Brockett reworked the Lead Belly song into a satirical talking blues called &quot;The Legend of the S.S. Titanic.&quot; There is no convincing evidence that Johnson was in fact refused passage on the &quot;Titanic&quot; because of his race, as these songs allege.

In the trenches of World War One, Johnson&#x27;s name was used by British troops to describe the impact of German 150 mm heavy artillery shells which had a black color. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert:

 We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue at the top of the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there&#x27;s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.

Johnson&#x27;s story is the basis of the play &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; and its 1970 film adaptation, starring James Earl Jones as &quot;Jack Jefferson&quot; and Jane Alexander as his love interest. Both Jones and Alexander won Tonys and were nominated for Oscars.

Also in 1970, Jimmy Jacobs and Bill Cayton brought together much of the rare archive footage of Johnson which they had saved and restored, and made the film &quot;Jack Johnson&quot;, with Johnson&#x27;s words voiced by Brock Peters, and music by Miles Davis. Davis&#x27; score later became the 1971 album named after the boxer. It features the actor Peters (as Johnson) saying:

In 2005, filmmaker Ken Burns produced a two-part documentary about Johnson&#x27;s life, &quot;Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,&quot; based on the 2004 nonfiction book of the same name by Geoffrey C. Ward, and with music by Wynton Marsalis. The book won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year (2006).

Several Hip Hop activists have also reflected on Johnson&#x27;s legacy, most notably in the album &quot;The New Danger,&quot; by Mos Def, in which songs like &quot;Zimzallabim&quot; and &quot;Blue Black Jack&quot; are devoted to the artist&#x27;s pugilistic hero. In the closing track of the album &quot;Run the Jewels 3&quot;, &quot;A Report to the Shareholders / Kill Your Masters,&quot; Killer Mike of the Hip Hop duo Run the Jewels reinvokes Johnson&#x27;s image with the line: &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m Jack Johnson, I beat a slave catcher snaggletooth&quot;.&quot; Additionally, both Southern punk rock band This Bike is a Pipe Bomb and alternative country performer Tom Russell have songs dedicated to Johnson. Russell&#x27;s piece is both a tribute and a biting indictment of the racism Johnson faced: &quot;here comes Jack Johnson, like he owns the town, there&#x27;s a lot of white Americans like to see a man go down ... like to see a black man drown.&quot;

In Joe R. Lansdale&#x27;s 1997 short story &quot;The Big Blow,&quot; Johnson is featured fighting a white boxer brought in by Galveston, Texas&#x27;s boxing fans to defeat the African American fighter during the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. The story won a Bram Stoker Award and was expanded into a 2000 novel.

The book of poetry, &quot;The Big Smoke&quot; by Adrian Matejka, is inspired by Johnson&#x27;s voice and life and written in forms ranging from sonnets to prose poetry. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Poetry in 2013.

&quot;The Royale&quot;, a play by Marco Ramirez, uses the life of Jack Johnson as inspiration for its main character, Jay Jackson. It premiered in March 2016 at Lincoln Center Theater directed by Rachel Chavkin, and was nominated for a Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Play, Outstanding Director of a Play, and a Special Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Ensemble.

The book &quot;Crossing the Color Line: Stanley Ketchel&#x27;s Challenge for Jack Johnson&#x27;s Heavyweight Crown&quot;, written by Vernon Gravely and released in 2021, details Johnson&#x27;s fight with middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel.

The graphic novel &quot;The Original Johnson&quot; was written and drawn by Trevor Von Eeden, the first black artist ever hired by DC Comics, in 1976, and co-creator of their first original black super-hero, Black Lightning. &quot;The Original Johnson&quot; details Jack Johnson&#x27;s life from childhood up to his death, and was generally well received. A favorable quote from the NY Times graces the cover of both volumes.

The graphic novel &quot;Last On His Feet: Jack Johnson and the Battle of the Century&quot; by Adrian Matejka and Youssef Daoudi, to be released in 2023, chronicles Johnson vs. Jeffries, interspersing the fight with flashbacks to Johnson&#x27;s youth.

<doc id="71966" wikidata="Q11647" url="?curid=71966" title="Nine Inch Nails">
<text>Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN (stylized as NIИ), is an American industrial rock band formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1988. Its members are the singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer Trent Reznor and his frequent collaborator, Atticus Ross. Reznor was previously the only permanent member of the band until Ross became an official member in 2016. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989), was released via TVT Records. After disagreements with TVT in regard to how the album would be promoted, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP &quot;Broken&quot; (1992). The following albums, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Fragile&quot; (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.

Following a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released its fourth album &quot;With Teeth&quot; (2005). Following the release of the next album &quot;Year Zero&quot; (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Slip&quot; (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot; (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot; (2016) and &quot;Add Violence&quot; (2017) and their ninth album &quot;Bad Witch&quot; (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further installments in the &quot;Ghosts&quot; series: &quot;Ghosts V: Together&quot; and &quot;Ghosts VI: Locusts&quot;. The band announced a number of new projects in 2024 through their multimedia company With Teeth, and plan to embark on the Peel It Back Tour in 2025.

When touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005), and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2008) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band&#x27;s concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.

Nine Inch Nails has sold over 20 million records worldwide and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs &quot;Wish&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; in 1996. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while &quot;Spin&quot; magazine has described him as &quot;the most vital artist in music&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Nine Inch Nails No. 94 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Nine Inch Nails was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, after being nominated in 2014 (the band&#x27;s first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.

==History==
=== Formation (1987–1988) ===
While living in Cleveland in 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboards in the Exotic Birds, a synthpop band managed by John Malm Jr. Reznor became friends with Malm, who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios. Studio owner Bart Koster granted Reznor free access to the studio between bookings to record demos, commenting that it cost him nothing more than &quot;a little wear on [his] tape heads&quot;. Unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired, Reznor was inspired by Prince to play all instruments himself except drums, which he programmed electronically. He has continued to play most parts on Nine Inch Nails recordings ever since.

The first Nine Inch Nails performance took place at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio, on October 21, 1988. Soon after, following their live support of Skinny Puppy, Reznor aimed to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine demos, recorded live in November 1988 and collectively known as &quot;Purest Feeling&quot;, were released in revised form on the first studio album, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989). The overall sound on &quot;Purest Feeling&quot; is lighter than that of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar, as well as a heavier use of film samples.

Reznor chose the name &quot;Nine Inch Nails&quot; because it &quot;abbreviated easily&quot; rather than for &quot;any literal meaning&quot;. Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to refer to Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion with nine-inch spikes, or Freddy Krueger&#x27;s nine-inch fingernails. The Nine Inch Nails logo first appeared on the music video for their debut single, &quot;Down in It&quot;. Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the logo, inspired by Tibor Kalman&#x27;s typography on the Talking Heads album &quot;Remain in Light&quot;. The logo features the band&#x27;s initials, with the second N mirrored. Talpas, a native of Cleveland, continued to design Nine Inch Nails packaging until 1997.

===&quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1988–1991)===

Written, arranged, and performed by Reznor, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; first album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; debuted in 1989. It marked his first collaboration with Adrian Sherwood (who produced the lead single &quot;Down in It&quot; in London without meeting Reznor face-to-face) and Mark &quot;Flood&quot; Ellis. Reznor asked Sean Beavan to mix the demos of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, which had received multiple offers for record deals. He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails&#x27; live concerts for several years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band and singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Flood&#x27;s production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has made remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; and &quot;Sin&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Michael Azerrad described the album as &quot;industrial-strength noise over a pop framework&quot; and &quot;harrowing but catchy music&quot;; Reznor proclaimed this combination &quot;a sincere statement&quot; of &quot;what was in [his] head at the time&quot;. In fact, the song &quot;Down in It&quot; spent over two months on &quot;Billboard&quot; club-play dance chart. After spending 113 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; became one of the first independently released records to attain platinum certification.
Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. MTV aired the videos for &quot;Down in It&quot; and &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, but an explicit video for &quot;Sin&quot; was only released in partial form for &quot;Closure&quot;. The original version of the &quot;Down in It&quot; video ended with the implication that Reznor&#x27;s character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the FBI.

In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band members were asked on what shows they would like to appear. They jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that they would like to appear on &quot;Dance Party USA&quot;, since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.

In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the &quot;Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series&quot;, in which it toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists such as Peter Murphy and the Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; &quot;Rockbeat&quot; interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band&#x27;s early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.

===&quot;Broken&quot; (1992–1993)===

After a poor European reception opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses, the band returned to the US amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a commercially oriented band and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with Interscope Records and created Nothing Records:

We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren&#x27;t ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I&#x27;ve finally got this thing going but it&#x27;s dead. Flood and I had to record &quot;Broken&quot; under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn&#x27;t my doing. I didn&#x27;t know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.

In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed &quot;Le Pig&quot; by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson&#x27;s &quot;family&quot; murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. The band used it to record &quot;Broken&quot;, an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP&#x27;s sound. He characterized &quot;Broken&quot; as a guitar-based &quot;blast of destruction&quot;, and as &quot;a lot harder ... than &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;&quot;. The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from &quot;Broken&quot; earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP&#x27;s first single &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; from Woodstock &#x27;94, and the second single &quot;Wish&quot;. In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for &quot;Wish&quot;, Reznor joked that &quot;Wish&quot; became &quot;the only song to ever win a Grammy that says &#x27;fist fuck&#x27; in the lyrics.&quot; Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.

Peter Christopherson of the bands Coil and Throbbing Gristle directed a performance video for &quot;Wish&quot;, but the EP&#x27;s most controversial video accompanied &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;. The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of performance artist Bob Flanagan disrobed and lying on a machine that pleases, tortures, then (apparently) kills him. A third video for &quot;Pinion&quot;, partially incorporated into MTV&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Nation&quot; opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in bondage. Reznor and Christopherson compiled the three clips along with footage for &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot; and &quot;Gave Up&quot; into a longform music video titled &quot;Broken&quot;. It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles. A separate performance video for &quot;Gave Up&quot; featuring Richard Patrick and Marilyn Manson was filmed at Le Pig. A live recording of &quot;Wish&quot; was also filmed, and both videos appeared in &quot;Closure&quot;.

&quot;Broken&quot; was followed by the companion remix EP &quot;Fixed&quot; in late 1992. The only track that was left off the final version of the release is the remix of &quot;Last&quot;, produced by Butch Vig (the outro of the &quot;Last&quot; remix is heard in &quot;Throw This Away&quot;, which also includes Reznor&#x27;s remix of &quot;Suck&quot;). The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11 kHz file, &quot;NIN_LAST.AIFF&quot;, available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256 kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying &quot;I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn&#x27;t fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.&quot;

===&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1993–1997)===

Early ideas for &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; arose after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival&#x27;s concerts ended in September. Reznor elaborated the album&#x27;s themes into lyrics. Despite initially choosing to record the album in New Orleans, Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, in Los Angeles (known as the Manson Murder House) renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, the start of the making of both &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;.

Nine Inch Nails&#x27; second studio album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two, and is the band&#x27;s highest seller in the US, over four million copies, among five million worldwide. Influenced by Pink Floyd and by David Bowie&#x27;s music from the 1970s, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;&#x27;s diverse textures and moods depict a protagonist&#x27;s mental progress. Flood co-produced several tracks, while Alan Moulder mixed most, and later found more extensive production duties on future albums. Reznor invited Sean Beavan to work on &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. After contributing to remixes of Nine Inch Nails songs, such as &quot;Closer&quot;, Beavan mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; in 1996. &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, like &quot;Broken&quot;, was recorded at Le Pig Studios. &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; were singles. Two other tracks, &quot;Hurt&quot; and &quot;Piggy&quot;, though not singles, were issued to radio. Also in 1994, the band released the promotional single &quot;Burn&quot;, which Reznor produced, on the soundtrack of Oliver Stone film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. as well as a cover of the Joy Division song &quot;Dead Souls&quot; on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Crow&quot;, which went to number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

The music video for &quot;Closer&quot;, directed by Mark Romanek, was in MTV&#x27;s frequent rotation, although the network, deeming it too graphic, heavily censored the original. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig&#x27;s head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&amp;M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag. A radio edit that partially mutes the song&#x27;s explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.

Contemporary critics generally praised &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, now classed among the most important albums of the 1990s. In 2005, Spin ranked it 25th among the &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 200 among &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; named it the 80th &quot;Greatest American Album&quot;. It was ranked No. 488 in the book &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot; by Martin Popoff. In 2001 &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;; in 2010 the album was ranked No. 102 on their &quot;250 Best Albums of Q&#x27;s Lifetime (1986–2011)&quot; list. After &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;&#x27;s release, Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;, the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States and among the best-selling remix albums of all time. It contained contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, among others.

After &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;&#x27;s 1994 release, the live band supported it by embarking on the Self Destruct Tour. The stage set-up featured dirty curtains, rising and lowering for visuals shown during songs such as &quot;Hurt&quot;. The tour debuted the band&#x27;s grungy, messy image as the members appeared in ragged attire slathered in corn starch. Performances were violent and chaotic, band members often injuring themselves by attacking each other, diving into the crowd, and destroying their instruments to close. The widest mainstream audience was a mud-soaked performance at Woodstock &#x27;94, and seen by Pay-Per-View in up to 24 million homes. Enjoying mainstream success thereafter, Nine Inch Nails then performed amid greater production values, adding theatrical visual elements. Supporting acts on tour included the Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the &quot;Closure&quot; video documented highlights from the tour, including full live videos of &quot;Eraser&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot; and a one-take &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; clip directed by Peter Christoperson. In 1997 Reznor also produced the soundtrack to the David Lynch film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, which featured one new Nine Inch Nails song, &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot;. Around this time, Reznor&#x27;s studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer&#x27;s block prolonged the production of &quot;The Fragile&quot;.

===&quot;The Fragile&quot; (1998–2002)===

Five years elapsed between &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; and Nine Inch Nails&#x27; next studio album, &quot;The Fragile&quot;, which arrived as a double album in September 1999. &quot;The Fragile&quot; was conceived by making &quot;songwriting and arranging and production and sound design ... the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song.&quot; Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album&#x27;s track listing; the liner notes state that he &quot;provided final continuity and flow.&quot;

On the heels of the band&#x27;s previous successes, media anticipation surrounded &quot;The Fragile&quot; more than a year before its release, when it was already described as &quot;oft-delayed&quot;. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving generally positive reviews. &quot;Spin&quot; hailed &quot;The Fragile&quot; as the &quot;album of the year&quot;, whereas Pitchfork Media panned its &quot;melodramatic&quot; lyrics. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; in North America; &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; in the EU and Japan (on three separate discs); and &quot;Into the Void&quot; in Australia. Several songs from the album became regulars on alternative rock radio stations, however the album dropped to number 16 and slipped out of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 only a week after its release, resulting in the band setting a record for the biggest drop from number one, which has since been broken. Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.

Before the album&#x27;s release, the song &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize. Cinesexuality critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a &quot;scathing attack on the alternative music scene,&quot; particularly Reznor&#x27;s former friend and protégé Marilyn Manson. The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song&#x27;s music video, retitled &quot;Starsuckers, Inc.&quot; and performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden in 2000.

Reznor followed &quot;The Fragile&quot; with another remix album, &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot;, released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 &quot;Fragility&quot; tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot;. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc &quot;Still&quot;, containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music.

During the &quot;Fragility 2.0&quot; tour, Reznor suffered a heroin overdose in London in June 2000, forcing a gig which was to be played that night to be cancelled. The incident pushed Reznor into entering rehab, putting Nine Inch Nails on hold while he attempted to become sober.

In 2002, Johnny Cash covered the Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Hurt&quot; for his album, &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot;, to critical acclaim. After seeing the music video, which later won a Grammy, Reznor himself became a fan of the rendition:

I pop the video in, and wow ... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps ... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn&#x27;t mine anymore ... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning—different, but every bit as pure.

===&quot;With Teeth&quot; (2004–2006)===
A further six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails&#x27; fourth full-length album. &quot;With Teeth&quot; was released in May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor&#x27;s battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. &quot;With Teeth&quot; debuted on top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; second reign at number one with an album. The album&#x27;s package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band&#x27;s official MySpace page in advance of its release date.

Critical reception of the album was mostly positive: &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield described the album as &quot;vintage Nine Inch Nails&quot;. PopMatters condemned the album, claiming Reznor &quot;ran out of ideas.&quot;

A music video for the song &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot; premiered on the Nine Inch Nails official website in March 2005. Reznor released the source files for it in GarageBand format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song. He similarly released files for the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Only&quot; in a wider range of formats, including Pro Tools and ACID Pro. David Fincher directed a video for &quot;Only&quot; with primarily computer-generated imagery. The planned music video for its third single, &quot;Every Day Is Exactly the Same&quot;, was directed by Francis Lawrence but reportedly scrapped in the post-production stage. All three singles topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart.

Nine Inch Nails launched a North American arena tour in Autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Autolux and Death from Above 1979. Another opening act on the tour, hip-hop artist Saul Williams, performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor&#x27;s former home. The Nine Inch Nails live band completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The &quot;Beside You in Time&quot; tour documentary was released in February 2007 via three formats: DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The home video release debuted at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Music Videos and &quot;Billboard&quot; Comprehensive Music Videos charts in the United States.

===&quot;Year Zero&quot; (2006–2007)===

Nine Inch Nails&#x27; fifth studio album, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, was released on April 17, 2007, only two years after &quot;With Teeth&quot;, a marked change in the slow pace from the release of previous albums. With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, &quot;Year Zero&quot; is a concept album criticizing the United States government&#x27;s policies and their effect on the world fifteen years in the future. Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on Metacritic.

The story takes place in the United States in 2022, which has been termed &quot;Year 0&quot;, by the government, being the year America was reborn. It had suffered several major terrorist attacks, apparently by Islamic fundamentalists, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle, and in response, the government seized absolute control of the country. The government is a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano. The government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, making Americans who drink water apathetic and carefree. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative. In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authorities. The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.

An alternate reality game emerged parallel to the &quot;Year Zero&quot; concept, expanding upon its storyline. Clues hidden on tour merchandise initially led fans to discover a network of fictitious, in-game websites that describe an &quot;Orwellian picture of the United States circa the year 2022&quot;. Before &quot;Year Zero&quot;″s release, unreleased songs from the album were found on USB drives hidden at Nine Inch Nails concert venues in Lisbon and Barcelona, as part of the alternate reality game. Fan participation in the alternate reality game caught the attention of media outlets such as &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;, who have cited fan-site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Survivalism&quot;, and other tracks from &quot;Year Zero&quot; were released as multitrack audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled &quot;Year Zero Remixed&quot; was later released, containing remixes from &quot;Year Zero&quot; by other artists. The remix album was Nine Inch Nails&#x27; final release on a major record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to Interscope Records and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with multitrack downloads and the ability to post remixes.

Reznor planned a film adaption of the album and noted &quot;Year Zero&quot; as &quot;part of a bigger picture of a number of things I&#x27;m working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot; The project moved into the television medium because of high costs for &quot;Year Zero&quot; as a film, then Reznor found American film producer Lawrence Bender and met with writers.
On August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal: &quot;We&#x27;re about to pitch it to the network, so we&#x27;re a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot; Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress slowed, reportedly due to the 2007–2008 Writer&#x27;s Guild strike, but it nevertheless continued. In 2010, the resultant miniseries, also named &quot;Year Zero&quot;, was reported to be in development with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions, with the screenplay and script written by Reznor and &quot;Carnivàle&quot; writer Daniel Knauf, but at the end of 2012 Reznor said that the project was &quot;in a holding state&quot;.

===&quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; and &quot;The Slip&quot; (2008–2012)===
In February 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled &quot;2 weeks&quot;. On March 2, &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; (the first release on The Null Corporation label), a 36-track instrumental album, became available via the band&#x27;s official website. &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; was made available in a number of different formats and forms, ranging from a free download of the first volume, to a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package. All 2,500 copies of the $300 package sold out in three days. The album is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike licence. The album was created improvisationally over a ten-week period and contributors included Atticus Ross, Alan Moulder, Alessandro Cortini, Adrian Belew, and Brian Viglione.

Similar to the announcement that ultimately led to the release of &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot;, a post on the band&#x27;s website in April 2008 read &quot;2 weeks!&quot; On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released &quot;The Slip&quot; via its website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, &quot;this one&#x27;s on me,&quot; protected under the same Creative Commons licence as &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4 million. &quot;The Slip&quot; has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000.

Since the release of &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; and &quot;The Slip&quot;, a 25-date tour titled &quot;Lights in the Sky&quot;, was announced in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became a quartet with the addition of Ilan Rubin on drums.

On January 7, 2009, Reznor uploaded unedited HD-quality footage from three shows as a download of over 400 GB via BitTorrent. In an immediate response, a fan organization known as This One Is On Us quickly downloaded the data and had begun to assemble the footage alongside its own video recordings to create a professional three-part digital film, followed by a physical release created &quot;by fans for fans&quot;. This tour documentary became collectively known as &quot;Another Version of the Truth&quot; and was released throughout late December 2009 to February 2010 via three formats: DVD, Blu-ray Disc and BitTorrent. To date, the group and the project has received significant attention from media outlets such as &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Techdirt and Pitchfork TV, and holds the support of both Reznor and the fan community with theatrical screenings being held all over the world. Nine Inch Nails art director and webmaster Rob Sheridan noted on the band&#x27;s official website:

This is yet another example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of openness combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever.

&quot;Nine Inch Nails Revenge&quot;, an iPhone/iPod Touch-exclusive rhythm game developed by Tapulous, was released on March 8, 2009 (five months after the company announced the development of the game). This installment in the &quot;Tap Tap&quot; video game franchise was themed after Nine Inch Nails, and included tracks from &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; and &quot;The Slip&quot;. Portions of the album &quot;Ghosts I-IV&quot; were also used in making of the soundtrack for the documentary &quot;Citizenfour.&quot;
In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on his official website, stating that &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking for some time now it&#x27;s time to make NIN disappear for a while.&quot; Reznor since clarified that he &quot;isn&#x27;t done creating music under the moniker, but that Nine Inch Nails is done touring for the foreseeable future.&quot; The &quot;Wave Goodbye&quot; tour concluded on September 10, 2009, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Reznor subsequently released two tracks under the Nine Inch Nails moniker: the theme song for the film &quot;&quot;, and a cover of U2&#x27;s &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, included in the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; tribute album &quot;AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered&quot;.

In 2009 Reznor married Mariqueen Maandig, and formed a project with Maandig and Atticus Ross dubbed How to Destroy Angels. Its first release, a six-track self-titled EP, was made available for free download in June 2010. Reznor&#x27;s next collaboration with Ross was co-writing and producing the official score for David Fincher&#x27;s 2010 film, &quot;The Social Network&quot;. Reznor and Ross received two awards for the score, a 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture, and a 2010 Oscar for Best Original Score. Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the official score the American adaptation of the novel &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, released in December 2011, and then again on Fincher&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Gone Girl&quot;.

In July 2012 Reznor teamed up with video game developer Treyarch to compose the theme music for &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;. Later that year Reznor again worked with Atticus Ross along with Alessandro Cortini on a remix of the song &quot;Destroyer&quot; by Telepathe. Reznor also appeared in a documentary called &quot;Sound City&quot; directed by Dave Grohl, in addition to co-writing and performing the song &quot;Mantra&quot; with Grohl and Josh Homme. This led to further collaboration with Reznor and Homme on the 2013 album from Queens of the Stone Age titled &quot;...Like Clockwork&quot;. Reznor contributed vocals and drum programing to the song &quot;Kalopsia&quot; and vocals on &quot;Fairweather Friends&quot; along with Elton John on piano and vocals. In October a project with Dr. Dre and Beats Electronics was announced that Reznor wrote was &quot;probably not what you&#x27;re expecting [from me]&quot;. The project was named &quot;Daisy&quot;; a digital music service was announced in January 2013. It was until January 2014 that the service was fully launched, with Reznor serving as chief creative officer.

===&quot;Hesitation Marks&quot; (2012–2014)===

In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails &quot;in mind&quot;. Reznor eventually confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again. In February 2013, Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed the Twenty Thirteen Tour. He also revealed that the new lineup of the band would include Eric Avery of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Adrian Belew of King Crimson, and Josh Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, as well as returning members Alessandro Cortini and Ilan Rubin. However, both Avery and Belew would quit the touring band before performances commenced, with former member Robin Finck returning in their place.

By May 28 a new Nine Inch Nails album was complete. Released September 3, &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot; incorporated rhythms reminiscent of earlier releases, but was more expansive and theatrical. In addition to the recently departed Adrian Belew, Reznor employed bassist Pino Palladino along with Todd Rundgren and Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Lindsey Buckingham to achieve various art-rock elements.

The album produced three singles, all released prior to that of the album itself. &quot;Came Back Haunted&quot; was released on June 6, with an accompanying music video bearing an epileptic seizure warning. The second single, &quot;Copy of A&quot;, was released on August 12 free of charge to US and UK Amazon.com account holders. &quot;Everything&quot; was the third and final single, recorded during sessions for the Nine Inch Nails greatest hits album. The sessions gave way to more songs that ended up yielding the entire album.

In July the Twenty Thirteen Tour was underway, beginning with a slew of festival appearances that included the Fuji Rock Festival, and the Pukkelpop, Hockenheim, Germany&#x27;s Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Heim and the Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The Tension 2013 North American leg of the tour ran from September to November and added Palladino, Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson to the lineup with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Explosions in the Sky as opening acts. This leg of the tour was documented and released in the spring as &quot;Nine Inch Nails Tension 2013&quot;.

In 2014 the band extended its tour worldwide as a four-piece. The new lineup included previous collaborators, Ilan Rubin, Alessandro Cortini, and Robin Finck. The band was joined by Queens of the Stone Age for the Australia and New Zealand tour, during which a nightly coin toss determined who opened. The tour closed in Europe with supporting synth-pop act Cold Cave. After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit the road on a joint tour with Soundgarden. The 23-day journey extended throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group Death Grips scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks prior to the tour, Death Grips announced its breakup and cancelled all subsequent live shows. Oneohtrix Point Never, the Dillinger Escape Plan and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately for the tour.

In 2014, its first year of eligibility, Nine Inch Nails was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with 14 other candidates. While they were not inducted that year, the band placed second in the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Fan Vote. In 2015, Nine Inch Nails was once again nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, they once again did not get inducted.

In June 2015, Nine Inch Nails released instrumental versions of &quot;The Fragile&quot; and &quot;With Teeth&quot; to stream exclusively on Apple Music, a service of which Reznor is chief creative director. In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started &quot;messing around with some things&quot; in regards to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating &quot;It&#x27;s not a record I&#x27;m trying to finish in a month. It&#x27;s more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting&quot;. In December 2015, Reznor reported that &quot;Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016&quot;.

=== &quot;The Trilogy (Not the Actual Events / Add Violence / Bad Witch)&quot; (2016–2019) ===

In October 2016, in response to a fan&#x27;s question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with &quot;2016 is not over yet&quot;. In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails&#x27; return by the end of the year: &quot;Those words did come out of my mouth, didn&#x27;t they? ... Just wait and see what happens.&quot; Three days later, Reznor announced an EP titled &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot;, along with reissues of &quot;Broken&quot;, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, and &quot;The Fragile,&quot; with subsequent reissues of &quot;With Teeth&quot;, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, and &quot;The Slip&quot; to be released later in 2017, these plans however fell through. Also announced was &quot;The Fragile: Deviations 1&quot;, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot; was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.

In early 2017, the band announced three headlining festival dates in North America. In January 2017, the band announced that it would be performing at the Panorama Music Festival in New York on July 30. On March 21, the band announced on their official Facebook page that it would be headlining Day 3 of FYF Fest in Los Angeles on July 23. In the same post, the band also announced their 2017 touring lineup, which included Reznor and Ross joined by the band&#x27;s 2014 touring lineup, Robin Finck, Alessandro Cortini, and Ilan Rubin. The band appeared in Part 8 of the third season of Twin Peaks, performing their song, &quot;She&#x27;s Gone Away&quot;.

In June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot; would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment &quot;Add Violence&quot; being released on July 21 and the third and final EP of the trilogy to follow in 2018. The single &quot;Less Than&quot; was released a week prior to the second EP&#x27;s release.

Also in 2017, the pair were tasked to score the upcoming Ken Burns series &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;, and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. Their score, which was released on September 15, 2017, included original compositions, and it also includes reworked pieces from other Nine Inch Nails songs and their award-winning scores for &quot;The Social Network&quot; and &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. 

The band released their ninth studio album, &quot;Bad Witch&quot;, on June 22, 2018. The band also announced the &quot;Cold and Black and Infinite 2018 North America Tour&quot;, where it toured with the Jesus and Mary Chain. To prevent ticket scalping, the band took the unusual step of only selling physical tickets that had to be purchased at the venue prior to the shows. Reznor stated of the decision &quot;The promise of a world made better by computers and online connectivity has failed us in many ways, particularly when it comes to ticketing. Everything about the process sucks and everyone loses except the reseller. We&#x27;ve decided to try something different that will also likely suck, but in a different way.&quot;

In October 2019, Nine Inch Nails was again nominated for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.

=== &quot;Ghosts V–VI&quot; (2020–2022) ===

On January 15, 2020, Nine Inch Nails was officially named as members of the Class of 2020 for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the induction ceremony was postponed indefinitely. Originally, only Trent Reznor was to be inducted as the sole full-time member of the group for most of its history. After holding discussions with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Reznor announced that former live band members Chris Vrenna and Danny Lohner, as well as current members Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin (the youngest person ever inducted into the Hall of Fame), longtime guitarist Robin Finck, and the only other full time member of the band, Atticus Ross, would all be inducted as members of Nine Inch Nails.

On March 26, 2020, Nine Inch Nails released &quot;Ghosts V: Together&quot; and &quot;Ghosts VI: Locusts&quot;, its tenth and eleventh studio albums and the sequels to their 2008 instrumental album &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot;. The albums were released for free as a show of solidarity with the band&#x27;s fans during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to the pandemic, the live induction ceremony for the 2020 Hall of Fame Induction was cancelled on July 15, 2020, and simultaneously, an induction special was announced to be broadcast and available for streaming through HBO and HBO Max, respectively, on November 7, 2020. In the interim, a special display was created to represent Nine Inch Nails&#x27; presence in the Hall of Fame that celebrated their popular, muddy performance at Woodstock &#x27;94; opened on the 26th anniversary of the concert. On November 6, 2020, Trent Reznor and the other to-be-inducted members of Nine Inch Nails were interviewed by journalist David Farrier about the history of the band and their feelings on being inducted. Then on November 7, Nine Inch Nails was formally inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, by punk icon Iggy Pop. Reznor thanked the fans, his family, and all of his many Nine Inch Nails collaborators in his acceptance speech, recorded from his home in Beverly Hills, CA.

On May 6, 2021, Nine Inch Nails released a new track, &quot;Isn&#x27;t Everyone&quot; in collaboration with noise rock group HEALTH, who had previously been an opening act on their Lights In The Sky and Wave Goodbye tours. On May 7, they announced they would be playing two shows in Cleveland (September 21 and 23, 2021) with the Pixies to commemorate their inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which, according to the band, would be &quot;the only NIN headline shows in 2021&quot;. Those shows were cancelled on August 19, 2021, due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. Also in 2021, Reznor and Ross produced Halsey&#x27;s album &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have Love, I Want Power&quot;. It was later nominated for the Best Alternative Music Album award at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.

In February 2022, Nine Inch Nails announced a short tour of the United States for 2022, the group&#x27;s first performances in nearly four years. A tour of the United Kingdom was announced shortly afterwards.

On September 24, 2022, Nine Inch Nails performed in their native Cleveland for the first time since 2013 after a &quot;Nine Inch Nails Fan Day&quot; at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame the previous day. Over the course of the performance, all the other six inductees, as well as former members Richard Patrick and Charlie Clouser, joined Reznor on stage and even covered Patrick&#x27;s Filter hit, &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot;. Reznor posted on his Discord after the show, “When/If we tour again, it will be different. Not like [2018′s “Cold Black Infinite” tour] era – It&#x27;s over.”

=== &quot;Tron: Ares&quot; and Peel It Back Tour (2024–present) ===
On April 4, 2024, Nine Inch Nails revealed plans to create a project with Epic Games that they described as &quot;something that is not exactly a video game, in the UEFN ecosystem Epic has built around &quot;Fortnite&quot;&quot;, to develop a TV series with Christopher Storer, and create a film with Mike Flanagan. The projects were being created from a newly established multimedia company With Teeth, ran in partnership with the band&#x27;s art director John Crawford and producer Jonathan Pavesi. The band is also working on a short film with artist Susanne Deeken, a clothing line called Memory Fade, as well as a music festival and a new record label set to launch alongside it.

On August 10, 2024, Reznor and Ross appeared at Disney&#x27;s D23 fan event to announce Nine Inch Nails was producing the film score for &quot;&quot;. It was reported that the soundtrack would feature &quot;new original songs&quot; by the band. Previously, soundtracks were credited to simply Ross and Reznor, whereas the score for &quot;Tron: Ares&quot; specifically credited the Nine Inch Nails entity.

Plans for a tour titled Peel It Back leaked on January 13, 2025. These leaks indicated August and September shows in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The leaks included a Facebook post for a September 10 event in Tampa, Florida, and an associated Ticketmaster listing. On January 14, the band confirmed they were touring, with further details to follow, but their announcement was paused due to the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires. The band then officially confirmed the summer tour on January 22.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Nine Inch Nails has been described as incorporating alternative rock, industrial rock, industrial dance, industrial, electro-industrial, industrial metal, electronic rock, and alternative metal. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey states that &quot;Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience&quot;. Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term &quot;industrial&quot; and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor&#x27;s body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine that &quot;Down in It&quot; was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band&#x27;s song &quot;Dig It&quot;; other songs from &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; and &quot;With Teeth&quot; have been described as synth-pop. Reviewing &quot;The Fragile&quot;, critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in &quot;The Frail&quot; and drum and bass elements in &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; music, including on &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; (which is specifically dark ambient), &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;The Slip&quot;, and &quot;The Fragile&quot;.


Songs such as &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor&#x27;s singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot;. The band&#x27;s music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in &quot;The Collector&quot; from &quot;With Teeth&quot; and concert favorite &quot;March of the Pigs&quot;. Reznor uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song &quot;Hurt&quot;, which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word &quot;I&quot; every time the B/E# dyad is played. &quot;Closer&quot; concludes with a chromatic piano motif: the melody is debuted during the second verse of &quot;Piggy&quot; on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of &quot;Heresy&quot;, while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout &quot;A Warm Place&quot;, and then recurs in its original state for the final time on &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;.

On &quot;The Fragile&quot;, Reznor revisits the technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on &quot;Year Zero&quot; contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s review described the album&#x27;s laptop-mixed sound: &quot;Guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.&quot; 

===Lyrical themes===
Lyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, and nihilism. Occasionally, the lyrics depart from their introspective nature to deal with a topic like politics, which is the focus of &quot;Year Zero&quot;. Three Nine Inch Nails albums are concept albums: &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;The Fragile&quot;, and &quot;Year Zero&quot;. The album &quot;With Teeth&quot; was originally set to be a concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.

===Influences===

Reznor&#x27;s earliest influence was the Eagles, whom he has cited as inspiring him to form a band. He would later recall, &quot;The first concert I ever saw was the Eagles in 1976. The excitement of the night struck a chord with me and I remember thinking, &#x27;Someday I&#x27;d love to be up on that stage.&#x27;&quot; Another major inspiration for the band is Gary Numan; Reznor has said that &quot;after hearing &#x27;Cars&#x27; I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers&quot;. Other influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy, which helped shape 1989&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes also paid tribute to Public Enemy and Prince. The 2005 single &quot;Only&quot; exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan&#x27;s persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails include acts such as Depeche Mode, Queen, King Crimson, Devo, the Cure, Joy Division, U2, Bauhaus, Adam Ant, Coil, and Soft Cell. Reznor and Vrenna saw Jane&#x27;s Addiction in 1988 during the making of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; and were influenced by the live presentation and raw rock sound of the band.

Reznor has toured with some of his influences, including a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1988. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who, along with Pink Floyd, had been a significant influence on &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. In 2006, Nine Inch Nails went on tour with Bauhaus, on their Summer Amphitheatre Tour.

==Legacy==

Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from &quot;generic imitations&quot; dating from his initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a &quot;truer, less imitative way&quot;. Following the release of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; influence: David Bowie compared Reznor&#x27;s influence to that of The Velvet Underground. Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose was influenced heavily by Nine Inch Nails in changing his band&#x27;s sound to an industrial style in the mid-90s. Bob Ezrin, producer for Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Peter Gabriel, described Reznor in 2007 as a &quot;true visionary&quot; and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude. Nine Inch Nails has been credited by music journalists for popularizing industrial music, despite ambivalence from Reznor.

The act has received four awards from 25 nominations, including two Grammy Awards for the songs &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Nine Inch Nails have received two &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards; one of them being the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Icon in 2006, honoring the band&#x27;s overall contributions since 1988 and long-standing influence on rock music. The band has also received nine nominations from the MTV Video Music Awards for several of its videos, including two nominations for the &quot;Closer&quot; music video and five nominations for &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; music video, including Video of the Year.

In 1997, Reznor appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the year&#x27;s most influential people, and &quot;Spin&quot; described him as &quot;the most vital artist in music&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America certified sales for 10.5 million units of the band&#x27;s albums in the United States, which accounted for roughly half of the band&#x27;s reported sales worldwide at that time. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; at No. 200 in a 2003 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and by the following year ranked Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list.

In 2019, Reznor and Ross received songwriting and production credits for the number-one single &quot;Old Town Road&quot; by Lil Nas X, which sampled their track &quot;34 Ghosts IV&quot; from &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot;. &quot;Old Town Road&quot; broke the record for most consecutive weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As producers for the song, Reznor and Ross won a CMA Award for the &#x27;Musical Event of the Year&#x27;, along with Lil Nas X, featured artist Billy Ray Cyrus and producer YoungKio.

In January 2020, after previous nominations in 2014 and 2015, Nine Inch Nails (Alessandro Cortini, Robin Finck, Danny Lohner, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, Ilan Rubin and Chris Vrenna) were named as inductees of the 2020 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Corporate disputes==
===TVT Records===
In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label&#x27;s attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.

At the behest of Prudential Securities bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor&#x27;s recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, and a percentage of royalties from Reznor&#x27;s song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. Rykodisc, which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; CD on November 22, 2005. Ryko also reissued the &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; CD and a vinyl edition of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but did not want to pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.

===Universal Music Group===
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website skeptical of Universal Music Group (parent company of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; record label, Interscope Records) for its pricing and distribution plans for &quot;Year Zero.&quot; He labeled the company&#x27;s retail pricing of &quot;Year Zero&quot; in Australia as &quot;ABSURD&quot;, concluding that &quot;as a reward for being a &#x27;true fan&#x27; you get ripped off&quot;. Reznor went on to say that he hated Interscope, and in later years the &quot;climate&quot; of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor&#x27;s post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to &quot;steal&quot; his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to &quot;steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealing&quot;.

Reznor announced on October 8, 2007, that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a &quot;totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label&quot;. Reznor also speculated that he would release the next Nine Inch Nails album online in a similar fashion to &quot;The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!&quot;, which he produced. Reznor later released the first nine tracks of &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; and the entirety of &quot;The Slip&quot; in 2008 for free download.

In another post on his website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential &quot;accusation&quot;, in Reznor&#x27;s words, &quot;that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for&quot;. Reznor wrote in response that he was &quot;challenged at the last second to find a way of bringing this idea to life without getting splashed by the urine as these media companies piss all over each other&#x27;s feet&quot;. Despite these obstacles, the remix website was launched in November 2007.

===Other corporations===
Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot;. Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: &quot;Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me.&quot; MTV replied that it respected Reznor&#x27;s point of view, but was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with the performance being &quot;built around partisan political statements&quot;. A performance by Foo Fighters replaced Nine Inch Nails&#x27; time slot on the show.

Another ceremony incident had occurred at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014. The band performed &quot;Copy of A&quot; and &quot;My God Is the Sun&quot; with Queens of the Stone Age, Lindsey Buckingham, and Dave Grohl towards the end of the broadcast; however, the performance was not shown in full to the audience at home as advertisements had cut-in midway through the second song. Despite an apology from producer Kenneth Ehrlich, Reznor later heavily criticized the situation.

In 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a cease and desist to Fox News Channel for using three songs from &quot;The Fragile&quot; on air without permission. The songs &quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;The Great Below&quot;, and &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot; appeared in an episode of &quot;War Stories with Oliver North&quot; detailing the battle of Iwo Jima. A post appeared on Reznor&#x27;s blog, which read: &quot;Thanks for the Fox News heads-up. A cease and desist has been issued. FUCK Fox Fucking News.&quot;

As part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of &quot;Year Zero&quot;, three tracks from the album (&quot;My Violent Heart&quot;, &quot;Survivalism&quot;, and &quot;Me, I&#x27;m Not&quot;) were intentionally &quot;leaked&quot; prior to their official release at a number of Nine Inch Nails concerts on USB flash drives. The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the Recording Industry Association of America, despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails&#x27; record label. The source that broke the story was quoted as saying, &quot;These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on.&quot;

The music of Nine Inch Nails has reportedly been used by the U.S. military as music torture to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message on the front page of the Nine Inch Nails website: &quot;It&#x27;s difficult for me to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you&#x27;ve put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities. Thank GOD this country has appeared to side with reason and we can put the Bush administration&#x27;s reign of power, greed, lawlessness and madness behind us.&quot;

Aside from disagreements over the usage of Nine Inch Nails material, some corporations have dismissed content due to perceived obscenity. In 2009, Apple rejected an update to Nine Inch Nails&#x27; iPhone application, &quot;NIN: Access&quot;, because it found &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; to contain &quot;offensive or obscene content&quot;, referring to the lyrical content. Reznor criticized their decision, citing the audio was also available through the iTunes application.

A similar incident involving digital content distribution occurred in 2013 when Nine Inch Nails re-released the original 1993 film &quot;Broken&quot; on Vimeo. Within hours of launch, the video was removed due to terms of service violation on material that &quot;harass, incite hatred or depict excessive violence&quot;.

==Live performances==
Until Atticus Ross joined in 2016, Reznor was the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, Reznor tours with a group of musicians.

The lineup of the live band often changes between major tours. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music. Band members have occasionally been invited to participate in the recording process, but creative control within the studio has always been exclusively with Reznor.

The Tapeworm project was created in 1995 as a Nine Inch Nails side-project between Reznor and various live-band members as a more &quot;democratic&quot; creative environment. The band initially included live band members Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser, but eventually expanded to include other frequent Nine Inch Nails contributors Josh Freese, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder. However, after 9 years of studio sessions, no material was ever officially released from the group, and it was confirmed to be no longer active in 2005.

<text>The École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (, EPFL) is a public research university in Lausanne, Switzerland, founded in 1969 with the mission to &quot;train talented engineers in Switzerland&quot;.

Like its sister institution ETH Zurich, EPFL is part of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain which groups several universities and research institutes under the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. As of 2024, EPFL enrolled 14,012 students from over 130 countries.

EPFL has an urban campus that extends alongside Lake Geneva, and includes the EPFL Innovation Park as well as university research centers and affiliated laboratories.

== History ==


The roots of modern-day EPFL can be traced back to the foundation of a private school under the name &quot;École spéciale de Lausanne&quot; in 1853 at the initiative of Louis Rivier, a graduate of the and John Gay, the then professor and rector of the &quot;Académie de Lausanne&quot;. At its inception it had only 11 students and the offices was located at Rue du Valentin in Lausanne.

In 1869, it became the technical department of the &quot;Académie de Lausanne&quot;. When the Académie was reorganized and acquired the status of a university in 1890, the technical faculty changed its name to École d&#x27;ingénieurs de l&#x27;Université de Lausanne. In 1946, it was renamed the École polytechnique de l&#x27;Université de Lausanne (EPUL). In 1969, the EPUL was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name. EPFL, like ETH Zurich, is thus directly controlled by the Swiss Federal Council.

In contrast, all other universities in Switzerland are controlled by their respective cantonal governments. Following the nomination of Patrick Aebischer as president in 2000, EPFL has started to develop into the field of life sciences. It absorbed the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in 2008.

In 1946, there were 360 students at EPFL. In 1969, the university had grown to 1,400 students and 55 faculty members.

In the past two decades, EPFL has grown rapidly in reputation and size. As of 2023, EPFL has more than 13,000 full-time students.

The environment at modern day EPFL is highly international with the school attracting students and researchers from all over the world. More than 125 countries are represented on the campus and the university has two official languages, French and English.

== Academics ==

===Admission===

Holders of a Swiss &quot;maturité gymnasiale&quot; are directly accepted with no other condition in the first year of their Bachelor&#x27;s program of choice.

Holders of a Swiss Professional &quot;Maturité&quot; or a Swiss specialised &quot;Maturité&quot; are accepted in the &quot;Cours de mathématiques spéciales&quot; within the places available.

As such, EPFL is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedure for Swiss residents.

However, international students are required to have a final grade average of 80% or above of the maximum grade of the upper secondary school national system.

The real selection process happens during the first year of undergraduate studies. This period is called the &quot;propaedeutic cycle&quot; and the students must pass a block examination of all the courses taken during the first year at the end of the cycle.

If the weighted average is insufficient, a student is required to retake the entire first year of coursework if they wish to continue their studies at EPFL. Roughly 60% of students fail the first year at EPFL all majors combined, and many choose to drop out rather than to repeat the &quot;propaedeutic cycle&quot;.

The failure rate differs between majors, it is higher for Life Sciences Engineering, Physics, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering where only 30–40% of students pass the first year.

For foreign students, the selection procedure towards the undergraduate program is rather strict, and since most undergraduate courses are taught in French, foreign students must provide documentation of having acquired a level B2 proficiency in French as measured on the CEFR scale, though C1 proficiency is recommended.

The usual time till graduation is six semesters (3 years) for the Bachelor of Science degree and four additional semesters (2 years) for the Master of Science degree with the final semester dedicated to writing a thesis. Though only 58% of the students who manage to graduate are able to graduate within this time-period.

The possibility to study abroad for one or two semesters is offered during the 3rd year of studies as EPFL maintains several long-standing student exchange programs, such as the junior year engineering and science program with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, as well as a graduate Aeronautics and Aerospace program with the ISAE in France.

Entrepreneurship is actively encouraged at EPFL, as evident by the EPFL Innovation Park being an integral part of the campus. Since 1997, 12 start-ups have been created per year on average by EPFL students and faculty. In the year 2013, a total of 105 million CHF was raised by EPFL start-ups.

=== Rankings ===

In 2023, the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; ranks EPFL 16th worldwide across all fields, and among the 10 best universities in several engineering disciplines. &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranks EPFL as the world&#x27;s 19th best school in the world for Engineering and Technology.

EPFL typically scores high on faculty to student ratio, international outlook and scientific impact. The CWTS Leiden Ranking that &quot;aims to provide highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities&quot; ranks EPFL world 13th, and 1st in Europe in the 2013 rankings for all the sciences. 
The &quot;Times&quot; 100 Under 50 Rankings is a ranking of the top 100 universities in the world under 50 years old. Since EPFL in its current form was formed in 1969, it is included in this ranking, and was ranked 1st in the world for three years in a row in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and 2nd in the world in 2018 and 2019.

&quot;Times Higher Education&quot; also ranked EPFL as the most international university in the world two years in a row 2014 and 2015.

== Campus ==

The &quot;École d&#x27;ingénieurs de l&#x27;Université de Lausanne&quot;, from which EPFL in its modern-day form originates, was located in the center of Lausanne. In 1974, five years after EPFL was separated from University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name, the construction of a new campus at Dorigny in Écublens, began. The inauguration of the first EPFL buildings of the new campus took place in 1978.

The EPFL campus has been evolving ever since. The first stage of development, with a total budget of 462 million Swiss francs, was completed in 1984; the second in 1990.

Construction of the northern parts of campus began in 1995 with the Microtechnology building (BM), completed in 1998, and the architecture building (SG), completed in 2000. In 2002, the department of architecture also moved to the campus in Écublens, uniting all departments of EPFL on the same site. The latest addition to the EPFL campus is the Rolex Learning Center completed in February 2010. The Rolex Learning Center is the main campus library and includes areas for work, leisure and services and is located at the center of the campus. The campus has also been expanded with the construction of the SwissTech Convention Center inaugurated in March 2014. As of 2022, RTS began the construction of a regional production center on campus in collaboration with EPFL.

Together with the University of Lausanne, EPFL forms a vast campus complex at the shores of Lake Geneva with about 20,000 students combined.

The campus is served by the Lausanne Metro Line 1 (M1) and is equipped with an electric bicycle sharing system. Since 2012, only electricity from certified hydroelectric generation is being bought by EPFL to power its campus. The university was the first campus to receive the &quot;International Sustainable Campus Excellence Award&quot; by the &quot;International Sustainable Campus Network&quot;.

Of the 14,000 people that work and study at the campus, roughly 9.300 are students in either Bachelor, Master or Doctoral programs, the remaining 4,700 being administrative staff, scientists, technical staff, professors and the entrepreneurs located in the Science Park EPFL7. More than 125 nationalities are represented on campus with 48% of the student population being foreign nationals.

Almost all of the structures are on its main campus. However, it also has branches in Neuchâtel (&quot;Microcity&quot;), in Sion (&quot;Pôle EPFL Valais&quot;), in Geneva (Campus Biotech, including the Wyss Center for Bio- and Neuro-engineering) and in Fribourg (&quot;Smart Living Lab&quot;). There was also a research centre in Ras al-Khaimah (United Arab Emirates), EPFL Middle East, between 2009 and 2022.
=== Buildings ===

The campus consists of about 65 buildings on . Built according to the growth of the school, the campus includes different types of architectures:
* Late 1970s–1980s: modularised building, used today by the Schools of Basic Sciences and Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering
* 1990s: buildings with institutes from the Schools of Engineering Sciences and Techniques, Computer and Communication Sciences, and the Scientific Park (PSE)
* Modern: new buildings (2002–2004) with Microengineering, Communications and Architecture institutes, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management.
* The Rolex Learning Center, a new library (2010)
* 2014: The SwissTech Convention Center and the &quot;Quartier Nord&quot; (convention center, student accommodation, shops...)
* The EPFL-Pavilions building (previously Artlab), designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, was opened in November 2016; it includes three spaces opened to the public. The first one hosts archives from the Montreux Jazz Festival; the second is a space for museum experimentations. The third space, named &quot;DataSquare&quot;, hosts an exposition on Big data, illustrated by two scientific projects from EPFL: the Human Brain Project and the Venice Time Machine.
*Museums: Musée Bolo, Archizoom (EPFL).
The EPFL and the University of Lausanne also share an active sports centre five minutes away from EPFL, on the shores of Lake Geneva.

=== Associated campuses ===
Beyond its main campus, EPFL operates a network of associated campuses in Western Switzerland, often sharing these spaces with partner academic institutions and hospitals:
* Fribourg: Smart Living Lab
*Neuchâtel: Microcity
* Geneva: Campus Biotech
* Sion: EPFL Valais/Wallis

=== Language Centre ===
The Language Centre offers language and communication modules for French, German, Italian and English (CEFR levels A1 to C2) to enable learners to participate more effectively in academic, professional and social situations in an internationalized multilingual and multicultural context. These modules are reserved for EPFL students, staff members and for their spouses.

Tandems are also organized and set up within the framework of the Tandem Program of the Faculty of Arts/EFLE of the University of Lausanne. This concept includes two people of different first languages meeting regularly to teach each other their respective language.

== Students and traditions ==

=== Student body ===

The number of students attending studying at EPFL has been rising heavily since EPFL was formed in 1969 under its current name. In 1969 EPFL had roughly 1400 students; that number had grown to 2367 by 1982, 4302 by 1997, 9921 students in 2014, and 10,536 students at the end of 2016. Within the student body, 112 different nationalities are represented. In the period from 1982 to 2014 the female proportion of the student body has increased from 12% to 27%. The proportion of female students is lowest at the School of Computer Science and Communication (15%) and highest at the School of Life Sciences (49%).

=== Clubs ===

The school encourages the formation of associations and sports activities on campus. As of 2023, there are nearly a hundred clubs and associations on campus for recreational and social purposes. In addition, the school has its own monthly newspaper, &quot;Flash&quot;. Included in the 79 associations are

* AGEPoly is the Student&#x27;s Association. Its purpose is to represent the EPFL&#x27;s students, defend the general interests of the students and inform and consult its members on decisions of the EPFL Direction that concern them.
* The Forum is a student association responsible for organization of the Forum EPFL. The Forum was founded in 1982 as a platform for exchange and meeting between the academic and professional communities. Today, it is one of the largest recruiting events in Europe, and the largest in Switzerland.
* UNIPOLY is the EPFL Association for Ecology, the Association works to create awareness of ecology on campus and in western Switzerland. UNIPOLY is part of the World Student Community for Sustainable Development, an international network of student organizations for sustainable development consisting of EPFL, ETH Zurich, MIT, University of Tokyo, University of Fort Hare, University of Nairobi, Chalmers, and University of Yaounde.
* The Anime and Manga club, PolyJapan, schedules viewings of seasonal anime on a regular basis.
* Polympiads is promoting mathematics and informatics through competitions. They organise the Helvetic Coding Contest, Switzerland&#x27;s biggest programming competition.

=== Music festivals===

Several music festivals are held yearly. The largest one is the Balélec Festival, organized in May each year since 1981. The festival welcomes 15,000 visitors to around 30 concerts.

=== Archimedean Oath===

EPFL was the birthplace of the Archimedean Oath, proposed by students in 1990. The Archimedean Oath has since spread to a number of European engineering schools. The Archimedean Oath is an ethical code of practice for engineers and technicians, similar to the Hippocratic Oath used in the medical world.

=== Harassment and sexism ===
In 2020, the student association Polyquity published numerous testimonies from students via an Instagram account @payetonepfl denouncing cases of sexual, homophobic and racist harassment as well as cases of rape within the associations present on campus but also within the teaching staff. The student association denounces serious failings of the institution that is supposed to manage harassment.

<text>The Cambridge Z88 is a Z80-based notebook computer released in 1987 by Cambridge Computer, the company formed for this purpose by Clive Sinclair. It was approximately A4 paper sized and lightweight at , running on four AA batteries for 20 hours of use.

It was packaged with a built-in combined word processing/spreadsheet/database application called &quot;PipeDream&quot; (functionally equivalent to a 1987 BBC Micro ROM called Acornsoft View Professional), along with several other applications and utilities, such as a Z80-version of the BBC BASIC programming language.

== History ==

The Z88 evolved from Sir Clive Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&quot; portable computer project which had been under development at Sinclair Research during the mid-1980s. Following the sale of Sinclair Research to Amstrad, Sinclair released the Z88 through his Cambridge Computer mail-order company, as he was no longer permitted to use the Sinclair name after the sale. The machine was launched at the &quot;Which Computer?&quot; Show on 17 February 1987. Early models were contract-manufactured by Thorn EMI but production later switched to SCI Systems in Irvine, Scotland.

== Design ==
The Z88 is a notebook computer weighing , based on a low-power CMOS version of the popular Zilog Z80 microprocessor. It comes with 32 kB of internal pseudo-static RAM and 128 kB of ROM containing the operating system (called &quot;OZ&quot;). The memory can be expanded up to 3.5 MB of RAM, the contents of which are preserved across sessions. An integrated capacitor prevents the Z88 from losing its data for the limited time it takes to change the batteries.

The machine uses a membrane keyboard, which is almost silent in use; an optional electronic &quot;click&quot; can be turned on to indicate keystrokes. The Z88 is powered by four AA batteries, giving up to 20 hours of use. It has three memory card slots, which accommodate proprietary RAM, EPROM or flash cards, the third slot being equipped with a built-in EPROM programmer. Card capacities range from 32 kB to 1 MB.

The Z88 has a built-in eight-line, 64 × 640 pixel super-twisted nematic display which has greater contrast than conventional twisted nematic LCDs.

The 64 kB addressable by the Z80 processor are divided in four banks of 16 kB each. The maximum memory of 4 MiB for the system is also divided in 256 segments of 16 kB each. The hardware can map any of the 16 kB blocks to any of the four banks. The first 512 kB are reserved for ROM; the next 512 kB are reserved for internal RAM. The next 3 MB are assigned to each one of the three memory slots.

== Postmarket upgrades ==

Since 1998, a 1 MiB Flash memory card is available which provides convenient non-volatile storage. Once written to the card, files are safe and not reliant on a power supply. Unlike traditional EPROM cards (erased with an external ultraviolet light), this one can be electrically erased in the computer&#x27;s slot. The first generation of card only worked in slot 3 where a 12 V signal (Vpp) is available. The later generation is based on AMD chips and runs with 5 V for erasure. It is possible to read, write and erase flash cards in the three slots and the internal one.

It is also possible for an experienced user to replace the built-in 32 kB RAM chip with a bigger 128 or 512 kB static RAM chip. However, the latter requires some extra board modifications, and 512 kB is the biggest size that can be addressed by the Z88 for the internal RAM. A similar modification is possible for the internal ROM slot. A 512 kB flash chip can replace the original ROM, allowing an upgrade of the operating system.

==Reception==
Jerry Pournelle in February 1989 described the Z88 as &quot;the most portable computer I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, much more so that his Zenith SupersPort 286. He said that the screen was small but readable, and thought that his $894 estimate for a minimum configuration was &quot;not a &quot;lot&quot; of money for good hardware&quot;. Pournelle said that Pipedream was &quot;disappointingly hard to use&quot;, reported that all of his notes in the software from COMDEX had vanished because he did not explicitly save them to memory card, and suggested that the Z88 was best suited as a second computer for students and reporters.

<doc id="71973" wikidata="Q750448" url="?curid=71973" title="Trail of Tears">
<text>The Trail of Tears was the forced displacement of about 60,000 people of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; between 1830 and 1850, and the additional thousands of Native Americans and their enslaved African Americans within that were ethnically cleansed by the United States government.

As part of Indian removal, members of the Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the Southeastern United States to newly designated Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River after the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830. The Cherokee removal in 1838 was the last forced removal east of the Mississippi and was brought on by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1828, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush. The relocated peoples suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their newly designated Indian reserve. Thousands died from disease before reaching their destinations or shortly after. A variety of scholars have classified the Trail of Tears as an example of the genocide of Native Americans; others categorize it as ethnic cleansing.

==Overview==
In 1830, a group of Indian nations collectively referred to as the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; (the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee, and Seminole nations), were living autonomously in what would later be termed the American Deep South. The process of cultural transformation from their traditional way of life towards a white American way of life as proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw.

American settlers had been pressuring the federal government to remove Indians from the Southeast; many settlers were encroaching on Indian lands, while others wanted more land made available to the settlers. Although the effort was vehemently opposed by some, including U.S. Congressman Davy Crockett of Tennessee, President Andrew Jackson was able to gain Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the government to extinguish any Indian title to land claims in the Southeast.

In 1831, the Choctaw became the first Nation to be removed, and their removal served as the model for all future relocations. After two wars, many Seminoles were removed in 1832. The Creek removal followed in 1834, the Chickasaw in 1837, and lastly the Cherokee in 1838. Some managed to evade the removals, however, and remained in their ancestral homelands; some Choctaw still reside in Mississippi, Creek in Alabama and Florida, Cherokee in North Carolina, and Seminole in Florida. A small group of Seminole, fewer than 500, evaded forced removal; the modern Seminole Nation of Florida is descended from these individuals. A number of non-Indians who lived with the nations, including over 4,000 slaves and others of African descent such as spouses or Freedmen, also accompanied the Indians on the trek westward. By 1837, 46,000 Indians from the southeastern states had been removed from their homelands, thereby opening for white settlement. When the &quot;Five Tribes&quot; arrived in Indian Territory, &quot;they followed their physical appropriation of Plains Indians&#x27; land with an erasure of their predecessor&#x27;s history&quot;, and &quot;perpetuated the idea that they had found an undeveloped &#x27;wilderness&quot; when they arrived&quot; in an attempt to appeal to white American values by participating in the settler colonial process themselves. Other Indian nations, such as the Quapaws and Osages had moved to Indian Territory before the &quot;Five Tribes&quot; and saw them as intruders.

=== Historical background ===
Before 1838, the fixed boundaries of these autonomous Indian nations, comprising large areas of the United States, were subject to continual cession and annexation, in part due to pressure from squatters and the threat of military force in the newly declared U.S. territories—federally administered regions whose boundaries supervened upon the Indian treaty claims. As these territories became U.S. states, state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the Indian nations within their borders, which were independent of state jurisdiction, and to expropriate the land therein. These pressures were exacerbated by U.S. population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South, with the rapid development of cotton cultivation in the uplands after the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney.

Many people of the southeastern Indian nations had become economically integrated into the economy of the region. This included the plantation economy and the possession of slaves, who were also forcibly relocated during the removal.

Prior to Jackson&#x27;s presidency, removal policy was already in place and justified by the myth of the &quot;Vanishing Indian&quot;. Historian Jeffrey Ostler explains that &quot;Scholars have exposed how the discourse of the vanishing Indian was an ideology that made declining Indigenous American populations seem to be an inevitable consequence of natural processes and so allowed Americans to evade moral responsibility for their destructive choices&quot;. Despite the common association of Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears, ideas for Removal began prior to Jackson&#x27;s presidency. Ostler explains, &quot;A singular focus on Jackson obscures the fact that he did not invent the idea of removal…Months after the passage of the Removal Act, Jackson described the legislation as the &#x27;happy consummation&#x27; of a policy &#x27;pursued for nearly 30 years. James Fenimore Cooper was also a key component of the maintenance of the &quot;vanishing Indian&quot; myth. This vanishing narrative can be seen as existing prior to the Trail of Tears through Cooper&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Scholar and author Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz shows that:

=== Jackson&#x27;s role ===
Although Jackson was not the sole, or original, architect of Removal policy, his contributions were influential in its trajectory. Jackson&#x27;s support for the removal of the Indians began at least a decade before his presidency. Indian removal was Jackson&#x27;s top legislative priority upon taking office. After being elected president, he wrote in his first address to Congress: &quot;The emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry&quot;. The prioritization of American Indian removal and his violent past created a sense of restlessness among U.S. territories. During his presidency, &quot;the United States made eighty-six treaties with twenty-six American Indian nations between New York and the Mississippi, all of them forcing land cessions, including removals&quot;.

In a speech regarding Indian removal, Jackson said,

The removals, conducted under both Presidents Jackson and Van Buren, followed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which provided the president with powers to exchange land with Indian nations and provide infrastructure improvements on the existing lands. The law also gave the president power to pay for transportation costs to the West, should the nations willingly choose to relocate. The law did not, however, allow the president to force Indian nations to move west without a mutually agreed-upon treaty. Referring to the Indian Removal Act, Martin Van Buren, Jackson&#x27;s vice president and successor, is quoted as saying &quot;There was no measure, in the whole course of [Jackson&#x27;s] administration, of which he was more exclusively the author than this.&quot;

According to historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Jackson&#x27;s intentions were outwardly violent. Dunbar-Ortiz claims that Jackson believed in &quot;bleeding enemies to give them their senses&quot; on his quest to &quot;serve the goal of U.S. expansion&quot;. According to her, American Indians presented an obstacle to the fulfillment of Manifest Destiny, in his mind. Throughout his military career, according to historian Amy H. Sturgis, &quot;Jackson earned and emphasized his reputation as an &#x27;Indian fighter&#x27;, a man who believed creating fear in the native population was more desirable than cultivating friendship&quot;. In a message to Congress on the eve of Indian Removal, December 6, 1830, Jackson wrote that removal &quot;will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of Alabama of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly in population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites.&quot; In this way, Sturgis has argued that Jackson demarcated the Indian population as an &quot;obstacle&quot; to national success. Sturgis writes that Jackson&#x27;s removal policies were met with pushback from respectable social figures and that &quot;many leaders of Jacksonian reform movements were particularly disturbed by U.S policy toward American Indians&quot;. Among these opponents were women&#x27;s advocate and founder of the American Woman&#x27;s Educational Association Catherine Beecher and politician Davy Crockett.

Historian Francis Paul Prucha, on the other hand, writes that these assessments were put forward by Jackson&#x27;s political opponents and that Jackson had benevolent intentions. According to him, Jackson&#x27;s critics have been too harsh, if not wrong. He states that Jackson never developed a doctrinaire anti-Indian attitude and that his dominant goal was to preserve the security and well-being of the United States and its Indian and white inhabitants. Corroborating Prucha&#x27;s interpretation, historian Robert V. Remini argues that Jackson never intended the &quot;monstrous result&quot; of his policy. Remini argues further that had Jackson not orchestrated the removal of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; from their ancestral homelands, they would have been totally wiped out.

==== Treaty of New Echota ====
Jackson chose to continue with Indian removal, and negotiated the Treaty of New Echota, on December 29, 1835, which granted the Cherokee two years to move to Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). The Chickasaws and Choctaws had readily accepted and signed treaties with the U.S. government, while the Creeks did so under coercion.

The negotiation of the Treaty of New Echota was largely encouraged by Jackson, and it was signed by a minority Cherokee political faction, the Treaty Party, led by Cherokee leader Elias Boudinot. However, the treaty was opposed by most of the Cherokee people, as it was not approved by the Cherokee National Council, and it was not signed by Principal Chief John Ross. The Cherokee National Council submitted a petition, signed by thousands of Cherokee citizens, urging Congress to void the agreement in February 1836. Despite this opposition, the Senate ratified the treaty in March 1836, and the Treaty of New Echota thus became the legal basis for the Trail of Tears. Only a fraction of the Cherokees left voluntarily. The U.S. government, with assistance from state militias, forced most of the remaining Cherokees west in 1838.

The Cherokees were temporarily remanded in camps in eastern Tennessee. In November, the Cherokee were broken into groups of around 1,000 each and began the journey west. They endured heavy rains, snow, and freezing temperatures. When the Cherokee negotiated the Treaty of New Echota, they exchanged all their land east of the Mississippi for land in modern Oklahoma and a $5 million payment from the federal government. Many Cherokee felt betrayed that their leadership accepted the deal, and over 16,000 Cherokee signed a petition to prevent the passage of the treaty.

By the end of the decade in 1840, tens of thousands of Cherokee and other Indian nations had been removed from their land east of the Mississippi River. The Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, and Chicksaw were also relocated under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. One Choctaw leader portrayed the removal as &quot;A Trail of Tears and Deaths&quot;, a devastating event that removed most of the Indian population of the southeastern United States from their traditional homelands.

==Legal background==
The establishment of the Indian Territory and the extinguishing of Indian land claims east of the Mississippi by the Indian Removal Act anticipated the U.S. Indian reservation system, which was imposed on remaining Indian lands later in the 19th century. The statutory argument for Indian sovereignty persisted until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831), that the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore not entitled to a hearing before the court. In the years after the Indian Removal Act, the Cherokee filed several lawsuits regarding conflicts with the state of Georgia. Some of these cases reached the Supreme Court, the most influential being &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832). Samuel Worcester and the group of white Christian missionaries he was in were convicted by Georgia law for living in Cherokee territory in the state of Georgia without a license in 1831. Worcester was sentenced to prison for four years and appealed the ruling, arguing that this sentence violated treaties made between Indian nations and the United States federal government by imposing state laws on Cherokee lands. The Court ruled in Worcester&#x27;s favor, declaring that the Cherokee Nation was subject only to federal law and that the Supremacy Clause barred legislative interference by the state of Georgia.

Chief Justice Marshall argued, &quot;The Cherokee nation, then, is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force. The whole intercourse between the United States and this Nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.&quot;

The Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision. &quot;Worcester&quot; thus imposed no obligations on Jackson; there was nothing for him to enforce, although Jackson&#x27;s&#x27; political enemies conspired to find evidence, to be used in the forthcoming political election, to claim that he would refuse to enforce the &quot;Worcester&quot; decision. He feared that enforcement would lead to open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia, which would compound the ongoing crisis in South Carolina and lead to a broader civil war. Instead, he vigorously negotiated a land exchange treaty with the Cherokee.

After this, Jackson&#x27;s political opponents Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams, who supported the &quot;Worcester&quot; decision, became outraged by Jackson&#x27;s alleged refusal to uphold Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia. Author and political activist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an account of Cherokee assimilation into the American culture, declaring his support of the &quot;Worcester&quot; decision.

At the time, members of individual Indian nations were not considered United States citizens. While citizenship tests existed for Indians living in newly annexed areas before and after forced relocation, individual U.S. states did not recognize the Indian nations&#x27; land claims, only individual title under State law, and distinguished between the rights of white and non-white citizens, who often had limited standing in court; and Indian removal was carried out under U.S. military jurisdiction, often by state militias. As a result, individual Indians who could prove U.S. citizenship were nevertheless displaced from newly annexed areas.

==Choctaw removal==


The Choctaw nation resided in large portions of what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. After a series of treaties starting in 1801, the Choctaw nation was reduced to . The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ceded the remaining country to the United States and was ratified in early 1831. The removals were only agreed to after a provision in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek allowed some Choctaw to remain. The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty presented by the federal government. President Jackson wanted strong negotiations with the Choctaws in Mississippi, and the Choctaws seemed much more cooperative than Andrew Jackson had imagined. The treaty provided that the United States would bear the expense of moving their homes and that they had to be removed within two and a half years of the signed treaty. The chief of the Choctaw nation, George W. Harkins, wrote to the citizens of the United States before the removals were to commence:

United States Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed George Gaines to manage the removals. Gaines decided to remove Choctaws in three phases starting in November 1831 and ending in 1833. The first groups met at Memphis and Vicksburg, where a harsh winter battered the emigrants with flash floods, sleet, and snow. Initially, the Choctaws were to be transported by wagon but floods halted them. With food running out, the residents of Vicksburg and Memphis were concerned. Five steamboats (the &quot;Walter Scott&quot;, the &quot;Brandywine&quot;, the &quot;Reindeer&quot;, the &quot;Talma&quot;, and the &quot;Cleopatra&quot;) would ferry Choctaws to their river-based destinations. The Memphis group traveled up the Arkansas for about to Arkansas Post. There the temperature stayed below freezing for almost a week with the rivers clogged with ice, so there could be no travel for weeks. Food rationing consisted of a handful of boiled corn, one turnip, and two cups of heated water per day. Forty government wagons were sent to Arkansas Post to transport them to Little Rock. When they reached Little Rock, a Choctaw chief referred to their trek as a &quot;trail of tears and death&quot;. The Vicksburg group was led by an incompetent guide and was lost in the Lake Providence swamps.

Alexis de Tocqueville, the French philosopher, witnessed the Choctaw removals while in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1831:

Nearly 17,000 Choctaws made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma. About 2,500–6,000 died along the trail of tears. Approximately 5,000–6,000 Choctaws remained in Mississippi in 1831 after the initial removal efforts. The Choctaws who chose to remain in newly formed Mississippi were subject to legal conflict, harassment, and intimidation. The Choctaws &quot;have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died&quot;. The Choctaws in Mississippi were later reformed as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the removed Choctaws became the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.

==Seminole resistance==
The U.S. acquired Florida from Spain via the Adams–Onís Treaty and took possession in 1821. In 1832 the Seminoles were called to a meeting at Payne&#x27;s Landing on the Ocklawaha River. The Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek nation, who considered them deserters; some of the Seminoles had been derived from Creek bands but also from other Indian nations. Those among the nation who once were members of Creek bands did not wish to move west to where they were certain that they would meet death for leaving the main band of Creek Indians. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already settled there, the seven chiefs signed a statement on March 28, 1833, that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the Indian nations and bands that resided on the reservation. The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834. On December 28, 1835, a group of Seminoles and blacks ambushed a U.S. Army company marching from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King in Ocala, killing all but three of the 110 army troops. This came to be known as the Dade Massacre.

As the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500 muskets. Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts, large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.

Other war chiefs such as Halleck Tustenuggee, Jumper, and Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse continued the Seminole resistance against the army. The war ended, after a full decade of fighting, in 1842. The U.S. government is estimated to have spent about $20,000,000 on the war, ($ today). Many Indians were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi; others retreated into the Everglades. In the end, the government gave up trying to subjugate the Seminole in their Everglades redoubts and left fewer than 500 Seminoles in peace. Other scholars state that at least several hundred Seminoles remained in the Everglades after the Seminole Wars.

As a result of the Seminole Wars, the surviving Seminole band of the Everglades claims to be the only federally recognized Indian nation which never relinquished sovereignty or signed a peace treaty with the United States.

In general the American people tended to view the Indian resistance as unwarranted. An article published by the Virginia &quot;Enquirer&quot; on January 26, 1836, called the &quot;Hostilities of the Seminoles&quot;, assigned all the blame for the violence that came from the Seminole&#x27;s resistance to the Seminoles themselves. The article accuses the Indians of not staying true to their word—the promises they supposedly made in the treaties and negotiations from the Indian Removal Act.

==Creek dissolution==


After the War of 1812, some Muscogee leaders such as William McIntosh and Chief Shelocta signed treaties that ceded more land to Georgia. The 1814 signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson signaled the end for the Creek Nation and for all Indians in the South. Friendly Creek leaders, like Shelocta and Big Warrior, addressed Sharp Knife (the Indian nickname for Andrew Jackson) and reminded him that they keep the peace. Nevertheless, Jackson retorted that they did not &quot;cut (Tecumseh&#x27;s) throat&quot; when they had the chance, so they must now cede Creek lands. Jackson also ignored Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent that restored sovereignty to Indians and their nations.

Eventually, the Creek Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions a capital offense. Nevertheless, on February 12, 1825, McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs, which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia. After the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, McIntosh was assassinated on April 30, 1825, by Creeks led by Menawa.

The Creek National Council, led by Opothle Yohola, protested to the United States that the Treaty of Indian Springs was fraudulent. President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic, and eventually, the treaty was nullified in a new agreement, the Treaty of Washington (1826). The historian R. Douglas Hurt wrote: &quot;The Creeks had accomplished what no Indian nation had ever done or would do again—achieve the annulment of a ratified treaty.&quot; However, Governor George Troup of Georgia ignored the new treaty and began to forcibly remove the Indians under the terms of the earlier treaty. At first, President Adams attempted to intervene with federal troops, but Troup called out the militia, and Adams, fearful of a civil war, conceded. As he explained to his intimates, &quot;The Indians are not worth going to war over.&quot;

Although the Creeks had been forced from Georgia, with many Lower Creeks moving to the Indian Territory, there were still about 20,000 Upper Creeks living in Alabama. However, the state moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws over the Creeks. Opothle Yohola appealed to the administration of President Andrew Jackson for protection from Alabama; when none was forthcoming, the Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March 24, 1832, which divided up Creek lands into individual allotments. Creeks could either sell their allotments and receive funds to remove to the west, or stay in Alabama and submit to state laws. The Creeks were never given a fair chance to comply with the terms of the treaty, however. Rampant illegal settlement of their lands by Americans continued unabated with federal and state authorities unable or unwilling to do much to halt it. Further, as recently detailed by historian Billy Winn in his thorough chronicle of the events leading to removal, a variety of fraudulent schemes designed to cheat the Creeks out of their allotments, many of them organized by speculators operating out of Columbus, Georgia and Montgomery, Alabama, were perpetrated after the signing of the Treaty of Cusseta. A portion of the beleaguered Creeks, many desperately poor and feeling abused and oppressed by their American neighbors, struck back by carrying out occasional raids on area farms and committing other isolated acts of violence. Escalating tensions erupted into open war with the United States after the destruction of the village of Roanoke, Georgia, located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory, in May 1836. During the so-called &quot;Creek War of 1836&quot; Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830 it continued into 1835 and after as in 1836 over 15,000 Creeks were driven from their land for the last time. 3,500 of those 15,000 Creeks did not survive the trip to Oklahoma where they eventually settled.

==Chickasaw monetary removal==


The Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836, the Chickasaws had reached an agreement to purchase land from the previously removed Choctaws after a bitter five-year debate. They paid the Choctaws $530,000 (equal to $ today) for the westernmost part of the Choctaw land. The first group of Chickasaws moved in 1837 and was led by John M. Millard. The Chickasaws gathered at Memphis on July 4, 1837, with all of their assets—belongings, livestock, and slaves. Once across the Mississippi River, they followed routes previously established by the Choctaws and the Creeks. Once in Indian Territory, the Chickasaws merged with the Choctaw nation.
==Cherokee forced relocation==


By 1838, about 2,000 Cherokee had voluntarily relocated from Georgia to Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). Forcible removals began in May 1838 when General Winfield Scott received a final order from President Martin Van Buren to relocate the remaining Cherokees. On 17 May 1838, General Scott issued Order No. 25, in the text he stated &quot; Every possible kindness, compatible with the necessity of removal, must, therefore, be shown by the troops, and, if, in the ranks, a despicable individual should be found, capable of inflicting a wanton injury or insult on any Cherokee man, woman or child, it is hereby made the special duty of the nearest good officer or man, instantly to interpose, and to seize and consign the guilty wretch to the severest penalty of the laws. The Major General is fully persuaded that this injunction will not be neglected by the brave men under his command, who cannot be otherwise than jealous of their own honor and that of their country.&quot; Approximately 4,000 Cherokees died in the ensuing trek to Oklahoma. In the Cherokee language, the event is called () or (). The Cherokee Trail of Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota, an agreement signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which exchanged Indian land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River, but which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people.

There were significant changes in gender relations within the Cherokee Nation during the implementation of the Indian Removal Act during the 1830s. Cherokee historically operated on a matrilineal kinship system, where children belonged to the clan of their mother and their only relatives were those who could be traced through her. In addition to being matrilineal, Cherokees were also matrilocal. According to the naturalist William Bartram, &quot;Marriage gives no right to the husband over the property of his wife; and when they part, she keeps the children and property belonging to them.&quot; In this way, the typical Cherokee family was structured in a way where the wife held possession to the property, house, and children. However, during the 1820s and 1830s, &quot;Cherokees [began adopting] the Anglo-American concept of power—a political system dominated by wealthy, highly acculturated men and supported by an ideology that made women … subordinate&quot;.

The Treaty of New Echota was largely signed by men. While women were present at the rump council negotiating the treaty, they did not have a seat at the table to participate in the proceedings. Historian Theda Perdue explains that &quot;Cherokee women met in their own councils to discuss their own opinions&quot; despite not being able to participate. The inability for women to join in on the negotiation and signing of the Treaty of New Echota shows how the role of women changed dramatically within Cherokee Nation following colonial encroachment. For instance, Cherokee women played a significant role in the negotiation of land transactions as late as 1785, where they spoke at a treaty conference held at Hopewell, South Carolina to clarify land cessions to the U.S. forced on the Cherokee due to their alliance with Britain during the American Revolutionary War.

The sparsely inhabited Cherokee lands were highly attractive to Georgian farmers experiencing population pressure, and illegal settlements resulted. Long-simmering tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1829, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the second gold rush in U.S. history. Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure mounted to fulfill the &quot;Compact of 1802&quot; in which the US Government promised to extinguish Indian land claims in the state of Georgia.

When Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case. However, in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government—not state governments—had authority in Indian affairs. &quot;Worcester v Georgia&quot; is associated with Andrew Jackson&#x27;s famous, though apocryphal, quote &quot;John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!&quot; In reality, this quote did not appear until 30 years after the incident and was first printed in a textbook authored by Jackson critic Horace Greeley.

Fearing open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia, Jackson decided not to enforce Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia. He was already embroiled in a constitutional crisis with South Carolina (i.e. the nullification crisis) and favored Cherokee relocation over civil war. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees to sign a removal treaty.

The final treaty, passed in Congress by a single vote, and signed by President Andrew Jackson, was imposed by his successor President Martin Van Buren. Van Buren allowed Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama an armed force of 7,000 militiamen, army regulars, and volunteers under General Winfield Scott to relocate about 13,000 Cherokees to Cleveland, Tennessee. After the initial roundup, the U.S. military oversaw the emigration to Oklahoma. Former Cherokee lands were immediately opened to settlement. Most of the deaths during the journey were caused by disease, malnutrition, and exposure during an unusually cold winter.

In the winter of 1838 the Cherokee began the march with scant clothing and most on foot without shoes or moccasins. The march began in Red Clay, Tennessee, the location of the last Eastern capital of the Cherokee Nation. Because of the diseases, the Indians were not allowed to go into any towns or villages along the way; many times this meant traveling much farther to go around them. After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky, they arrived at the Ohio River across from Golconda in southern Illinois about the 3rd of December 1838. Here the starving Indians were charged a dollar a head (equal to $ today) to cross the river on &quot;Berry&#x27;s Ferry&quot; which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $ today. They were not allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and were forced to take shelter under &quot;Mantle Rock&quot;, a shelter bluff on the Kentucky side, until &quot;Berry had nothing better to do&quot;. Many died huddled together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross. Several Cherokee were murdered by locals. The Cherokee filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government through the courthouse in Vienna, suing the government for $35 a head (equal to $ today) to bury the murdered Cherokee.

As they crossed southern Illinois, on December 26, Martin Davis, commissary agent for Moses Daniel&#x27;s detachment, wrote:

There is the coldest weather in Illinois I ever experienced anywhere. The streams are all frozen over something like thick. We are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and animals. It snows here every two or three days at the fartherest. We are now camped in Mississippi [River] swamp from the river, and there is no possible chance of crossing the river for the of ice that comes floating down the river every day. We have only traveled on the last month, including the time spent at this place, which has been about three weeks. It is unknown when we shall cross the river...

A volunteer soldier from Georgia who participated in the removal recounted:

I fought through the civil war and have seen men shot to pieces and slaughtered by thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.

It eventually took almost three months to cross the on land between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The trek through southern Illinois is where the Cherokee suffered most of their deaths. However a few years before forced removal, some Cherokee who opted to leave their homes voluntarily chose a water-based route through the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. It took only 21 days, but the Cherokee who were forcibly relocated were wary of water travel.

Environmental researchers David Gaines and Jere Krakow outline the &quot;context of the tragic Cherokee relocation&quot; as one predicated on the difference between &quot;Indian regard for the land, and its contrast with the Euro-Americans view of land as property&quot;. This divergence in perspective on land, according to sociologists Gregory Hooks and Chad L. Smith, led to the homes of American Indian people &quot;being donated and sold off&quot; by the United States government to &quot;promote the settlement and development of the West,&quot; with railroad developers, white settlers, land developers, and mining companies assuming ownership. In American Indian society, according to Colville scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, it caused &quot;the loss of ancient connections to homelands and sacred sites,&quot; &quot;the deaths of upward of 25 percent of those on the trail&quot; and &quot;the loss of life-sustaining livestock and crops.&quot;

Dina Gilio-Whitaker draws on research by Choctaw and Chippewa historian Clara Sue Kidwell to show the relationship between the Trail of Tears and a negative impact on the environment. In tracking the environmental changes of the southeastern tribes who relocated to new lands across the Trail of Tears, Kidwell finds that &quot;prior to removal the tribes had already begun adapting to a cash-based, private property economic system with their adoption of many European customs (including the practice of slave owning), after their move west they had become more deeply entrenched into the American economic system with the discovery of coal deposits and the western expansion of the railroads on and through their lands. So while they adapted to their new environments, their relationship to land would change to fit the needs of an imposed capitalist system&quot;. Cherokee ethnobotanist Clint Carroll illustrates how this imposed capitalist system altered Cherokee efforts to protect traditional medicinal plants during relocation, saying that &quot;these changes have resulted in contrasting land management paradigms, rooted in the language of &#x27;resource-based&#x27; versus &#x27;relationship-based&#x27; approaches, a binary imposed on tribal governments by the Bureau of Indian Affairs through their historically paternalistic relationship&quot;. This shift in land management as a function of removal had negative environmental ramifications such as solidifying &quot;a deeply entrenched bureaucratic structure that still drives much of the federal-tribal relationship and determines how tribal governments use their lands, sometimes in ways that contribute to climate change and, in extreme cases, ways that lead to human rights abuses&quot;.

In addition to a physical relocation, American Indian removal and the Trail of Tears had social and cultural effects as American Indians were forced &quot;to contemplate abandonment of their native land. To the Cherokees life was a part of the land. Every rock, every tree, every place had a spirit. And the spirit was central to the tribal lifeway. To many, the thought of loss of place was a thought of loss of self, loss of Cherokeeness, and a loss of life- way&quot;. This cultural shift is characterized by Gilio-Whitaker as &quot;environmental deprivation,&quot; a concept that &quot;relates to historical processes of land and resource dispossession calculated to bring about the destruction of Indigenous Americans&#x27; lives and cultures. Environmental deprivation in this sense refers to actions by settlers and settler governments that are designed to block Native peoples&#x27; access to life-giving and culture-affirming resources&quot;. The separation of American Indian people from their land lead to the loss of cultural knowledge and practices, as described by scholar Rachel Robison-Greene, who finds the &quot;legacy of fifteenth-century European colonial domination&quot; led to &quot;Indigenous knowledge and perspectives&quot; being &quot;ignored and denigrated by the vast majority of social, physical, biological and agricultural scientists, and governments using colonial powers to exploit Indigenous resources&quot;. Indigenous cultural and intellectual contribution to &quot;environmental issues&quot; in the form of a &quot;rich history, cultural customs, and practical wisdom regarding sustainable environmental practices&quot; can be lost because of Indigenous removal and the Trail of Tears, according to Greene.

Removed Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. When signing the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 Major Ridge said &quot;I have signed my death warrant.&quot; The resulting political turmoil led to the killings of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of the leaders of the Treaty Party, only Stand Watie escaped death. The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded, and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the United States.

There were some exceptions to removal. Approximately 100 Cherokees evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states. Those Cherokees who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina, about 400 Cherokees, sometimes referred to as the Oconaluftee Cherokee due to their settlement near to the river of the same name, lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal. Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U.S. Army in hunting down and capturing the family of the old prophet, Tsali, who was executed by a firing squad as were most of his family. These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation.

A local newspaper, the &quot;Highland Messenger&quot;, said July 24, 1840, &quot;that between nine hundred and a thousand of these deluded beings … are still hovering about the homes of their fathers, in the counties of Macon and Cherokee&quot; and &quot;that they are a great annoyance to the citizens&quot; who wanted to buy land there believing the Cherokee were gone; the newspaper reported that President Martin Van Buren said &quot;they … are, in his opinion, free to go or stay.&#x27;

Several Cherokee speakers throughout history offered first-hand accounts of the events of the Trail of Tears as well as provided insight into its lasting effects. Elias Budinot, Major Ridge, Speckled Snake, John Ross, and Richard Taylor were all notable Cherokee orators during the 19th century who used the speech as a form of resistance against the U.S. government. John Ross, the Cherokee Chief from 1828 to 1866, and Major Ridge embarked on a speaking tour within the Cherokee Nation itself in hopes of strengthening a sense of unity amongst the tribal members. Tribal unity was a central tenet to Cherokee resistance, with Ross stating in his council address: &quot;&#x27;Much…depends on our unity of sentiment and firmness of action, in maintaining those sacred rights which we have ever enjoyed&#x27;&quot;. Cherokee speeches like this were made even more important because the state of Georgia made it illegal for members of American Indian tribes to both speak to an all-white court and convince other Indian tribal members not to move.

Another influential Cherokee figure was Cherokee writer John Ridge, son of Major Ridge, who wrote four articles using the pseudonym &quot;Socrates&quot;. His works were published in the Cherokee Phoenix, the nation&#x27;s newspaper. The choice of pseudonym, according to literary scholar Kelly Wisecup, &quot;...facilitated a rhetorical structure that created not only a public persona recognizable to the Phoenix&#x27;s multiple readerships but also a public character who argued forcefully that white readers should respect Cherokee rights and claims&quot;. The main focal points of Ridge&#x27;s articles critiqued the perceived hypocrisy of the U.S. government, colonial history, and the events leading up to the Trail of Tears, using excerpts from American and European history and literature.

=== Eastern Cherokee Restitution ===
The United States Court of Claims ruled in favor of the Eastern Cherokee Nation&#x27;s claim against the U.S. on May 18, 1905. This resulted in the appropriation of $1 million (equal to $27,438,023.04 today) to the Nation&#x27;s eligible individuals and families. Interior Department employee Guion Miller created a list using several rolls and applications to verify tribal enrollment for the distribution of funds, known as the Guion Miller Roll. The applications received documented over 125,000 individuals; the court approved more than 30,000 individuals to share in the funds.

===Terminology===
The events have sometimes been referred to as &quot;death marches&quot;, in particular when referring to the Cherokee march across Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri in 1838.

Indians who had the means initially provided for their own removal. Contingents that were led by conductors from the U.S. Army included those led by Edward Deas, who was claimed to be a sympathizer for the Cherokee plight. The largest death toll from the Cherokee forced relocation comes from the period after the May 23, 1838 deadline. This was at the point when the remaining Cherokee were rounded up into camps and placed into large groups, often over 700 in size. Communicable diseases spread quickly through these closely quartered groups, killing many. These groups were among the last to move, but following the same routes the others had taken; the areas they were going through had been depleted of supplies due to the vast numbers that had gone before them. The marchers were subject to extortion and violence along the route. In addition, these final contingents were forced to set out during the hottest and coldest months of the year, killing many. Exposure to the elements, disease, starvation, harassment by local frontiersmen, and insufficient rations similarly killed up to one-third of the Choctaw and other nations on the march. There exists some debate among historians and the affected nations as to whether the term &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; should be used to refer to the entire history of forced relocations from the Eastern United States into Indian Territory, to the relocations of specifically the Five Civilized Tribes, to the route of the march, or to specific marches in which the remaining holdouts from each area were rounded up.

==== Classification debate ====
There is debate among historians about how the Trail of Tears should be classified. Some historians classify the events as a form of ethnic cleansing; others refer to it as genocide.

Historian and biographer Robert V. Remini wrote that Jackson&#x27;s policy on Native Americans was based on good intentions. He writes: &quot;Jackson fully expected the Indians to thrive in their new surroundings, educate their children, acquire the skills of white civilization so as to improve their living conditions, and become citizens of the United States. Removal, in his mind, would provide all these blessings...Jackson genuinely believed that what he had accomplished rescued these people from inevitable annihilation.&quot; Historian Sean Wilentz writes that some critics who label Indian removal as genocide view Jacksonian democracy as a &quot;momentous transition from the ethical community upheld by antiremoval men&quot;, and says this view is a caricature of US history that &quot;turns tragedy into melodrama, exaggerates parts at the expense of the whole, and sacrifices nuance for sharpness&quot;. Historian Donald B. Cole, too, argues that it is difficult to find evidence of a conscious desire for genocide in Jackson&#x27;s policy on Native Americans, but dismisses the idea that Jackson was motivated by the welfare of Native Americans. Colonial historian Daniel Blake Smith disagrees with the usage of the term genocide, adding that &quot;no one wanted, let alone planned for, Cherokees to die in the forced removal out West&quot;.

Historian Justin D. Murphy argues that:

In contrast, some scholars have debated that the Trail of Tears was a genocidal act. Historian Jeffrey Ostler argues that the threat of genocide was used to ensure Natives&#x27; compliance with removal policies, and concludes that, &quot;In its outcome and in the means used to gain compliance, the policy had genocidal dimensions.&quot; Patrick Wolfe argues that settler colonialism and genocide are interrelated but should be distinguished from each other, writing that settler colonialism is &quot;more than the summary liquidation of Indigenous people, though it includes that.&quot; Wolfe describes the assimilation of Indigenous people who escaped relocation (and particularly their abandonment of collectivity) as a form of cultural genocide, though he emphasises that cultural genocide is “the real thing” in that it resulted in large numbers of deaths. The Trail of Tears was thus a settler-colonial &quot;replacement&quot; of Indigenous people and culture in addition to a genocidal mass-killing according to Wolfe. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz describes the policy as genocide, saying: &quot;The fledgling United States government&#x27;s method of dealing with native people—a process which then included systematic genocide, property theft, and total subjugation—reached its nadir in 1830 under the federal policy of President Andrew Jackson.&quot; Mankiller emphasises that Jackson&#x27;s policies were the natural extension of much earlier genocidal policies toward Native Americans established through territorial expansion during the Jefferson administration.

Dina Gilio-Whitaker, in &quot;As Long as Grass Grows&quot;, describes the Trail of Tears and the Diné long walk as structural genocide, because they destroyed Native relations to land, one another, and nonhuman beings which imperiled their culture, life, and history. According to her, these are ongoing actions that constitute both cultural and physical genocide.

=== Landmarks and commemorations ===

In 1987, about of trails were authorized by federal law to mark the removal of 17 detachments of the Cherokee people. Called the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, it traverses portions of nine states and includes land and water routes.

==== Trail of Tears outdoor historical drama, &quot;Unto These Hills&quot; ====
A historical drama based on the Trail of Tears, &quot;Unto These Hills&quot; written by Kermit Hunter, has sold over five million tickets for its performances since its opening on July 1, 1950, both touring and at the outdoor Mountainside Theater of the Cherokee Historical Association in Cherokee, North Carolina.

==== Remember the Removal bike ride ====
A regular event, the &quot;Remember the Removal Bike Ride,&quot; entails six cyclists from the Cherokee Nation to ride over 950 miles while retracing the same path that their ancestors took. The cyclists, who average about 60 miles a day, start their journey in the former capital of the Cherokee Nation, New Echota, Georgia, and finish in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. In June 2024, Shawna Baker, justice of the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court was a mentor cyclist on the 40th commemorative ride.

==== Commemorative medallion ====
Cherokee artist Troy Anderson was commissioned to design the &quot;Cherokee Trail of Tears Sesquicentennial Commemorative Medallion&quot;. The falling-tear medallion shows a seven-pointed star, the symbol of the seven clans of the Cherokees.

* Ruth Muskrat Bronson, a Cherokee scholar and poet, was a more contemporary figure who wrote a poem titled &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; that enshrined the devastation faced by the Cherokee nation that still permeates Indigenous conscience today:
From the homes their fathers made // From the graves the tall trees shade // For the sake of greed and gold, // The Cherokees were forced to go // To a land they did not know; // And Father Time or wisdom old // Cannot erase, through endless years // The memory of the trail of tears.

<text>Hellraiser is a 1987 British supernatural horror film written and directed by Clive Barker in his directorial debut. Based on Barker&#x27;s 1986 novella &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;, the film&#x27;s plot concerns a mystical puzzle box that summons the Cenobites, a group of extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic beings who cannot differentiate between pain and pleasure. It stars Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence, and Doug Bradley as the leader of the Cenobites, identified in the sequels as &quot;Pinhead&quot;.

Development of the film began before Barker&#x27;s novella was published. Disappointed by previous adaptations of his work, Barker elected to direct himself, appropriating several actors and crew from his earlier career as a playwright. With the backing of independent producer Christopher Figg and financing from New World Pictures, filming took place in London in autumn 1986.

&quot;Hellraiser&quot; had its first public showing at the Prince Charles Cinema on 10 September 1987. It was widely released in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film Distributors, and was a considerable commercial success, grossing $30 million from its $1 million production budget. Critical reception was initially divided, but the film has since been evaluated as a classic of the horror genre.

The film was followed by nine sequels, the first seven of which featured Bradley reprising his role as Pinhead. A franchise reboot, also titled &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and executive produced by Barker, was released in 2022.

==Plot==

In Morocco, Frank Cotton, a hedonist, buys a puzzle box said to open the door to a realm of otherworldly pleasure. At home in his bare attic, Frank solves the puzzle and hooked chains emerge, tearing him apart. A black-robed figure resets the puzzle and the room is restored to normal.

Later, Frank&#x27;s brother Larry moves into the same house. He intends to rebuild his relationship with his second wife, Julia. Larry is unaware that Julia had an affair with his brother Frank before her marriage to him. When Larry accidentally cuts his hand moving furniture, his blood drips on the attic floor and resurrects Frank in a ghoulish form. Julia later finds Frank; still obsessed with him, she agrees to help restore his body, so they can run away together. Julia picks up men in bars and brings them back to the attic, where she mortally wounds them. Frank then drains their life, which regenerates his body. Frank explains to Julia that, having exhausted all sensory experiences, he sought out the puzzle box, which was supposed to provide access to a realm of new carnal pleasures. When the puzzle was solved, the &quot;Cenobites&quot; came to subject him to extreme sadomasochism.

Kirsty, Larry&#x27;s teenage daughter and Frank&#x27;s niece, sees Julia bringing a man to the house and follows her to the attic, where she finds Frank. She evades Frank and escapes with the puzzle box, collapsing shortly thereafter. Awakening in a hospital, Kirsty solves the box out of curiosity, and unknowingly summons the Cenobites and a monster called the Engineer, from which she narrowly escapes. The Cenobites&#x27; leader (referred to by fans as &quot;Pinhead&quot;) explains that although they have been perceived as both angels and demons, they are simply &quot;explorers&quot; from another dimension seeking carnal experiences, and they can no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure. When they attempt to force Kirsty to return to their realm with them, she informs Pinhead that Frank has escaped them. The Cenobites agree to spare Kirsty and recapture Frank instead, with the condition that Frank must confess to escaping them.

Kirsty returns home, where Frank has killed Larry and has taken on his identity by wearing his skin. Julia shows her what is purported to be Frank&#x27;s flayed corpse in the attic. Julia then leaves the attic, locking the door behind her. The Cenobites appear and, not fooled by the deception, demand the man who &quot;did this&quot;. Kirsty tries to escape, but is held by Julia and Frank. Frank reveals his true identity to Kirsty and, when his sexual advances are rejected, he decides to kill her to complete his rejuvenation. He accidentally stabs Julia instead and drains her without remorse. Frank chases Kirsty to the attic and, when he is about to kill her, the Cenobites appear after hearing him confess to killing her father. Now certain he is the one they are looking for, they ensnare him with chains with hooks and tear him to pieces. When the Cenobites double-cross Kirsty and attempt to take her, she grabs the puzzle box from Julia&#x27;s dead hands and banishes them by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box. Kirsty&#x27;s boyfriend Steve arrives and they both escape the collapsing house.

Afterwards, Kirsty throws the puzzle box onto a burning pyre. A vagrant who has been stalking Kirsty walks into the fire and retrieves the box before transforming into a winged skeletal creature and flying away. The box ends up with the same merchant who sold it to Frank, where he offers it to another customer.

==Cast==
==Production==
Having been dismayed at prior cinematic adaptations of his work, Barker, who had experience from writing, directing and starring in plays and had made two short films, decided to attempt to direct a film himself. He asked Christopher Figg, who became his producer, how small the budget would have to be for someone being willing to hire him as a first time director. Figg said the budget had to be less than a million dollars, which could be done if the film was just about a house and some monsters, and if he used more or less unknown actors. Barker decided to adapt &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;, as the story fit those parameters. New World Pictures agreed to fund the film for $900,000.

&quot;Hellraiser&quot; was filmed at the end of 1986 and was set to be made in seven weeks, but was extended over a nine- to ten-week period by New World. The film was originally made under the working title of &quot;Sadomasochists from Beyond the Grave&quot;. Barker also wanted to call the film &quot;Hellbound&quot; but producer Christopher Figg suggested &quot;Hellraiser&quot; instead. Barker spoke fondly in &quot;The Hellraiser Chronicles&quot; about the filming, stating that his memories of production were of &quot;unalloyed fondness ... The cast treated my ineptitudes kindly, and the crew were no less forgiving&quot;. Barker admitted his own lack of knowledge on filmmaking, stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t know the difference between a 10-millimetre lens and a 35-millimetre lens. If you&#x27;d shown me a plate of spaghetti and said that was a lens, I might have believed you&quot;. After filming, New World convinced Barker to relocate the story to the United States which required overdubbing to remove some English accents.

During production, Doug Bradley had trouble hitting his marks during his takes in make-up as he could not see through his black contact lenses and was afraid of tripping over Pinhead&#x27;s skirts. The special effects of the unnamed creature, known as &quot;The Engineer&quot; in the novels, proved challenging as the creature was difficult to maneuver. Other issues included a rushed shoot of the Chinese restaurant scene with Kirsty and Larry, due to the lateness of the person responsible for letting the cast and crew into the establishment. Numerous props of Lemarchand&#x27;s box, constructed from wood and cut-out brass, were produced by special effects designer and maker Simon Sayce; due to the box&#x27;s delicate construction, Sayce would lie on the floor under the Cenobites during some takes in case it was dropped, to save himself the eight hours it took to create another.

About seven or eight weeks after principal photography had finished the executive producers saw the footage and liked the film enough to invest some more in it, and so a few scenes were redone with a higher budget, like the scene near the end where Frank&#x27;s body is ripped apart. To produce Frank&#x27;s resurrection, effects like reverse motion were used to give his skeleton flesh and inner organs.

The film had two editors: Richard Marden and an uncredited Tony Randel.

==Censorship==
Clive Barker had to make some cuts on the film after the MPAA originally gave it an X rating. Two and a half shots were excised from the first hammer murder, including a closeup of the hammer lodged in the victim&#x27;s head. In the scene where Julia murders another man, the actor playing the victim felt that it made sense for him to do so naked. The nude murder scene was shot but, ultimately, replaced with a semi-clothed version. Close-ups of Kirsty sticking her hand into Frank&#x27;s stomach, exposing his guts, a longer version of the scene where Frank is being torn into pieces, and the final shot where his head explodes were also cut.

In an interview for &quot;Samhain&quot; magazine in July 1987, Barker mentioned some problems that censors had with more erotic scenes in the film:

Barker also said that the seduction scene between Julia and Frank was initially a lot more explicit: 
==Soundtrack==

Barker originally wanted the electronic music group Coil to perform the music for the film, but that notion was rejected by New World. Editor Tony Randel then suggested Christopher Young as a replacement for Coil for the film&#x27;s score. Young had previously composed scores for other horror films such as the 1985 slasher &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and the 1986 Tobe Hooper film &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;.

The score for &quot;Hellraiser&quot; was released in 1987. AllMusic stated that the score proved that Christopher Young &quot;hadn&#x27;t used up all of his ideas for the horror genre&quot; and that Young had matched &quot;Barker&#x27;s stylish look with a gothic score that mixed in exciting synthesizer effects&quot;. The music that Coil had recorded as a demo for their version of the score was later released as &quot;The Unreleased Themes for Hellraiser&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Hellraiser&quot; had its first public showing at the Prince Charles Cinema on 10 September 1987. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 18 September.

&quot;Hellraiser&quot; was initially banned in Ontario by the Ontario Film and Video Review Board. By a 3–2 majority vote, the film was deemed &quot;not approved in its entirety as it contravenes community standards&quot;. It was banned because of its &quot;brutal, graphic violence with blood-letting throughout, horror, degradation and torture&quot;. In August 1987, &quot;Hellraiser&quot; was passed by the Ontario Film Review Board, but only after several cuts were made to the film. New World Mutual Pictures of Canada cut about 40 seconds to get the film passed with an R rating. Thirty-five seconds of an extended torture scene featuring hooks pulling apart a body and face were removed, as well as a scene of squirming rats nailed to a wall.

&quot;Hellraiser&quot; received a wide theatrical re-release in the United States on 5 and 6 February 2025, accompanied by featurette &quot;Under the Skin: Doug Bradley on Hellraiser&quot;.

===Home media===
In North America, &quot;Hellraiser&quot; has been released by Anchor Bay Entertainment three times, all of which are the original 93-minute version of the film (this is the only version to ever be released on DVD). The original DVD release was a &quot;barebones&quot; release and is now out of print. It was reissued in 2000 with a new 5.1 mix mastered in THX. Finally, it was packaged along with &quot;&quot; in a Limited Edition tin case which included a 48-page colour booklet and a reproduction theatrical poster for both films. Anchor Bay released the film on Blu-ray in 2009. This version retains all of the special features found on the 20th anniversary special edition DVD. In 2011, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Image Entertainment under the &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; series label. This version contains no special features. However, various Blu-ray releases have since emerged with a highly variable selection of special features, although most of these are recycled from previous DVD releases.

In October 2015, Arrow Films released the film on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom along with &quot;Hellbound: Hellraiser II&quot; and &quot;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&quot; in a Scarlet Box edition featuring new 2K restorations and extensive list of bonus features including feature-length documentaries on the first 2 films and a bonus disc containing additional content such as two short films by Clive Barker. The Scarlet Box is now out of print in the UK and replaced by a three-film edition of the set without the bonus disc.

A US version of the Scarlet Box (with the same material) was released by Arrow on 20 December 2016.

In celebration of the 30th anniversary of the film, Clive Barker has adapted his early &quot;Hell Priest&quot; concept designs for the Lead Cenobite into an officially licensed mask for Composite Effects. Only a limited quantity of thirty of these masks were made and then released to the public on 24 March 2017. As part of the Anniversary, &quot;Hellraiser&quot; was re-released via Blu-Ray in a SteelBook edition on 30 October. It additionally received a theatrical screening at the Prince Charles Cinema, where it made its world premiere in 1987. A remixed and remastered version of Christopher Young&#x27;s score was also made available, debuting at the Anniversary screening.

==Reception==
&quot;Hellraiser&quot; grossed $14,564,000 in the United States and Canada, £763,412 in the United Kingdom and $30 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
For contemporary reviews in the United Kingdom, &quot;Time Out London&quot; referred to the film as &quot;Barker&#x27;s dazzling debut&quot; that &quot;creates such an atmosphere of dread that the astonishing set-pieces simply detonate in a chain reaction of cumulative intensity&quot; and concluded that the film was &quot;a serious, intelligent and disturbing horror film&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that &quot;Barker has achieved a fine degree of menace&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described it as &quot;the best horror film ever to be made in Britain&quot;. Kim Newman writing for the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; noted that the most immediately striking aspect of the movie is its seriousness of tone in an era when horror films (the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; or &quot;Evil Dead&quot; films in particular) tend to be broadly comic&quot;. Newman stated that the film &quot;suffers from a few minor compromises: notably a decision made fairly late in shooting to change the specifically English setting for an ambiguous (and unbelievable) mid-Atlantic one&quot;. Newman also noted that the Cenobites were &quot;well used suggestive figures&quot; but &quot;their monster companion is a more blunderingly obvious concession to the gross-out tastes of the teenage drive-in audience&quot;. Newman concluded that the film was &quot;a return to the cutting edge of horror cinema&quot; and that in more gruesome moments the film &quot;is a reminder of the grand guignol intensity that has recently tended to disintegrate into lazy splatter&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Hellraiser&quot; does have its share of problems: the re-dubbing of peripheral character with a mid-Atlantic twang, the relocation of the film in a geographical limbo [...] The film, however, cannot be faulted for the ambitiousness of its themes [...] Sadly the moral and emotional complexity that is the film&#x27;s greatest strength is likely to be deemed its greatest weakness by an audience weaned on the misplaced jocularity of &quot;House&quot; or &quot;Fright Night&quot;&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Barker cast &quot;singularly uninteresting actors&quot; while &quot;the special effects aren&#x27;t bad – only damp&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to the film as a &quot;dark, frequently disturbing and occasionally terrifying film&quot; but also argued that &quot;Barker&#x27;s vision hasn&#x27;t quite made the conversion from paper to celluloid [...] There are some weaknesses, particularly the framing of close-ups and the generic score, but there are some moments of genuinely inventive gore [...] the film falls apart at its climax, degenerating to a surprisingly lame ending full of special effects and triumphant good&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film one-half of a star out of four and deemed it &quot;as dreary a piece of goods as has masqueraded as horror in many a long, cold night. This is one of those movies you sit through with mounting dread, as the fear grows inside of you that it will indeed turn out to be feature length&quot; and that &quot;this is a movie without wit, style or reason, and the true horror is that actors were made to portray, and technicians to realize, its bankruptcy of imagination&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; stated that &quot;Hellraiser&quot; is &quot;well made, well acted, and the visual effects are generally handled with skill&quot;.

In the early 2010s, &quot;Time Out London&quot; conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. &quot;Hellraiser&quot; placed at number 80 on their top 100 list.

== Sequels and remake==

&quot;Hellraiser&quot; was followed by nine sequels, the first seven of which featured Doug Bradley reprising his role as Pinhead. Clive Barker has stated that he signed away the story and character rights to the production company prior to the release of the first film, not realizing the critical and financial success it would be.

Plans for a &quot;Hellraiser&quot; remake were publicized in October 2007, when Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury were reported to be directing, with Barker producing and Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton writing the script. After Maury and Bustillo left the project, Todd Farmer and Patrick Lussier were attached, with production slated for an early 2012 release. However, following the release of &quot;&quot; (2011) to secure continuing rights, Farmer and Lussier were no longer involved. By 2018, after the critical and commercial success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, Miramax Films had confirmed plans for new &quot;Hellraiser&quot; installments. The film was green-lit in early 2019, with David Bruckner directing from a script written by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski. It was released on Hulu in October 2022. A &quot;Hellraiser&quot; television series is in development at HBO.

<text>Milton James Rhode Acorn (March 30, 1923 – August 20, 1986), nicknamed &quot;The People&#x27;s Poet&quot; by his peers, was a Canadian poet, writer, and playwright.

==Early life==
He was born in Prince Edward Island, and grew up in Charlottetown. He joined the armed forces during World War II at the age of eighteen.

==Career==

During World War II, on a trans-Atlantic crossing, Acorn suffered a wound from depth charges. The wound was severe enough for him to receive a disability pension from Veterans Affairs for most of his life. He returned to Prince Edward Island and moved to Montreal, Quebec in 1956 and was for a time a member of the Labor-Progressive Party. He spent several years living at the Hotel Waverly in Toronto, Ontario.

In Montreal, he published some of his early poems in the political magazine, &quot;New Frontiers&quot;. In 1956 he self-published a mimeographed chapbook, &quot;In Love and Anger,&quot; his first collection of poems. In the 1950s some of his poetry was published in the magazine &quot;Canadian Forum&quot;.

He was for a short time married to poet Gwendolyn MacEwen.

In the mid-1960s, he moved to Vancouver and joined the League for Socialist Action. In 1967, Acorn helped found the &quot;underground&quot; newspaper &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; in Vancouver, BC. In 1969 he published his poetry collection &quot;I&#x27;ve Tasted My Blood&quot;.

Acorn was awarded the &quot;Canadian Poets Award&quot; in 1970 and the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1976 for his collection of poems, &quot;The Island Means Minago&quot;. In 1977, Acorn introduced the Jackpine sonnet, a form designed to be as irregular and spikey (and Canadian) as a jack pine tree, but with internal structure and integrity. Without a fixed number of lines and with varied line lengths, the Jackpine sonnet depends on interweaving internal rhymes, assonance and occasional end-rhymes.

In July 1986, he suffered a heart attack and was admitted to the hospital. Acorn died in his home town of Charlottetown on August 20, 1986, due to complications associated with his heart condition and diabetes. According to fellow poet and friend Jim Deahl, he had &quot;lost his will to live after the death of a younger sister.&quot;

==Milton Acorn People&#x27;s Poetry Award==
In 1987, the Milton Acorn People&#x27;s Poetry Award was established in his memory by Ted Plantos. It is presented annually to an outstanding &quot;people&#x27;s poet.&quot; The award was initially $250 (since raised to $500) and a medallion, modelled after the one given to Milton Acorn.

==Acorn on film==
In 1971 Acorn was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Milton Acorn: The People’s Poet&quot;, which was aired on the CBC program &quot;Thirty Minutes&quot;. The National Film Board of Canada produced two films on Acorn&#x27;s life and works. The first is entitled &quot;In Love and Anger: Milton Acorn - Poet,&quot; and came out in 1984. The second is called &quot;A Wake for Milton&quot;. It was produced in 1988.

<doc id="71978" wikidata="Q1068289" url="?curid=71978" title="Chatsworth House">
<text>Chatsworth House is a stately home in the Derbyshire Dales, north-east of Bakewell and west of Chesterfield, England. The seat of the Duke of Devonshire, it has belonged to the Cavendish family since 1549. It stands on the east bank of the River Derwent, across from hills between the Derwent and Wye valleys, amid parkland backed by wooded hills that rise to heather moorland. 

The house holds major collections of paintings, furniture, Old Master drawings, neoclassical sculptures and books. Chosen several times as Britain&#x27;s favourite country house, it is a Grade I listed property from the 17th century, altered in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 2011–2012 it underwent a £14-million restoration. The owner is the Chatsworth House Trust, an independent charitable foundation formed in 1981, on behalf of the Cavendish family.

==History==
===11th–16th centuries===

The name &#x27;Chatsworth&#x27; is a corruption of &quot;Chetel&#x27;s-worth&quot;, meaning &quot;the Court of Chetel&quot;. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, a man of Norse origin named Chetel (Danish-Norwegian: Ketil) held lands jointly with a Saxon named Leotnoth in three townships: Ednesoure to the west of the Derwent, and Langoleie and Chetesuorde to the east. Chetel was deposed after the Norman Conquest, and in the Domesday Book of 1086 the Manor of Chetesuorde is listed as the property of the Crown in the custody of William de Peverel. Chatsworth ceased to be a large estate, until the 15th century when it was acquired by the Leche family who owned property nearby. They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir William Cavendish, Treasurer of the King&#x27;s Chamber and the husband of Bess of Hardwick, who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county.

Bess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished needlewoman, Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the Oxburgh Hangings. Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, Henry. The estate was purchased from Henry by his brother William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, for £10,000.

===17th century===

Few changes were made at Chatsworth until the mid-17th century. William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire, a staunch Royalist, was expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestered. Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until The Restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe.

The famed political philosopher Thomas Hobbes spent the last four or five years of his life at Chatsworth Hall, then owned by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire. He had been a friend of the family for nearly 70 years, having taken a job tutoring the 2nd Earl shortly after graduating from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1608. Hobbes died at another Cavendish family estate, Hardwick Hall, in December 1679. After his death, many of Hobbes&#x27; manuscripts were found at Chatsworth House. 

William Cavendish, 4th Earl of Devonshire, who became the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced Whig. He was forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of King James II. This called for rebuilding the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish aimed initially to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments and so decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, although its layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large parterre gardens designed by George London and Henry Wise, who was later appointed by Queen Anne as Royal Gardener at Kensington Palace.

===18th century===
William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire, and William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire, made no changes to the house or gardens, but both contributed much to the collection found at Chatsworth at the time. Connoisseurs of the arts, they included in the collection paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by William Kent was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had Devonshire House in London rebuilt after a fire in 1733. When Devonshire House was sold and demolished in 1924, the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth.

The 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west. He had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house, and replaced the 1st Duke&#x27;s formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Capability Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.

In 1748, the 4th Duke married Lady Charlotte Boyle, the sole surviving heiress of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including Chiswick House. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent-designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family.

In 1774, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, married Georgiana Spencer famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. The film &quot;The Duchess&quot; portrayed their life together. Georgiana was the great-great-great-great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales; their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.

===19th century===
The 6th Duke (known as &quot;the Bachelor Duke&quot;) was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector, who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates: Chatsworth and Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, Burlington House and Chiswick House in London, Bolton Abbey and Londesborough Hall in Yorkshire, and Lismore Castle in Ireland. These covered of land in England and Ireland.
The Duke was a collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of Sir Jeffry Wyatville, it included a purpose-built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection. He took over several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he was purchasing at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country-house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set from the period to survive with their original furnishings. There is much eastern influence in the decoration, including hand-painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics typical of Regency taste, which developed in the reign of George IV (1762–1830). Those who stayed at Chatsworth included Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens.
In October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, visited Chatsworth, where the Princess had her first formal adult dinner at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another chance to welcome Victoria in 1843, when the Queen and Prince Albert returned to enjoy an array of illumination in the gardens, in the conservatory and on the fountains, forming a scene of &quot;unparalleled display and grandeur&quot;, according to one guest.

The Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A Latin inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates, &quot;William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840.&quot; The year 1688 was that of the Glorious Revolution, supported by the Whig dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 brought the death of the Duke&#x27;s beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future 7th Duke. 

In 1844, the 6th Duke privately printed and published a book called &quot;Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick&quot;, giving a history of the Cavendish family&#x27;s two main estates. It was praised by Charles Dickens.

In 1888, the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Chatsworth, California, was named after the estate.

===20th century===

Social change and taxes in the early 20th century began to affect the Devonshires&#x27; lifestyle. When the 8th Duke died in 1908 over £500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared with that of 42 years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke&#x27;s extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke&#x27;s business ventures at Barrow-in-Furness, and the depression in British agriculture apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by William Caxton and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four Shakespeare folios and 39 Shakespeare quartos, to the Huntington Library in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in Somerset, Sussex and Derbyshire were also sold during or just after the First World War.

In December 1904, King Charles I of Portugal and Queen Maria Amélia stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to Britain. It snowed almost constantly while they were there and the King reportedly started a snowball fight, in which the assembled ladies joined enthusiastically, when he met the Marquis of Soveral, the Portuguese Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St James&#x27;s.

In 1920 the family&#x27;s London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a site in Piccadilly, was sold to developers and demolished. Much of its contents went to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near The Mall was acquired. The Great Conservatory in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished, as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it and all the plants had died during the war, when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To reduce running costs further, there was talk of pulling down the 6th Duke&#x27;s north wing, which was then seen as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House – the celebrated Palladian villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the 4th Duke married Lord Burlington&#x27;s daughter – was sold in 1929 for £80,000 to Middlesex County Council and Brentford and Chiswick Urban District Council.

Nonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a comptroller and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the countryside than the cities. The staff at Chatsworth at the time consisted of a butler, an under-butler, a groom of the chambers, a valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess&#x27;s maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two still-room maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess&#x27;s secretary. All these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, an upholsterer, a scullery maid, two scrubbing women, a laundry porter, a steam boiler man, a coal man, two porter&#x27;s lodge attendants, two night firemen, a night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between 80 in the 6th Duke&#x27;s time and the 20 or so in the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke&#x27;s handbook.

Most of the UK&#x27;s country houses were put to institutional use in the Second World War. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the 10th Duke, thinking that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by Penrhos College, a girls&#x27; public school in Colwyn Bay, Wales. The contents were packed away in 11 days, and in September 1939, 300 girls and their mistresses moved in for a six-year stay. The whole house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.

In May 1944 Kathleen Kennedy, sister of John F. Kennedy, married William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, elder son of the 10th Duke of Devonshire. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944 and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the 11th Duke in 1950. He was married to Deborah Mitford, one of the Mitford girls, sister to Nancy Mitford, Diana Mitford, Pamela Mitford, Unity Mitford and Jessica Mitford.
The modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had yet to move back after the war. Although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding death duties, the Duke died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply and tax was charged at 80 per cent on the estate. The amount due was £7 million (equivalent to £ as of ). Some of the family&#x27;s advisors considered the situation irretrievable and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a Victoria and Albert Museum of Northern England. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family&#x27;s home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family&#x27;s Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school. 

The effect of the death duties was mitigated to an extent by the historically low value of art in the post-war years and the increase in land values after 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and so on the face of it the losses were much less than 80 per cent in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire were retained out of . The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. It took 17 years to complete negotiations with the Inland Revenue, interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, established in 1946.
The 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945, the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948–1949 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women, who had been Kathleen Kennedy&#x27;s cook and housemaid in London, and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951 after the passage of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947.

In the mid-1950s, the 11th Duke and Duchess began to think about moving in. The pre-war house had relied wholly on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants&#x27; hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke&#x27;s cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.

In 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new Chatsworth House Trust. The aim was to preserve the house and its setting for &quot;the benefit of the public&quot;. The new trust was granted a 99-year lease of the house, its main contents, its grounds, its precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of . To legalise this, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of £1 a year. To facilitate the arrangement and build up a sufficient multi-million-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old masters&#x27; drawings, which had not been on regular display. The Cavendish family is represented on the House Trust&#x27;s Council of Management, but most of the directors are not family members. The Duke pays a market rent for use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is about £4 million a year.

===21st century===

The 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire. The 11th Duke&#x27;s widow, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, died on 24 September 2014. Until then she was active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She made many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. As Deborah Mitford, she wrote seven books on various aspects of Chatsworth and its massive property. 

A structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation was required. A £32 million programme of works was undertaken, including restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.

According to the Estate website, Chatsworth remains home to the 12th Duke and Duchess. They are involved in the operation through the Charitable Trust.

The Devonshire Collection Archives stored at Chatsworth include 450 years of documents about the family and their two main estates. In 2019, the Duke and Duchess visited Sotheby&#x27;s to view &quot;Treasures From Chatsworth: art and artifacts from Chatsworth House&quot; that would be displayed in New York.

During the 2022 European heatwaves, a section of the Great Parterre that formerly occupied Chatsworth&#x27;s South Lawn was revealed as the grass and soil dried out, showing the patterns of earthworks that had been used to construct it. As the lawn&#x27;s grass has shorter roots, it dried out faster, creating a contrast that allows the structure to be viewed with the naked eye.

==Architecture==
Chatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by Bess of Hardwick in a quadrangle layout, about from north to south and from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the great hall in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day.

The south and east fronts were rebuilt to the designs of William Talman and completed by 1696 for William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire. The 1st Duke&#x27;s Chatsworth was a key building in the development of English Baroque architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir John Summerson, &quot;It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.&quot; The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a rustic basement. The façade is dramatic and sculptural with ionic pilasters and a heavy entablature and balustrade. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in having an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards.
The west and north fronts may have been the work of Thomas Archer, possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and pilasters to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site, this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey façades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected nine feet (3 m) further than the north end of the east front. The problem was overcome by building a slightly curved façade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main façade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century, when William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the architect Jeffry Wyatville, built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of the wing has only two storeys, as opposed to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house and around 400 feet (120 m) long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an Italianate style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house.

The 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central, largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, while the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke&#x27;s time, but is now the family&#x27;s private entrance again.

The façades of the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor, with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque façade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by Samuel Watson, a Derbyshire craftsman who did much work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood.

==Interiors==
The 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamental layout, which in this way is unique, full of irregularities, and the interiors are decorated by a diverse centuries-old collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable as of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance.

===State apartments===


The 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of state rooms across the south front when expecting a visit from King William III and Queen Mary II, which never occurred. The State Apartments are approached from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals of scenes from the life of Julius Caesar by Louis Laguerre, and ascend by the cantilevered Great Stairs to an enfilade of rooms that controlled how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen.

The Great Chamber is the largest in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet, each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber has a painted ceiling of a classical scene by Antonio Verrio. The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room when the 6th Duke brought the violin door from Devonshire House in London. It has a convincing &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; of a violin and bow &quot;hanging&quot; on a silver knob, painted about 1723 by Jan van der Vaart.

About the time Queen Victoria decided that Hampton Court, with state apartments in the same style, was uninhabitable, the 6th Duke wrote that he was tempted to demolish the State Apartments to make way for new bedrooms. However, sensitive to his family heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than changing the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider, shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they had looked in the 17th and 18th centuries.

===18th-century alterations===
In the 1760s, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall, from which guests walked through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook&#x27;s bedroom and the back stairs, and into the Painted Hall. He then built a neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that was a forerunner of the 6th Duke&#x27;s north wing. William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, had some of the family&#x27;s private rooms redecorated and some partition walls moved, but there are few traces of the mid and late 18th century in the public rooms.

===19th-century alterations===
The 6th Duke modified much of Chatsworth to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, suiting a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke&#x27;s time. The corridors round the courtyard were enclosed and given a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and there were more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook&#x27;s bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome and built at the north end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along the staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke made a library of the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room, before the 6th Duke used it for his growing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms where the Duke installed a single-pane window, which he saw as the &quot;greatest ornament of modern decoration&quot;. The window in the Ante-Library is the only one preserved. Much of the scientific library of Henry Cavendish (1731–1810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville-designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun, but later abandoned.

The entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants&#x27; hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper&#x27;s rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called &quot;California&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot;. The main rooms in the new wing face east and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using marble from the 1st Duke&#x27;s bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the belvedere itself, an open viewing platform below the roof.

===Private rooms===

Chatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, described the family rooms in detail in her book &quot;Chatsworth: The House&quot;. She lived at Edensor until her death in 2014; the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the north-east corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route.

The main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the south-east corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke&#x27;s dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little over a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick&#x27;s house and the 1st Duke&#x27;s house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the Great Chamber, which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that to his knowledge, it had never been used.

The yellow drawing room is next to the dining room and directly beneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess wrote that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke&#x27;s bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front&#x27;s external staircase. Three corridors called the Tapestry Gallery, Burlington Corridor and Book Passage are wrapped round the south, west and north passages at this level and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner — one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is why they are sometimes available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes not. This suite now contains the 11th Duke&#x27;s Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the chapel.

The private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right on entering is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room with walls of leather. Its great many books make it one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke&#x27;s Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, &quot;three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris&quot;. The corner room on the ground floor is the former &quot;little dining room&quot;. These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors round the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor.

The other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front. They are reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now a pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and made out of the steward&#x27;s room and linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices.

==Park and landscape==
The garden attracts about 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of features from six different centuries, covering . It is surrounded by a wall 1.75 miles (2.8 km) long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the Derwent River and blends into the surrounding park, which covers . The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of some 20 full-time gardeners. Average rainfall is some 33.7 inches (855 mm) a year, with an annual average of 1,160 hours of sunshine. Most of the main features of the garden were created in five main phases of development.

===Elizabethan garden===
The house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the garden today. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of the time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary&#x27;s Bower on account of a legend that Mary, Queen of Scots was allowed to take the air there while a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date from this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later.
===1st Duke&#x27;s garden (1684–1707)===
While rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created Baroque gardens. It featured numerous parterres cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The main surviving features of that time are:

*The Cascade and Cascade House, a set of stone steps over which water flows from fountains at the top. It was built in 1696 and rebuilt more grandly in 1701. In 1703 a grand baroque Temple or Cascade House designed by Thomas Archer was added at the top. Major restoration of both in 1994–1996 took 10,000 man-hours of work. In 2004 the Cascade was voted England&#x27;s best water feature by a panel of 45 garden experts chosen by &quot;Country Life&quot;. It has 24 cut steps, each slightly different and with a variety of textures so that each gives a different sound when water runs over and down it.
*The Canal Pond dug in 1702 is a -long rectangular lake to the south of the house.
*The Seahorse Fountain is a sculptural fountain in a circular pond on the lawn between the house and the Canal Pond. Originally it was the centrepiece of the main parterre.
*The Willow Tree Fountain is an imitation tree that squirts water on the unsuspecting from its branches. The writer Celia Fiennes wrote in her diary: &quot;There... in the middle of ye grove stands a fine willow tree, the leaves, barke and all looks very naturall, ye roote is full of rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a sudden by ye turning of a sluice it rains from each leafe and from the branches like a shower, it being made of brass and pipes to each leafe, but in appearance is exactly like any willow.&quot; The tree has been replaced twice and then restored in 1983.
*The First Duke&#x27;s greenhouse is a long, low building with ten arched windows and a temple-like centrepiece. It has been moved from a site overlooking the 1st Duke&#x27;s bowling green to the northern edge of the main lawn and is now fronted by a rose garden.

*Flora&#x27;s Temple is a classical edifice from 1695, moved to its present site at the northern end of the broad walk in 1760. It contains a statue of the goddess Flora by Caius Gabriel Cibber.
*The West Garden – now the family&#x27;s private garden with modern planting in a three-section formal structure – is mainly a creation of the 1st Duke&#x27;s time, but the layout is not original.

===4th Duke&#x27;s garden (1755–64)=== 
The 4th Duke commissioned the landscape architect, Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were turned into lawns, but as detailed above several features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species imported from Philadelphia in 1759. The main aim of the work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown&#x27;s Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade.

===6th Duke&#x27;s garden (1826–58)===


In 1826 a 23-year-old named Joseph Paxton, who had trained at Kew Gardens, was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth 15 years earlier and till then shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth&#x27;s garden. Features that survive from that time include:
*The Rockeries and The Strid: In 1842 Paxton began work on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks weighing several tons one on top of another. One was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: &quot;In one place a sort of miniature Matterhorn apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass.&quot; It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced that it can be swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named after the Queen and Prince Albert and another after the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke&#x27;s time. The Wellington Rock, a structure of several piled rocks, is high. A small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in winter the water freezes, creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called &#x27;The Strid&#x27;, named after a stretch of the River Wharfe on the Devonshires&#x27; Bolton Abbey estate, where the river is pressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth&#x27;s Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge.
*The Arboretum and Pinetum: The 6th Duke&#x27;s time was one of plant-hunting expeditions, with major new species readily discovered by intrepid botanists, and the Duke among the most generous sponsors. In 1829 he took an additional of the park into the garden to create a pinetum, and in 1835 Paxton began work on an arboretum planned as a systematic succession of trees in accordance with botanical classification. Chatsworth has some of the oldest UK specimens of species such as Douglas fir and Giant Sequoia. Also in this part of the garden is the Grotto Pond, originally a fishpond, breeding fish for Chatsworth&#x27;s table. The 6th Duke&#x27;s mother had the rustic grotto built at the end of the 18th century. The area round the pond is now planted for autumn colour.
*The Azalea Dell and the Ravine: Rhododendrons and Azaleas grow well at Chatsworth as the soil suits them, and a section of the southern end of the garden is devoted to them. This is the most rugged part of the garden, with steep serpentine paths and a stream running down a valley known as The Ravine. In 1997 a waterfall was created out of old drinking troughs gathered from fields on the estate. There is also a bamboo walk.
*The Emperor Fountain: In 1843 Tsar Nicholas I of Russia informed the Duke that he was likely to visit Chatsworth the following year. In anticipation of this Imperial visit, the Duke decided to construct the world&#x27;s tallest fountain, and set Paxton to work to build it. An lake was dug on the moors above the house to supply the natural water pressure. The work was finished in just six months, continuing at night by the light of flares, and the resulting water jet is on record as reaching a height of . However, the Tsar died in 1855 and never saw the fountain. Due to a limited supply of water, the fountain usually runs on partial power, reaching half its full height. The water power found a practical use generating Chatsworth&#x27;s electricity from 1893 to 1936. The house was then connected to the mains, and a new turbine was installed in 1988 that produces about a third of the electricity the house needs.
*The Conservative Wall is a set of greenhouses that run up the slope from Flora&#x27;s Temple to the stables against the north wall of the garden. A tall central section is flanked by ten smaller sections used to grow fruit and camellias. Two &quot;Camellia reticulata&quot; &#x27;Captain Rawes&#x27; planted in 1850 survive. Chatsworth&#x27;s camellias have won many prizes. The name of the building has no political connotations; the Dukes of Devonshire were Whigs and later Liberals.
*The bust of the 6th Duke on a Poseidon Temple column was erected in the 1840s and situated at the south end of today&#x27;s Serpentine Hedge. The four classical column drums beneath were a gift from the 6th Duke&#x27;s half brother, Augustus Clifford, who collected these drums from the site of the Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sounion between 1821 and 1825, during his naval service as the captain of . The column is possibly composed by the bottom, 3rd, 4th, and the 6th drum from a single collapsed temple column, while the British Museum preserves the 7th. The inscription on the pedestal erroneously credits the origin of these drums to the Temple of Athena, Cape Sounion, a smaller site located north-west of the Temple of Poseidon.

Two significant features from the period have been lost:
*The Great Conservatory, also known as the &quot;Great Stove&quot;, was the largest glasshouse in the world at that time. Paxton and architect Decimus Burton designed this glasshouse, which was begun in 1836 and completed in 1841 at a cost of £33,099. It was long, wide and high. It used eight coal-fired furnaces to send hot water through of pipes. A carriage drive ran the length of the building between lush tropical vegetation. One W. Adam called it &quot;A mountain of glass... an unexampled structure... like a sea of glass when the waves are settling and smoothing down after a storm.&quot; The King of Saxony compared it to &quot;a tropical scene with a glass sky&quot;. The Great Conservatory was demolished in 1920, as it had not been heated during World War I to conserve coal. 
*The Victoria regia House or Lily House, built by Paxton in 1849–1850, was devoted to the giant Amazon water lily &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot;, which flowered in captivity there for the first time. Like the Great Conservatory, the Lily House was unused in World War I and demolished in 1920.

===Modern garden (1950–present)===

The 7th–10th Dukes made few changes to the garden, which suffered in the Second World War, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival. Gardening personality Alan Titchmarsh wrote in 2003, &quot;Chatsworth&#x27;s greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.&quot; Many historical features have been immaculately restored, and unusually for a modern country-house garden, many new features have been added, including:
*The South Lawn limes: Double rows of pleached red-twigged limes on either side of the South Lawn, which were planted in 1952 and removed in 2014
*The Serpentine Hedge: A wavy-hedged beech corridor from the Ring Pond to the bust of the 6th Duke. It was planted in 1953.
*The Maze: planted with 1,209 yews in the centre of the site of the former Great Conservatory in 1962. Two flower gardens occupy the rest of the site.
*The Display Greenhouse (1970): Modern in style, but unobtrusively sited behind the First Duke&#x27;s greenhouse. It has three climate zones: tropical, Mediterranean and temperate. Public access is limited but groups may book tours and there are first-come-first-served tours on a few days each season.
*The Cottage Garden: Inspired by an exhibit at the 1988 Chelsea Flower Show. A front garden of flower beds bordered by box leads to the &quot;kitchen/dining&quot; room with furniture covered with plants. There is a bedroom in the same style on the upper level.
*The Kitchen Garden: a productive fruit and vegetable garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s. Chatsworth&#x27;s original kitchen garden covered and was by the river in the park.
*Modern sculpture includes such pieces as &quot;War Horse&quot; and &quot;Walking Madonna&quot; by Dame Elisabeth Frink, and 14 bronze portrait heads by Angela Conner. 
*The Sensory Garden is accessible to the disabled and features many fragrant plants. It was opened in 2004 by the then Home Secretary David Blunkett.
*Quebec: A part of the garden to the south and west of the canal pond that was, until 2006, a neglected and dank area covered with &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot;. This is now an extension to the Arboretum walk, with a path along the top of the steep bank. The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood. An 18th-century cascade was uncovered during the clearance.

===Stables===
The stable block at Chatsworth is prominent on the rising ground to the north-east of the house. Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rustic banding, a pediment with a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a cupola. This was designed by James Paine for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758–1767. It is about square and two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners and one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses and all necessary equine facilities including a blacksmiths shop. The first floor was taken by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess&#x27;s &quot;Chatsworth: The House&quot;, one room still has &quot;Third Postillion&quot; painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s.

The last horses left the stables in 1939, when the building became a store and garage. The grooms&#x27; accommodation was turned into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners. When the house reopened after the war, &quot;catering&quot; was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled &quot;water for dogs&quot;. In 1975 a tea bar was set up with an investment of £120. The first attempt at a café opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was unsatisfactory to customers and from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess&#x27;s private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre Béraud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge. After a failed attempt to gain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen&#x27;s Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop, and three rooms for hire. The stables cater for 30,000 people a month in the visitor season.

===Park, woods and farmyard===
Chatsworth park of about is open to free of charge all year round, except for the south-east section, the Old Park, which is used for breeding by herds of red and fallow deer. The stance of the Dukes on wider access rights has changed much. On the 11th Duke&#x27;s death in 2004, the Ramblers Association praised him for enlightened championing of open access and his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even under the 11th Duke, disputes arose: when the definitive rights of way were being compiled in the 1960s and 1970s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by a lake in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the High Court, making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps.


Farm stock also graze in the park, many belonging to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use it for summer grazing. Bess of Hardwick&#x27;s park was wholly on the east side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large flat area is used now for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, typically held near the end of August. The bridge over the river was at the south end of the park and crossed to the old village of Edensor, which was by the river in full sight of the house.

Capability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree-flecked landscape admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river and put a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms; weeds and scrub are kept under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. Meanwhile James Paine designed a new bridge to the north of the house, set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps, so that a screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown&#x27;s plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to cater to a growing number of well-to-do travellers coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office.

In 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the Duke of Rutland&#x27;s land around Baslow to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for land elsewhere. He extended the park about half a mile (800 m) north to its present limits. He had the remaining cottages of Edensor inside the park demolished, apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the 7th Duke had St Peter&#x27;s Church, Edensor, enlarged by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park. Inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick&#x27;s sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter&#x27;s in Edensor is where the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Dukes and their wives are buried, not in a vault inside the church, but in individual graves marked by simple headstones, in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard.

On the hills of the eastern side of the park is Stand Wood. The Hunting Tower there was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top is a plateau of several square miles of lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. The area is the water source for the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade.

The late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life. In 1973 a Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables at explaining how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983. A venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by the television gardener Alan Titchmarsh in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks, in which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods.

In 2001, the ashes of 
Air Vice Marshal James Edgar Johnson , DL, a Second World War flying ace, were scattered on the Chatsworth estate. There is a bench dedicated to his memory at his favourite fishing spot on the estate; the inscription reads &quot;In Memory of a Fisherman&quot;.
==Estate==

Chatsworth is the hub of a agricultural estate. This, together with around Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in Eastbourne and Carlisle belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family&#x27;s Lismore Castle estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire:
*The Main Estate is a compact block of around the house, including the park and many properties in the villages of Baslow, Pilsley, Edensor, Beeley, and Calton Lees.
*The West Estate is of scattered high ground, mostly in the Peak District and partly in Staffordshire. Hartington, from which the family takes its secondary title is nearby.
*The Shottle Estate is in and around Shottle, which is around south of Chatsworth. This low-lying land is home to most of the dairy farms on the estate and also has some arable farms.
*The Staveley Estate at Staveley near Chesterfield includes a industrial site called Staveley Work, let to various tenants, and some woodlands and arable farms.
*The Scarcliffe Estate, mostly arable farms, is east of Chesterfield.

The Chatsworth Settlement has a range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres, mostly round Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. Several properties can be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick&#x27;s Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals.

The 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for a &quot;theme park&quot; approach to modernising a country estate. They eschewed the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a large enterprise employing over a hundred. A 90-seat restaurant opened at the Farm Shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of Belgravia, but it was unsuccessful and closed down.

The Settlement runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel &amp; Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate and owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow, on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the Caravan Club; a paddock at the south end of the park where bucks were fattened for Chatsworth&#x27;s table is a tenanted garden centre. In both cases the Settlement receives a percentage of turnover as rent.

There is a line of Chatsworth branded foods endorsed with the Dowager Duchess&#x27;s signature and available by mail order. She also established Chatsworth Design to exploit intellectual property rights to the Devonshire collections, and a furniture company called Chatsworth Carpenters, but the latter has now been licensed to an American company.

==In popular culture==

Chatsworth House has been referenced in literature and used as a location set for films, television and for music videos including: &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813); &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; (1943); &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975); &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984); &quot;Interceptor&quot; (1989); &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1995); &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005); &quot;Face to Face&quot;; &quot;The Duchess&quot; (2008); &quot;The Wolfman&quot; (2009); &quot;Rivers with Griff Rhys Jones&quot; (2009); &quot;Chatsworth&quot; (2012); &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot; (2013); &quot;Austenland&quot; (2013); &quot;Secrets of The Manor House&quot; (2014); &quot;Breathless Beauty, Broken Beauty&quot; (2014); &quot;The Crown&quot; (2016) and &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;.
