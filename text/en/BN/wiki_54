<text>The Waffen Grenadier Brigade of the SS Charlemagne () was a Waffen-SS unit formed in September 1944 from French collaborationists, many of whom were already serving in various other German units.

Named after the 9th-century Frankish emperor, the Charlemagne Brigade superseded two units of French volunteers already serving within the German Army and Waffen-SS, namely the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and SS-Volunteer &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot; France (&quot;SS-Freiwilligen Sturmbrigade &quot;Frankreich&quot;&quot;). The division also included French recruits from other German military and paramilitary formations and &quot;Miliciens&quot; who had fled ahead of the Allied Liberation of France (June–November 1944).

After training, the Charlemagne Brigade was reclassified as a division as the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) (&quot;33. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot; (französische Nr. 1)&quot;). It had 7,340 men at the time of its deployment to the Eastern Front in February 1945. It fought against Soviet forces in Pomerania where it was almost annihilated during the East Pomeranian Offensive within a month. Around 100 members of the unit participated in the Battle in Berlin in April–May 1945 and were among the last Axis forces to surrender.

==Background==
===Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism===
The Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (&quot;Légion des Volontaires Français contre le Bolchévisme&quot;, or LVF) was a unit of the German Army (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) formed shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 by a coalition of small far-right political factions within Vichy France. Although its supporters were more explicitly supportive of Nazi ideology and close collaboration with Nazi Germany than the Vichy regime itself, the German authorities remained skeptical of incorporating French soldiers and limited the unit&#x27;s size significantly. Furthermore, it only succeeded in including 5,800 recruits between 1941 and its disbandment in 1944. It was also kept at arm&#x27;s length by the Vichy regime. The LVF participated in the Battle of Moscow in November–December 1941 but suffered heavy casualties and performed poorly in combat. For most of its existence, it was confined to so-called &quot;bandit-fighting&quot; operations (&quot;Bandenbekämpfung&quot;) behind the front line in German-occupied Byelorussia and Ukraine. The Tricolour Legion (&quot;Légion Tricolore&quot;) formed in France with Vichy support was later also absorbed into the LVF. In early 1944, the unit again took part in rear-security operations. In June 1944, following the collapse of Army Group Centre&#x27;s front during the Red Army&#x27;s summer offensive, the LVF was attached to the 4th SS Police Regiment.

===SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade France===

The SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade France (&quot;SS-Freiwilligen Sturmbrigade &quot;Frankreich&quot;&quot;) was formed in July 1943 as the first French formation permitted within the Waffen-SS. It was led by SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Paul-Marie Gamory-Dubourdeau who had formerly served in the Foreign Legion. It attracted around 3,000 applicants in German-occupied France, many of whom were existing members of the collaborationist paramilitary Milice or university students. The official requirements were that the recruit had to be &quot;free of Jewish blood&quot; and between 20 and 25 years old. The approximately 1,600 men of the &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot; were attached to the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel and sent to Galicia on the Eastern Front. In heavy fighting against the Red Army, 7 officers and 130 men were killed, while 8 officers and 661 men were wounded.

==Formation==
The LVF and the Brigade Frankreich were disbanded in September 1944 in the aftermath of the Allied Liberation of France. Their soldiers were folded into a new unit created the same month called the Waffen Grenadier Brigade of the SS Charlemagne (&quot;Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS Charlemagne&quot;). Joining them were French collaborators fleeing the Allied advance in the west, as well as Frenchmen from the German Navy, the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), the Organisation Todt and the detested &quot;Milice&quot; security police who had fled ahead of the Allied forces. SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Gustav Krukenberg was appointed to command the division, while Edgar Puaud, who had commanded the LVF, was the nominal French commander. The two main infantry regiments were designated as the 57th and 58th Regiments. Members of the LVF were the nucleus of the former and &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot; formed the core of the latter. The LVF also manned the artillery battalion, the headquarters company and the engineer company. In February 1945, the unit was officially upgraded to a division and renamed to SS Division Charlemagne. At this time it had a strength of 7,340 men; 1,200 men from the LVF, 1,000 from the &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot;, 2,500 from the Milice, 2,000 from the NSKK and 640 were former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and naval police.

==Operational history==
===Pomerania, February–April 1945===

The division was sent to fight the Red Army in Poland, but on 25 February it was attacked at Hammerstein (present-day Czarne) in Pomerania, by troops of the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front. The Soviet forces split the French force into three pockets. One group with Puaud was destroyed by Soviet artillery and a second group tried fighting its way back westward, but by 17 March all had been captured or killed in action. A third group commanded by Krukenberg survived. It was evacuated from the coast by the German Navy to Denmark and later sent to Neustrelitz for refitting.

By early April 1945, Krukenberg commanded only about 700 men organized into a single infantry regiment with two battalions (Battalions 57 and 58) and one heavy support battalion without equipment. He released about 400 men to serve in a construction battalion; the remainder, numbering about 350, had chosen to go to Berlin. On 23 April the Reich Chancellery in Berlin ordered Krukenberg to proceed to the capital with his men, who were reorganized as Assault Battalion (&quot;Sturmbataillon&quot;) Charlemagne. As the men assembled at the Marktplatz of Alt-Strelitz, a black Mercedes approached fast. As the car went past the column of men, Krukenberg and several other officers quickly stood at attention, recognising &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, who had just come from a private meeting with Count Folke Bernadotte at the Swedish consulate in Lübeck to offer surrender terms to the Western Allies. The SS men were disappointed that Himmler did not stop and instead sped on past.

===Berlin, April–May 1945===
The French SS troops arrived in Berlin on 24 April after a long detour to avoid advance columns of the Red Army. Although estimates vary, around 100 men remaining in the SS Division Charlemagne participated in the Battle in Berlin. On 25 April, Krukenberg was appointed the commander of (Berlin) Defence Sector C which included SS Division Nordland, whose previous commander, Joachim Ziegler, was relieved of his command earlier the same day. Charlemagne was attached to Nordland whose two regiments had been decimated in the fighting. Both equaled roughly a battalion. The Frenchmen walked from West to East Berlin, to a brewery near Hermannplatz. Here fighting began, with Hitler Youth firing &quot;Panzerfausts&quot; at Soviet tanks belonging to advance guards near the Tempelhof Airport.

Supported by Tiger II tanks and the 11th SS Panzer Battalion, men of Charlemagne took part in a counterattack on the morning of 26 April in Neukölln. The counterattack ran into an ambush by Soviet troops using a captured German Panther tank. The regiment lost half of the available troops in Neukölln on the first day. It later defended Neukölln&#x27;s Town Hall. Given that Neukölln was heavily penetrated by Soviet combat groups, Krukenberg prepared fallback positions for Sector C defenders around Hermannplatz. He moved his headquarters into the opera house. As SS Division Nordland withdrew towards Hermannplatz, the French under &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Henri Joseph Fenet and some attached Hitler Youth destroyed fourteen Soviet tanks; one machine gun position by the Halensee bridge held up Soviet forces for 48 hours.

The Soviet advance into Berlin followed a pattern of massive shelling followed by assaults using house-clearing battle groups of about 80 men in each, with tank escorts and close artillery support. On 27 April, the remnants of Nordland were pushed back into the central government district (Zitadelle sector) in Defence Sector Z. There, Krukenberg&#x27;s Nordland headquarters was a carriage in the Stadtmitte U-Bahn station. Fighting was very heavy and by 28 April 108 Soviet tanks had been destroyed in the southeast of Berlin within the &quot;S-Bahn&quot;. The French squads under Fenet&#x27;s command accounted for &quot;about half&quot; of the tanks. Fenet and his battalion were given the area of Neukölln, Belle Alliance Platz, Wilhelmstrasse and the Friedrichstrasse to defend. On 28 April, the Red Army started a full-scale offensive into the central sector. Charlemagne was in the center of the battle zone around the Reich Chancellery. French SS man Eugène Vaulot, who had destroyed two tanks in Neukölln, claimed to have destroyed six more near the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross by Krukenberg on 29 April. Vaulot was killed three days later by a Red Army sniper. Second Lieutenant Roger Albert-Brunet destroyed four Soviet tanks by &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; on 29 April 1945. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st class by Krukenberg. During the fighting, Fenet was wounded in the foot. The Soviets forces drove what was left of the battalion back to the vicinity of the Reich Aviation Ministry in the central government district under the command of SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke. For the combat actions of the battalion during the Battle in Berlin, Mohnke awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross to Fenet on 29 April 1945.

By 30 April, the last defenders in the area of the bunker complex were mainly made up of Frenchmen of the SS Division Charlemagne, others being Waffen-SS men from the SS Division Leibstandarte, SS Division Nordland, Latvian SS and Spanish SS from the Blue Legion. A group of French SS remained in the area of the bunker until the early morning of 2 May. By the evening of 30 April, the French SS men serving under Fenet had destroyed another 21 Soviet tanks and used up a large number of the &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; reserves from the Reich Chancellery. On the night of 1 May, Krukenberg told the men that were left to split up into small groups and attempt to break-out. Reduced to approximately thirty troops, most French SS men surrendered near the Potsdamer rail station to the Red Army. Krukenberg made it to Dahlem where he hid out in an apartment for a week before surrendering to Red Army troops.

Having escaped out of Berlin, Fenet with a small remainder of his unit surrendered to British forces at Bad Kleinen and Wismar. Some of the Frenchmen, such as Fenet, were turned over to the Soviet Army. Twelve of those turned over to French authorities by the U.S. Army were summarily executed on the orders of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque. Fenet was allowed to be treated for his foot wound at hospital. He was then returned to a Soviet POW camp and a short time later released. Most of the rest who made it to France were apprehended and sent to Allied prisons and camps. Fenet was arrested upon his return to France. In 1949, Fenet was convicted of being a collaborator and sentenced to 20 years of forced labour, but was released from prison in 1959.

<doc id="436632" wikidata="Q7503958" url="?curid=436632" title="Shrigley abduction">
<text>The Shrigley abduction was an 1826 British case of a forced marriage by Edward Gibbon Wakefield to the 15-year-old heiress Ellen Turner of Pott Shrigley. The couple were married in Gretna Green, Scotland, and travelled to Calais, France, before Turner&#x27;s father was able to notify the authorities and intervene. The marriage was annulled by Parliament, and Turner was legally married two years later, at the age of 17, to a wealthy neighbour of her class. Both Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his brother William, who had aided him, were convicted at trial and sentenced to three years in prison.

==Background==

Ellen Turner was the daughter and only child of William Turner, a wealthy resident of Pott Shrigley, Cheshire, who owned calico printing and spinning mills. At the time of the abduction, Turner was a High Sheriff of Cheshire and lived in Shrigley Hall, near Macclesfield. Fifteen-year-old Ellen came to the attention of Edward Gibbon Wakefield in 1826. He conspired with his brother William Wakefield to marry her for her inheritance.

Edward Gibbon Wakefield was 30 years old; he had been a King&#x27;s Messenger (a diplomatic courier) as a teenager, and later became a diplomat. At the age of 20, he had eloped to Scotland with a 17-year-old heiress, Eliza Pattle. Her mother accepted the marriage and settled £70,000 on the young couple. Eliza died four years later in 1820 after giving birth to her third child. Wakefield had political ambitions and wanted more money. He tried to break his father-in-law&#x27;s will and was suspected of perjury and forgery. He appeared to have based his plan to marry Ellen Turner on the expectation that her parents would respond as Mrs Pattle had.

==False summons==
On 7 March 1826, Wakefield sent his servant Edward Thevenot with a carriage to Liverpool, where Ellen was a pupil at a boarding school. Thevenot presented a message to the Misses Daulby, the mistresses of the school. (The Misses Daulby were the daughters of Daniel Daulby, a well-known Liverpool collector and author of &quot;The Collected Works of Rembrandt&quot; (1796)). The message stated that Mrs Turner had become paralysed and wished to see her daughter immediately. The Misses Daulby were initially suspicious of the fact that Ellen did not recognise Thevenot but eventually let him take her away.

Thevenot took Ellen Turner to Manchester and the Hotel Albion to meet Wakefield. Wakefield told her that her father&#x27;s business had collapsed, and that Wakefield had agreed to take her to Carlisle, where Turner had supposedly fled to escape his creditors.

The party proceeded to Kendal, where the next day Wakefield told Ellen that her father was a fugitive. He claimed that two banks had agreed that some of her father&#x27;s estate would be transferred to her or, to be exact, her husband. He said that his banker uncle had proposed that Wakefield marry Ellen, and that if she would agree to marry him, her father would be saved. Ellen allowed them to take her to Carlisle. There they met Edward&#x27;s brother William Wakefield, who claimed to have spoken to Turner and got his agreement to the marriage.

Ellen finally consented and the Wakefields took her over the border of Scotland to Gretna Green, a favoured place of elopement for those who wanted to exploit the less strict marriage laws of Scotland. There Ellen and Edward were married by blacksmith David Laing.

They returned to Carlisle, where Ellen said she wanted to see her father. Wakefield agreed to take her to Shrigley, but instead took her to Leeds. Wakefield then claimed he had a meeting in Paris that he could not postpone, and had to go to France by way of London. He sent his brother off, ostensibly to invite Turner to meet them in London. Wakefield and Ellen continued to London. In London, Wakefield, accompanied by Ellen, pretended to inquire after his brother and Turner. At Blake&#x27;s Hotel, a valet told them that Turner and Wakefield had gone to France. Edward Wakefield and Ellen had to follow them, and he took her to Calais.

==Suspicions arise==
After a few days, Miss Daulby became concerned. Turner and his wife received a letter from Wakefield, stating that he had married Ellen. Wakefield may have expected the Turners to accept the marriage rather than face a public scandal. Instead, Turner went to London and asked for help from the Foreign Secretary. Learning that his daughter had been taken to the European mainland, Turner sent his brother to Calais, accompanied by a police officer and a solicitor. There they soon found the couple staying in a hotel.

Wakefield claimed that since they were legally married, Ellen could not be taken from him by force. After interviewing the girl, the French authorities let her leave the country with her uncle. Wakefield wrote a statement attesting that Ellen was still a virgin, and he left for Paris.

==Arrest and trial==
The British Foreign Secretary had issued a warrant for the Wakefields&#x27; arrest; William was arrested in Dover a couple of days later. He was taken to Cheshire, where magistrates debated his offence. They committed him to Lancaster Castle to await trial. The Court of King&#x27;s Bench later released him on £2,000 bail and two sureties of £1,000 each.

Edward Thevenot and the Wakefields&#x27; stepmother Frances were indicted as accomplices. Both brothers and their stepmother appeared in court and pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;. Thevenot, who was still in France, was indicted for felony &quot;in absentia&quot;. On 23 March 1827 all three defendants were put on trial in Lancaster. The jury found all guilty the same day. They were committed to Lancaster Castle the following day.

On 14 May the Wakefields were taken to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in Westminster Hall in London. William testified that he had acted as guided by his brother. Edward Wakefield swore that the legal expenses had exceeded £3,000. The court sentenced the brothers to three years in prison, Edward in Newgate and William in Lancaster Castle. Frances Wakefield was released. The marriage was later annulled by Act of Parliament on 14 June 1827.

==Aftermath==

After his release, Edward Wakefield became active in prison reform. He became involved in colonial affairs, and had roles in the development of South Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. William Wakefield became an early leader in the colonisation of New Zealand.

William Turner was elected Member of Parliament for Blackburn as a Whig in 1832, serving until 1841. At the age of 17, Ellen Turner married Thomas Legh, a wealthy neighbour. She died in childbirth at the age of 19 and was survived by a daughter.

<doc id="436633" wikidata="Q1657500" url="?curid=436633" title="Almoner">
<text>An almoner () is a chaplain or church officer who originally was in charge of distributing money to the deserving poor. The title &quot;almoner&quot; has to some extent fallen out of use in English, but its equivalents in other languages are often used for many pastoral functions exercised by chaplains or pastors. The word derives from the &#x27; (alms), via the [[popular Latin]]&#x27;.

==History==
Christians have historically been encouraged to donate one-tenth of their income as a tithe to their church and additional offerings as needed for the poor. The first deacons, mentioned in Acts 6:1–4, dealt with the distribution of the charity of the early Christian churches to needy members. Popes, bishops and Christian monarchs and organizations have since employed their own officers to organize their donations to the poor and needy. Such donations were referred to as alms and the officers as almoners and the position was one of considerable status.

==Catholic Church==

The papal almoner, formally titled the &quot;Almoner of His Holiness&quot;, is responsible for performing works of mercy on behalf of the pope. He is one of a small number of Vatican officials who continue in office when a pope dies or resigns. Until June 2022, he was a member of the papal household; since then he heads the Dicastery for the Service of Charity, an administrative unit of the Roman Curia. Cardinal Konrad Krajewski has held this post since late 2013.

==French royal household==

The position of almoner within the French royal household was that of Grand Almoner of France (&quot;Grand aumônier de France&quot;) created by King Francis I.

==British royal household==

Today in the United Kingdom, the office of Lord High Almoner still exists in the royal household and the holder of the office is responsible, amongst other things, for organizing the ceremony of the Crown&#x27;s annual distribution of Maundy money. Associated with the almoner&#x27;s office is the grand almoner, a hereditary title in the hands of the Marquess of Exeter.

==Livery companies and Masonic lodges==
The almoner also remains an active and important office in the livery companies of the City of London. In Masonic lodges, the almoner&#x27;s duty is to oversee the needs of the brethren within his lodge. He is the contact for charity and looks after the welfare of the members, including visits to the sick, aged and infirm.

==Hospital almoners==
The title almoner was also used for a hospital official who interviews prospective patients to qualify them as . It was later applied to the officials who were responsible for patient welfare and after-care. This position evolved into the modern profession of medical social work. Lady almoners existed in the UK from 1895 to the termination of the private medical system in 1948; their task was to determine the patients&#x27; ability to contribute towards their own medical care.

<doc id="436636" wikidata="Q182875" url="?curid=436636" title="Amphictyonic league">
<text>In Archaic Greece, an amphictyony (, a &quot;league of neighbors&quot;), or Amphictyonic League, was an ancient religious association of tribes formed before the rise of the Greek &quot;polis&quot;.

The six Dorian cities of coastal southwest Anatolia and the twelve Ionian cities to their north that formed the Ionian League after a Meliac war in the mid-7th century BC were already of considerable antiquity when the first written records emerged.

== The First Amphictyony ==
The oldest religious Amphictyonic League was known as &quot;Anthelian&quot; because it was centered on the cult of the chthonic goddess Demeter at Anthela. The twelve delegates were entitled &quot;Pylagorai&quot; (gate-assemblers), perhaps a reference to the local Gates of Hades, since Demeter was a chthonic goddess in her older local cults. The immediate dwellers-round were some small states, including Achaea-Phthiotis, that paved the way for the entry of the body of the rest Boeotian tribes which were living around Thessaly (&quot;perioikoi&quot;). Boeotia and Phocis, the most remote locations, joined only during or after the &quot;First Sacred War&quot;, which led to the defeat of the old priesthood and to a new control of the prosperity of the oracle at Delphi.

As a result of the war the Anthelan body was known thenceforth as the Delphic Amphictyony and became the official overseer and military defender of the Delphic cult. A strange and revealing anti-Thessalian feeling appeared and a wall was built across the narrow defile at Thermopylae to keep the Thessalians out.

It is suggested that the Shield of Heracles may reflect anti-Thessalian feeling after the First Sacred War. In this epic, a Thessalian hero interfering with the Phoecian sanctuary is killed by a Boeotian hero, Heracles, whose mortal father, Amphitryon, had for allies Locrians and Phoecians. This was made to be sung at a Boeotian festival at midsummer at the hottest time of the Dog Star, Sirius.

The name &quot;Hellenes&quot;, is related to the members of the league and was broadened to refer to all Greeks when the myth of their patriarch, Hellen, was invented. In Greek mythology, Amphictyon was brother of Hellen, and Graecus was son of his sister Pandora. According to the Parian Chronicle, the previously-named Graeces were renamed Hellenes.

== Ancient historiography ==
An amphictyony consisting of polities under the aegis of Apollo&#x27;s shrine at Delos was well-established in the seventh century. The Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo of that approximate date lists them. Those cities and islands that trembled and refused to offer themselves for the birthplace of Apollo when pregnant Leto went to each in turn. The Homeric hymn presents an origin myth for the cult of Apollo on Delos. The joint Ionian festival celebrated there was the Delia. The Delian Amphictyony arose in the 4th century BC as an instrument of Athenian hegemony.

Thucydides made recollection of the Lelantine War when writing, &quot;The war between Chalcis and Eretria was the one in which most cities belonging to the rest of Greece were divided up into alliances with one side or the other.&quot; The Lelantine War was fought in Euboea at some point between the late 8th century BC and the first half of the 7th century BC.

Historians have puzzled over the broader meanings of &quot;alliance&quot; in such early times. However, as George Forrest notes, &quot;large-scale associations lead more readily to contacts, to friendships and enmities at a distance than do little city-like units.&quot; This explains why Phrygia and Assyria were at war with each other about 720–710, raising tensions among interested Greeks.

An amphictyony would survive as a form of religious organization enjoined to support specific temples or sacred places. Traditional amphictyonies coordinated Olympic and Pythian Games. Twelve members would meet at specific times in the same sanctuary to keep religious festivals and conduct other matters as well. 

An early amphictyony centered on Kalaureia, an island close to the coast of Troezen in the Peloponnese and sacred to Poseidon, was noted by Strabo. Archaeology of the site suggested to Thomas Kelly that the sacred league was founded in the second quarter of the 7th century BCE, –650. Before that date, there were virtually no remains at the site, which were not used more than sporadically. The island was known at one time as &quot;Eirene&quot; (Εἰρήνη) (&quot;Peace&quot;), which is in reference to the amphictyony. Strabo lists the &quot;polis&quot; that belonged: &quot;And there was also a kind of amphictyonic league connected with this temple, a league of seven cities which shared in the sacrifice; they were Hermione, Epidaurus, Aegina, Athens, Prasïeis, Nauplïeis, and Orchomenus Minyeius; however, the Argives paid dues for the Nauplians, and the Lacedaemonians for the Prasians.&quot;

==Delphic Amphictyony==
The least obscure and longest lasting amphictyony was the Delphic Amphictyony that was organized to support the greater temples of Apollo and Demeter. Its council had religious authority and the power to pronounce punishments against offenders which ranged from fines to expulsion. They also had the ability to conduct sacred wars. The Amphictyonic League also set the rules of battle so as to protect sanctuaries and impose sentences on those who molested sanctuaries. All members were obliged to pledge themselves by an oath as reported by Aeschines.

Based on legend, the Great Amphictyonic League was founded somewhat after the Trojan War, for the protection and administration of the temple of Apollo in Delphi and temple of Demeter in Anthela (Ἀνθήλη), near Thermopylae. The founding myth claimed that it had been founded in the most distant past by an eponymous founder Amphictyon, brother of Hellen, the common ancestor of all Hellenes. Representatives of the twelve members (called &quot;hieromnemones&quot;) met in Thermopylae in spring and in Delphi in autumn.

Many different sources have noted eleven to thirteen founding populations. The list below is as enumerated by Aeschines:

* The Aenianes or Oetaeans (Αἰνιᾶνες, Οἰταῖοι)
* The Boeotians (Βοιωτοί) of Thebes
* The Dolopes (Δόλοπες)
* The Dorians (Δωριείς) of Sparta
* The Ionians (Ἴωνες) of Athens
* The Phthian Achaeans (Ἀχαιοί)
* The Locrians (Λοκροί) [divided into the eastern Opuntians (Ὀπούντιοι) and western Ozolians (Ὀζολοί)]
* The Magnesians (Μάγνητες)
* The Malians (Μαλιεῖς)
* The Perrhaebians (Περραιβοί)
* The Phoecians (Φωκεῖς)
* The Pythians (Πύθιοι) of Delphi
* The Thessalians (Θεσσαλοί)

The League doctrine required that no member would be entirely wiped out in war and no water supply of any member would be cut even in wartime. It did not prevent members from fighting about the dominance over the temples.

==Sacred Wars==
Originally a religious organization, the Delphic Amphictyonic League became politically important in the 6th century BCE, when larger city-states began to use it to apply pressure to the lesser ones. 

The Oracle managed to become independent from the city of Krissa, to which the temple originally belonged. The people of Krissa then imposed a tax on those who were passing through their area to go to Delphi, causing strong complaints and reducing the resources of the Oracle. The Amphictyony, having exhausted all other means to peacefully resolve the crisis, declared the First Sacred War (or &quot;Cirrhean War&quot;) against Krissa that lasted a decade, from 596 to 585 BCE. The result was the destruction of Krissa and the dedication of this country to Apollo, Leto, Artemis, and Athena Pronaia. After this, the Pythian Games were held every four years, under the direction of the Amphictyons. 

In 449-448 the Phoecians, wanting to become masters of the sanctuary, marched against Delphi, but the Spartans sent an army to preserve the status quo: this was the Second Sacred War. After the Spartans&#x27; departure, the Athenians, led by Pericles, gave back to the Phoecians the rule of Delphi and the management of the Pythian Games. In 421, after the Peace of Nicias, Delphi became autonomous again. It is unlikely, however, that Phoecis remained in control of Delphi after members of the Boeotian League defeated Athens at the Battle of Coronea (447 BCE).

In 356 the Phoecians under Philomelos captured and looted Delphi, and a Third Sacred War was declared against them. After ten years of war, in 346, the Phoecians were expelled from the League and their two votes were given to Macedon, which had helped to defeat them. Philip II of Macedonia used this power to further his expansionist policy in Greece. This resulted in the Fourth Sacred War which culminated in the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), marking the final domination of the Macedonians over Greece.

==Decline==
In 279 the Delphic Amphictyony admitted as new members the Aetolian League, who had successfully defended the sanctuary as well as the rest of mainland Greece against the Gauls. At this instance the Phoecians were also readmitted for having also participated at the defense of the region. In the 3rd century the Soteria (festival) was held in honour of the Greek victory against the Gauls. By 191 the League had 17 members but only the most dominant one had the two votes, when others had only one. The league continued to exist under the Roman Empire but its authority was limited to the care of the temple of Apollo at Delphi. The Roman emperor Augustus incorporated the Aenianes, Malians, Magnetians and Pythians with the Thessalians. Since the Dolopes had meanwhile vanished, he gave their vote to the city of Nicopolis. 

The Amphictyonic League gradually declined and in the 2nd century CE it was replaced by the Panhellenion, established by the Roman emperor Hadrian. However, the see of the Amphictyonic League was in Athens, the emperor&#x27;s favorite city. Thus, it seems that the Amphictyony lost influence and came to an end, although we have no specific date for its actual cessation.

<doc id="436644" wikidata="Q1362652" url="?curid=436644" title="Housecarl">
<text>A housecarl (; ) was a non-servile manservant or household bodyguard in medieval Northern Europe.

The institution originated amongst the Norsemen of Scandinavia, and was brought to Anglo-Saxon England by the Danish conquest in the 11th century. They were well-trained, and paid as full-time soldiers. In England, the royal housecarls had a number of roles, both military and administrative, and they fought under Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings.

==Etymology==
Housecarl is a calque of the original Old Norse term, &quot;húskarl&quot;, which literally means &quot;house man&quot;. &quot;Karl&quot; is cognate to the Old English &quot;churl&quot;, or &quot;ceorl&quot;, meaning a man, or a non-servile peasant. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; uses &quot;hiredmenn&quot; as a term for all paid warriors and thus is applied to &quot;housecarl&quot;, but it also refers to &quot;butsecarls&quot; and &quot;lithsmen&quot;. It is not clear whether these were types of &quot;housecarl&quot; or different altogether.

==In Scandinavia==

===As free manservants===
Originally, the Old Norse word &quot;húskarl&quot; (plural: &quot;húskarlar&quot;) (spelled huskarl, pl. huskarlar in Swedish) had a general sense of &quot;manservant&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;húsbóndi&quot;, the &quot;master of the house&quot;. In that sense, the word had several synonyms: &quot;griðmenn&quot; (&quot;home-men&quot;) in Norway and Iceland, &quot;innæsmæn&quot; (&quot;inside-men&quot;) in Denmark. Housecarls were free men, not to be confused with thralls (slaves or serfs); to this effect, the Icelandic laws also call them &quot;einhleypingar&quot; (&quot;lone-runners&quot;) and &quot;lausamenn&quot; (&quot;men not tied&quot;). Both terms emphasise that they were voluntarily in service of another, as opposed to thralls.

===As combatant retainers===
With time, the term &quot;housecarls&quot; (&quot;húskarlar&quot;) came to acquire a specific sense of &quot;retainers&quot;, in the service of a lord, in his &quot;hirð&quot;, &quot;lid&quot; or &quot;drótt&quot; (all meaning &quot;bodyguard&quot;, &quot;troop of retainers&quot;). In Denmark, this was also the sense of the word &quot;himthige&quot;, a variant of &quot;húskarl&quot; (&quot;see below&quot;). This meaning can be seen, for instance, on the Turinge stone:

According to Omeljan Pritsak, this Þorsteinn may have commanded the retinue of Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand Prince of Kiev. Thus, the housecarls mentioned here would be royal bodyguards; in any case, it can be seen here that the word &quot;housecarl&quot; now applied to a person who fought in the service of a different person.

===In Norwegian service: the &quot;heiðþegar&quot;===

In Norway, housecarls were members of the king&#x27;s or another powerful man&#x27;s &quot;hirð&quot;. The institution of the &quot;hirð&quot; in Norway can be traced back to the ninth century. The texts dealing with royal power in medieval Norway, the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and the &quot;Konungs skuggsjá&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Mirror&quot;), make explicit the link between a king or leader and his retainers (housecarls and &quot;hirðmenn&quot;). There was a special fine for the killing of a king&#x27;s man, which in &quot;Konungs skuggsjá&quot; is underlined as an advantage of entering the king&#x27;s service. Conversely, retainers were expected to avenge their leader if he was killed.

Sigvatr Þórðarson (also known as Sigvat the Skald), a court poet to two kings of Norway, Olaf II of Norway (saint Olaf) and Magnus the Good (and also to two kings of Denmark), called the retainers of Olaf II of Norway &quot;heiðþegar&quot;, meaning &quot;gift- (or pay-)receivers&quot;. More precisely, Snorri Sturluson explained that &quot;&quot;heið&quot;-money is the name of the wages or gift which chieftains give&quot;. Thus, Sigvat probably referred to an institution similar to the Danish &quot;heimþegar&quot; (&quot;see below&quot;) or to the housecarls of Cnut the Great (&quot;see below&quot;): free men in the service of a king or lord, who gave them gifts as payment of said service. It is known from Icelandic sources that in the 1060s, the royal housecarls were paid with Norwegian coins.

===The housecarls of the Danish kings: the &quot;heimþegar&quot;===

Six runestones in Denmark, DR 1, DR 3, DR 154, DR 155, DR 296, and DR 297, use the term &quot;heimþegi&quot; (pl. &quot;heimþegar&quot;), meaning &quot;home-receiver&quot; (i.e. one who is given a house by another). The use of the term in the inscriptions suggest a strong similarity between &quot;heimþegar&quot; and housecarls: like housecarls, &quot;heimþegar&quot; are in the service of a king or lord, of whom they receive gifts (here, homes) for their service. Johannes Brøndsted interpreted &quot;heimþegi&quot; as nothing more than a local (Danish) variant of &quot;húskarl&quot;.

Johannes Brøndsted suggested that the garrison of the Danish fort of Trelleborg may have consisted of royal housecarls, and that kings Svein Forkbeard and Cnut the Great may have &quot;safeguarded the country by a network of forts manned by the royal housecarls, the mercenaries, the &quot;hird&quot;&quot;. Among the Hedeby stones, the Stone of Eric (DR 1) is dedicated by a royal retainer to one of his companions:
&quot;Sven&quot; is probably king Svein Forkbeard, as elsewhere on the Hedeby stones. Another runestone there, the Skarthi stone (DR 3), was apparently personally raised by king Svein:
Under Svein Forkbeard and Cnut the Great, when the Danish kings came to rule England, a body of royal housecarls was developed there, with institutions that were partly of Norse inspiration, and partly inspired by canon law (&quot;see below&quot;). But even after the Danish kings had lost England, housecarls continued to exist in Denmark. Such a group of royal retainers was still in place at the beginning of the 12th century, under Niels of Denmark, when, according to Danish historian Svend Aggesen, Aggesen&#x27;s grandfather, a member of the retinue, was tried for the murder of a fellow housecarl. Svend Aggesen&#x27;s account of the law governing Cnut the Great&#x27;s housecarls in 11th century England (the &quot;Witherlogh&quot; or &quot;Lex Castrensis&quot;) may reflect, in fact, those governing Danish housecarls in the 12th century. But, by the end of the 12th century, housecarls had probably disappeared in Denmark; they had transformed into a new kind of nobility, whose members no longer resided at the king&#x27;s court.

==In England==
The term entered the English language when Svein Forkbeard and Cnut the Great conquered and occupied Anglo-Saxon England; the housecarls of Cnut were highly disciplined bodyguards. It is unclear, however, whether Cnut&#x27;s housecarls were all Scandinavians; some were Slavs according to Domesday Book records and according to Susan Reynolds, it is likely that some of them were English, with many Englishmen becoming housecarls early in Cnut&#x27;s reign.

Housecarls were only one group of paid soldiers or &quot;hiredmenn&quot; who fought for England before the Norman Conquest. From the annals, it is not clear whether other paid men were types of housecarl or a different subdivision of retainers. There were groups known as &quot;lithsmen&quot; and &quot;butsecarls&quot;, who were soldiers that were equally adept in land and maritime warfare. Also, there were bands of foreign warriors under the control of foreign commanders, who sometimes served as the retinues of important Anglo-Saxon lords. For example, one version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; refers to Earl Tostig&#x27;s retainers as &quot;hiredmenn&quot; whereas another version calls them &quot; hus karlas&quot;. As Tostig was fighting against the king at the time, then the use of the term &quot;housecarl&quot; seems to have been a synonym for a mercenary or retainer rather than just royal bodyguards. It also would have been used to differentiate between that of the paid warrior and the unpaid militia known as the &quot;fyrd&quot;.

===Organisation as royal bodyguards and courtiers===

According to 12th century Danish historian Svend Aggesen, Cnut&#x27;s housecarls were governed by a specific law, the &quot;Witherlogh&quot; or &quot;Lex Castrensis&quot;. Their organisation in a band or guild was Scandinavian in character, but the legal process the &quot;Witherlogh&quot; defines is mainly derived from canon law, directly or through Anglo-Saxon laws. Other possible inspirations include the rules of the Jomsvikings and the rules of the Norwegian &quot;hirð&quot;. The &quot;Whitherlogh&quot; defined an etiquette: housecarles were to be seated at the kings&#x27; tables according to a number of factors, among which skill in war and nobility. They could be disgraced by being moved to a lower place; this was punishment for minor offences, such as not giving proper care to the horse of a fellow housecarl. After three such offences, the offender could be seated at the lowest place, and no-one was to talk to him, but everyone could throw bones at him at will. The murder of another housecarl was punished by outlawry and exile, whereas treason was punished by death and confiscation of all property. Quarrels between housecarles were decided by a specific tribunal (&quot;gemot&quot;), the &quot;Huskarlesteffne&quot;, in the presence of the king; depending on the nature of the quarrel, a varying number of testimonies would be required. However, the &quot;Witherlogh&quot; as we know it through Svend Aggesen was redacted more than one century after the time of Cnut; thus, we cannot be sure that it presents an accurate picture of Cnut&#x27;s housecarls.

===Pay, land grants, and social role===

A special tax was levied to provide pay in coin to the royal housecarls. According to Saxo Grammaticus, the pay was monthly. Due to these wages, the housecarls are seen by some as a type of mercenary; the &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; calls them &quot;málamenn&quot; (&quot;men receiving wages&quot;), while Florence of Worcester uses the term &quot;solidarii&quot; (&quot;salarymen&quot;) and William of Malmesbury that of &quot;stipendarii&quot; (&quot;paid men&quot;). Furthermore, the housecarles were not bound to indefinite service; but there was only one day in the year during which they could leave the king&#x27;s service. That was New Year&#x27;s Eve, a day on which it was customary for Scandinavian kings to reward their retainers with gifts.

On one hand, the number of housecarls receiving land grants and estates from the king seems to have been rather limited, from the beginning of Cnut&#x27;s reign up to the Norman conquest in 1066. At that last date, the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records only thirty-three landholding housecarls in the kingdom; furthermore, these estates were small. Thus, it does not seem that the English landholders were deprived of their properties to provide for land grants to the king&#x27;s housecarls. On the other hand, some of Cnut&#x27;s housecarls seem to have been quite prosperous; the Abbotsbury Abbey was founded either by one of them under the reign of Cnut himself, or by his wife under the reign of Edward the Confessor.

===Administrative role===
The royal housecarls had some administrative duties in peacetime as the King&#x27;s representatives. Florence of Worcester recounts how, in 1041, there was a revolt against a very heavy levy in Worcester, and two of king Harthacnut&#x27;s housecarls, who were acting as tax collectors, were killed.

===Military role===

Because the main sources on Cnut&#x27;s housecarls were written at least one century after Cnut&#x27;s reign, there are several theories about the exact nature and role of these housecarls. Cnut is said to have retained 3,000 to 4,000 men with him in England, to serve as his bodyguard. One theory is that these men were Cnut&#x27;s housecarls, and that they served as a well-equipped, disciplined, professional, and quite numerous (for the time) standing army at the service of the king. However, another theory is that there was nothing like an important, standing, royal army in 11th century Anglo-Saxon England.

This debate has direct consequences on the assessment of the housecarls&#x27; specificities, and whether or not they were an elite troop. For instance, Charles Oman, in his book &quot;The Art of War in the Middle Ages&quot; (1885), states that the main advantage of the housecarls at Hastings were their &quot;esprit de corps&quot;. This view, still widely held today, mainly stems from Svend Aggesen&#x27;s 12th-century description of Cnut&#x27;s housecarls as a group characterized by a strict code (&quot;see above&quot;); Aggesen having been used as a main source by L.M. Larson&#x27;s &quot;The King&#x27;s Household in England Before the Norman Conquest&quot; (1902). However, more recently, historian Nicholas Hooper criticised Larson and stated that &quot;it is time to debunk the housecarl&quot;; according to Hooper, housecarls were not in effect distinguishable from Saxon thegns, and were mainly retainers who received lands or pay (or both), but without being really a standing army. Hooper asserts that while the Housecarles might well have had superior &quot;esprit de corps&quot; and more uniform training and equipment than the average Thegn, they would not necessarily have been a clearly defined military elite.

Yet another theory is that the role of a standing army was not assumed, or was not mostly assumed, by the royal housecarls; but that the housecarls were a smaller body of household troops, partly stationed at the king&#x27;s court. During the reign of Edward the Confessor, a number of sailors and soldiers, the &quot;lithsmen&quot;, were paid wages and possibly based in London; those lithsmen were, according to some, the main standing armed force, while the housecarls were only acting as a secondary one.

One reason to doubt the existence of a standing army made of housecarls is that, when there was a revolt in 1051, under the reign of Edward the Confessor, no such standing army was used to crush it, whereas its existence would have allowed for a swift, decisive action against the rebels.

===The housecarls of Harold Godwinson: Stamford Bridge and Hastings===
By the end of the 11th century in England, there may have been as many as 3,000 Englishmen who were royal housecarls. As the household troops of Harold Godwinson, the housecarls had a crucial role as the backbone of Harold&#x27;s army at Hastings. Although they were numerically the smaller part of Harold&#x27;s army, their possibly superior equipment and training meant they could have been used to strengthen the militia, or &quot;fyrd&quot;, which made up most of Harold&#x27;s troops. The housecarls were positioned in the centre, around their leader&#x27;s standard, but also probably in the first ranks of both flanks, with the fyrdmen behind them. In the Battle of Hastings, these Housecarls fought after Harold&#x27;s death, holding their oath to him until the last man was killed.

The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the housecarls as footmen clad in mail, with conical nasal helmets, and fighting with great, two-handed long axes.

<doc id="436645" wikidata="Q1474788" url="?curid=436645" title="Holmgang">
<text>Holmgang (, , Danish and , ) is a duel practiced by early medieval Scandinavians. It was a legally recognized way to settle disputes.

The name &quot;holmgang&quot; (literally &quot;holm-going&quot;) may derive from the combatants&#x27; dueling on a small island, or &quot;holm&quot;, as they do in the saga of Egill Skallagrímsson, alternatively figuratively in reference to an arena.

At least in theory, anyone offended could challenge the other party to holmgang regardless of their differences in social status. This could be a matter of honor, ownership or property, demand of restitution or debt, legal disagreement or intention to help a wife or relative or avenge a friend.

Holmgangs were fought 3–7 days after the challenge. If the person challenged did not turn up for the holmgang, the other man was considered just in his challenge. If the offended party did not turn up for the holmgang, they were deemed niðingr, and could have been sentenced to outlawry. In effect, if someone was unwilling or unable to defend their claim, they had no honor. Sometimes a capable warrior volunteered to fight in the place of a clearly outclassed friend.

The 13th-century Västgötalagen (Westrogothic law), is a fragment from a unknown late Viking Age law document from Västergötland, Sweden, which stipulates the conditions for a type of judicial duel, either referring to holmgang or einvigi (trial by combat):
Exact rules varied from place to place and changed over time, but before each challenge the duelists agreed to the rules they used. The duel was fought either on a pre-specified plot or on a traditional place which was regularly used for this purpose. The challenger recited the rules, traditional or those agreed upon, before the duel. Rules determined the allowed weapons, who was eligible to strike first, what constituted a defeat or forfeiture, and what the winner received; in Norway, the winner could claim everything the loser owned. &quot;Egils saga Skallagrímssonar&quot; 1975 (as cited in the Viking Lady Answer Page) recounted:


How many times the challenged actually gave in beforehand is unrecorded.

First holmgangs probably ended on the death or incapacitation of one combatant. Killing an opponent did not constitute a murder and therefore did not lead to outlawry or payment of weregeld. Later rules turned holmgang into a more ritualistic direction.

&quot;Kormakssaga&quot; states that the holmgang was fought on an ox hide or cloak with sides that were three meters long. It was staked on the ground with stakes used just for that purpose and placed in a specific manner now unknown. After that the area was marked by drawing three borders around the square hide, each about one foot from the previous one. Corners of the outermost border were marked with hazel staves. Combatants had to fight inside these borders. Stepping out of borders meant forfeiture, running away meant cowardice.

There is a hint in &quot;Kormakssaga&quot; about the sacrifice of a bull before a holmgang, whose hide was stretched and afixed to the ground on which the fight was to take place; but there are many references about the sacrifice the winner made after the victory. Combatants were permitted a specific number of shields (usually three) they could use – the opponent&#x27;s strikes could break a shield. The challenged would strike first and then the combatants would hit each other in turn. The combat would normally end on the first blood and the winner would receive three marks of silver. This represents mainly the later Icelandic version of holmgang, which was intended to avoid unnecessary loss of life and excessive profiteering; unless the dispute was about a specific property, the most the winner could receive was the three marks of silver.

Professional duelists used holmgangs as a form of legalized robbery; they could claim rights to land, women, or property, and then prove their claims in the duel at the expense of the legitimate owner. Many sagas describe berserks who abused holmgang in this way. In large part due to such practices, holmgangs were outlawed in Iceland in 1006, as a result of the duel between Gunnlaugr Ormstunga and Hrafn Önundarson, and in Norway in 1014.

==In popular culture==

In the allegorical fantasy novel &quot;Silverlock&quot;, by John Myers Myers, in the song &quot;The Ballad of Bowie Gizzardsbane&quot;, Bowie&#x27;s knife-fighting past is referred to as &quot;the Holmgang at Natchez.&quot;

In 1957, Poul Anderson – a Danish-American who frequently used Viking themes in his writings – published the science fiction story &quot;Holmgang&quot; (collected in the 1982 anthology &quot;Cold Victory&quot;). The story&#x27;s two protagonists – feuding spacemen of the future who are of distant Scandinavian origin and one of whom (the villain) is historically conscious – decide to revive this Viking tradition, resorting to a deadly holmgang on a lonely asteroid instead of a sea island, in order to settle their irreconcilable differences over a tangled issue involving crime, politics, and a woman&#x27;s love. Anderson&#x27;s protagonist in &quot;The Man Who Came Early&quot;, set in 10th-century Iceland, is also forced into a holmgang.

&quot;Holmgang&quot; is the name of a Norwegian TV-debate program that aired on the commercial Norwegian station TV 2 from 1992 to 2008.

In the 2001 novel &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Dart&quot; by Jacqueline Carey, the fictional Skaldic people observe the holmgang and other Norse and Teutonic traditions. One Skaldic character challenges Joscelin Verreuil to holmgang.

The film &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999) includes a holmgang process, complete with insult, shields and weregild. The book the film is based on, &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, contains the same scene with more detailed explanation of both the ritual and the significance of how it is carried out. 

In the 2013 MMORPG &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;, the character class Marauder and its upgraded form Warrior has the ability Holmgang, which creates a chain that binds the user and their target together. They are immobile for the duration and must attack each other, in reference to how a real Holmgang would be conducted.

The Norwegian television series &quot;Norsemen&quot; featured a holmgang in the first episode of the series, and again in the second season.

The 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot; features several holmgangs throughout its story campaign.

In 2021, Pär Hulkoff (solo Swedish metal singer-songwriter) released a single &quot;Holmgång&quot; for his upcoming album &quot;Ragnarök&quot;. The song, melodic and aggressive, ties the ancient Northern practice into modern military context.

In the 2022 film The Northman, Amleth and Fjölnir engage in Holmgang at the top of the volcano Hekla.

<text>Mary Anne Talbot also known as John Taylor (2 February 1778 – 4 February 1808) was an Englishwoman who wore male dress and became a soldier and sailor during the French Revolutionary Wars.

==Life==
Mary Anne Talbot was born in London at 62 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Later she claimed that she was one of the sixteen illegitimate children of Lord William Talbot, Baron of Hensol. Her mother died in childbirth when she was four. She spent her childhood in the care of different guardians, living with a wet nurse at Worthen, Shropshire from after her birth until the age of five, and then attended a girls&#x27; boarding school in Chester until age fourteen. She fell in the hands of a man she called Mr. Sucker (also known as Shuker), who was also in charge of her inheritance from her sister.

In 1792 Talbot ended up as a mistress of Captain Essex Bowen, who enlisted her as his footboy under the name &quot;John Taylor&quot; for a voyage to Santo Domingo. The regiment, the 82nd of Foot, were diverted for service in Flanders against the French and she served as a drummer-boy in the battle for Valenciennes, where Captain Bowen was killed. She was also wounded by a sabre slash and treated the wound herself. From Bowen&#x27;s letters Talbot found out that Sucker had squandered what was left of her inheritance. She decided to go on working as a male sailor.

She deserted, fleeing through Luxembourg into the German Rhineland and became a cabin boy for a French ship. When the British Royal Navy captured the ship she was transferred to the &quot;Brunswick&quot; where she served as a powder monkey.

Talbot was wounded for the second time on 1 June 1794 during the battle against the French fleet off Ushant when grapeshot almost severed her leg. She never recovered the full use of it but later rejoined the crew. Later the French captured her and she spent the following 18 months in a Dunkirk dungeon. She managed to return to London in 1796. She subsequently signed on as a clerk aboard an American merchantman as a passage to the United States but she returned again to England to avoid the attentions of the skipper&#x27;s niece who wanted to marry her, ignorant of Talbot&#x27;s gender.

In 1797 she was seized by a press-gang and was forced to reveal her gender.

She went to the Navy to get the money due to her because of her service and wounds and finally found a sympathetic magistrate. At the same time her leg wound worsened and she continued to wear male clothing. She also visited Mr. Sucker who told her that all her inheritance was lost. Sucker apparently died of a heart attack three days later.
Talbot continued to use sailor&#x27;s clothes, worked in menial jobs and even tried her luck on stage at Drury Lane but eventually was arrested and taken to debtor&#x27;s prison at Newgate. When she was released she became a household servant for publisher Robert S. Kirby at his home in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, London and worked for him for three years until her health deteriorated. She went to live with friends in Shropshire and died a few weeks later aged 34, on 4 February 1808.

Talbot has been identified with the &quot;Anna Maria Talbot, d[aughter] of Tho[mas] Weaver - [of] Worthin - aged 30&quot;(sic) who was recorded in the parish register of Worthen as buried there on 7 February 1808.

Kirby included her tale in his book &quot;Wonderful Museum&quot;, and (following her death) in &quot;The Life and Surprising Adventures of Mary Anne Talbot&quot; (1809). Talbot&#x27;s tale aroused some sympathy and even a case of imposture when a woman in a Light Horseman&#x27;s uniform tried to use a name John Taylor to solicit money in London.

However, the truthfulness of Talbot&#x27;s story has been thrown into doubt, due to the discrepancies of the tale of her supposed time at sea, recorded in her biography and published in 1804. Among these, there is no record of any seamen on board the ships she claimed to have served in with the name Taylor. The unlikeliness of several of her accounts is also shown with her claim to have been on the &quot;Vesuvius&quot; as a midshipman when it was captured by the French on the English Channel. The ship in question was, at the time of the alleged capture, serving in the West Indies.

<text>Marvin Harold Hewitt (March 24, 1922 – March 31, 1991) was an American impostor who became, among other things, a university physics professor.

Hewitt was born in Philadelphia on March 24, 1922, the son of Samuel Hewitt, a police officer who was killed in 1947.

Hewitt was a high school drop-out with no qualifications who wanted to become an academic. He always used names and identities of real-life people in his impostures. He later claimed that he had a &quot;compulsion to teach&quot;.

Hewitt&#x27;s first imposture began in 1945 when he selected a famous name from a list of university teachers and used it to apply for a position of an aerodynamic engineer. However, the name was too recognizable and he was soon exposed.

The next identity Hewitt adopted was that of Julius Ashkin, a physics professor. He applied and was accepted first into a pharmacological college in Philadelphia and the next year into teacher&#x27;s college in Minnesota. When he began to gain academic fame, the real Ashkin wrote him to suggest that he stop.

Hewitt proceeded to adopt the persona of George Hewitt, former chief researcher of Radio Corporation of America. When he was found out, he switched to that of philosophy professor Clifford Berry.

In 1954, Hewitt was on his fifth teaching job as Dr. Kenneth Yates, an associate professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire. At that stage two other colleges had discovered that his credentials were false when they noticed that the real Kenneth Yates was currently working for an oil company. They had only removed him from the faculty and the university authorities had decided to let him leave quietly when the details leaked out.

Hewitt died on March 31, 1991, aged 69.

<text>Randy S. Ferbey (born May 30, 1959) is a Canadian retired curler from Sherwood Park, Alberta. Ferbey is a six-time Canadian champion and a four-time World Champion. He recently coached the Rachel Homan women&#x27;s team.

Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Ferbey notably popularized the system of having the skip throw third rocks, when he skipped the team nicknamed &quot;the Ferbey Four&quot;, a team that he won four Briers (2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and narrowly missed winning the 2004 final after giving up an 8-4 lead to Mark Dacey. Others teams in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s curling have adopted the system of not having the skip throw last stones, such as the Margaretha Sigfridsson rink, who would win an Olympic Silver medal and numerous World silver medals and European gold medals by skipping while throwing lead stones, and Jim Cotter throwing last rocks for John Morris who would together reach the finals of both 2014 Olympic Curling Trials and 2014 Brier. The Ferbey Four also popularized the &quot;numbered zones&quot;, when calling out the weight of various draw shots. Many consider the quartet together at its peak from 2002–2006 to be either the best team or very near to the best team in curling history. Nedohin&#x27;s often near perfect shotmaking (regularly having games in the high 90s), Ferbey&#x27;s extremely aggressive shot calling, and the stellar brushing and front end stones of Marcel Rocque and Scott Pfeifer (nicknamed Huff and Puff for their tireless work on the broom) made them an incredibly difficult challenge for every opponent.

All together, he has played in eight Briers, six World Championships, four Continental Cups, skipped in two Canadian Mixed Curling Championships, won three Canada Cups, and two TSN Skins Games. In In 2019, Ferbey was named the greatest Canadian male third in history in a TSN poll of broadcasters, reporters and top curlers. As he threw third stones for most of his career, Ferbey was considered a third rather than a skip as his position.

==Career==

===Early years with Pat Ryan===
Ferbey participated in his first Brier in 1987 as a third for Pat Ryan. His first Brier would be a disappointment, as they finished with a 6–5 record. The next year however, Ferbey, Ryan and their team Alberta mates Don Walchuk and Don McKenzie won the Brier, and were thus crowned Canadian champions defeating Eugene Hritzuk of Saskatchewan 8–7 in the final. At the 1988 Worlds, Team Ryan won the silver medal, losing in the finals to Eigil Ramsfjell of Norway 5–4. As defending champions at the 1989 Brier, Team Ryan would not disappoint, capturing their 2nd Canadian championship defeating Rick Folk of British Columbia in a non-eventful 3–2 victory. It was low scoring games like this one, and by teams like Ryan&#x27;s dubbed the &quot;Ryan Express&quot; that forced the Canadian Curling Association and World Curling Federation to implement the 3-rock rule, and later the 4-rock rule to force more offense. At the 1989 Worlds, Ferbey and Team Ryan won their first World Championships, beating Switzerland&#x27;s Patrick Hürlimann in the finals. In 1990, Ferbey left the team, and was unsuccessful at attempting to make it to the Brier with his new team of Don Walchuk, Pat McCallum, and Greg Muzechka. Although they did make it to the final four teams at the 1990 Alberta Championships, failing to make the 1990 Labatt Brier in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.

===The &quot;Ferbey Four&quot;===
After playing his last season with Ryan in 1997 where he played in the British Columbia playdowns, Ferbey teamed up with a young David Nedohin in 1997 with Carter Rycroft and Pat McCallum. After a reasonably successful season, reaching the Semi-Finals of the World Curling Tour Championship, and winning the Edmonton Superleague, Ferbey picked up Scott Pfeifer, bumping Rycroft to lead.

In 1999, Rycroft left the team to play with Ferbey&#x27;s main rival, Kevin Martin. Rycroft was replaced by Marcel Rocque. The Ferbey Four that would dominate the Brier for the next few years was complete. Ferbey made his return to the Alberta provincials in 1999. While they didn&#x27;t win, they did return in 2001 with a bang. They would win the Alberta final against Kevin Martin, 6–4, and then won the 2001 Nokia Brier as well beating Kerry Burtnyk of Manitoba 8–4 in the final. This sent the team to the 2001 Worlds where they lost both their semi-final game and the bronze medal game, which they gave up to Pål Trulsen of Norway. In 2002, Team Ferbey won their second straight provincial final, defeating Mike Vavrek 6–5. Ferbey then went on to win his fourth Brier, the 2002 Nokia Brier, which was his team&#x27;s 2nd. They beat John Morris 9–4 in the final. This time, at the 2002 Worlds in Bismarck, North Dakota his team won the championship, beating the same Pål Trulsen, 10–5. After defeating Jamie King 10–3 in the 2003 Alberta final, Ferbey and his team would return to the Brier, in 2003 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In the finals, they beat the home-town favourites Mark Dacey 8–4 in the finals. At the 2003 Ford World Curling Championship, his team won their 2nd world title, beating Ralph Stöckli of Switzerland 10–6 in the finals. The team won their fourth provincial title in 2004, defeating the Kurt Balderston rink in the final, 8–5. The 2004 Nokia Brier was a blip on his team&#x27;s record. After returning to the Brier for the fourth straight year, an unprecedented feat especially considering the great number of good teams in Alberta, his team would bow out in the final. After a 10–1 round-robin record, Ferbey and his team lost out to the same team they beat the previous year, Mark Dacey of Nova Scotia, in a 10–9 game where Ferbey&#x27;s team surrendered a lead. However, Team Ferbey did not give up, and their reign would not be over. In 2005, they once again won the Alberta championships, for a record fifth time, defeating the Jamie King rink 8–6 in an extra end. The team once again won the 2005 Canadian championships, setting a record, as his team became the first to win four championships as a team. The final was against Nova Scotia again, albeit a different team, that of Shawn Adams. In another close game, team Ferbey pulled it out and won 5–4 in the final. His trip to the 2005 Men&#x27;s Ford World Curling Championships were marked with struggles, as the team finished the round-robin with three losses – tied for first with five other teams. After having a 4–3 record, Ferbey mounted eight straight wins for the championship over David Murdoch of Scotland in a convincing 11–4 victory. Additionally, the Ferbey rink was the first team in history to score five on any single end in the world finals – and they managed this feat twice at the 2005 Ford World Curling Championships.

Many attribute Ferbey&#x27;s success during this time to the boycott that other major teams of the early 2000s had of the Brier, to play in Grand Slam events. Ferbey did not boycott the Brier, and as a result, played in very few Grand Slam events. This however could only possibly be applied to his 2002 and 2003 Brier wins, as his first Brier title in 2001 was before the emergence of the official Grand Slam circuit with all top teams involved in provincial playdowns, and his final Brier title in 2005 was after the conflict had been resolved and player&#x27;s boycott lifted with all now participating in provincial playdowns. After Ferbey&#x27;s run of 4 Brier wins from 2001–2005, Ferbey rink failed to win another provincial title, as Kevin Martin&#x27;s rink would win the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 provincial tournaments; from 2007 onwards with a new team with young guns Ben Hebert and Marc Kennedy as his front end, and former rival John Morris as his third. The Ferbey four would still remain one of the top teams in the country however, as they would win three Grand Slam events in their career, but Kevin Martin and Glenn Howard would supplant Team Ferbey as the two dominant teams in the country over this quadrennial. David Nedohin would lose his edge as the games top shooter over this period as well.

One of the big disappoints for the team was their failure to qualify for the Olympics. After winning their first Brier, the team went 5–4 at the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, missing out on the playoffs or a tiebreaker by just 1 game. In 2005 after winning their final Brier, they finished just 4–5 at the Trials that year. In 2009, the team had another disappointing Olympic Trials, finishing 3–4.

===Teaming up with Brad Gushue===
In April 2010, Randy Ferbey announced he would be joining Brad Gushue&#x27;s team effective for the 2010–11 curling season. Ferbey will skip the team, but throw third rocks like he had been with his former team. Previous third, Mark Nichols, will be bumped up to the second position and Ryan Fry will play lead. Jamie Korab, the past lead on Team Gushue, decided to take a year or two off. In an ironic twist, the final game played by the Ferbey four would be against Gushue in the quarterfinals of the 2010 Players&#x27; Championships. Ferbey lost to Gushue 8–3. In their first event as a team, the rink lost to Thomas Lips in the final of the 2010 Baden Masters.

In December 2010, Randy Ferbey and David Nedohin announced they would team up once again in an attempt to play in the 2011 Boston Pizza Cup for a chance to represent Alberta at the 2011 Tim Hortons Brier.

On February 9, 2011, Randy Ferbey announced his time curling with Brad Gushue had come to an end. He stated he knew after the Canadian Open Grand Slam Event, he was done curling with them.

===The final season and retirement===
In the 2011–12 curling season, Ferbey teamed up with longtime teammate David Nedohin, who threw fourth stones. Ferbey skipped at third position, and Ted Appelman and Brendan Melnyk played as second and lead, respectively. They fared rather well on the World Curling tour, winning The Shoot-Out and finishing second at the Cactus Pheasant Classic. However, they failed to qualify for the playoffs at the 2011 World Cup of Curling and the 2011 BDO Canadian Open of Curling.

Ferbey decided to retire from competitive curling after attempting to construct a team that might be able to qualify for the 2013 Olympic Trials, a plan which ultimately failed when Nedohin decided to form his own team. He was inducted into the WCF Hall of Fame in 2014.

In 2023 Ferbey and his Team Ferbey rinkmates (David Nedohin, Scott Pfeifer and Marcel Rocque) were inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Ferbey is a representative for Everest Funeral Concierge Service. He is married and has three children.

<text>(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory? is the second studio album by the English rock band Oasis. Released on 2 October 1995 by Creation Records, it was produced by Owen Morris and the group&#x27;s lead guitarist and chief songwriter Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album was a significant departure from the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; (1994). Gallagher&#x27;s compositions were more focused in balladry and placed more emphasis on &quot;huge&quot; choruses, with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; (1994). &quot;Morning Glory&quot; was the group&#x27;s first album with drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll (though McCarroll still appeared on the album, drumming on the track &quot;Some Might Say&quot;).

The album propelled Oasis from being a crossover indie act to a worldwide rock phenomenon, and is seen by critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music. &quot;Morning Glory&quot; sold a record-breaking 345,000 copies in its first week in the UK before going on to spend 10 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was also the band&#x27;s breakthrough in the United States, reaching number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and being certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album yielded four major hit singles in the band&#x27;s native Britain: &quot;Some Might Say&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; reached number one, and &quot;Roll with It&quot; and &quot;Wonderwall&quot; peaked at number two; the latter has emerged as the band&#x27;s biggest-selling UK hit, spending 30 consecutive weeks on the chart. &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; and &quot;Wonderwall&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band supported the album with an extensive world tour, which saw them play to among the largest audiences ever at the time.

Although a commercial success, the record initially received lukewarm reviews from mainstream critics; many reviewers deemed it inferior to &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, with the songwriting and production being particular points of criticism. However, critical opinion of the album reversed dramatically in the ensuing months and years, with critics recognising its strengths and its &quot;populist appeal&quot;. Despite some views since that the album is overrated, &quot;Morning Glory&quot; is still considered a seminal record of both the Britpop era and the 1990s in general. It has appeared on several lists of the greatest albums in rock music, and at the 2010 Brit Awards, it was named the greatest British album since 1980. It has sold over 22 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. As of January 2024, the album has been certified 17× platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling 5.1 million copies in the United Kingdom.

==Background and recording==
In May 1995, in the wake of the critical and commercial success of their 1994 debut album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, Oasis began recording &quot;Morning Glory&quot; at Rockfield Studios in Wales, with Owen Morris and Noel Gallagher producing. By the time they had finished in June 1995, Oasis were on the brink of becoming one of the most popular bands in the UK; the August 1995 &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;, in which Oasis and Blur had a chart battle over their respective singles &quot;Roll with It&quot; and &quot;Country House&quot; would propel them to mainstream awareness.

Despite the friction between the Gallagher brothers, Owen Morris reflected in 2010 that: &quot;The sessions were the best, easiest, least fraught, most happily creative time I&#x27;ve ever had in a recording studio. I believe people can feel and hear when music is dishonest and motivated by the wrong reasons. &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, for all its imperfection and flaws, is dripping with love and happiness.&quot; Paul Weller joined them in the studio and provided lead guitar and backing vocals for &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;, and harmonica for the two untitled tracks known as &quot;The Swamp Song&quot;. Noel wrote the last song for the album, &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot;, on the train as he returned to the studio. - the track was written for Richard Ashcroft, following a painful initial split of his band, The Verve.

Morris claimed the album was recorded in 15 days, at a pace of one song a day. &quot;Some Might Say&quot; proved problematic to record: the backing track was recorded in one take after Noel Gallagher and Morris drunkenly listened to the demo and decided the new version was played too fast, and Noel woke the rest of the band to re-record it. The backing track was faster than intended, with what Morris described as &quot;a really bad speed up during the first three bars of the first chorus&quot;, but the take had to be used because those involved were impressed with Liam&#x27;s vocals, and Morris had to mix the track three times, using delay and other processing to hide the mistakes. When the album was finished, Morris said it would &quot;wipe the field with any competition ... It&#x27;s astonishing. It&#x27;s the &quot;Bollocks&quot; for this decade.&quot; Creation Records boss Alan McGee was similarly enthused, saying that &quot;You just cannot slag this record. It&#x27;s gonna speak to real, working-class lads in a way that a Suede or Radiohead could only dream of doing.&quot; The album&#x27;s title was inspired by Noel&#x27;s friend Melissa Lim answering the phone with said phrase, which is itself derived from a line in the song &quot;The Telephone Hour&quot; from the film &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.

The brickwall mastering technique used during the recording of the album has led to some journalists claiming that it was responsible for initiating the loudness war, as its heavy use of compression, first widely used by Morris on &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, was leaps and bounds beyond what any other album up until then had attempted. Music journalist Nick Southall, who has written extensively on the loudness war, commented, &quot;If there&#x27;s a jump-the-shark moment as far as CD mastering goes then it&#x27;s probably Oasis.&quot; In &quot;Britpop and the English Music Tradition&quot;, Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton noted that as a result of this technique &quot;the songs were especially loud. [Liam] Gallagher&#x27;s voice is foregrounded to the point that it appears to grow out of the mixes of the songs, exposing itself to execute a pseudo-live quality.&quot;

==Composition==
The music on &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; has been characterised by commentators as rock, and Oasis as an essential part of Britpop culture. Music critic John Harris commented in his music history &quot;Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock&quot; that much of the music seemed to be &quot;little more inspired than a string of musical hand-me-downs&quot;. Among the musical cues Harris noted on the album were Gary Glitter&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Hello, I&#x27;m Back Again&quot;, John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;), the theme to the 1970s children&#x27;s programme &quot;You and Me&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; (&quot;She&#x27;s Electric&quot;), and the influence of R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;The One I Love&quot; on &quot;Morning Glory&quot;. One song, &quot;Step Out&quot;, bore such a close resemblance to the song &quot;Uptight (Everything&#x27;s Alright)&quot; by Stevie Wonder that it was removed from the album shortly before release due to the threat of legal action. Musicologist Allan F. Moore compares &quot;She&#x27;s Electric&quot; to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, writing that both songs can be claimed by an older generation.

In &quot;Britpop ...&quot;, Bennett and Stratton analysed Liam Gallagher&#x27;s vocal style in significant detail, stressing its importance to the songs of the album; &quot;[Liam&#x27;s] Mancunian accent blends into a register and timbre that works the gestural contours of the melody and lyrics.&quot; Bennett and Stratton went on to conclude that Liam&#x27;s &#x27;over-personalized&#x27; style on songs such as &quot;Wonderwall&quot; resulted in &quot;a beautiful sense of sentimentality that bespeaks the despondency of a generation. This occurs through the narrative structure of the song, vocal production, and the conventions of the singer&#x27;s cultural context.&quot; Music critic Derek B. Scott remarked &quot;a Beatles-influenced vocal harmony that includes falsetto and echoing of words is heard in &#x27;Cast No Shadow&#x27;&quot;.

Noel Gallagher summed up his own perspective on the album&#x27;s aesthetic in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1995; &quot;Whilst [&quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;] is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band, &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; is about actually &quot;being&quot; a pop star in a band.&quot; The album has a notable anthemic theme to its songs, differing from the raw-edged rock of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. The use of string arrangements and more varied instrumentation in songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; and &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; was a significant departure from the band&#x27;s debut. This style had first been implemented by the band on their fifth single, &quot;Whatever&quot;, released in December 1994. It was produced in conjunction with the London Symphony Orchestra, resulting in a much more pop-oriented and mellower sound; this would be the template that would come to define many of the songs on &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot;. In the BBC documentary &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot;, former NME chief editor Steve Sutherland noted that &quot;with &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, [Noel] began to take seriously the notion of being the voice of a generation&quot;.

==Cover==

The cover is a picture of two men passing each other on Berwick Street in London. The two men are London DJ Sean Rowley and album sleeve designer Brian Cannon (back to the camera). The album&#x27;s producer Owen Morris can be seen in the background, on the left footpath, holding the album&#x27;s master tape in front of his face. The location was chosen because the street was a popular location for record shops at the time. The cover cost £25,000 to produce. In the documentary &quot;Squaring the Circle: The Story of Hipgnosis&quot;, Noel Gallagher expresses his displeasure with the cover, admitting that he had not paid enough attention to the art design process.

==Promotion==
While &quot;Some Might Say&quot;, a number one hit, had been released in April, the single chosen to precede the album&#x27;s release was &quot;Roll with It&quot;, planned for release on 14 August, six weeks before the album was due to hit the shelves. This was an unorthodox method for the time, contrasting the standard industry procedure of releasing the lead single three weeks before its parent album. Blur&#x27;s management had become worried that this would hinder the chances of the group&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;Country House&quot; single reaching number one the following week. As a reaction, Food Records pushed the release of &quot;Country House&quot; back a week. The NME hailed this oncoming chart battle as a &quot;British Heavyweight Championship&quot; between the two bands and thus started what became known as &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;.

The event triggered an unprecedented amount of exposure for both bands in national newspapers and on television news bulletins, supposedly symbolising the battle between the middle class of the south and the working class of the north. In the midst of the battle a &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper headline proclaimed &quot;Working Class Heroes Lead Art School Trendies&quot;. &quot;Country House&quot; outsold &quot;Roll with It&quot; by 54,000 and topped the singles chart for a fortnight. Overall singles sales that week were up by 41 per cent. In 2005, John Harris reflected on the importance of the event in popularising Britpop; &quot;(as) Blur&#x27;s &quot;Country House&quot; raced Oasis&#x27; &quot;Roll with It&quot; to the top of the charts, just about every voice in the media felt compelled to express an opinion on the freshly inaugurated age of Britpop.&quot;

During a promotional interview in September, the month before the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with Damon Albarn and Alex James from Blur, and was quoted in the 17 September edition of &quot;The Observer&quot; saying he hoped &quot;the pair of them would catch AIDS and die because I fucking hate them two.&quot; Although Noel recanted and said that AIDS is no laughing matter, the quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that &quot;my whole world came crashing down in on me then&quot;. However, in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005, Blur&#x27;s guitarist Graham Coxon said that he bore no malice towards Oasis. &quot;At least they were outright about it. They weren&#x27;t pretending to like us and then slagging us off, which is what we&#x27;d been used to. In that way, I quite appreciated them.&quot;

On 2 October 2018, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the album release, a new lyric video for the track &quot;She&#x27;s Electric&quot;, described as being &quot;loaded with psychedelic imagery&quot;, was published on the band&#x27;s YouTube VEVO channel.

==Release==
&quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; was released on 2 October 1995. The album sold quickly; the &quot;Daily Express&quot; reported the day after release that central London HMV stores were selling copies of the album at a rate of two per minute. At the end of the first week of sales, the album had sold a record-breaking 345,000 copies, making it (at the time) the second-fastest-selling album in British history, behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot;. After initially entering the UK charts at number one, it hovered around the top three for the rest of the year before initiating a six-week stay at the top in mid January, followed by a further three weeks at number one in March. In total, the album did not leave the top three for seven months.

After the fourth single from the album, &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, hit the top ten in several countries, including stays at number one in Australia and New Zealand and achieving a peak of number eight in the United States, the album began to enjoy prolonged international success. Eventually the album had a five-week run at the top of the Australian albums chart and an eight-week run at the top of the New Zealand albums chart before topping charts in Canada, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland. The album was also making significant waves in the US market, thanks in part to the success of the &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; singles on American modern rock radio. Both songs reached number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and stayed there for ten and five weeks respectively. By early 1996, &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; was selling 200,000 copies a week, eventually peaking at number four and being certified four times platinum by the end of the year for shipments of over four million units. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; also topped the Australian and New Zealand singles charts.

==Tour==
The band embarked on what would become a 103 show world tour in support of the album over a period of several months in 1995 and 1996. The tour started on 22 June 1995 with a pre-Glastonbury festival warm-up gig at the 1,400 capacity Bath Pavilion, which featured the debut of new drummer Alan White and several new songs off the album, and ended on 4 December 1996 at the 11,800 capacity Mayo Civic Centre in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and included concerts at Earls Court in November 1995 and Cardiff International Arena in March 1996. The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice walking out of the group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg.

In September 1995, bass player Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan walked out on the group after he was subjected to a flurry of verbal abuse from Liam while doing interviews in Paris. McGuigan cited nervous exhaustion as the reason for his departure. Scott McLeod of The Ya-Yas was brought in as his replacement; though, despite playing a string of gigs with the band and appearing in the video for the &quot;Wonderwall&quot; single, McLeod was unable to adapt to the frenetic celebrity lifestyle, duly returning to Manchester halfway through an American promotional tour for the album. The band played a few dates, including an appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, as a four piece, before McGuigan was convinced to return for the group&#x27;s Earls Court shows in early November. When the band broke up for a brief time in late 1996, several US tour dates and the entire Australia and New Zealand leg had to be cancelled.

As the band began to reach the peak of their popularity, several large open-air concerts were organised in the UK during 1996, including two gigs at Manchester City football stadium Maine Road, two nights at Loch Lomond in Scotland, and two nights at Knebworth House in front of a record 125,000 people each night; an event that would come to be acknowledged as the height of the Britpop phenomenon, with one journalist commenting; &quot;(Knebworth) could be seen as the last great Britpop performance; nothing after would match its scale.&quot; At the time, the concerts were the biggest gigs ever held for a single band on UK soil, and to date remain the largest demand ever for a British concert; with reportedly over 2.5 million applications for tickets. The Earl&#x27;s Court and Maine Road gigs were filmed and later released as the Oasis VHS/DVD &quot;...There and Then&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; was released to lukewarm reviews from the mainstream music press. Contemporary reviewers expressed disappointment at the album&#x27;s perceived inferiority to &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, taking aim at the &quot;banal lyrics&quot; and the unoriginal nature of the compositions. David Cavanagh of &quot;Q&quot; magazine said of the lyrics: &quot;They scan; they fill a hole; end of story. They [say] nothing much about anything.&quot; Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; commented that &quot;She&#x27;s Electric&quot; is &quot;laddism of a tiresomely generic kind&quot;, while &quot;Roll with It&quot; is &quot;drab and chummy&quot;. In &quot;Spin&quot;, Chuck Eddy wrote that the band had eschewed the &quot;Bowie glitter&quot; of their debut for &quot;generic classic rock&quot;, while &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; critic Shane Danielsen felt the Gallaghers lacked the ability to sing or &quot;produce classics&quot;. While stating that &quot;Some Might Say&quot; was &quot;the best single of the year&quot;, David Stubbs of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was critical of the album as a whole; &quot;&quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; [sounds] laboured and lazy. On this evidence, Oasis are a limited band ... they sound knackered.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; was more enthusiastic, with the magazine&#x27;s John Robinson writing that the album shows Oasis pursuing &quot;an altogether different direction; away from the conscience-free overloaded hedonism towards an understanding of its consequences&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Wiederhorn wrote that &quot;&quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; is more than a natural progression, it&#x27;s a bold leap forward that displays significant musical and personal growth.&quot; He went on to note that the &quot;stormy&quot; relationship between Liam and Noel proved to be one of the album&#x27;s strengths; &quot;tension and instability have been inherent traits of great rock teams ... for Oasis, the addition of shared genes gives their songs extra impact and dimension.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn welcomed the album as a counterpoint to the prevailing &quot;despair&quot; of the decade&#x27;s rock music. The album finished 10th in the voting for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. The poll&#x27;s curator Robert Christgau initially assessed it as &quot;phony Beatlemania&quot;; he later gave it a two-star honourable mention, indicating a &quot;likable effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy&quot;, and quipped &quot;give them credit for wanting it all—and (yet another Beatles connection!) playing guitars&quot;. &quot;Select&quot; ranked the album at number two on its end-of-year list of the 50 best albums of 1995.

In his book &quot;Britpop!&quot;, John Harris concluded that the initial negative reviews of the time missed the album&#x27;s universal strengths. &quot;Those who fussed about the music&#x27;s more artful aspects were missing the point. The fact that [Noel&#x27;s] songs contained so many musical echoes seemed to couch the album in an air of homely reassurance.&quot; Harris believed that the &quot;ordinary&quot; nature of some of the album&#x27;s songs &quot;turned out to be part of its deeply populist appeal&quot;.

=== Battle of Britpop ===
The album&#x27;s release alongside Blur&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape&quot; came at the height of the so-called &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;. Despite some genuine enmity between the two bands, this was a primarily media-constructed pitting of the more classic rock-focused, working-class northern band Oasis against the middle-class, musically more eclectic Blur. Released around the same time as &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story?) Morning Glory&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was initially widely praised by critics, far more so than Oasis&#x27; effort. However, as Oasis gained popularity and acclaim, critical consensus around &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was revised, with &quot;Q&quot; magazine even apologising for its original review. BBC Music writer James McMahon recalled how the &quot;critical euphoria&quot; surrounding the album lasted &quot;about as long as it took publishers to realise Oasis would probably shift more magazines for them&quot;. The media&#x27;s switch to Oasis has led to the band&#x27;s critical acclaim being questioned in the years since Britpop. Additionally, the critical lauding awarded by numerous critics to Oasis out of a desire to grow sales of their own publications, rather than genuinely reviewing the album for its strengths and weaknesses alone, is recognised as a leading factor in the alleged &quot;over-hype&quot; of &quot;Morning Glory&quot;&#x27;s follow up &quot;Be Here Now&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; is considered an important record of the Britpop era and one of the best albums of the nineties, and it appears in several lists as one of the greatest albums of all time. Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), called the album &quot;a triumph, full of bluster and bravado but also moments of surprising tenderness&quot;, adding that it &quot;capped a true golden age for Britpop&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at 378 on its 2012 list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and at 157 on its 2020 list. &quot;Spin&quot; included it at 79 in their list of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014&quot;. The album&#x27;s enduring popularity within the UK was reflected when it won the British Album of 30 Years award at the 2010 Brit Awards. The award was voted by the public to decide the greatest Album of the Year winner in the history of the Brit Awards. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 21 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The Encyclopedia of Popular Music stated that &quot;it was undeniably a gigantic album&quot;.

On the other hand, some have considered &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; to be overrated. &quot;FasterLouder&quot; writer Max Easton argued that its &quot;lasting place in &#x27;90s folklore is less about the quality of the album, and more about the celebrity status and faux imagery attached to it&quot;. Easton saw all 12 tracks as &quot;variations on only a couple of good ideas&quot;. &quot;Musicradar&quot; felt the initial lukewarm reviews of the album were accurate, adding that &quot;its place on countless &#x27;best ever&#x27; lists is wholly unjustified. Even Noel Gallagher admits that &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; is a superior record&quot;. Gallagher has noted &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; as an overrated work, expressing a level of dissatisfaction with its production values, and stating that &quot;some of the songs are not as great as people think they are&quot;; he outright dismissed &quot;Roll with It&quot; as a &quot;shit&quot; song. &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot; readers named &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; as one of the 20 most overrated albums in history.

&quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; nevertheless went on to become the best-selling album of the decade in the UK, with its sixteen platinum certifications from the British Phonographic Industry. It was also certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The sixteen platinum certifications in the UK were the highest ever awarded to a single record until Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot;, released in 2011. The success of the album resulted in Oasis becoming one of the biggest bands in the world, with substantial and considerable press coverage in the mainstream music press and frequent comparisons to the Beatles in the media.

&quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; propelled Oasis from being a crossover indie act to a worldwide rock phenomenon after the momentum gained by the critically acclaimed &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. It has been pinpointed by music critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music, demonstrating just how far into the mainstream independent music had ventured. In 2005, John Harris noted the significance of the album and &quot;Wonderwall&quot; in particular to Britpop&#x27;s legacy. &quot;When (Oasis) released Wonderwall, the rules of British music were decisively changed. From hereon in, the lighter-than-air ballad became obligatory, and the leather-trousers era of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll was over.&quot; The success of the album in Britain resulted in Oasis becoming a cultural ubiquity for a brief period, featuring in tabloid newspapers on an almost daily basis and breaking sales records for live concerts.

<doc id="436658" wikidata="Q1762047" url="?curid=436658" title="Ulama (game)">
<text>Ollama () is a ball game played in Mexico, currently experiencing a revival from its home in a few communities in the state of Sinaloa. As a descendant of the Aztec version of the Mesoamerican ballgame, the game is regarded as one of the oldest continuously played sports in the world and as the oldest known game using a rubber ball.

==History==

The word &quot;ollama&quot; comes from the Nahuatl word &quot;ōllamaliztli&quot; from &quot;ōllama&quot; (playing of a game with a ball), related to the word &quot;ōlli&quot; (rubber, rubber ball). &quot;Ōllamaliztli&quot; was the Aztec name for the Mesoamerican ballgame (meaning roughly &quot;the process of playing the ball game&quot;), whose roots extended back to at least the 2nd millennium BC and evidence of which has been found in nearly all Mesoamerican cultures in an area extending from modern-day Mexico to El Salvador, and possibly in modern-day Arizona and New Mexico. Archaeologists have uncovered rubber balls dating to at least 1600 BC, ballgamer figures from at least 1200 BC, and nearly 1,500 ancient ball courts.

Due to its religious and ritual aspects, Spanish Catholics suppressed the game soon after the Spanish conquest. It survived in areas such as Sinaloa, where Spanish influence was less pervasive.

As part of its nationwide revival, the game now has a home in the capital Mexico City, at a cultural centre in the Azcapotzalco neighborhood.

==Gameplay==
Ulama games are played on a temporary court called a &quot;tastei&quot; (, from &quot;tlachtli&quot; , the Nahuatl word meaning &quot;ballcourt&quot;). The bounds of these long narrow courts are made by drawing or chalking thick lines in the dirt. The courts are divided into opposing sides by a center line, called an &quot;analco&quot;. A ball that is allowed to cross the end line, the &quot;chichi&quot; or &quot;chivo&quot;, will result in a point scored for the opposing team. Points or &quot;rayas&quot; (&quot;lines&quot;, so named for the tally marks used to keep score) are gained in play. The scoring system provides for resetting the score to zero under certain conditions, which can make for lengthy games.

The modern-day game has three main forms:
* &quot;Ulama de cadera&quot; or hip ulama. A hip ulama team consists of five or more players (but there could be as many as twelve) wearing loincloths, with leather hip pads for some protection against the heavy (3–4 kg, around 7–9 lb) rubber ball. 
* &quot;Ulama de antebrazo&quot; or forearm ulama. Played on a smaller field, with teams of one to three players and a ball lighter than that of hip ulama, the games require the players to return the ball using their wrapped forearm. Women often play this game.
* &quot;Ulama de mazo&quot; or &quot;Ulamad de palo&quot;, in which a heavy (6–7 kg or 13–15 lb) two-handed wooden paddle strikes a 500g (1 lb) ball, usually in teams of three or four.

The object of the game is to keep the ball in play and in-bounds. Depending on the score and the local variant of the rules, the ball is played either high or low. A team scores a point when a player of the opposing team hits the ball out of turn, misses the ball, knocks the ball out of bounds, touches the ball with any part of the body aside from the hip, accidentally touches a teammate, lets the ball stop moving before it reaches the center line, or even if they fail to announce the score after they have scored a point.

The first team that scores eight points wins. If both teams end up having the same number of points after a turn, both sides begin again from zero. One record-setting game reportedly lasted for eight days. Most modern games are stopped after about two hours.

<text>Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata  (My heart swims in blood) 199 in Weimar between 1712 and 1713, and performed it on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity, 12 August 1714. It is a solo cantata for soprano.

The text was written by Georg Christian Lehms and published in Darmstadt in 1711 in the collection , on the general topic of redemption. The librettist wrote a series of alternating recitatives and arias, and included as the sixth movement (of eight) the third stanza of Johann Heermann&#x27;s hymn &quot;&quot;. It is not known when Bach composed the work, but he performed it as part of his monthly cantata productions on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity, 12 August 1714. The solo voice is accompanied by a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and continuo. The singer expresses in a style similar to Baroque opera the dramatic development from feeling like a &quot;monster in God&#x27;s eyes&quot; to being forgiven. Bach revised the work for later performances, leading to three editions in the &quot;Neue Bach-Ausgabe&quot;.
== History and words ==

On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court orchestra (&quot;Kapelle&quot;) of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the &quot;Schlosskirche&quot; (palace church), on a monthly schedule. He performed the cantata on the Eleventh Sunday after Trinity as the fifth cantata of the series, following . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, on the gospel of Christ and his (Paul&#x27;s) duty as an apostle (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector ().
The text, which concerns a sinner seeking and finding redemption, was written by Georg Christian Lehms. Lehms was based in Darmstadt, and it is not known whether Bach knew him personally, but he may well have had access to Lehms&#x27;s 1711 publication , which includes this text and that of another solo cantata, &quot;Widerstehe doch der Sünde&quot;, BWV 54, performed the month before. The third stanza of Johann Heermann&#x27;s hymn &quot;&quot; is integrated as the sixth movement, to the melody of &quot;Auf meinen lieben Gott&quot;. The text in the first person shows the dramatic change of a person initially feeling as &quot;a monster in God&#x27;s eyes&quot; to finally feeling accepted as God&#x27;s child. The cantata text was set to music in 1712 by Christoph Graupner in Darmstadt. It is not known if Bach knew of Graupner&#x27;s composition. The text has no specific relation to the prescribed readings, therefore it is possible that Bach may have already composed the work before his promotion to concert master with regular Sunday services, like the other cantata on a text by Lehms.

Bach first performed the cantata on 12 August 1714. When he performed it again in Leipzig on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity in 1723 (8 August) it was the first solo cantata and the most operatic work which he had presented to the congregation up to that point. He made revisions for that performance, such as transposing it from C minor to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello piccolo. In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after the sermon.

The &quot;Neue Bach-Ausgabe&quot; recognises three distinct versions: the Weimar version, a Köthen version, and the Leipzig version.

== Music ==
=== Structure and scoring ===

The cantata, structured in eight movements, is scored as chamber music for a solo soprano voice (S), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe (Ob), violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc) including bassoon (Fg) and violone (Vo). In the Weimar version, it is in C minor, with a viola as the obbligato instrument in movement 6. The title page of the parts for this version reads: &quot;Geistliche Cantate / Mein Herze schwimt im Blut / â / Soprano solo / 1 Hautb. / 2 Viol. / Viola / e / Basso / di / J.S.Bach&quot;. In the Leipzig version, it is in D minor, with an obbligato violoncello piccolo instead of the viola.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.




=== Movements ===

Although limited to one soprano voice, Bach achieves a variety of musical expression in the eight movements. All but one recitative are accompanied by the strings (accompagnato), and only movement 5 is secco, accompanied by the continuo only. The solo voice is treated to dramatic declamation, close to contemporary opera.

==== 1 ====
A recitative sets the scene, &quot;&quot; (&quot;My heart swims in blood&quot;).

&lt;poem&gt;Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut,
Weil mich der Sünden Brut
In Gottes heilgen Augen
Zum Ungeheuer macht.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
My heart swims in blood,
since the offspring of my sins
in the holy eyes of God
make me a monster.&lt;/poem&gt;
The musicologist Julian Mincham explains that it &quot;drips with the self-obsessed agonies of sin, pain and abandonment ... with the torment of an abandoned soul swamped by its own sin and sorrow. Its finely wrought contours portray dramatically the vacillating emotions ranging from horror and terror to lonely and dispirited resignation.&quot;

==== 2 ====
The first aria, a da capo aria, &quot;&quot; (Mute sighs, silent cries), is accompanied by the oboe. The theme of the ritornello is present throughout the movement. The middle section begins with a dissonance to stress the sorrowful image of &quot;&quot; (&quot;And you, moist springs of tears&quot;). It ends with a passage set as a secco recitative, described by Mincham: &quot;Time almost appears to stand still with this final expression of misery&quot;.

==== 3 ====
The following recitative, &quot;&quot; (&quot;But God must be gracious to me&quot;), ends in a statement of repentance.

==== 4 ====
The second aria, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Deeply bowed and filled with regret&quot;), is dominated by rich string sound. An adagio passage leads to the da capo. The aria expresses repentance in a &quot;civilised and refined minuet&quot;.

==== 5 ====
A short secco recitative, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Upon this painful repentance&quot;), introduces the following hymn stanza. It begins with &quot;a musical echo of the torments of the heart swimming in blood&quot;.

==== 6 ====

The only chorale stanza of the work is &quot;&quot; (&quot;I, Your troubled child&quot;), the third stanza of Johann Heermann&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Where should I flee&quot;), published in 1630. Its term &quot;troubled child&quot; is a good summary of the position of the human being in relation to God. The wording of its conclusion, &quot;In deine tiefen Wunden, da ich stets Heil gefunden&quot; (&quot;into Your deep wounds, where I have always found salvation&quot;) leads to the following recitative. The voice is accompanied by an obbligato viola (violoncello piccolo in the Leipzig version) in a lively figuration.

Bach used a rather unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob Regnart. The hymn is treated as in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between the verses.

==== 7 ====

The last recitative, &quot;&quot; (&quot;I lay myself on these wounds&quot;), introduces a different mood; the final measures are a &quot;soaring melisma&quot;, a &quot;joyously uplifting prelude&quot; to the last movement.

==== 8 ====
The final aria, &quot;&quot; (&quot;How joyful is my heart&quot;), expresses joy as a cheerful gigue, with a long coloratura on &quot;&quot; (joyful). It is comparable to the gigues in Bach&#x27;s French Suites. Mincham concludes: 

== Recordings ==

The work has been recorded often, both by Bach specialists and others. The listing is taken from the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website, which lists 58 recordings . Ensembles playing on period instruments in historically informed performance are marked by green background.

<text>Colleen Patricia Jones (born December 16, 1959) is a Canadian curler and television personality. She is best known as the skip of two women&#x27;s world championship teams and six Tournament of Hearts Canadian women&#x27;s championships, including an unprecedented four titles in a row and held the record for most Tournament of Hearts wins from when she won her 67th game in 1994 until her eventual 152 wins were eclipsed by Jennifer Jones in 2021.

Jones also serves as a reporter and weather presenter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and as a curling commentator for NBC in the United States, particularly during the 2010 Winter Olympics.

In 2018, Jones finished second to Sidney Crosby in a listing of the greatest 15 athletes in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history. In 2019, she was named the third greatest Canadian curler in history in a TSN poll of broadcasters, reporters and top curlers. In 2016, Jones was awarded the Order of Sport, marking her induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

She currently coaches the Owen Purcell rink.

==Early career==
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from a family of curlers, at age 14, she joined the Mayflower Curling Club. She found success in competitive curling from an early age, playing skip for the St. Patrick&#x27;s High School curling team. She was only 19 years old when she won the first of her 16 Nova Scotia curling titles. That led to competing in the Canadian championships, where she finished second.

In 1982 she became the youngest skip, at age 22, ever to win the Canadian women&#x27;s curling championship but career, marriage and a family slowed down her competitive curling. She joined CBC Television as a reporter in 1986 and went on to cover numerous summer and winter Olympic Games.

==Broadcasting career==
Jones began her broadcasting career in radio sports at CHUM radio in 1982. She made the switch to television broadcasting in 1984 at CTV, and joined the CBC in 1986. Beginning in 1993, Jones has been the weather presenter and sports reporter for &quot;CBC Morning News&quot; on CBC Newsworld (now CBC News Network). At the 2006 Torino Olympics, she did CBC segments about curling. Jones provided curling commentary for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She served as the sideline reporter for the curling events at the 2014, 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics.

Jones starred in a public service announcement about the Canada 2006 Census. Jones appeared in the January 15, 2008 episode of &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; for a skit titled MVC &quot;Most Valuable Curler&quot;. She also co-hosts the online series &quot;That Curling Show&quot; with CBC journalist Devin Heroux.

On 6 April 2023, it was announced that she would be retiring from CBC after almost 40 years with the broadcaster.

==Curling career==

===1999–2006===
In 1999, with her new team of Kim Kelly, Mary Anne Waye (later Arsenault) and Nancy Delahunt, Jones won the Canadian curling title for the second time. The team repeated this in 2001 and they went on to win the World Curling Championship in Lausanne, Switzerland. They followed this up with another Canadian championship in 2002 and then won it for a record-setting fifth time at the 2004 Scott Tournament of Hearts. This made Jones the first skip to win four straight Canadian titles. From there the team went on to win their second World Curling Championship.

Their return at the 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts was not as stellar. The team finished the round-robin at 6–5 and lost in a tie-breaker to Sandy Comeau of New Brunswick. When this happened, the team got a standing ovation, which even halted play in the other game that was occurring two sheets over. The following year, the team was back in form, but bowed out in the semi-finals to Jennifer Jones. At the end of the 2006 season, the team broke up. Jones joined the team of fellow Haligonian Kay Zinck, as her third. The rest of the team got a new skip in Laine Peters.

===2006–2008===
After a short run playing third for Kay Zinck during the 2006/2007 season, Jones went back to skipping. For the 2007/2008 season she would add Olympic bronze medallist Georgina Wheatcroft to her team along with Kate Hamer and Darah Provencal. At the end of the season Jones would retire from competitive curling.

===2010–2011===
Colleen Jones announced on March 24, 2010, on CBC News that she would be again returning to competitive curling. Having been present for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, a spark ignited in her, and she once again wanted to make another run for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.

For the 2010/2011 season, Jones was recruited by Heather Smith-Dacey, Blisse Comstock and Teri Lake, to take over skipping duties, when former skip Jill Mouzar moved to Ontario. Just as Jones was due to begin her competitive curling comeback, days before beginning the playdowns for the Nova Scotia Scotties Tournament of Hearts, It was announced on December 10, 2010, that Jones was diagnosed with meningitis. Jones turned over skipping duties to Heather Smith-Dacey, and brought in Danielle Parsons to play at third. Smith-Dacey&#x27;s team won the Nova Scotia title, and then went on to win the bronze medal at the 2011 Scotties. Jones was able to return to competition after recovering from her illness, and won the 2011 Nova Scotia Senior Women&#x27;s Championship on February 27.

===2011–present===
For the 2011–2012, Jones recruited a new squad, originally consisting of Kristen MacDiarmid, Helen Radford and Mary Sue Radford, all of whom previous played with Theresa Breen. Later in the season, she modified her team adding former teammate Nancy Delahunt to third, and Marsha Sobey to second. Mary Sue Radford remained at lead. Delahunt and Sobey were members of Jones&#x27; Senior women&#x27;s champion team. After failing to qualify for the provincial 2012 Nova Scotia Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Jones and her senior team of Delahunt, Sobey and Sally Saunders, participated in the 2012 Nova Scotia Women&#x27;s Senior Championships. They made it to the final, where they defeated Colleen Pinkney, 6–4, to win back-to-back seniors championships, qualifying for the National senior finals. With Delahunt skipping, and Jones throwing last stones, the team represented Nova Scotia at the 2012 Canadian Senior Curling Championships, where they lost in the semi-final to Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s Cathy Cunningham.

For the 2012–2013 season Jones reunited with Mary-Anne Arsenault and Kim Kelly, with the goal of reaching the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Jones threw second stones on the team, while acting as the rink&#x27;s vice skip, or &quot;mate&quot; while Arsenault skips.

The Arsenault-skipped team won the 2013 Nova Scotia Scotties Tournament of Hearts, and qualified for the 2013 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Kingston, Ontario. They finished the event with a 5–6 record.

Jones has appeared in 4 Canadian Senior Curling Championships (2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016). She finished with a bronze medal at the 2012 Championships, and a silver medal at the 2015 Championships. She won her first Canadian Seniors in 2016 and represented Canada at the 2017 World Senior Curling Championships in Lethbridge, Alberta where her rink went through the event undefeated to win the world title.

<doc id="436663" wikidata="Q911049" url="?curid=436663" title="Bretton Woods, New Hampshire">
<text>Bretton Woods is an area within the town of Carroll, New Hampshire, United States, whose principal points of interest are three leisure and recreation facilities. Being virtually surrounded by the White Mountain National Forest, the vista from Bretton Woods toward Mount Washington and the Presidential Range includes no significant artificial structures other than the Mount Washington Cog Railway and the Mount Washington Hotel.

Bretton Woods was the site of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944 which has given its name to the Bretton Woods system and led to the establishment of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in 1945. The Bretton Woods system ended in 1971.

Bretton Woods is located along U.S. Route 302, east of the village of Twin Mountain and through scenic Crawford Notch northwest of the town of Bartlett.

In 1772, King George III granted Sir Thomas Wentworth of Bretton Hall, a country house in West Bretton, West Yorkshire, and 82 others, a parcel of of land to be laid out as a plantation in the White Mountains. The plantation became the town of Carroll, and the southeast corner of the land retained the name &quot;Bretton Woods&quot;, after the estate.

==Points of interest==

The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort is one in the last surviving handful of New Hampshire grand hotels, and includes two golf courses, alpine and Nordic skiing, a spa, sled rides, dog sled rides, tennis, horseback riding and much more in its facilities.

The Bretton Woods Mountain Resort ski area serves both downhill and cross-country skiing, primarily in the Rosebrook Mountains, located in Bethlehem to the south. The downhill resort is the largest in New Hampshire, with 101 trails. In the early twentieth century heyday of northern U.S. resorts for the elite, rail passengers would travel from Boston on the Boston and Maine&#x27;s &quot;Mountaineer.&quot; From New York City, passengers took the &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot;, &quot;Day White Mountains&quot;, &quot;Night White Mountains&quot;, or &quot;Overnighter.&quot;

The tracks of the Cog Railway and its associated buildings lie up the slope of Mount Washington, in nearby Thompson and Meserve&#x27;s Purchase. The &quot;Base Road&quot; from Bretton Woods and Fabyan&#x27;s is the preferred route to the lower end of the tracks (the Base Station of the Cog), except in those winters when the Mount Clinton Road is instead the only plowed road to their intersection. (The closing of the lower end of the Base Road had been traditional into 2004.) The Cog was operated during the winter seasons of 2004 to 2006 to take wilderness skiers partway up the mountain.

<doc id="436667" wikidata="Q3459117" url="?curid=436667" title="Grand River Transit">
<text>Grand River Transit (GRT) is the public transport operator for the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It operates daily bus services in the region, primarily in the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge, alongside the ION rapid transit light rail system which began service on June 21, 2019.

It was named for the Grand River, which flows through the Region; the naming also echoes the Grand River Railway, a former electric railway which served the area in the early twentieth century. GRT is a member of the Canadian Urban Transit Association.

==Overview==
On January 1, 2000, the Region of Waterloo created GRT by assuming the operations of the former Kitchener Transit (which also served Waterloo) and Cambridge Transit. By the end of that year, operations had been fully synchronized and buses began running between Cambridge and Kitchener; as a result, ridership in Cambridge improved dramatically, and there have been increases in service, including Sundays and late evenings Monday-Saturday.

Grand River Transit has consistently purchased low floor, wheelchair-accessible buses, principally from Nova Bus, Orion, and New Flyer, and these now form the entirety of the standard fleet. Most operating buses are less than twenty years old, though a few older buses are used primarily for high-school special runs. GRT has installed bicycle racks on the front of its buses in order to encourage the use of sustainable transport; all buses now have these racks. Bicycles are also allowed on-board Ion trains.

Service to less dense areas is provided by the busPLUS system, large vans which take regular fares on scheduled routes to new neighbourhoods and more remote facilities; if ridership is sufficiently high, these services can later be replaced with regular buses, as happened with the 71 Melran route in Cambridge.

GRT also operates Mobility&quot;PLUS&quot;, which provides specialized transit for disabled patrons using minibuses equipped with wheelchair lifts.

The GRT fleet consists entirely of motor buses. Kitchener Transit operated trolleybuses earlier in its history, but they were withdrawn from service during the 1970s, well before the systems were merged. GRT continued operating 23 compressed natural gas-driven buses inherited from Kitchener Transit but did not expand this fleet; these buses were retired before the end of 2009. Until the 1950s, the area was served by electric passenger and freight trains run by the Grand River Railway, which even earlier in the 20th century had run streetcars on city streets before the separated railway lines were built.

Since September 1, 2007, all undergraduate students at the University of Waterloo have purchased a non-refundable four-month U-Pass as part of their tuition fees for less than a quarter of the equivalent adult monthly pass.

Grand River Transit has six diesel-hybrid buses which began service in late August 2008. To get the best use of their powertrain, these buses run on routes like Route 7 King, which have frequent stops and heavy usage.

With the launch of Ion rapid transit in June 2019, GRT&#x27;s bus services were substantially reorganized. The greatest effect was in decentralizing the network in Kitchener–Waterloo by no longer using the Charles Street terminal as a service hub; the affected routes now connect with Ion trains at their stations, forming a centralized spine.

==History==
Public transit in the Grand River area began with private operators and slowly gave way to municipal run service. Interurban and streetcar service were the earlier modes and by the mid-20th century, bus transit became the norm.

===New Hamburg===

On April 25, 2016, Grand River Transit began operating route 77 which connects The Boardwalk and the Wilmot Township (Petersburg, Baden and New Hamburg) during the AM and PM peak periods. This route is a BusPlus route and because of the length of the route, route 77 operates every 75 minutes. GRT is using Voyago (formerly Voyageur Transportation Services) to operate the new route.

The Grand River area also had interurban railway service from 1894 to 1955 by various operators.

=== Breslau ===
As of June 11, 2022, Grand River Transit operates BusPlus service for Breslau, which provides locations in Breslau, including Region of Waterloo International Airport. Connections with route 34 and 204 are also available for those needing a trip to Kitchener, Waterloo or Cambridge.

==Ion rapid transit ==
=== History ===
In June 2011, Waterloo Region council approved a plan for a light rail transit line, powered by electricity, between Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo and Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener. At first, rapid buses would run from the south end of Kitchener to the &quot;downtown Galt&quot; area of Cambridge but eventually, the LRT would be expanded to that city. (At least one journalist pointed out the similarity between this plan and the electric Grand River Railway system of the early 1900s.) In Stage 1, the Ion rapid transit train runs between Fairview Park Mall and Conestoga Mall by way of the central districts of Kitchener and Waterloo.

Construction on the light rail system, now named &quot;Ion&quot;, began in August 2014 and the Stage 1 service was expected to begin in 2017. Most of the rails had been installed by the end of 2016; the maintenance facility and all underground utility work had been completed. The start date of service was postponed to early 2018, and then to December 2018, however, because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of the vehicles by Bombardier Transportation. Bombardier was to deliver all 14 vehicles by December 14; that was postponed to December 2017 and then to June 2018. In April 2018, the planned start of Ion service was postponed to December, and was finally accomplished on June 21, 2019.

In late February 2017, plans for the Stage 2 (Cambridge section) of the Ion rail service were still in the very early stage but a proposed route with map had been published. The public consultation process for Cambridge was postponed to 2018.

In early July 2017, Cambridge City Council expressed an objection to parts of the route planned for that city and requested the Region to consider alternatives. At that time, a report indicated that construction of Stage 2 would not begin until 2025. Until LRT service arrives in Cambridge, GRT will offer rapid transit with adapted iXpress buses to Fairview Park Mall using bus-only lanes at Pinebush, Munch and Coronation to minimize slowdowns at times of heavy traffic. In 2017, the route also continued to Conestoga Mall in Waterloo (though not as rapid transit) with many stops along the way. Following Ion launch in Kitchener–Waterloo, GRT is continuing the remainder of the iXpress 200 service to the terminal at Fairview Park, renumbered as 302.

==iXpress==

The iXpress express bus service is operated by GRT consisting of six routes along main corridors in Kitchener–Waterloo and Cambridge, serving major roads in all 3 cities.

In order to increase ridership across the region and facilitate the expected growing population, the Region of Waterloo unveiled the Regional Transportation Master Plan in 2010, which consisted of seven iXpress-style routes that criss-cross the important secondary corridors along the region (with the proposed light rail serving the Central Transit Corridor), and where they are expecting the most growth to occur. These corridors include Fischer-Hallman, University, Highland/Victoria North, Ottawa, Homer Watson/Maple Grove, Coronation, and the Cambridge stubs centered around Cambridge Centre and Ainslie Street Terminal. The routes were to be phased in, with the last route being introduced in 2015. The plan was eventually scaled down in order to put more emphasis on the LRT proposal with the Cambridge stubs largely eliminated, and the timeline was also spread out, with all routes expected to be implemented by 2018.

There were different naming proposals for the new iXpress routes. During the public consultations in March 2011, the proposal was to name each iXpress route after a colour, with the letter X at the back. For example, Fischer-Hallman iXpress would be named Blue X, and the shelter would have blue stickers in order to identify each route. However, the plan was eventually dropped, and GRT decided to stick with the iXpress trademark, with route numbers being added to signify between the different iXpress routes.

Fischer-Hallman was chosen as the first corridor to have the new iXpress service, as the current route 12 serving this corridor is full during most times of the day, and residents wanted a faster service to Forest Glen, Highland Hills Mall, and the university area. During the public consultations, there were different routing proposals at the north end. Proposals ranged from having the route go all the way east on Columbia to King, south on King, west on University, and north on Phillip, to having the route go only as east as Phillip, then head south on Phillip, west on University, north on Seagram, and east on Ring Road to serve the current UW Davis Centre bus stop. Eventually, the suggested proposal was to have the route go east on Columbia, south on Phillip, east on University, and north on Hazel. This allows equal access to the north end of the University of Waterloo campus, the RIM offices along Columbia, and Wilfrid Laurier University.

The first (and now defunct) route, designated route 200 after the expansion of iXpress service, was launched in September 2005 and ran from Conestoga Mall in Waterloo and Ainslie St. Transit Terminal in Cambridge primarily along King Street in Kitchener and Waterloo and Hespeler Road in Cambridge, utilizing a short section of Highway 401. The second route, route 201, runs from Conestoga College Doon Campus Door 6 in Kitchener to Conestoga Mall in Waterloo, primarily along Fischer-Hallman Road in both cities. The third, route 202, runs in a crosstown fashion through Waterloo, primarily along University Avenue, between the Boardwalk shopping centre and Conestoga Mall. The fourth iXpress route, route 203, opened on April 28, 2014. It runs from Cambridge Centre to Sportsworld Terminal. An extension of the 203 to Conestoga College is made during the AM and PM peak periods when classes are in session. The fifth iXpress route, route 204, began service in September 2015. The 204 iXpress runs from Ottawa and Lackner to the Boardwalk via Victoria Street, Highland Road, Ira Needles Boulevard and Downtown Kitchener. The 205 Ottawa iXpress opened on April 30, 2018, which primarily served northern Ottawa Street. and the 206 Coronation iXpress launched September 2, 2019, partially replacing route 52. The 200 was discontinued upon the launch of Ion service; the bus portion not converted to light rail now runs on route 302, branded as Ion Bus.

In April 2017, it was announced that the Ion and iXpress services would be closely integrated into a single system. In March 2018, nine new Ion buses were unveiled; initially they were used on local routes in Cambridge. They now operate from Fairway Station in Kitchener to the Ainslie Street terminal in Cambridge. These vehicles offer new features, such as more comfortable, high-back seats, free Wi-Fi and USB charging ports.

== Fares ==

Buses and Ion fare machines accept cash and the EasyGo smart card; unlimited transfers are available for 120 minutes of travel following payment of a single-use fare. Monthly passes or a stored fare balance are loaded on the EasyGo card; this can be done online, at customer service desks, or at ticket machines. Specialized passes for corporate or school purposes are loaded on specialized smart cards.

The new EasyGO system on electronic fare cards was first made available on March 1, 2019, in anticipation of the Ion light rail launch. At Ion launch, this fully replaced an old system of paper passes (and accompanying photo ID) and paper tickets.

=== Connect-to-GO ===
Beginning March 31, 2023, riders can enrol in Connect-to-GO, which gives riders a rebate to their GRT fare when travelling to or from Kitchener station, using an EasyGo fare card.

==System routes==
Routes are listed effective September 2, 2024. The following is a general summary of route services; for details, consult the official website. Routes numbered below 100 are local services, numbers in the 100s are express services (the only remaining of which is 110) in the 200s are iXpress service with the iXpress brand, and in the 300s are fully integrated rapid transit. Routes marked + use smaller BusPLUS vehicles. All routes, excluding 79 make connections to major transit hubs.
Frequency on routes will vary. Routes like the 7, 201, &amp; 301 provide more frequent service all day, while routes like the 34 have service levels limited to peak hours.

==Vehicle fleet==

At launch, Grand River Transit&#x27;s fleet was originally made of busses from Kitchener Transit and Cambridge Transit&#x27;s fleet, with the later new Nova Bus LFS addition to the fleet. Most of these busses retired in or before 2010.

Today, GRT provides over 250 busses, 35 MobilityPlus vehicles, and 15 LRVS for the Region of Waterloo. GRT&#x27;s fleet is a mix of 4th gen Nova Bus LFS series, New Flyer Industries (NFI) XD-40 busses, and brand new Vicinity Classic.

ION Light rail uses 15 Bombardier Flexity Freedom light rail vehicles, all of which are stored at the Dutton LRT Maintenance Storage Facility. ION Bus is provided with 9 designated buses, though sometimes ION Bus is provided with the traditional local buses and vice versa. 

In 2022, Grand River Transit said that they would replace their old diesel fleet with newer electric and hybrid buses such as the electric and hybrid counterparts of the LFS series. As of May 9th, 2024, Grand River Transit operates 

==Facilities==
One major transit terminal is operated and staffed, the Ainslie St. Transit Terminal at Galt City Centre in Cambridge. In downtown Kitchener, customer service functions come from an office at 105 King Street East, near Frederick station. No GRT services remain at the Charles Street Transit Terminal. 

All ION stations have customer help points and ticket machines; most are major transfer points, with Waterloo’s Conestoga Mall, Kitchener’s Fairview Park Mall, and the University of Waterloo station also having off-street bus terminals. Unstaffed off-road satellite terminals are also in place at The Boardwalk Station, Stanley Park Mall, Sportsworld, Sunrise Centre, and Cambridge Centre. An additional terminal at the Conestoga College Doon Campus is planned.
Other significant transfer points include King Street/University Avenue, Holiday Inn Drive/Hespeler, Conestoga College-Doon Campus, and the Preston Towne Centre.

Grand River Transit has 4 garages:

<doc id="436668" wikidata="Q506763" url="?curid=436668" title="Blanching (cooking)">
<text>Blanching is a cooking process in which a food, usually a vegetable or fruit, is scalded in boiling water, removed after a brief timed interval, and finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water (known as shocking or refreshing) to halt the cooking process. Blanching foods helps reduce quality loss over time. Blanching is often used as a treatment prior to freezing, dehydrating, or canning vegetables or fruits to deactivate enzymes, modify texture, remove the peel and wilt tissue. The inactivation of enzymes preserves colour, flavour, and nutritional value. The process has three stages: preheating, blanching, and cooling. The most common blanching methods for vegetables/fruits are hot water and steam, while cooling is either done using cold water or cool air. Other benefits of blanching include removing pesticide residues and decreasing microbial load. Drawbacks to the blanching process can include leaching of water-soluble and heat-sensitive nutrients and the production of effluent.

== Application ==
Blanching is a process used in the home kitchen as well as used as a pre-treatment in the food industry. In both cases, its main purpose is to deactivate enzymes that cause browning as well as textural changes and off-flavors. Enzymes that cause deterioration in fruits and vegetables include lipoxygenase, polyphenoloxidase, polygalacturonase, and chlorophyllase. Catalase and peroxidase are commonly used to determine blanching success, since they are the most thermal-resistant enzymes of concern. These enzymes are responsible for the loss of flavor, color, texture, and nutritional qualities during product storage.

The blanching process expels air trapped inside plant tissues, which is a vital step before canning. Blanching prevents the expansion of air during processing, which reduces strain on the containers and the risk of cans having faulty seams. Moreover, removing gas from foods like pears results in better texture and reduces oxidation of the product. Also, the intercellular gases removed results in better color retention.
Fruit, vegetable, and nut peeling is also important in food processing. When almonds or pistachios are blanched, the skin of the nut (botanically the seed coat surrounding the embryo) softens and can be easily removed later. Steam peeling produces less environmental pollution and peeling losses, as compared to chemical or manual peeling processes.

Other uses of blanching are enhancing drying rate and product quality, decreasing microbial load, removing pesticide and toxic residues, increasing extraction of bioactive compounds, surface cleaning, removing damaged seeds or foreign materials, killing parasites and their eggs, and reducing oil uptake.

== Technology ==
Traditionally, blanching is done using either a water bath or saturated steam. In both methods, the food is heated for a short period of time and then introduced into either cold water or cold air to quickly stop the heating process. At the industrial level, foods move on a continuous conveyor belt through preheating, holding, and cooling.

For hot water blanching, vegetables are immersed under pre-warmed water (70 to 100 °C) for varying amounts of time, depending on type and quantity. When the product is heated by water, greater uniformity of heating is achieved, especially when compared to hot air. This advantage allows hot water blanching at lower temperatures, but requires longer blanching times. Water is heated and cooled using heat exchangers and recirculated for continuous use, reducing costs.

Steam blanching systems inject hot air (~100 °C) onto food as it passes through the blanching system on a conveyor belt. This method greatly reduces the leaching of water-soluble compounds from the product and is the preferred technique for smaller foods and those with cut surfaces. Steam blanching is more energy-efficient, and the ability for quick heating allows for shorter processing times. This reduced heat exposure preserves color, flavor, and overall quality of the food; however, evaporation may occur leading to lower masses and product yields.

Directly following the heat treatment, vegetables/fruits are quickly chilled by cold water. A common alternative to cooling with cold water is cooling with cold air. This method of cooling prevents the leaching of water-soluble nutrients; however, the air causes evaporation and lowers the mass of the vegetable—a monetary disadvantage for industry.

Emerging technologies include ohmic, infrared, microwave, and radio frequency blanching.

== Time and temperature ==
It is important to consider the recommended times and temperatures for a food product when blanching. Times and temperatures are based on the type of food, size, shape, and other factors. Over-blanching can lead to an excessive loss of nutrients and aromatic compounds, as well as softening of the food. Blanching at temperatures or times lower than those recommended may not effectively inactivate all enzymes. In addition, this may also cause the release of more enzymes from the plant tissue, causing greater overall enzymatic activity and faster spoiling of the product.

== Disadvantages ==
Although blanching is a thermal process, the times and temperatures are not sufficient to effectively destroy all microorganisms. Blanching is often seen as a pre-process to later preservation steps. For example, blanching in the home is often done in combination with freezing; blanching in industry is also used before canning, dehydration, or heat sterilization.

A limitation to hot water blanching is the leaching of water-soluble nutrients and the degradation of thermal sensitive compounds. Vitamins, minerals, and other water-soluble compounds, such as proteins, sugars, and flavor compounds, diffuse out of the food and into the water, lowering the overall quality of the food. The degree to which compounds diffuse out of food depends on the food&#x27;s composition and characteristics, the water to food ratio, the blanching temperature, and other variables. Ascorbic acid, thiamin, and many aromatic compounds are heat-sensitive.

A complication in the food industry is the production of effluent from water blanching systems. Blanching with reused water can lead to a buildup of water-soluble compounds that are considered pollutants, and therefore must be properly treated before being discharged. This can increase capital costs at the industrial level and has been a main reason for the development of newer blanching technologies.

<text>Edward Plunket Taylor, CMG (January 29, 1901 – May 14, 1989) was a Canadian business tycoon, investor and philanthropist. He was a famous breeder of Thoroughbred race horses, and a major force behind the evolution of the Canadian horse-racing industry. Known to his friends as &quot;Eddie&quot;, he is all but universally recorded as &quot;E. P. Taylor&quot;.

==Early years==
Taylor was the first child of Plunket Bourchier Taylor and Florence Magee Taylor. Taylor attended Ashbury College and Ottawa Collegiate. During World War I, his father enlisted and the family moved to London, England. After Taylor attempted several times to join the British Army, his father sent him back to Ottawa to live with his grandfather Charles Magee, a wealthy Ottawa businessman. The time spent with Magee had a profound influence on Taylor, who decided he wanted to be successful in business like Magee. In 1918, Taylor moved to Montreal to attend McGill University, having to work part-time to pay his way. That fall, Taylor&#x27;s studies were interrupted when McGill closed during the Spanish Flu epidemic. Returning the next winter, Taylor graduated in 1922 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering.

While studying at McGill, Taylor patented an electric toaster design that browned both sides of the bread simultaneously. At that time, toasters only toasted one side of the bread. Taylor sold the patent for a royalty of 40 cents on every toaster to the Thomas Davidson Manufacturing Co. of Montreal. Taylor decided during college that he did not want to pursue engineering, finding that he was more interested in business and economics. After graduation, Taylor returned to Ottawa, where he and Lawrie Hart operated a two-vehicle bus line between Westboro and Ottawa. Taylor and Hart sold the bus line after a year, and Taylor joined the investment brokerage firm of McLeod Young Weir (now ScotiaMcLeod) that his father worked for.

In 1926, Taylor met Winifred Duguid while at a social event at the Chaudiere Golf Club. They were married on June 15, 1927, at Christ Church Cathedral in Ottawa, honeymooned in Lake Placid, and settled into their first residence at the Strathcona Apartments on Laurier Avenue in Ottawa.

==Business==
Taylor&#x27;s grandfather Charles Magee was a successful businessman in Ottawa, holding interests in brewing, dry goods, and transportation. Magee died in 1918, leaving the family businesses to his brother and his daughters Carrie and Taylor&#x27;s mother. In 1923, Taylor was made a director of the Brading Brewery, one of the family businesses, which his father was president of. On the side of selling securities and the brewing business, Taylor organized the Red Line Taxi Company in 1923. Like the bus line, it was sold after a year. This established the pattern in business that Taylor would follow, conceiving and developing ideas, and then persuading others to buy them. Taylor remained with McLeod, Young, Weir and became a partner in 1928. In 1928, Taylor and Winifred moved to Toronto, getting an apartment on University Avenue, conveniently close to the McLeod, Young, Weir offices in the Metropolitan Building.

In the 1920s, Brading Brewery was limited by temperance laws. While it operated in Ontario, it could only sell into Quebec. This changed in 1927, when the Conservative government in Ontario ended prohibition. At the suggestion of Taylor, the company &quot;traded on its equity&quot; and rebuilt its plant, modernizing it and increasing capacity by 50%. Taylor studied the brewing business in Ontario. In 1928, there were 37 breweries. They operated at below capacity and many were in need of modernization. They were not profitable in general and had only in sales on assets of . Quebec was dominated by three breweries; one of them, National Breweries, had consolidated 14 breweries that had operated before World War I. Taylor proposed a similar strategy to Brading&#x27;s board of directors: acquire and merge with successful breweries in Ontario, and acquire and close other breweries to bring under its control some 70% of the volume of beer sold in Ontario.

The stock market crash of 1929 affected Taylor in two ways. On the one hand, the underwriting business virtually ceased. However, it left Taylor free to pursue the brewery acquisition plan, although now Taylor could only offer Brading Brewery shares in its acquisitions. Taylor fortuitously met Clark Jennison, who was acting for British interests interested in investing in Canadian breweries at the same time and had to invest. The two incorporated a new firm, Brewing Corporation of Ontario, merging the Brading and Kuntz breweries and the British interests in common and preferred shares. Another company, Canadian Brewery Corporation Limited, had also begun acquiring breweries in Ontario. Taylor approached the company and successfully negotiated a merger in 1930. Later in 1930, Taylor successfully took over the Carling Brewery, which had become majority-owned by the Dominion Bank, for repayable at $100,000 per year. In all, Taylor merged more than 20 other small breweries into Canadian Breweries Limited, which grew to be the world&#x27;s largest brewing company. Taylor would eventually gain operating control of the holding company.

Taylor described his consolidation approach as &quot;trading pieces of paper for other pieces of paper.&quot; At times, he was so cash poor that a legend had him passing cheques back and forth between two bank accounts in Montreal and Toronto to meet payroll. He later recalled it as &quot;a period of hectic finance.&quot; His liquidity situation eased after prohibition ended. After 1934, Taylor implemented a number of changes to make the brewing sales and marketing respectable, firing the old school &quot;runners&quot; who profited by selling to bootleggers, and replacing them with salesmen who were encouraged to become community leaders. He also consolidated the number of brands offered from over 100 to just six.

Taylor became involved in the soft drink industry through the acquisition of brewers, who had diversified into soft drinks during prohibition. Unable to spin off the soft drinks at first, Taylor first worked on building them into a business suitable for sale. Taylor purchased control of the Canadian Orange Crush company and then taking control of its subsidiary Honey Dew. Honey Dew had multiple retail locations, which Taylor restyled and relocated to increase their profitability. This formed the core of his &quot;food empire&quot;, that included over 100 stores by 1950 (not including his subsequent interest in Dominion grocery stores). Taylor spun off Honey Dew as a separate company, which later became Canadian Food Products.

During World War II, Taylor was a volunteer executive in the Government of Canada&#x27;s war effort. He was appointed by C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply, to the executive committee of the Department of Munitions and Supply and would be appointed by Winston Churchill to run the British Supply Council in North America. He came close to losing his life when, in December 1940, the ship he was on was torpedoed while crossing the Atlantic. At that time, regulations were such that convoys did not stop to rescue survivors of a sinking ship. Taylor and others, including Howe and Bill Woodward, were rescued by a merchant vessel that had lost its convoy. A destroyer appeared and gave permission to save them, circling the rescue to ward off any submarines.

In 1941, Taylor clashed with Mackenzie King, who had called for a wartime curtailment of beer drinking and advertising. Taylor sent a letter to the Ottawa Journal calling this position &quot;un-British and therefore undemocratic&quot;.

Through his war-time service, Taylor became connected to top businessmen from across Canada and around the world. For his wartime service, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1946. At war&#x27;s end, he founded Argus Corporation, becoming the investment company&#x27;s majority shareholder by rolling Canadian Breweries stock into the new entity. Over the years, he gained control or had significant positions in many of his country&#x27;s largest companies such as Canadian Food Products, Massey-Harris, Standard Chemical, Dominion Stores, British Columbia Forest Products Limited, Dominion Tar &amp; Chemical Co., Standard Broadcasting, and Hollinger Mines. During the highest point of his career, he was one of Canada&#x27;s richest people.

In 1950, Taylor said of his position in Canadian industry, &quot;I simply own the largest piece of the largest piece.&quot; According to &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, he owned 5/17 of Argus Corp.&#x27;s common stock at the time, giving him effective control of the company. In turn, Argus owned 3/10 of Standard Chemical (Javex, Goderich Salt, etc.). Standard Chemical owned 9/20 of Dominion Tar and Chemical (Sifto Salt, Ace-Tex, Fiberglas, etc.). Through the series of ownership shares, Taylor effectively controlled Dominion Tar even though his personal interest in the voting stock amounted to only about 4%.

Taylor traveled extensively to manage his sprawling business interests, flying each month to the Cleveland headquarters of his Brewing Corporation of America. From there, he headed to New York, where he spent much of his time associating with Floyd Odlum of Atlas Corporation, an investment company that served as the prototype for Argus. He would then travel to Montreal and back to Toronto again. His executives were expected to make their reports rapidly, with meetings scheduled at 15-minute intervals. He valued energy, judgement and the ability to get along with others, once saying that a genius is more trouble than he&#x27;s worth.

In 1948, Taylor and a small group of fellow alumni established the &quot;McGill University Alma Mater Fund&quot;, inviting all graduates to give annual donations and thereby &quot;make of themselves a living endowment.&quot;

Taylor also pioneered the concept of gated communities in exotic places. In 1957, the Bahamian government passed the &quot;Lyford Cay Development Company, Limited, Agreement and Road Diversion Act 1957&quot; providing for the development of land in western New Providence, by the company and Taylor, and the diversion of West Bay Street to accommodate it. Taylor founded the highly exclusive Lyford Cay gated community in 1959 and its &#x27;Lyford Cay Club&#x27; on New Providence island in the Bahamas. The Lyford Cay Club is home to some of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people.

In 1975, the Argus Corporation became the target of a takeover by Power Corporation. Taylor sold his non-voting shares to Power Corp and held his voting shares for one year to allow his Argus partners to purchase them. The partners did not take them up. In 1976, Taylor retired from Argus Corporation, selling his 10% share of the voting shares to Power Corporation.

==Thoroughbred racing==
While a student at Montreal&#x27;s McGill University in 1918, Taylor was introduced to the sport of thoroughbred horse racing at Blue Bonnets Raceway. As a businessman in the 1930s he established Cosgrave Stable to race horses, which notably owned and raced the future (2000) Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame filly Mona Bell, winner of the 1938 Breeders&#x27; Stakes and Maple Leaf Stakes.

After the second World War, Taylor became steadily more involved in horse racing as an owner, breeder and an organizer. In the latter role, he transformed the Ontario racing scene in the 1950s much the way he had earlier transformed the brewing industry. &quot;Our sport wasn&#x27;t keeping up with the progress made in other areas,&quot; he once said. &quot;We had too many tracks... our patronage was falling, we had low purses and many bad horses, and I was afraid that racing might die here as it did in Quebec.&quot; Instead of operating fourteen racetracks each with 14-day race meetings, he concentrated the industry in Toronto and Fort Erie. In 1956, he opened &quot;new&quot; Woodbine racetrack on the outskirts of Toronto while renovating &quot;old&quot; Woodbine (subsequently renamed Greenwood racetrack). New Woodbine developed into a world-class venue, especially when Taylor convinced Penny Chenery to have Secretariat make his final start in the Canadian International in 1973. Taylor was the founder of the Jockey Club of Canada and served as the president of the Thoroughbred Racing Association in the United States.

Taylor and his wife began breeding thoroughbreds in the 1950s. He first purchased a property in Toronto that he named Windfields Farm. He then acquired Parkwood Stable in Oshawa, which he first renamed as the National Stud and which was later called Windfields Farm. Determined to raise the standard of Canadian breeding stock, Taylor imported several stallions from the United States. The most notable of these was Chop Chop, who went on to sire four Queen&#x27;s Plate winners for Taylor including Canadiana and Victoria Park, who also became a leading Canadian sire.

The Taylor thoroughbred horse breeding operation produced Northern Dancer, who in 1964 became the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. Northern Dancer then became arguably the greatest sire and sire of sires of the 20th century, whose impact on the breed is still felt worldwide. In 1970, Taylor was the world&#x27;s leading horse breeder measured by money won. He was voted Thoroughbred racing&#x27;s man of the year in 1973 and the following year was elected to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. In 1977 and 1983 he was named the winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in North America. Taylor&#x27;s horses won 15 Queen&#x27;s Plate races and were named Canadian Horse of the Year nine times.

==Residences==

Windfields Estate was Taylor&#x27;s main residence and was situated at 2489 Bayview Avenue in North York, Toronto. It is now the site of the Canadian Film Centre. The estate has been preserved as a heritage site. The Canadian Royal Family often stayed at Windfields when they visited Toronto. The last royals to stay there were Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, in the summers of 1974 and 1981, and Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales. There were many maids, two gardeners and a house manager who worked at the residence.

In 1963, Taylor moved to the Bahamas, taking advantage of the warm climate and its inheritance tax laws. He lived in the gated community he had built called Lyford Cay. He died there in 1989 at the age of 88. A friend of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, in December 1962, the President stayed at Taylor&#x27;s home in Lyford Cay while he held talks with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.

His son, journalist and author Charles P. B. Taylor, died in 1997 at 62, after a nine-year battle with cancer.

<doc id="436699" wikidata="Q1050571" url="?curid=436699" title="Catcher">
<text>Catcher is a position in baseball and softball. When a batter takes their turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket.

Positioned behind home plate and facing toward the outfield, the catcher can see the whole field, and is therefore in the best position to direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using PitchCom, or hand signals. The calls are based on the pitcher&#x27;s mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter&#x27;s tendencies and weaknesses. Essentially, the catcher controls what happens during the game when the ball is not &quot;in play&quot;. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher&#x27;s mitt. Though rare, some chest protectors may extend lower to provide some shield to the genitalia; wearing a pelvic protector or cup, depending on the case, is preferred and more common.

Because the position requires a comprehensive understanding of the game&#x27;s strategies, the pool of former catchers yields a disproportionate number of managers in both Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, including such prominent examples as Yogi Berra, Connie Mack, Steve O&#x27;Neill, Al López, Mike Scioscia, Joe Girardi, Stephen Vogt, and Joe Torre. The physical and mental demands of being involved on every defensive play can wear catchers down over a long season, and can have a negative effect on their offensive output. As a result, catcher is the only position (other than pitcher) to not have a member of the 3,000 hit club (not counting Craig Biggio, who only played four seasons as a catcher and was a second baseman when he reached the milestone); the current hit leader for the position is Iván Rodríguez, with 2,844.

Because of the strategic defensive importance of catching, if a catcher has exceptional defensive skills, teams are often willing to overlook their relative offensive weaknesses. A knowledgeable catcher&#x27;s ability to work with the pitcher, via pitch selection and location, can diminish the effectiveness of the opposing team&#x27;s offense. Many great defensive catchers toiled in relative anonymity, because they did not produce large offensive numbers. Notable examples of light-hitting, defensive specialists were Jerry Grote, Jeff Mathis, Martín Maldonado, Ray Schalk, Jim Hegan, Jim Sundberg and Brad Ausmus. Schalk&#x27;s career batting average of .253 is the lowest of any position player in the Baseball Hall of Fame. His selection for enshrinement in 1955 was largely a tribute to his outstanding defensive skills.

In the numbering system used to record baseball plays, the catcher is assigned the number &#x27;2&#x27;. (See &quot;Baseball scorekeeping&quot;.)

==History and evolution of the position==

In the middle of the nineteenth century, the game of baseball began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher&#x27;s delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher&#x27;s role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee offers up a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.

As the game progressed towards professionals and became more serious, pitchers began to attempt to prevent the batter from hitting the ball by throwing faster pitches. With the introduction of the called strike in , catchers began inching closer to home plate due to the rules requirement that a strikeout could only be completed by a catch. The rules governing the delivery of pitches proved to be hard to enforce, and pitchers continued to stretch the boundaries of the rules until the 1870s when the release point of pitches had reached the pitcher&#x27;s waist level. Pitchers had begun throwing overhand by , when the National League made a rule change removing all restrictions on the pitcher&#x27;s delivery.

These developments meant that catchers began to take on a crucial defensive role, as a pitcher&#x27;s deceptive deliveries could only be effective if the catcher was capable of fielding them. The progression of the catcher positioning themselves closer to the plate would lead to changes in pitching deliveries that would revolutionize the sport. In the 1870s, pitcher Candy Cummings was able to introduce the curveball because his catcher, Nat Hicks, fielded his position in close proximity to home plate and was able to catch the deceptive pitch. Other specialized pitches such as the spitball and the knuckleball followed, which further emphasized the defensive importance of the catcher&#x27;s position.

At about the same time that catchers began fielding their position closer to home plate, baseball teams began using a less rubbery ball which led to a decline in the number of runs scored. In the 1860s it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs in a game. The combination of the new, harder ball and the continuation of the rise in pitcher&#x27;s release points helped usher in what became known as the Dead-ball era. The decrease in run production placed greater significance on stolen bases and bunts, which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive role played by catchers. In , the National League introduced a new rule specifying that the catcher must stand within 10 feet of home plate. The American League adopted the rule the following year.

The rising velocity of pitches in conjunction with catchers gradually moving closer to home plate significantly increased the risk of injuries for catchers, especially face and hand injuries. By the late 1870s, catchers began to use padded, fingerless gloves to protect their hands, and in the first protective catcher&#x27;s mask was used. The first catchers to use protective masks sometimes had their courage called into question, but the effectiveness of the masks in preventing injuries meant that they became widely accepted. In the 1880s, the first padded chest protectors came into use, and in specialized catcher&#x27;s mitts used on the non-throwing hand began to be used. The final pieces of protective gear were shin guards which were first worn by catcher Roger Bresnahan in . Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher&#x27;s defensive role to the way that it is presently played.
==Catching pitches==

The catcher is usually the first to notice the tendencies, quirks, and peculiarities of each home-plate umpire. Some umpires favor high strikes, pitched balls that are technically above the strike zone but appear, to the umpire, to be good. Conversely, some umpires will call low pitches strikes even when they are slightly below the knees. Other umpires have an inside bias or an outside bias; some umpires have more than one bias; some are uniformly lenient; some have very restricted notions of the strike zone, and the pitcher will constantly feel that their pitches are unfairly judged. The catcher can exploit an umpire&#x27;s tendencies by taking them into account in when receiving the ball.

The catcher can help their pitcher get more strike calls from the umpire by using a technique called &quot;framing&quot;. This practice is a matter of a catcher keeping the mitt inside the strike zone, or making the pitch appear as close to the strike zone, when receiving the pitch, thereby giving the plate umpire the impression that the pitch is in the strike zone, even if it is not. When framing, a catcher will also hold their mitt still for a second or two so that the umpire has an opportunity to thoroughly consider their call (and, hopefully, let their innate biases influence their decision in a direction favorable to the catcher&#x27;s team).

The catcher, when receiving a borderline pitch, usually has several options in how they make the catch. They can catch the pitch in the webbing of their mitt or in the heel; they can catch the pitch on their forehand or backhand, as necessary; they can catch a low pitch with the mitt pointed upward or downward. These choices help the catcher to create a favorable presentation (or frame) for the umpire.

A variation on &quot;framing&quot; is called &quot;pulling pitches&quot;. The general approach is to catch the half of the ball that is outside the strike zone and show the umpire only the half of the ball, lodged in the mitt, that is closer to the zone. The illusion is often enhanced with a slight &#x27;tug&#x27; of the mitt (of an inch or two) toward the strike zone.

By rule, the catcher must station directly back of the plate (generally in the catcher&#x27;s box) the moment a pitch is thrown but may leave at any time to catch a pitch or make a play. The moment an intentional ball leaves a pitcher&#x27;s hand, the catcher must have both feet in the catcher&#x27;s box. The catcher is the only defensive player who is allowed to be in foul territory when a pitch is thrown.

===&quot;Catcher&#x27;s Balk&quot;===
A Catcher&#x27;s Balk occurs when the catcher is not properly set in the designated box. Once the pitcher releases the ball and the Catcher is caught outside of this zone, the play is thrown out. The term &quot;Catcher&#x27;s Balk&quot; is not an official term, however it is common to hear among Catchers and umpires alike.

===Catcher&#x27;s Interference===

If a pitch is thrown and the catcher has extended their arm resulting in the catcher&#x27;s glove being contacted by the batter&#x27;s swinging bat, a catcher&#x27;s interference is called, and the batter is awarded first base. This is recorded as an error. If the bases were loaded, it results in a run being scored, but since it is an error it is not awarded to the batter as run batted in. The catcher&#x27;s interference call is uncommon. Also, an interference penalty may be declined by the batting team, such as when a better result ensues.

==Blocking balls in the dirt==

To block balls that a pitcher throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that are said to be &quot;in the dirt&quot;), the catcher will slide their body to the left or right, as necessary, to place themselves directly in the path of the ball. Once in position, they push towards the ball while dropping to their knees, place their mitt between their legs to prevent the ball from passing through, and lean forward to deaden the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off their thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with the mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher&#x27;s ability to &quot;keep the ball in front of the body&quot; than to make a catch with their mitt. Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm&#x27;s reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle their body so that their chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. Tucking your chin or looking the ball in will help with deadening the ball like this. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, the angle at which the ball is thrown into the ground, where it first hits the ground, the firmness of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.

==Calling the game==
 15 of 30 Major League Baseball managers were former catchers. Because catchers are considered a captain on the field (and some, such as Thurman Munson and Jason Varitek were in fact team captains), they are often in charge of planning defensive plays; thus, the catcher will give signs to the pitcher for what pitch is to be thrown.

Calling the game refers to the act of catchers deciding the type of pitch delivered to home plate. The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. It is not unusual for a catcher to briefly look at the posture and position of the batter-in-turn prior to calling the next pitch; even the way a batter holds the bat may shed some indication of what the strategy may be. The selection of which pitch to use can depend on a wide variety of situations such as the type of hitter that is being faced, whether there are any base runners, how many outs have been made in the inning, or the current score, among others.

Since a catcher uses their fingers to signal and communicate with the pitcher, they may wear colorful stickers on their nails to accentuate the motion of the fingers and thus help with the visibility of the signal. As an alternative, the catcher may wear painted nails, such as with fluorescent polish.

Starting in 2022, Major League catchers began wearing a PitchCom device on their wrist. This was done in an attempt to curb the prevalence of sign stealing, which reached its peak after the Houston Astros were caught stealing signs during their World Series-winning 2017 season.

==Throwing==
A catcher nearly always throws with their right hand since most hitters are right-handed and stand to the left side of the plate when batting, so a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when they throw from behind the plate. In addition, a lefty&#x27;s throw would tend to come in on the shortstop side of the bag, while a righty&#x27;s throw would be on the second base side of the bag, which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, and Jack Clements, who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is the only man in the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer, have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano, the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate. Others suggest that fielding bunts up the 3rd base line would give the catcher a better throw to 1st base or 2nd base.

==Defensive plays==

Unlike the other fielders, the catcher and pitcher must start every play in a designated area. The catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher&#x27;s box, while the pitcher must be on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, with one foot in contact with the pitcher&#x27;s rubber. Once the ball is in play, however, the catcher and pitcher, like the other fielders, can respond to any part of the field necessary to make or assist in a defensive play. The defensive plays expected of catchers, aside from managing the pitcher by calling for pitches and catching them, include:

Preventing wild pitches and avoiding passed balls. Although the pitcher has a responsibility to throw with reasonable accuracy, catchers must be mobile enough to catch (or block) errant pitches. By doing so, a catcher prevents baserunners from advancing while the loose ball is retrieved. An errant pitch that eludes the catcher and allows a baserunner to take one or more additional bases is called a wild pitch. (Techniques for blocking wild pitches are described in the previous section.) A pitched ball which would require only ordinary effort to be caught or blocked by the catcher—but is nonetheless misplayed, allowing a base runner to advance—is called a &quot;passed ball&quot;.

Fielding high pop flies, often hit at unusual angles. In this case, the catcher must turn their back to the field in order to properly account for the spin of the ball, which often follows unpredictable paths.

Fielding catchable foul balls, in foul territory near the home plate.

Fielding weakly hit fair ground balls (including bunts) in front of home plate in order to throw to a base to complete a groundout or a fielder&#x27;s choice play. The catcher must avoid hitting the batter-runner with the thrown ball, implying that they must move to a position in which they have a clear throw to the infielder at first base.
Guarding home plate on plays in which a baserunner attempts to score a run. The catcher is often obliged to catch a ball thrown from a fielder and to tag out a runner arriving from third base. Naturally, the runner&#x27;s objective, in this situation, is to elude the catcher&#x27;s tag and touch the plate. Prior to 2014, the catcher&#x27;s best strategy was to block the runner&#x27;s path so as to prevent the runner from reaching the plate at all. Collisions between runners and catchers were common. Since the start of the 2014 season, a catcher may only obstruct a runner&#x27;s path to home plate when he, the catcher, is in possession of the ball. Without the ball in hand, the catcher must allow the runner to score uncontested. If the catcher drops the ball while tagging the runner, the runner is safe. Although contact between a runner and a catcher was generally allowed in the major leagues until the beginning of the 2014 season, little league, high school, and college runners are encouraged or mandated to avoid significant contact.

Preventing stolen bases by throwing to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting to reach the base. A catcher who is very good at preventing stolen bases is said to have a low stolen-base percentage. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher should be able to get the ball from their glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher&#x27;s &quot;pop time&quot;, the time elapsing between the popping sound of the pitch striking the catcher&#x27;s mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.

Rarely, a catcher can make a successful pick-off throw to a base to surprise an inattentive or incautious baserunner. Especially at the higher levels of baseball (where this play almost never results in an out), the catcher&#x27;s snap throws are mainly for psychological effect. If the runner knows that the catcher often attempts snap throws, the runner is likely to take a smaller lead from their base before each pitch, which will allow the infielders an extra fraction of a second to throw the runner out at the next base if they attempt to advance (as, for example, when a ground ball is hit). Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals and former MLB catcher Iván Rodríguez are known for using pickoffs with success, particularly at first base. Teams may sometimes call a deliberate play, the pitchout, wherein the pitcher intentionally throws the ball wide and high to the catcher, who comes out of their crouch to receive it and relays the ball quickly to a base to put a runner out.

Rarely, a catcher will run to first base or third base to participate in rundown plays at those bases.

In certain game situations, typically a ball batted to the shortstop or third baseman with no runners on base, the catcher may be expected to back-up first base in case the first baseman misses or mishandles a throw.

In certain game situations, when a runner is on first and the batter bunts the ball or hits the ball softly, which causes the third baseman to rush in to get the ball and throw to first base, the catcher must cover third base so that the runner from first base does not advance to third base on the play and this then forces the third baseman to cover home plate.

Any failure by the catcher can have dire consequences for their team. Passed balls are possible whenever one or more runners are on base. A failure to catch a ball thrown from the outfield on a play at home plate, or a failure to tag a runner, means that the defensive team fails to record an all-important out and, instead, it allows a run. On an attempt to prevent a stolen base, a catcher&#x27;s bad throw might careen past the infielder and skip into the outfield, allowing an additional advance by the baserunner.

Though not exactly a play, &quot;psyching the batter&quot; refers to a casual attempt by the catcher to distract the batter prior to the pitcher throwing the ball. As long as it does not fall in a lack of sportsmanship, such as offensiveness, and as long as the umpire permits it, the catcher may mention a specific throw or say something funny to try to distract the opponent to cause them to err.

==Personal catcher==
Because of the close mental relationship and trust that a successful pitcher must have with his catcher, a number of catchers throughout history have become preferred by pitchers, to the point that the catcher will almost always (especially during the regular season) start along with the pitcher. The catcher is then informally referred to as that pitcher&#x27;s &quot;personal catcher&quot;.

Naturally, the potential problem with this arrangement is that if the pitcher prefers to work with the team&#x27;s backup catcher, then the regular catcher—presumably the better player—must be benched. However, because of the physically grueling nature of the position, many &quot;regular&quot; catchers are asked to either rest relatively frequently or play a different position such as first base or designated hitter.

Personal catchers are often used for pitchers who specialize in throwing knuckleballs because of the difficulty of catching such an inconsistent and erratic pitch.

Some personal catchers have included:
* David Ross, for Jon Lester
* Tim McCarver, for Steve Carlton
* Bob Uecker, for knuckleballer Phil Niekro
* Charlie O&#x27;Brien, Eddie Pérez, Paul Bako, and Henry Blanco for Greg Maddux
* Doug Mirabelli, Kevin Cash, and George Kottaras, for knuckleballer Tim Wakefield
* Josh Thole, for knuckleballer R. A. Dickey
* Tony Cruz, for Lance Lynn
* Carlos Hernández, for Ramón Martínez
* Austin Barnes and A.J. Ellis for Clayton Kershaw
* Joe Girardi for Andy Pettitte and David Cone
* Jose Molina for A.J. Burnett

==Injury==
The catcher is the most physically demanding position in baseball, more so than the pitcher. Despite being heavily padded, catchers routinely suffer some of the worst physical abuse in baseball. The catcher has the physically risky job of blocking the plate to prevent base runners from reaching home and scoring runs. Catchers also constantly get bruised and battered by pitches, foul balls, and occasionally the bat in an undisciplined follow-through of the batter&#x27;s swing.

Catchers also are prone to knee ailments stemming from the awkward crouching stance they assume. Because of this, catchers have a reputation for being slow baserunners (perhaps the most notable of whom is Ernie Lombardi); even if they have speed at the beginning of their careers, the eventual toll taken on their knees slows them down, although there are some exceptions, such as Manny Sanguillén and Jason Kendall. Some players who begin their career as catchers are moved to other positions in order to preserve their running speed, increase their availability for games (mainly catchers with either poor defensive skills, recurring injuries, or were blocked by the presence of a more talented catcher), and take advantage of their prowess with the bat. Prominent examples of catchers switching position (mainly first base) in mid-career include Mike Napoli, Craig Biggio, B. J. Surhoff, Joe Torre, Víctor Martínez, Joe Mauer, Carlos Santana, Brandon Inge, and Dale Murphy (although Murphy was also known as a poor thrower to the pitcher and to second base, nearly hitting pitchers in the process).

As a result, catchers often have shorter careers than players at other positions; consequently, few catchers hold batting records that require many seasons of play to compile. Mike Piazza is the only catcher in history with more than 400 career home runs, and no catcher has amassed 3,000 career hits (Iván Rodríguez leads all Major League catchers with 2,844 hits). Although 3,000 hit club member Craig Biggio played his first three full seasons as a catcher, he played his remaining sixteen seasons at second base and in the outfield.

The larger or heavier the catcher, the greater the health risks associated with repeatedly assuming a crouching or squatting position; knees and backs are especially vulnerable to &quot;wear-and-tear&quot; injuries. Catchers also have an increased risk of circulatory abnormalities in the catching hand. A study of minor-league ballplayers showed that, of 36 players in various positions, all nine of the catchers had hand pain during a game, and several had chronic pain in the catching hand. Catching high-speed pitches can, in some cases, cause the index finger on the gloved hand to swell to twice the size of the other fingers. Ultrasound and blood-pressure tests showed altered blood flow in the gloved hand of five of the catchers, a far higher incidence than in the hands of players at other baseball positions.

==Equipment==

Catchers in baseball use the following equipment to help prevent injury while behind the plate:
* Catcher&#x27;s mask: To protect the face, much of the side of the head, and, often, part of the throat. In recent years, catchers have begun wearing masks similar to those worn by ice-hockey goaltenders. The hockey-style mask typically includes a section which protects the top of the head; older-style masks are usually worn over a flap-less helmet (worn backwards and often with a trimmed bill) to provide similar protection to the skull. The older style masks are now banned by the National Federation of State High School Associations.
*Catcher&#x27;s mitt: Catchers use mitts with extra padding to lower the impact of the ball on their hand. The catcher is the only player on the field who is allowed to use this type of mitt. (The first baseman also wears a mitt instead of a glove, but it is longer and not as heavily padded as a catcher&#x27;s mitt.) See &quot;Catcher&#x27;s mitt&quot;.
*Leg guards: To protect the knees and legs from the impact of a ball that the catcher is unable to play cleanly. Less commonly called &#x27;spike protectors&#x27;, they are used to prevent injury caused by base-runners advancing home with &#x27;spikes up&#x27;, that is, with the intention of injuring or intimidating the catcher with their metal cleats. Most modern styles of shin guard also incorporate a flap that covers the top of the foot.
* Chest protector: A piece of equipment, padded with rubber, plastic foam, or gel, that protects the catcher&#x27;s body while blocking as well as from the impact of a pitch if they fail to catch it. Many modern chest protectors also have an extension to cover the shoulder of the non-throwing or &quot;glove&quot; hand.
*Cup: Worn by a catcher under their uniform to mitigate the risk of serious injury when a batted or thrown ball strikes the groin area.
Additionally, some catchers choose to use the following optional equipment:
* Knee savers: Special pads filled with air or foam that attach to the straps of the shin guards, allowing cushion for the catcher when they are in the squatting position; they provide support for the knee ligaments which can, over time, stretch and tear.
* Inner protective glove: A glove, normally a batting glove, that is worn inside of the mitt to help absorb the shock of the pitched ball striking the hand.
* Throat protector: A hard-plastic plate which hangs from the bottom of the catcher&#x27;s mask to protect the throat. Because a ball striking the throat may cave in the windpipe, throat protectors are required in almost all youth-baseball games, even at the high school level.
* Thumb guard: A hard plastic guard that forms around the thumb to prevent it from being broken from a pitch from the pitcher. The thumb guard is located on the inside of the glove (if worn) and is usually very helpful in protection.
In addition to their protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize the risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with their gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes the pocket of their glove, with their bare hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep their bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm&#x27;s way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding their unprotected throwing hand behind their back or ankle. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.

Given the physical punishment suffered by catchers, the pieces of equipment associated with the position are often referred to as &quot;the tools of ignorance&quot;. This is an ironic expression; the catcher typically has the most thorough understanding of baseball tactics and strategies of any player on a team.

Catchers often experience knee tendinitis because of the constant squatting and bending of the knees while catching.

==Hall of Fame catchers==

<doc id="436705" wikidata="Q7205327" url="?curid=436705" title="Plum Island Animal Disease Center">
<text>Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) is a United States federal research facility dedicated to the study of foreign animal diseases of livestock. It is a national laboratory of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Directorate for Science and Technology (S&amp;T), and operates as a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The facility&#x27;s director is Larry Barrett.

Isolated on Plum Island off the eastern tip of Long Island, New York, the center has been tasked with protecting America&#x27;s livestock from animal diseases since 1954. It is the only facility in the country authorized to work with live foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) samples, and specializes in the study of FMD and African swine fever. At the height of the Cold War, study of biological weapons for use against livestock was conducted at the site, ending in 1969 when President Nixon declared an end to the United States&#x27; offensive bioweapons program. Today the facility maintains laboratories up to biosafety level 3, and has remained controversial as a result of its high-risk work and proximity to the New York metropolitan area.

The facility is slated for closure in 2024, with work moving to the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility under construction in Manhattan, Kansas.

==Location==

The center is located on Plum Island near the northeast coast of Long Island in New York state. During the Spanish–American War, the island was purchased by the government for the construction of Fort Terry, which was later deactivated after World War II and then reactivated in 1952 for the Army Chemical Corps. The center comprises 70 buildings (many of them dilapidated) on . Plum Island has its own fire department, power plant, water treatment plant, and security. Any wild mammal seen on the island is killed to prevent the possible transmission of foot-and-mouth disease. However, as Plum Island was named an important bird area by the New York Audubon Society, it has attracted different birds. Plum Island has placed osprey nests and bluebird boxes throughout the island. , new kestrel houses were planned to be added.

==History==
In response to disease outbreaks in Mexico and Canada in 1954, the US Army gave the island to the Agriculture Department to establish a research center dedicated to the study of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle.

The island was opened to news media for the first time in 1992. In 1995, the Department of Agriculture was issued a $111,000 fine for storing hazardous chemicals on the island.

Local Long Island activists prevented the center from expanding to include diseases that affect humans in 2000, which would require a Biosafety Level 4 designation; in 2002, the US Congress again considered the plan.

The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in January 2002 that many scientists and government officials wanted the lab to close, believing that the threat of foot-and-mouth disease was so remote that the center did not merit its $16.5 million annual budget. In 2002, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center was transferred from the United States Department of Agriculture to the United States Department of Homeland Security.

In 2003, a whistleblower who voiced concerns about safety at the facility was fired by the contractor he worked for. He had discussed his concerns with aides to Senator Hillary Clinton. A National Labor Relations Board judge found that the contractor, North Fork Services, had discriminated against the whistleblower.

In 2020, the Department of Homeland Security plan to put the island up for auction after the conclusion of laboratory activities in 2023 was blocked by Congress. As part of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York negotiated a provision in the CARES Act that protects the island from being sold. Environmentalists had opposed the sale of the island because of its extensive wildlife habitats. After the final draft of the legislation was announced, Schumer said “It would have been a grave mistake to sell and develop Plum Island&#x27;s 840-acres of habitat, which is home to many endangered species, that&#x27;s why preventing the unnecessary sale requirement was a top priority of these negotiations.&quot;

=== Replacement facility ===

On September 11, 2005, DHS announced that the Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center will be replaced by a new federal facility. The location of the new high-security animal disease lab, called the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), is being built in Manhattan, Kansas.

The plan was controversial almost immediately when it was unveiled, following a cost assessment by DHS and prime contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in which the agency determined that the cost of maintaining or moving the facility would be comparable.

Those conclusions, as well as claims about the safety of the facility proposed were called into question several times, first by a 2007 Government Accountability Office study, which stated that claims by DHS that the work on foot and mouth disease performed on Plum Island can be performed &quot;as safely on the mainland&quot; is &quot;not supported&quot; by evidence.

In 2012, DHS completed a risk assessment of the Kansas site that called the proposed facility &quot;safe and secure&quot;. In response, a 2012 review of the risk assessment by the National Research Council called it &quot;seriously flawed&quot;.

Despite controversy, the new facility is nearing completion, and transfer of laboratory contents from Plum Island to NBAF is to be complete by 2023. The USDA has named former director of Canada&#x27;s Centers for Animal Disease Alfonso Clavijo as the director of the new facility.

==Activities==
PIADC&#x27;s mission can be grouped into three main categories: diagnosis, research, and education.

Since 1971, PIADC has been educating veterinarians in foreign animal diseases. The center hosts several Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic schools each year to train federal and state veterinarians and laboratory diagnostic staff, military veterinarians and veterinary school faculty.

At PIADC, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) work together; DHS&#x27; Targeted Advanced Development unit partners with USDA, academia and industry scientists to deliver vaccines and antivirals to the USDA for licensure and inclusion in the USDA National Veterinary Vaccine Stockpile.

USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) performs basic and applied research to better formulate countermeasures against foreign animal diseases, including strategies for prevention, control and recovery. ARS focuses on developing faster-acting vaccines and antivirals to be used during outbreaks to limit or stop transmission. Antivirals prevent infection while vaccine immunity develops. The principal diseases studied are foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, and vesicular stomatitis virus.

USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) operates the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, an internationally recognized facility performing diagnostic testing of samples collected from U.S. livestock. APHIS also tests animals and animal products being imported into the U.S. APHIS maintains the North American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine Bank at PIADC and hosts the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnosticians training program, offering several classes per year to train veterinarians to recognize foreign animal diseases.

Research on biological weapons at PIADC ceased when the United States Biological Warfare program was ended in 1969 by President Richard Nixon.

===Biological weapons research===
The original anti-animal biological weapons mission was &quot;to establish and pursue a program of research and development of certain anti-animal (BW) agents&quot;. By August 1954 animals occupied holding areas at Plum Island and research was ongoing within Building 257. The USDA facility, known as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, continued work on biological warfare research until the U.S. program was ended by Richard Nixon in 1969. The bio-weapons research at Building 257 and Fort Terry was shrouded in aura of mystery and secrecy. The existence of biological warfare experiments on Plum Island during the Cold War era was denied for decades by the U.S. government. In 1993 &quot;Newsday&quot; unearthed documents proving otherwise and in 1994, Russian scientists inspected the Plum Island research facility to verify that these experiments had indeed ended.

==Diseases studied and outbreaks==
As a diagnostic facility, PIADC scientists study more than 40 foreign animal diseases, including classical swine fever and African swine fever. PIADC runs about 30,000 diagnostic tests each year. PIADC operates Biosafety Level 3 Agriculture (BSL-3Ag), BSL-3 and BSL-2 laboratory facilities. The facility&#x27;s research program includes developing diagnostic tools and biologicals for foot-and-mouth disease and other diseases of livestock.

Because federal law stipulates that live foot-and-mouth disease virus cannot be studied on the mainland, PIADC is unique in that it is currently the only laboratory in the U.S. equipped with research facilities that permit the study of foot-and-mouth disease.

Foot-and-mouth disease is extremely contagious among cloven-hooved animals, and people who have come in contact with it can carry it to animals. Accidental outbreaks of the virus have caused catastrophic livestock and economic losses in many countries throughout the world.

Foot-and-mouth disease was eradicated from the U.S. in 1929 (with the exception of the stocks within the Plum Island center) but is currently endemic to many parts of the world.

In 2012, two researchers at the facility, John Neilan and Michael Puckette, developed the first Foot-and-mouth disease vaccine which does not require live virus cultures in the manufacturing process, allowing vaccine development to occur safely and legally on U.S. mainland for the first time.

=== Laboratory accidents ===
Plum Island has experienced outbreaks of its own, including one in 1978 in which foot-and-mouth disease was released to animals outside the center, and two incidents in 2004 in which the disease was released within the center.

In response to the two 2004 incidents, New York Senator Hillary Clinton and Congressman Tim Bishop wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security regarding their concerns about the center&#x27;s safety: &quot;We urge you to immediately investigate these alarming breaches at the highest levels, and to keep us apprised of all developments.&quot;

==Historic buildings==
===Building 257===
Building No. 257 at Fort Terry, on Plum Island near Long Island, New York, was completed around 1911. The original purpose of the building was to store weapons, such as mines, and the structure was designated the Combined Torpedo Storehouse and Cable Tanks building. Fort Terry went through a period of activations and deactivations through World War II until the U.S. Army Chemical Corps took over the facility in 1952 for use in anti-animal biological warfare (BW) research. The Chemical Corps planned a laboratory for the fort, to be housed in Building 257. The conversion of Fort Terry to a BW facility required the remodeling of Building 257 and other structures.

As work neared completion on the lab and other facilities in the spring of 1954 the mission of Fort Terry changed. Construction was completed on the facilities on May 26, 1954, but the post was transferred to the USDA before the military could utilize the new laboratory facilities. Fort Terry was officially transferred to the USDA on July 1, 1954, at the time scientists from the Bureau of Animal Industry were already working in Building 257. Construction on a new lab facility, known as Building 101, also began about this time but was not completed until September 1956.

A modernization program in 1977 aimed to update both Building 257 and Building 101, but the program was canceled in 1979 because of construction contract irregularities. Plum Island facilities were essentially unchanged until a new modernization began in 1990. Two-thirds of the laboratory facilities inside Building 101 were renovated and operations in Building 257 were consolidated into Building 101. According to a United States Department of Homeland Security spokesperson in 2004, Building 257 was closed in 1995 and poses no health hazard.

===Building 101===
The structure is a T-shaped white building. It is situated on Plum Island&#x27;s northwest plateau on a site where it is buttressed by a steep cliff which leads into the ocean. To the south-west of the building&#x27;s site is the old Plum Island Lighthouse.

Construction on Plum Island&#x27;s new laboratory Building 101 began around July 1, 1954, around the same time that the Army&#x27;s anti-animal bio-warfare (BW) facilities at Fort Terry were transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Following the transfer, the facilities on Plum Island became known as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The USDA&#x27;s $7.7. million Building 101 laboratory facility was dedicated on September 26, 1956. Prior to the building&#x27;s opening the area around it was sprayed with chemicals to deter insect or animal life from approaching the facility. Upon its opening a variety of tests using pathogens and vectors were conducted on animals in the building. Research on biological weapons at PIADC did not cease until the entire program was canceled in 1969 by Richard Nixon.

A modernization program in 1977 aimed to update both Building 101 and another laboratory, Building 257, but the program was canceled in 1979 because of construction contract irregularities. PIADC facilities were essentially unchanged until a new modernization began in 1990. Two-thirds of the laboratory facilities inside Building 101 were renovated and operations from Building 257 were consolidated into Building 101. Building 257 was closed, and a major expansion, known as Building 100, was completed on Building 101 in 1995. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Building 257 currently poses no health hazard.

==Controversy==
=== Conspiracy theories ===
Prolific but unfounded conspiracy theories have alleged that Lyme disease, first documented in nearby Lyme, Connecticut, was a biological weapon that originated in the Plum Island laboratory. A discredited 2004 book entitled &quot;Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government&#x27;s Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory&quot; fueled the conspiracy theories. Archived specimens show that Lyme disease was endemic well before the establishment of Plum Island laboratory. Additionally, Lyme disease was never a topic of research at Plum Island, according to the US Department of Homeland Security and Department of Agriculture.

On July 12, 2008, a creature dubbed the Montauk Monster washed ashore at Ditch Plains Beach near the business district of Montauk, New York. The creature, a quadruped of indeterminate size, was dead when discovered, and was assumed by some to have come from Plum Island as a result of the currents and proximity to the mainland. Palaeozoologist Darren Naish studied the photograph and concluded from visible dentition and the front paws that the creature may have been a raccoon. This was also the opinion of Larry Penny, the East Hampton Natural Resources Director.

=== Terrorism ===
When American educated Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, a suspected al-Qaeda member, was captured in Afghanistan in July 2008, she had in her handbag handwritten notes referring to a &quot;mass casualty attack&quot; that listed various U.S. locations, including the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. In February 2010, she was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and attempting to kill U.S. servicemembers and FBI agents who sought to interrogate her.

== In popular culture ==
* Plum Island and PIADC are the subject of a murder mystery novel, &quot;Plum Island&quot;, by Nelson DeMille. DeMille has said, &quot;How could anthrax not be studied there? Every animal has it.&quot; While addressing popular culture fears of a germ warfare lab at Plum Island, overall, the facility is presented as doing the job described by the Federal Government—research into animal diseases that would either devastate our national livestock or jump to humans and devastate us. The novel portrays the investigation into the murder of two Plum Island scientists. The motive, initially thought to be germs for terrorists or germs for a biotech company, is really the search for the lost treasure of Captain Kidd, who sailed the waters around Long Island prior to his capture. Kidd&#x27;s treasure has never been found.
* Plum Island is also referred to in the 1991 psychological thriller &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, when the character of Hannibal Lecter is offered a transfer to a different psychiatric institution, as well as the promise of annual week-long supervised furlough to Plum Island, in exchange for his assistance in helping the FBI locate the whereabouts of the missing daughter of a prominent US Senator. It is later revealed in the film that the offer is bogus in the first place, used only as a ruse to elicit Lecter&#x27;s cooperation.
* The Plum Island facility served as the inspiration for the Mount Dragon research facility in the 1996 techno-thriller &quot;Mount Dragon&quot;, written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.
* The testing facility at Plum Island is the subject of a novel, &quot;The Poison Plum&quot;, by author Les Roberts.
* Plum Island and the facility there figure prominently in the 2014 horror novel, &quot;The Montauk Monster&quot;, by Hunter Shea, in which a bizarre carcass found on a beach in 2008 is an early version of vicious creatures now terrifying the Montauk community.
* The Plum Island facility is mentioned in the television show &quot;Emergence&quot; as the takeoff point for a flight that crashes in Southold, New York. In reality, this would be impossible, as there are no airstrips on Plum Island.

<text>Dot-decimal notation is a presentation format for numerical data. It consists of a string of decimal numbers, using the full stop (&quot;dot&quot;) as a separation character.

A common use of dot-decimal notation is in information technology where it is a method of writing numbers in octet-grouped base-10 (decimal) numbers. In computer networking, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) addresses are commonly written using the quad-dotted notation of four decimal integers, ranging from 0 to 255 each.

==IPv4 address==
In computer networking, the notation is associated with the specific use of &quot;quad-dotted notation&quot; to represent IPv4 addresses and used as a synonym for &quot;dotted-quad notation&quot;. Dot-decimal notation is a presentation format for numerical data expressed as a string of decimal numbers each separated by a full stop. For example, the hexadecimal number &quot;0xFF000000&quot; may be expressed in dot-decimal notation as &quot;255.0.0.0&quot;.

An IPv4 address has 32 bits. For purposes of representation, the bits may be divided into four octets written in decimal numbers, ranging from 0 to 255, concatenated as a character string with full stop delimiters between each number. This octet-grouped dotted-decimal format may more specifically be called &quot;dotted octet&quot; format, or a &quot;dotted quad address&quot;.

For example, the address of the loopback interface, usually assigned the host name localhost, is 127.0.0.1. It consists of the four octets, written in binary notation: &quot;01111111&quot;, &quot;00000000&quot;, &quot;00000000&quot;, and &quot;00000001&quot;. The 32-bit number is represented in hexadecimal notation as &quot;0x7F000001&quot;.

No formal specification of this textual IP address representation exists. The first mention of this format in RFC documents was in RFC 780 for the Mail Transfer Protocol published May 1981, in which the IP address was supposed to be enclosed in brackets or represented as a 32-bit decimal integer prefixed by a pound sign. A table in RFC 790 (&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;) used the dotted decimal format, zero-padding each number to three digits. RFC 1123 (&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts – Application and Support&quot;) of October 1989 mentions a requirement for host software to accept &quot;IP address in dotted-decimal (&quot;#.#.#.#&quot;) form&quot;, although it notes &quot;[t]his last requirement is not intended to specify the complete syntactic form for entering a dotted-decimal host number&quot;. An IETF draft intended to define textual representation of IP addresses expired without further activity.

A popular implementation of IP networking, originating in 4.2BSD, contains a function &quot;inet_aton()&quot; for converting IP addresses in character string representation to internal binary storage. In addition to the basic four-decimals format and 32-bit numbers, it also supported intermediate syntax forms of &quot;octet.24bits&quot; (e.g. 10.1234567; for Class A addresses) and &quot;octet.octet.16bits&quot; (e.g. 172.16.12345; for Class B addresses). It also allowed the numbers to be written in hexadecimal and octal representations, by prefixing them with 0x and 0, respectively. These features continue to be supported in some software, even though they are considered as non-standard. This means addresses with a component written with a leading zero digit may be interpreted differently in programs that do or do not recognize such formats.

A POSIX-conforming variant of &quot;inet_aton&quot;, the &quot;inet_pton()&quot; function, supports only the four-decimal variant of IP addresses.

IP addresses in dot-decimal notation are also presented in CIDR notation, in which the IP address is suffixed with a slash and a number, used to specify the length of the associated routing prefix. For example, 127.0.0.1/8 specifies that the IP address has an eight-bit routing prefix, and therefore the subnet mask &quot;255.0.0.0&quot;.

==OIDs==
Object identifiers use a style of dot-decimal notation to represent an arbitrarily deep hierarchy of objects identified by decimal numbers. They may also use textual words separated by dots, like some computer languages (see inheritance).

==Version numbers==
Software releases are often given version numbers in dot-decimal notation, with the first digit designating major revisions and the smaller ones progressively more minor releases. Version numbers with a leading zero, say &quot;0.1.8&quot;, conventionally indicate that the software is still in beta and does not yet have complete features.

==Libraries==
Libraries use notation systems consisting of decimal numbers separated by dots, such as the older Dewey Decimal Classification and the Universal Decimal Classification, to classify books and other works by subject. The UDC additionally codes works with &quot;multiple&quot; dot-decimal topics, separated by colons.

==Texts==
Dot-decimal notation is often used for sections within a large text. This was standardized in ISO 2145.

==Medicine==

Dot-decimal notation is also used to describe illnesses in a language-neutral way. For instance, the AO Foundation/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification generates numeric codes for describing broken toes. They run 88[meaning a fracture of the phalanges].[number-code of toe, with the big toe=1 and the little toe=5].[number-code of phalanx, counting 1-3 outwards from the foot].[number-code of location on the bone, with 1 being the inner end, 3 the outer, and 2 in-between]. So, for instance, 88.5.3.2 means a fracture to the little toe&#x27;s outermost bone, in the center. There are other classifications for other fractures and dislocations.

<text>Daniel Robbins is a computer programmer who founded the Gentoo Linux project and was its former chief architect. In 2008, he launched the Funtoo project, a free Linux distribution based on Gentoo, and he became the project&#x27;s lead developer and organizer. He works in Albuquerque, New Mexico at Zenoss, and as president for Funtoo Technologies.

==Biography==

=== Formation of Gentoo Linux distribution ===
During his time as a system administrator at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, Robbins formed his own distribution &quot;Enoch Linux&quot;, which was later renamed Gentoo Linux in 2002.

Gentoo struggled to create a business model that would support its key developers, like many other free software projects at the time. Robbins resigned as Chief Architect in April 2004. He formed the Gentoo Foundation and transferred all Gentoo intellectual property to it, so that Gentoo would be run as a full community-based model. He rejoined the project for a short time from August 2006, becoming a developer again in February 2007 and joining the amd64 team but resigned in early March 2007.

There have been several high-profile criticisms of the way Gentoo has run since Robbins left, such as: &quot;...since the resignation of Gentoo&#x27;s founder and benevolent dictator from the project in 2004, the newly established Gentoo Foundation has been battling with lack of clear directions and frequent developer conflicts...&quot;.

In mid-July 2007, it emerged that Robbins was still technically the legal president of the Gentoo Foundation.

====Funtoo Linux====
In 2008, Robbins began to work on Funtoo, a project created to allow him to work on extending the technologies originally created for Gentoo.

In 2024, Robbins announced that he would shut down Funtoo without searching a handover.

==== Microsoft ====
Robbins&#x27; move to Microsoft, in May 2005, attracted attention within the Linux community, which has historically had a combative relationship with Microsoft. He described his role working for Bill Hilf as &quot;...helping Microsoft to understand Open Source and community-based projects...&quot;

However, Robbins resigned less than a year later in January 2006 due to frustrations that he was unable to fully utilize his technical skills in this position.

====RTLinux====
Later in 2006, he joined FSMLabs in Socorro, New Mexico, to work on RTLinux.

===Funtoo Technologies===

Daniel Robbins is also president of Funtoo Technologies, a consulting firm founded in 2006 and located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

<doc id="436713" wikidata="Q2271107" url="?curid=436713" title="Eternity (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Eternity is a fictional cosmic entity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by scripter-editor Stan Lee and artist-plotter Steve Ditko, the character is first mentioned in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #134 (July 1965) and first appears in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #138 (Nov. 1965).

Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared in five decades of Marvel continuity and appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, films, trading cards, and video games.

Eternity appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
Eternity debuted in an epic 17-issue storyline dubbed &quot;The Eternity Saga&quot;, which occurred in the ongoing feature &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #130–146 (March 1965–July 1966). The character was first mentioned in the 10-page story &quot;Earth Be My Battleground&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #134 (July 1965), and first seen in the 10-page story &quot;If Eternity Should Fail&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #138 (Nov. 1965).

Following the publication&#x27;s retitling as &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, the character returned in issues #180–182 (May–July 1969), and thereafter continued to appear in stories that were cosmic in scope, including in &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; vol. 2 #10–13 (Oct. 1974–April 1975); &quot;The Defenders&quot; #92 (Feb. 1981); and a story by writer-artist John Byrne in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #262 (Jan. 1984) that attracted controversy. At the conclusion of that story, Eternity validated the existence of another cosmic character, Galactus. Howard University Professor of Literature Marc Singer stated Byrne used the character Eternity as a means to &quot;justify planetary-scale genocide&quot;.

Eternity guest starred in &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; #6–7 (Dec. 1984–Jan. 1985); &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3 #6 &amp; 10 (Dec. 1987, April 1988) and with Marvel&#x27;s cosmic hierarchy in the limited series &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1–6 (July–Dec. 1991), and in its sequel, &quot;The Infinity War&quot; #1–6 (June–Nov. 1992). The character played a pivotal role in limited series &quot;Avengers Infinity&quot; #1–4 (Sept.–Dec. 2000). Major revelations about the character appeared in a storyline in &quot;Quasar&quot; #19–25 (Feb.–Aug. 1991). Other appearances, again in storylines that featured a cosmic theme, included &quot;Infinity Abyss&quot; #1–6 (Aug.–Oct. 2002); and &quot;Defenders&quot; vol. 3, #1–5 (Sept. 2005–Jan. 2006).

Eternity has also appeared in the alternate universe titles &quot;What If?&quot; #32 (April 1982), &quot;&quot; #1–6 (May 2003–Aug. 2003), and &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; #1–4 (Sept. 2003–May 2004). Eternity&#x27;s origin, along with the birth of the Marvel Multiverse, was finally revealed in &quot;The Ultimates 2&quot; #6 (2017). He returned in 2019&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; story arc &quot;Herald Supreme&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Eternity, along with his twin sister Infinity, were born with the Big Bang and they represent the multiverse in its current iteration (but each universe has its own Eternity and Infinity that represent that universe). Before Eternity, there was a single universe, whose animating force was the primal cosmic being that would later call itself the First Firmament. The First Firmament was attacked by its creations, The Celestials, during the catastrophic cosmic war that erupted between them and their counterpart creations, the Aspirants. The climax of that war resulted in the Celestials&#x27; weapons tearing the first universe apart. The core essence of the First Firmament and the surviving Aspirants desperately fled to the void outside creation. The torn fragments of the sundered first universe then coalesced into a new being that was made up of hundreds of universes: the &quot;Second Cosmos&quot; which was the first multiverse. Creation would then evolve, die and be reborn six more times, each time evolving and changing to add new realities, forces and properties to itself-and all these changes would be reflected in the corresponding birth of Eternity. After the destruction of the multiverse by the incursions and its rebirth at the hands of Reed Richards, Franklin Richards, and Molecule Man, Eternity is in his 8th incarnation.

The first recorded human contact with Eternity is by Doctor Strange, who seeks the entity out when his master the Ancient One is attacked by former pupil Baron Mordo. After a series of battles with Mordo and his minions, and discovering that arch-foe Dormammu is secretly backing Mordo, Strange finds and speaks with Eternity. The entity advises Strange that he is capable of defeating his foes without aid, and Strange wins a duel with Dormammu (who is ultimately defeated by Eternity) and thwarts an attempted sabotage in his Sanctum Sanctorum.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the entity is kidnapped by Doctor Strange&#x27;s foe Nightmare, who after causing time distortions that allow beings such as dinosaurs and barbarians to appear in New York City, appears before Strange and his aide and sometime lover Clea. Nightmare challenges the mystic to attempt to rescue Eternity, and after accepting, Strange enters Nightmare&#x27;s Dream World. After an extended series of battles and a temporary defeat, Strange successfully recruits the X-Men foe the Juggernaut to stop Nightmare from merging his realm with Earth, and together they free Eternity. The entity then banishes Nightmare while Doctor Strange and the Juggernaut restore reality.

The entity is aided by superhero team the Defenders, who locate three missing fragments of its being and convince them to rejoin with Eternity.

Eternity is also summoned to the trial of Fantastic Four member Mister Fantastic, who is accused of saving the life of fellow cosmic entity Galactus. Eternity allows all present to momentarily possess &quot;cosmic awareness&quot;, thereby allowing them to understand that Galactus is a vital part of the universe, despite the continued extinction of entire species.

During a series of extended battles between cosmic hero Quasar and the villain Maelstrom (the avatar of the entity Oblivion), Eternity is revealed to have a &quot;twin&quot; entity, Infinity, with the pair representing the space-time continuum and the living force of the universe.

The character appears with the entire cosmic hierarchy (eventually revealed to be &quot;retconned&quot; into an avatar of the entity) during an encounter with the entity the Beyonder and consults with fellow entity Galactus when the Elders of the Universe plan to destroy the latter (to initiate a new Big Bang and restart the universe).

Abraxas was imprisoned inside Eternity and was released when Galactus died.

Together with the cosmic hierarchy Eternity opposes the Eternal Thanos when the villain wields the Infinity Gauntlet, although they are all eventually defeated. Once Thanos is eventually dispatched (courtesy of his own carelessness), Eternity unsuccessfully advises fellow cosmic entity the Living Tribunal against allowing the Infinity Gems to be used in conjunction. Eternity develops animosity towards the artificial being Adam Warlock, whom the entity encounters on several occasions.

Eternity also &quot;spawned&quot; several &quot;children&quot;, or concepts that became separate, independent entities: Empathy; Eulogy; Expediency; Entropy; Epiphany; Enmity and Eon (Eon is eventually killed and replaced in turn by the concept Epoch).

Eternity is imprisoned by the Magus (the evil alter ego of Adam Warlock) who attempts to reunite the Infinity Gems for his own use. The villain is eventually defeated when Eternity merges with Infinity and together they strip the Magus of his newfound power.

Eternity is also summoned by the superhero team the Avengers to reason with the cosmic entities the Infinites and observes the attempts of Thanos and several of Earth&#x27;s heroes to defeat several of his clones, who are dedicated to destroying the universe and in turn, Eternity itself.

Eternity is eventually killed due to the machinations of his son Entropy, when the later allied himself with Genis-Vell, who at the time was becoming insane under the strain of his cosmic awareness. Entropy soon regretted what he had done, when all of creation was destroyed, leaving only himself, his sister Epiphany, Genis and Rick Jones, since the prospect of spending the rest of eternity in an empty void was not all that alluring. Rick Jones suggested that he try creating something. Entropy did, and with Genis-Vell&#x27;s help, he re-created the Universe, thus becoming the new Eternity. As Eternity, he revealed that this was all part of his life cycle.

Eternity is one of the last beings (together with the Living Tribunal and Infinity) to be overcome by Thanos when he uses the Heart of the Universe to undo the universe and then remake it minus a fatal flaw. During JLA/Avengers he met Kismet and the two fell in love. They are then kidnapped by the villain Krona when the Grandmaster engineers a merging of the Marvel Universe and the DC Universe, who use their connections to their universes in an attempt to destroy both so he can learn their secrets. After the Crisis was averted due to the Avengers and Justice League joining forces and defeating Krona, the two sadly parted ways.

The entity&#x27;s power is stolen by Dormammu and his sister Umar to remake the universe in their image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of three of the original Defenders (Strange; the Hulk and Namor), with Umar betraying Dormammu and then being defeated in turn. Eternity&#x27;s power returns to him and reality is restored.

When an alien race&#x27;s experiments in eternal universal observation cause damage to Eternity, he is narrowly saved by the actions of the Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Storm, Gravity and the Silver Surfer. Strange uses Gravity as a &quot;scalpel&quot; based on his gravity-wielding powers to cut out the damaged portions while Storm serves as a temporary host to Eternity&#x27;s consciousness as the other heroes hold back the universe&#x27;s &quot;antibodies&quot; as they try to attack the perceived cause of the damage.

In the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Eternity grants Henry Pym the title of Scientist Supreme, a scientific counterpart to the mystical title Sorcerer Supreme, as he is able to create science with effects similar to magic. However, Loki later claims to have been posing as Eternity to trick Pym.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Eternity is summoned by Hercules to deal with Amatsu-Mikaboshi. However, Eternity tells Hercules that fighting the Chaos God will be like fighting an aspect of Eternity himself. Eternity remains confident that Hercules and his comrades will find a way to win.

During the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, the Beyonders are revealed to have killed Eternity as part of destroying abstract entities in each reality across the multiverse.

Doctor Doom&#x27;s killing of the Beyonders and use of their power to create Battleworld out of what remains of the multiverse revives Eternity, whose face and voice are replaced by Doom&#x27;s. Glorian informs the Silver Surfer that reality being held together by Doom&#x27;s will has turned Eternity into the will of Doom.

At the end of the &quot;Civil War II&quot; story line, Eternity appears before Ulysses when he evolves into a new being and becomes one with the universe.

The cosmic team The Ultimates traveled Outside of the Multiverse to survey the timestream to evaluate its status after the rebirth of reality during the Secret Wars event. The forces outside Reality proved to be too great a challenge even for the immensely powerful and skilled super-team. They were rescued by Galactus The Lifebringer, whom the Ultimates had earlier cured of his hunger and transformed into a positive cosmic force, much to the former Devourer&#x27;s gratitude. An aspect of Eternity had informed Galactus of their danger and requested he assist them. However, after rescuing the Ultimates, Galactus discovered to his horror that the actual totality of Eternity - the actual life force of the Multiverse rather than the aspects of him that usually interact with lesser beings - had been chained and imprisoned by some mysterious cosmic force. Eternity had used the rescue of the Ultimates as an excuse to lure Galactus there to warn him of his predicament and that all of Creation was in danger from his jailer.

It was eventually revealed Eternity&#x27;s jailer was none other than his predecessor, The First Firmament. The destruction of the Seventh and the rebirth of the Eighth Multiverse by the Beyonders during the Secret Wars had an unforeseen consequence: It provided an opening for the Firmament, who had been patiently waiting Outside, to attack the newly reborn and therefore greatly weakened Eternity with the goal of destroying the multiverse and restoring itself to the center of creation. The Firmament first chained and then began infiltrating Eternity with both its loyal Aspirant agents and taking control over the lesser cosmic entities that protected the cosmic balance in its component universes. For example, under the Firmament&#x27;s influence, Master Order and Lord Chaos destroyed the reborn Living Tribunal in front of Galactus the Lifebringer and then found their servant, The In-Betweener and forcibly merged into a new cosmic being many orders of magnitude of power greater that called itself Logos. Logos then located the surviving Celestials and destroyed all but one of them. One of the Celestials was rescued by The Queen of Nevers. Logos then transformed Galactus back into the Devourer of Worlds, with an enormously increased hunger. The goal was to turn Galactus into a living weapon that would devour the Multiverse. Galactus was rescued again by the Ultimates and his current herald, the Anti-Man-who sacrificed his life to restore Galactus as the Lifebringer. Enraged, Galactus devoured Rostov, the Firmament&#x27;s servant who had infiltrated the Troubleshooters and attempted to manipulate them into defeating the Ultimates. After devouring him, Galactus knew all Rostov knew. However, Galactus was now weakened and had to have time to recover before planning their next move. Eternity remained chained with the First Firmament acting against the newly reborn and therefore malleable Cosmic Order within him. Galactus swore to free him by any means necessary and the Ultimates agreed to help.

==Eternity Mask==
A black magical item created from Eternity&#x27;s own substance during the sixth century by a group of renegade occultists to give whoever wears it equal power to anyone they may face, unless they are below the natural ability of the mask&#x27;s user. This allowed for example, an untrained peasant to be on equal grounds with the Black Knight and fight him for three days straight. If the would-be user&#x27;s intent was to commit acts of evil, the mask had no effect on them. So far the upper limits of this ability have yet to be established. The Mask has since then, been passed on from individual to individual and has been implied to have taken a role in the most important events in Human history. One of the first known users of the mask was Jim Gardley a.k.a. Masked Raider. Other users were the Black Rider, the Ferret, Thunderer and Jerome Hamilton a.k.a. Blind Justice.

==Powers and abilities==
Eternity is a tremendously powerful abstract entity. An embodiment of the multiverse, it has no real physical body. The entity can manipulate the multiverse to achieve essentially any desired effect, and as its name suggests, it is immortal and unaffected by the passage of time. Eternity can warp space and matter into a manifestation that can be perceived by lesser beings, or form avatars from another plane of existence known as the Dimension of Manifestations. On occasion it manifests by possessing the body of exceptionally spiritually-strong mortal beings (e.g. Doctor Strange, Thor, Storm).

Thanos, wielding the Infinity Gauntlet, ranked Eternity&#x27;s scale of power as above that of Lord Chaos and Master Order, equal to that of Infinity, but below that of the Living Tribunal.

=== Impact ===
&quot;The Eternity Saga&quot; culminates in the introduction of the character Eternity. The saga is frequently cited on lists of the top Doctor Strange storylines to read, being called &quot;Lee and Ditko’s magnum opus of oddity.&quot; In 2017, &quot;CBR.com&quot; highlighted the surreal and trippy imagery attributed to the emergence of Eternity himself and his battle with Dormammu, when it was rated one of Marvel&#x27;s top cosmic/space stories and voted 89th in the top 100 comic book storylines.

Eternity possibly served as inspiration for Marvel writers Jim Starlin and Steve Englehart.

<text>The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL ) is a type of semiconductor laser diode with laser beam emission perpendicular from the top surface, contrary to conventional edge-emitting semiconductor lasers (also called &quot;in-plane&quot; lasers) which emit from surfaces formed by cleaving the individual chip out of a wafer. VCSELs are used in various laser products, including computer mice, fiber-optic communications, laser printers, Face ID, and smartglasses.

== Production advantages ==

There are several advantages to producing VCSELs, in contrast to the production process of edge-emitting lasers. Edge-emitters cannot be tested until the end of the production process. If the edge-emitter does not function properly, whether due to bad contacts or poor material growth quality, the production time and the processing materials have been wasted. VCSELs however, can be tested at several stages throughout the process to check for material quality and processing issues. For instance, if the vias, which are the electrical connections between layers of a circuit, have not been completely cleared of dielectric material during the etch, an interim testing process will flag that the top metal layer is not making contact to the initial metal layer. Additionally, because VCSELs emit the beam perpendicular to the active region of the laser as opposed to parallel as with an edge emitter, tens of thousands of VCSELs can be processed simultaneously on a three-inch gallium arsenide wafer. Thus, although the VCSEL production process is more labor and material intensive, the yield can be controlled to a more predictable and higher outcome.

== Structure ==

The laser resonator consists of two distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors parallel to the wafer surface with an active region consisting of one or more quantum wells for the laser light generation in between. The planar DBR-mirrors consist of layers with alternating high and low refractive indices. Each layer has a thickness of a quarter of the laser wavelength in the material, yielding intensity reflectivities above 99%. High reflectivity mirrors are required in VCSELs to balance the short axial length of the gain region.

In common VCSELs the upper and lower mirrors are doped as p-type and n-type materials, forming a diode junction. In more complex structures, the p-type and n-type regions may be embedded between the mirrors, requiring a more complex semiconductor process to make electrical contact to the active region, but eliminating electrical power loss in the DBR structure.

In laboratory investigation of VCSELs using new material systems, the active region may be &quot;pumped&quot; by an external light source with a shorter wavelength, usually another laser. This allows a VCSEL to be demonstrated without the additional problem of achieving good electrical performance; however such devices are not practical for most applications.

VCSELs for wavelengths from 650 nm to 1300 nm are typically based on gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafers with DBRs formed from GaAs and aluminium gallium arsenide (Al&quot;x&quot;Ga(1−&quot;x&quot;)As). The GaAs–AlGaAs system is favored for constructing VCSELs because the lattice constant of the material does not vary strongly as the composition is changed, permitting multiple &quot;lattice-matched&quot; epitaxial layers to be grown on a GaAs substrate. However, the refractive index of AlGaAs does vary relatively strongly as the Al fraction is increased, minimizing the number of layers required to form an efficient Bragg mirror compared to other candidate material systems. Furthermore, at high aluminium concentrations, an oxide can be formed from AlGaAs, and this oxide can be used to restrict the current in a VCSEL, enabling very low threshold currents.

The main methods of restricting the current in a VCSEL are characterized by two types: ion-implanted VCSELs and oxide VCSELs.

In the early 1990s, telecommunications companies tended to favor ion-implanted VCSELs. Ions, (often hydrogen ions, H+), were implanted into the VCSEL structure everywhere except the aperture of the VCSEL, destroying the lattice structure around the aperture, thus inhibiting the current. In the mid to late 1990s, companies moved towards the technology of oxide VCSELs. The current is confined in an oxide VCSEL by oxidizing the material around the aperture of the VCSEL. A high content aluminium layer that is grown within the VCSEL structure is the layer that is oxidized. Oxide VCSELs also often employ the ion implant production step. As a result, in the oxide VCSEL, the current path is confined by the ion implant and the oxide aperture.

The initial acceptance of oxide VCSELs was plagued with concern about the apertures &quot;popping off&quot; due to the strain and defects of the oxidation layer. However, after much testing, the reliability of the structure has proven to be robust. As stated in one study by Hewlett Packard on oxide VCSELs, &quot;The stress results show that the activation energy and the wearout lifetime of oxide VCSEL are similar to that of implant VCSEL emitting the same amount of output power.&quot;
A production concern also plagued the industry when moving the oxide VCSELs from research and development to production mode. The oxidation rate of the oxide layer was highly dependent on the aluminium content. Any slight variation in aluminium would change the oxidation rate sometimes resulting in apertures that were either too big or too small to meet the specification standards.

Longer wavelength devices, from 1300 nm to 2000 nm, have been demonstrated with at least the active region made of indium phosphide. VCSELs at even higher wavelengths are experimental and usually optically pumped. 1310 nm VCSELs are desirable as the dispersion of silica-based optical fiber is minimal in this wavelength range.

=== Special forms ===
; Multiple active region devices (aka bipolar cascade VCSELs) : Allows for differential quantum efficiency values in excess of 100% through carrier recycling
; VCSELs with tunnel junctions : Using a tunnel junction (n+p+), an electrically advantageous n-n+p+-p-i-n configuration can be built that also may beneficially influence other structural elements (e.g. in the form of a &quot;Buried Tunnel Junction&quot; (BTJ)).
; Tunable VCSELs with micromechanically movable mirrors (MEMS) : (either optically or electrically pumped )
; Wafer-bonded or wafer-fused VCSEL: Combination of semiconductor materials that can be fabricated using different types of substrate wafers
; Monolithically optically pumped VCSELs : Two VCSELs on top of each other. One of them optically pumps the other one.
; VCSEL with longitudinally integrated monitor diode : A photodiode is integrated under the back mirror of the VCSEL. VCSEL with transversally integrated monitor diode: With suitable etching of the VCSEL&#x27;s wafer, a resonant photodiode can be manufactured that may measure the light intensity of a neighboring VCSEL.
; VCSELs with external cavities (VECSELs) : VECSELs are optically pumped with conventional laser diodes. This arrangement allows a larger area of the device to be pumped and therefore more power can be extracted – as much as 30 W. The external cavity also allows intracavity techniques such as frequency doubling, single frequency operation and femtosecond pulse modelocking.

;Vertical-cavity semiconductor optical amplifiers: VCSOAs are optimized as amplifiers as opposed to oscillators. VCSOAs must be operated below threshold and thus require reduced mirror reflectivities for decreased feedback. In order to maximize the signal gain, these devices contain a large number of quantum wells (optically pumped devices have been demonstrated with 21–28 wells) and as a result exhibit single-pass gain values which are significantly larger than that of a typical VCSEL (roughly 5%). These structures operate as narrow linewidth (tens of GHz) amplifiers and may be implemented as amplifying filters.

== Characteristics ==
Because VCSELs emit from the top surface of the chip, they can be tested &quot;on-wafer&quot;, before they are cleaved into individual devices. This reduces the fabrication cost of the devices. It also allows VCSELs to be built not only in one-dimensional, but also in two-dimensional &quot;arrays&quot;.

The larger output aperture of VCSELs, compared to most edge-emitting lasers, produces a lower divergence angle of the output beam, and makes possible high coupling efficiency with optical fibers.

The small active region, compared to edge-emitting lasers, reduces the threshold current of VCSELs, resulting in low power consumption. However, as yet, VCSELs have lower emission power compared to edge-emitting lasers. The low threshold current also permits high intrinsic modulation bandwidths in VCSELs.

The wavelength of VCSELs may be tuned, within the gain band of the active region, by adjusting the thickness of the reflector layers.

While early VCSELs emitted in multiple longitudinal modes or in filament modes, single-mode VCSELs are now common.

=== High-power VCSELs ===
High-power vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers can also be fabricated, either by increasing the emitting aperture size of a single device or by combining several elements into large two-dimensional (2D) arrays. There have been relatively few reported studies on high-power VCSELs. Large-aperture single devices operating around 100 mW were first reported in 1993. Improvements in the epitaxial growth, processing, device design, and packaging led to individual large-aperture VCSELs emitting several hundreds of milliwatts by 1998. More than 2 W continuous-wave (CW) operation at -10 degrees Celsius heat-sink temperature was also reported in 1998 from a VCSEL array consisting of 1,000 elements, corresponding to a power density of 30 W/cm2. In 2001, more than 1 W CW power and 10 W pulsed power at room temperature were reported from a 19-element array. The VCSEL array chip was mounted on a diamond heat spreader, taking advantage of diamond’s very high thermal conductivity. A record 3 W CW output power was reported in 2005 from large diameter single devices emitting around 980 nm.

In 2007, more than 200 W of CW output power was reported from a large (5 × 5mm) 2D VCSEL array emitting around the 976 nm wavelength, representing a substantial breakthrough in the field of high-power VCSELs. The high power level achieved was mostly due to improvements in wall-plug efficiency and packaging. In 2009, &gt;100 W power levels were reported for VCSEL arrays emitting around 808 nm.

At that point, the VCSEL technology became useful for a variety of medical, industrial, and military applications requiring high power or high energy. Examples of such applications are: 
* Medical/cosmetics: laser hair removal, laser wrinkle removal
* Infrared illuminators for military/surveillance
* Pumping of solid-state lasers and fiber lasers
* High-power/high-energy second harmonic generation (blue/green light)
* Laser machining: laser cutting, laser drilling, laser ablation, laser engraving

== Applications ==
* Optical fiber data transmission
* Analog broadband signal transmission
* Absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS)
* Laser printers
* Computer mouse
* Biological tissue analysis
* Chip scale atomic clock
* Lidar for cellphone cameras
* Structured light (e.g. the &quot;dot projector&quot; for iPhone Face ID)
* Lidar for automobile collision avoidance

== History ==
The surface emission from a bulk semiconductor at ultra-low temperature and magnetic carrier confinement was reported by Ivars Melngailis in 1965. The first proposal of short cavity VCSEL was done by Kenichi Iga of Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1977. A simple drawing of his idea is shown in his research note. Contrary to the conventional Fabry-Perot edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, his invention comprises a short laser cavity less than 1/10 of the edge-emitting lasers vertical to a wafer surface. In 1979, a first demonstration on a short cavity VCSEL was done by Soda, Iga, Kitahara and Suematsu, but devices for CW operation at room temperature were not reported until 1988. The term VCSEL was coined in a publication of the Optical Society of America in 1987. In 1989, Jack Jewell led a Bell Labs / Bellcore collaboration (including Axel Scherer, Sam McCall, Yong Hee Lee and James Harbison) that demonstrated over 1 million VCSELs on a small chip. These first all-semiconductor VCSELs introduced other design features still used in all commercial VCSELs. &quot;This demonstration marked a turning point in the development of the surface-emitting laser. Several more research groups entered the field, and many important innovations were soon being reported from all over the world&quot;. Andrew Yang of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) quickly initiated significant funding toward VCSEL R&amp;D, followed by other government and industrial funding efforts. VCSELs replaced edge-emitting lasers in applications for short-range fiberoptic communication such as Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel, and are now used for link bandwidths from 1 to 400 gigabits per second or greater.

<doc id="436718" wikidata="Q4927494" url="?curid=436718" title="BlooP and FlooP">
<text>and (Bounded loop and Free loop) are simple programming languages designed by Douglas Hofstadter to illustrate a point in his book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;. BlooP is a Turing-incomplete programming language whose main control flow structure is a bounded loop (i.e. recursion is not permitted). All programs in the language must terminate, and this language can only express primitive recursive functions.

FlooP is identical to BlooP except that it supports unbounded loops; it is a Turing-complete language and can express all computable functions. For example, it can express the Ackermann function, which (not being primitive recursive) cannot be written in BlooP. Borrowing from standard terminology in mathematical logic, Hofstadter calls FlooP&#x27;s unbounded loops MU-loops. Like all Turing-complete programming languages, FlooP suffers from the halting problem: programs might not terminate, and it is not possible, in general, to decide which programs do.

BlooP and FlooP can be regarded as models of computation, and have sometimes been used in teaching computability.

==BlooP examples==

The only variables are codice_1 (the return value of the procedure) and codice_2 (an unbounded sequence of natural-number variables, indexed by constants, as in the Unlimited Register Machine). The only operators are codice_3 (assignment), codice_4 (addition), codice_5 (multiplication), codice_6 (less-than), codice_7 (greater-than) and codice_8 (equals).

Each program uses only a finite number of cells, but the numbers in the cells can be arbitrarily large. Data structures such as lists or stacks can be handled by interpreting the number in a cell in specific ways, that is, by Gödel numbering the possible structures.

Control flow constructs include bounded loops, conditional statements, codice_9 jumps out of loops, and codice_10 jumps out of blocks. BlooP does not permit recursion, unrestricted jumps, or anything else that would have the same effect as the unbounded loops of FlooP. Named procedures can be defined, but these can call only previously defined procedures.

=== Factorial function ===
=== Subtraction function ===
This is not a built-in operation and (being defined on natural numbers) never gives a negative result (e.g. 2 − 3 := 0). Note that codice_1 starts at 0, like all the codice_12s, and therefore requires no initialization.

==FlooP example==

The example below, which implements the Ackermann function, relies on simulating a stack using Gödel numbering: that is, on previously defined numerical functions codice_13, codice_14, and codice_15 satisfying codice_16, codice_17, and codice_18. Since an unbounded codice_19 is used, this is not a legal BlooP program. The codice_20 instructions in this case jump to the end of the block and repeat the loop, unlike the codice_9, which exits the loop.

<doc id="436728" wikidata="Q592333" url="?curid=436728" title="Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy">
<text>Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS, sometimes referred to as TDLS, TLS or TLAS) is a technique for measuring the concentration of certain species such as methane, water vapor and many more, in a gaseous mixture using tunable diode lasers and laser absorption spectrometry. The advantage of TDLAS over other techniques for concentration measurement is its ability to achieve very low detection limits (of the order of ppb). Apart from concentration, it is also possible to determine the temperature, pressure, velocity and mass flux of the gas under observation. TDLAS is by far the most common laser based absorption technique for quantitative assessments of species in gas phase.

==Working==
A basic TDLAS setup consists of a tunable diode laser light source, transmitting (i.e. beam shaping) optics, optically accessible absorbing medium, receiving optics and detector/s. The emission wavelength of the tunable diode laser, viz. VCSEL, DFB, etc., is tuned over the characteristic absorption lines of a species in the gas in the path of the laser beam. This causes a reduction of the measured signal intensity due to absorption, which can be detected by a photodiode, and then used to determine the gas concentration and other properties as described later.

Different diode lasers are used based on the application and the range over which tuning is to be performed. Typical examples are InGaAsP/InP (tunable over 900 nm to 1.6 μm), InGaAsP/InAsP (tunable over 1.6 μm to 2.2 μm), etc. These lasers can be tuned by either adjusting their temperature or by changing injection current density into the gain medium. While temperature changes allow tuning over 100 cm−1, it is limited by slow tuning rates (a few hertz), due to the thermal inertia of the system. On the other hand, adjusting the injection current can provide tuning at rates as high as ~10 GHz, but it is restricted to a smaller range (about 1 to 2 cm−1) over which the tuning can be performed. The typical laser linewidth is of the order of 10−3 cm−1 or smaller. Additional tuning, and linewidth narrowing, methods include the use of extracavity dispersive optics.

==Basic principles==

=== Concentration measurement ===
The basic principle behind the TDLAS technique is simple. The focus here is on a single absorption line in the absorption spectrum of a particular species of interest. To start, the wavelength of a diode laser is tuned over a particular absorption line of interest and the intensity of the transmitted radiation is measured. The transmitted intensity can be related to the concentration of the species present by the Beer-Lambert law, which states that when a radiation of wavenumber formula_1 passes through an absorbing medium, the intensity variation along the path of the beam is given by,

:formula_2
where,

:formula_3 is the transmitted intensity of the radiation after it has traversed a distance formula_4 through the medium,
:formula_5 is the initial intensity of the radiation,
:formula_6 is the absorbance of the medium,
:formula_7 is the absorption cross-section of the absorbing species,
:formula_8 is the number density of the absorbing species,
:formula_9 is the line strength (i.e. the total absorption per molecule) of the absorbing species at temperature formula_10,
:formula_11 is the lineshape function for the particular absorption line. Sometimes also represented by formula_12,
:formula_13 is the center frequency of the spectrum.

=== Temperature measurement ===
The above relation requires that the temperature formula_14 of the absorbing species is known. However, it is possible to overcome this difficulty and measure the temperature simultaneously. There are number of ways to measure the temperature. A widely applied method, which can measure the temperature simultaneously, uses the fact that the line strength formula_15 is a function of temperature alone. Here two different absorption lines for the same species are probed while sweeping the laser across the absorption spectrum, the ratio of the integrated absorbance, is then a function of temperature alone.

:formula_16
where,

:formula_17 is some reference temperature at which the line strengths are known,
:formula_18 is the difference in the lower energy levels involved in the transitions for the lines being probed.

Another way to measure the temperature is by relating the FWHM of the probed absorption line to the Doppler line width of the species at that temperature. This is given by,

:formula_19
where,
:formula_20 is the weight of one molecule of the species, and
:formula_21 is the molecular weight of the species.
Note: In the last expression, formula_22 is in kelvins and formula_21 is in g/mol.
However, this method can be used, only when the gas pressure is low (of the order of few mbar). At higher pressures (tens of millibars or more), pressure or collisional broadening becomes important and the lineshape is no longer a function of temperature alone.

=== Velocity measurement ===
The effect of a mean flow of the gas in the path of the laser beam can be seen as a shift in the absorption spectrum, also known as Doppler shift. The shift in the frequency spectrum is related to the mean flow velocity by,

:formula_24
where,

:formula_25 is the angle between the flow direction and the laser beam direction.
Note : formula_26 is not the same as the one mentioned before where it refers to the width of the spectrum. The shift is usually very small (3×10−5 cm−1 ms−1 for near-IR diode laser) and the shift-to-width ratio is of the order of 10−4.

==Limitations and means of improvement==
The main disadvantage of absorption spectrometry (AS) as well as laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) in general is that it relies on a measurement of a small change of a signal on top of a large background. Any noise introduced by the light source or the optical system will deteriorate the detectability of the technique. The sensitivity of direct absorption techniques is therefore often limited to an absorbance of ~10−3, far away from the shot noise level, which for single pass direct AS (DAS) is in the 10−7 – 10−8 range. Since this is insufficient for many types of applications, AS is seldom used in its simplest mode of operation.

There are basically two ways to improve on the situation; one is to reduce the noise in the signal, the other is to increase the absorption. The former can be achieved by the use of a modulation technique, whereas the latter can be obtained by placing the gas inside a cavity in which the light passes through the sample several times, thus increasing the interaction length. If the technique is applied to trace species detection, it is also possible to enhance the signal by performing detection at wavelengths where the transitions have larger line strengths, e.g. using fundamental vibrational bands or electronic transitions.

=== Modulation techniques ===
Modulation techniques make use of the fact that technical noise usually decreases with increasing frequency (which is why it is often referred to as 1/f noise) and improve the signal to noise ratio by encoding and detecting the absorption signal at a high frequency, where the noise level is low. The most common modulation techniques are wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) and frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS).

In WMS the wavelength of the light is continuously scanned across the absorption profile, and the signal is detected at a harmonic of the modulation frequency.

In FMS, the light is modulated at a much higher frequency but with a lower modulation index. As a result, a pair of sidebands separated from the carrier by the modulation frequency appears, giving rise to a so-called FM-triplet. The signal at the modulation frequency is a sum of the beat signals of the carrier with each of the two sidebands. Since these two sidebands are fully out of phase with each other, the two beat signals cancel in the absence of absorbers. However, an alteration of any of the sidebands, either by absorption or dispersion, or a phase shift of the carrier, will give rise to an unbalance between the two beat signals, and therefore a net-signal.

Although in theory baseline-free, both modulation techniques are usually limited by residual amplitude modulation (RAM), either from the laser or from multiple reflections in the optical system (etalon effects). If these noise contributions are held low, the sensitivity can be brought into the 10−5 – 10−6 range or even better.

In general the absorption imprints are generated by a straight line light propagation through a volume with the specific gas. To further enhance the signal, the pathway of the light travel can be increased with multi-pass cells. There is however a variety of the WMS-technique that utilizes the narrow line absorption from gases for sensing even when the gases are situated in closed compartments (e.g. pores) inside solid materia. The technique is referred to as gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy (GASMAS).

=== Cavity-enhanced absorption spectrometry (CEAS) ===
The second way of improving the detectability of TDLAS technique is to extend the interaction length. This can be obtained by placing the species inside a cavity in which the light bounces back and forth many times, whereby the interaction length can be increased considerably. This has led to a group of techniques denoted as cavity enhanced AS (CEAS). The cavity can either be placed inside the laser, giving rise to intracavity AS, or outside, when it is referred to as an external cavity. Although the former technique can provide a high sensitivity, its practical applicability is limited because of all the non-linear processes involved.

External cavities can either be of multi-pass type, i.e. Herriott or White cells, of non- resonant type (off-axis alignment), or of resonant type, most often working as a Fabry–Pérot (FP) etalon. Multi-pass cells, which typically can provide an enhanced interaction length of up to ~2 orders of magnitude, are nowaday common together with TDLAS.

Resonant cavities can provide a much larger path length enhancement, in the order of the finesse of the cavity, &quot;F&quot;, which for a balanced cavity with high reflecting mirrors with reflectivities of ~99.99–99.999% can be ~ 104 to 105. It should be clear that if all this increase in interaction length can be utilized efficiently, this vouches for a significant increase in detectability. A problem with resonant cavities is that a high finesse cavity has very narrow cavity modes, often in the low kHz range (the width of the cavity modes is given by FSR/F, where FSR is the free-spectral range of the cavity, which is given by &quot;c&quot;/2&quot;L&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light and &quot;L&quot; is the cavity length). Since cw lasers often have free-running linewidths in the MHz range, and pulsed even larger, it is non-trivial to couple laser light effectively into a high finesse cavity.

The most important resonant CEAS techniques are cavity ring-down spectrometry (CRDS), integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) or cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS), phase-shift cavity ring-down spectroscopy (PS-CRDS) and Continuous wave Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectrometry (cw-CEAS), either with optical locking, referred to as (OF-CEAS), as has been demonstrated Romanini et al. or by electronic locking., as for example is done in the Noise-Immune Cavity-Enhanced Optical-Heterodyne Molecular Spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS) technique. or combination of frequency modulation and optical feedback locking CEAS, referred to as (FM-OF-CEAS).

The most important non-resonant CEAS techniques are off-axis ICOS (OA-ICOS) or off-axis CEAS (OA-CEAS), wavelength modulation off-axis CEAS (WM-OA-CEAS), off-axis phase-shift cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (off-axis PS-CEAS).

These resonant and non-resonant cavity enhanced absorption techniques have so far not been used that frequently with TDLAS. However, since the field is developing fast, they will presumably be more used with TDLAS in the future.

==Applications==
Freeze-drying (lyophilization) cycle development and optimization for pharmaceuticals.

Flow diagnostics in hypersonic/re-entry speed research facilities and scramjet combustors.

Oxygen tunable diode laser spectrometers play an important role in safety applications in a wide range of industrial processes, for this reason, TDLS are often an integral part of modern chemical plants. The fast response time compared to other technologies for measuring gas composition, and the immunity to many background gasses and environmental conditions makes TDL technology a commonly selected technology for monitoring of combustible gasses in process environments. This technology is employed on flares, in vessel headspace and in other locations where explosive atmospheres must be prevented from forming. According to a 2018 research study, TDL technology is the 4th most commonly selected technology for gas analysis in Chemical Processing.

<text>Firelord (Pyreus Kril) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==

Firelord first appears in Thor #225 (July 1974) and was created by writer Gerry Conway and penciler John Buscema.

==Fictional character biography==
Pyreus Kril is a Xandarian who was born on the planet Xandar, in the Andromeda Galaxy. He is a graduate of the Nova Corps Academy, the military and exploratory force of the planet Xandar. During his commission, he served aboard a Xandarian ship under the command of Gabriel Lan. Gabriel and Pyreus became friends, until Gabriel was abducted by the cosmic entity Galactus and transformed into his herald, the Air-Walker. Pyreus assumes command as captain and begins an obsessive search for Gabriel. Pyreus eventually locates Galactus&#x27; vessel and confronts the entity, only to discover that Gabriel was killed in combat. Galactus tells this to Pyreus only after he agrees to serve him as his latest herald.

Pyreus is then transformed into Firelord, and after a period of servitude asked for his freedom. Galactus agrees on the condition that Firelord first find a replacement. Firelord travels to Earth and after an encounter with the Thunder God Thor and Hercules is freed when Thor presents Galactus with the armor of the Asgardian Destroyer to animate and use as a herald. After aiding Thor on several occasions, Firelord returns to deep space. He returns months later with the Shi&#x27;ar agent Erik the Red, who tricks Firelord into battling the X-Men.

Several years later Firelord discovers that Thor has battled a robot replica of the Air-Walker, and after revealing the origin of the two heralds to Thor returns to space with the remains of the android. Firelord later encounters Spider-Man in a fight - albeit one provoked by humans who drove Firelord into a temper because they believed that he was a mutant - but he was defeated due to Spider-Man&#x27;s hit-and-run approach serving as an effective counter to Firelord&#x27;s raw power. Firelord also meets the Avengers, and assists them against the space-pirate Nebula. Firelord has since aided his fellow herald Silver Surfer on a number of occasions, particularly against Morg. Firelord assisted Thor in his battle against Thanos and his thrall Mangog. Firelord and Air-Walker also helped Nova and the New Warriors fight the Xandarian villain Supernova.

===Annihilation===

Firelord battles the Annihilation Wave alongside his fellow heralds, including Red Shift and Stardust. Although wounded at one point, Firelord recovers and seeks vengeance against the remnants of the forces of Annihilus for destroying Xandar.

==Powers and abilities==
Pyreus Kril was a normal Xandarian man until transformed by Galactus. Given mastery over the cosmic flame, Firelord wields a flaming staff and can project energy from his eyes and staff. Like all heralds, the Power Cosmic provides Firelord with superhuman strength, reflexes and durability, flight, mastery of the electromagnetic spectrum and total immunity to the rigors of space. Firelord is also capable of travelling faster than the speed of light.

Pyreus Kril graduated from the Xandarian Nova Corps Academy, and in addition to a thorough knowledge of combat has knowledge of advanced alien technology and space navigation.

==Other versions==

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In the 31st century of Earth-691, Firelord is an ally of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He is known as &quot;Protector of the Universe&quot;, but does not wear the Quantum Bands traditionally assigned to the role. He soon joins the sub-group, the Galactic Guardians.

===Heroes Reborn===
Firelord serves Galactus alongside his fellow heralds, with the entire group being worshipped by the Inhumans.

===Marvel Zombies 2===
A zombified alternate universe variant of Firelord from Earth-2149 appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies 2&quot;.

<doc id="436740" wikidata="Q4036419" url="?curid=436740" title="ColorForth">
<text>colorForth is a programming language from the Forth language&#x27;s creator, Charles H. Moore, developed in the 1990s. The language combines elements of Moore&#x27;s earlier Forth systems and adds color as a way of indicating how words should be interpreted. Program text is tokenized as it is edited; the compiler operates on the tokenized form, so there is less work at compile time.

colorForth is an idiosyncratic programming environment: the colors simplify Forth&#x27;s semantics, speed compiling, and are said to aid Moore&#x27;s own poor eyesight: colorForth uses different colors in its source code (replacing some of the punctuation in standard Forth) to determine how different words are treated.

colorForth was originally developed as the scripting language for Moore&#x27;s own VLSI CAD program, OKAD, with which he develops custom Forth processors. As the language gained utility, he rewrote his CAD program in it, spruced up the environment, and released it to the public. It has since gained a small following, spurred much debate in the Forth community, and sprung offshoots for other processors and operating environments. The language&#x27;s roots are closer to the Forth machine languages Moore develops for his processors than to the mainstream standardized Forths in more widespread use.

The language comes with its own tiny (63 KB) operating system. Practically everything is stored as source code and compiled when needed. The current colorForth environment is limited to running on Pentium-grade PCs with limited support for lowest-common-denominator motherboards, AGP video, disk, and network hardware.

Coloring in colorForth has semantic meaning. Red words start a definition, and green words are compiled into the current definition. Thus, colorForth would be written in standard Forth as
 : color forth ;

Yellow words are executed. The transition from green to yellow and back again can be used while defining words, to transition between compiling words into the current definition, executing words immediately (manipulating the data stack during compilation), and back again (adding the top of the data stack to the current definition) in other words, precomputing a value during compilation (a functionality that other languages use macros or optimizing compilers for).

Moore developed Forth in the early 1970s and created a series of implementations of the language. In the 1980s he diverged from the standardization of the language, instead continuing to evolve it. He developed a series of Forth-like languages, each extreme in its simplicity: Machine Forth, OKAD, and colorForth.

Moore has stated that color is only one option for displaying the language. One of Moore&#x27;s papers on colorForth was printed in black and white but used italics and other typographical conventions to present source code.

 refers to demons in the religious sense (). It is therefore used to refer to demons in the sense of both Buddhist and Christian scripture, and to truly evil spiritual entities.

While (), (), (), () are used loosely and interchangeably to refer to malevolent supernatural beings in literature, it is also clear that the characters have different specific connotations, as follows:

* (demons) can be distinguished from yaoguai (goblins, sprites), which refer to folkoric supernatural beings associated with abnormal phenomena (), and who are more akin in their nature and quality to the unseelie fae of European folklore. 
* (demons) can be distinguished from gui 鬼 (ghosts), which in the usual sense refers primarily to souls of departed beings (). 
* refers to any strange phenomenon () and can encompass both () and (), in addition to other aberrant beings, including mutants.

<text>Lake Strom Thurmond, officially designated J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir at the federal level, and Clarks Hill Lake by the state of Georgia, is a man-made reservoir at the border between the U.S. states of Georgia and South Carolina in the Savannah River Basin.

==Description==

The reservoir was created by the J. Strom Thurmond Dam during 1951 and 1952 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers near the confluence of the Little River and the Savannah River. At , it is the third-largest artificial lake east of the Mississippi River, behind the Kentucky Lake on the Tennessee River and Lake Marion on the Santee River. The J. Strom Thurmond Dam is located upstream from Augusta, Georgia.

The Thurmond Lake is one of the Southeast&#x27;s largest and most popular public recreation lakes. The dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1946 and 1954, but the lake was filled during 1951 and 1952 as part of a flood control, hydropower, and navigation project. Its legally authorized purposes now include recreation, water quality, water supply, and fish and wildlife management. Each year, millions of people use the many public parks, marinas, and campgrounds conveniently located around Thurmond Lake for a variety of outdoor recreational experiences, making it one of the 10 most visited Corps lakes in the nation.

Thurmond Lake is a man-made lake bordering Georgia and South Carolina on the Savannah, Broad, and Little Rivers. The lake is created by the J. Strom Thurmond Dam located on the Savannah River above Augusta, Georgia and above the mouth of the Savannah River. The lake extends up the Savannah River, up the Little River in Georgia, and up the Broad River in Georgia, and up the Little River in South Carolina, at normal pool elevation of 330 mean sea level, Thurmond Lake comprises nearly 71,100 acres (287 km2) of water with a shoreline of . The entire Thurmond &quot;project&quot; contains 151,000 acres (611 km2) of land and water.

J. Strom Thurmond Lake and Dam is the first Corps of Engineers project to be built in the Savannah River Basin. Hartwell Lake and Dam the second project built in the basin was completed in 1963, and a third project, Richard B. Russell Lake and Dam was completed in 1985. Together these three lakes form a chain of lakes that is long. Congress authorized Thurmond Lake in 1944 and construction began in 1946. The project was completed in 1954 at a cost of $79 million.

==History==
Due to a clerical error in the original Congressional Authorization, the project was officially authorized to build &quot;Clark Hill Dam&quot;, creating &quot;Clark Hill Lake&quot;, with the &quot;s&quot; at the end of &quot;Clarks&quot; accidentally omitted. The authorization document outlined the plan of development for the basin with authorized purposes of power production, incidental flood control, and navigation. Later, recreation, water quality, water supply, and fish and wildlife management were added as authorized purposes. Twenty-six years after the construction of the dam, both the dam and lake were renamed to &quot;Clarks Hill Dam&quot; and &quot;Clarks Hill Lake&quot;, respectively, in legislation sponsored by Strom Thurmond.

The 1966 Flood Control Act authorized the building of Trotters Shoals Lake and Dam on the Savannah River between Clarks Hill Lake and Hartwell Lake. This lake was later renamed to commemorate a late senator from Georgia, Richard B. Russell, who was an important supporter of building dams on the river. This created a movement to rename Clarks Hill Lake after J. Strom Thurmond, the longest-serving senator in US history, who was from Edgefield on the South Carolina side of the lake. This movement gained support due to the senator&#x27;s popularity in the area, and in 1988 the project was congressionally renamed &quot;J. Strom Thurmond Dam and Lake at Clarks Hill.&quot;

==Renaming of lake==
Until 1987, the lake was called Clarks Hill Lake after the nearby South Carolina town of Clarks Hill named for Augusta businessman John Mulford Clark (1813–1880). (See &quot;Years Gone By: Information on the Origin of the Names Clarks Hill,&quot; Reservoirs—Clarks II Subjects, DOC-1991, Georgia Archives, Morrow.) On December 3, 1987, two days before long-time South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 85th birthday, Representative Butler Derrick of South Carolina introduced a bill before Congress to rename the lake after Thurmond.

The bill quickly passed through Congress and was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on December 23, 1987. Many residents of both states were upset by the sudden change of name of the lake and the dam, which had not been open to public comment. In response, a group of Georgia legislators, led by Representative Doug Barnard, Jr. (who was the only Georgia co-sponsor of the original 1987 bill) introduced a federal bill to rename the lake as &quot;Clarks Hill&quot; once again. That bill, however, was unsuccessful, and the name remained unchanged.

On April 4, 1989, the State of Georgia legislature passed House Resolution No. 115 making &quot;Clarks Hill&quot; the official state name for both the dam and associated reservoir. Accordingly, Georgia&#x27;s state map still refers to the lake as Clarks Hill. Many residents of Georgia as well as South Carolina still refer to the lake by its original name.

<text>Poreč (; ; ; or ; ) is a town and municipality on the western coast of the Istrian peninsula, in Istria County, west Croatia. Its major landmark is the 6th-century Euphrasian Basilica, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

The town is almost 2,000 years old, and is set around a harbour protected from the sea by the small island of Sveti Nikola. Its population of approximately 12,000 resides mostly on the outskirts, while the wider Poreč area has a population of approximately 16,600 inhabitants. The municipal area covers , with the long shoreline stretching from the Mirna River near Novigrad (Cittanova) to Funtana (Fontane) and Vrsar (Orsera) in the south. Ever since the 1970s, the coast of Poreč and neighboring Rovinj (Rovigno) has been the most visited tourist destination in Croatia. 

==History==

===Roman period===
During the 2nd century BC, a Roman castrum was built on a tiny peninsula with approximate dimensions of where the town centre is now. During the reign of Emperor Augustus in the 1st century BC, it officially became a city and was part of the Roman colony of &quot;Colonia Iulia Parentium&quot;.

In the 3rd century the settlement had an organised Christian community with an early-Christian complex of sacral buildings. The earliest basilica contained the remains of and was dedicated to Saint Maurus of Parentium and dates back to the second half of the 4th century. The floor mosaic from its oratory, originally part of a large Roman house, is still preserved in the garden of the Euphrasian Basilica.

===Middle Ages===
With the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, different rulers and powers governed. First, it was held by the Ostrogoths and after 539 was part of the Byzantine Empire. From 788 it was ruled by the Franks. A short independence period followed in the 12th century and later it was ruled by the Patriarchate of Aquileia. In 1267 Parenzo became the first Istrian city that chose to become part of the Republic of Venice, whose rule lasted for more than five centuries. During this period several palaces, squares and religious buildings in Venetian style were built. In 1354 the city was destroyed by the Genoese. In 1363 the town was given the City Statute.

===Modern period===
The population was decimated by plague at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century. After the fall of the Venetian Republic, Parenzo came under the sovereignty of the Habsburg monarchy.

Between 1805 and 1814, Parenzo was part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and then of the Illyrian Provinces, nominally part of the First French Empire. After this period it was again annexed by the Habsburgs, with the Monarchy reorganized into the Austrian Empire. In 1844 a steamship connection was established between Parenzo and Trieste.

In 1861, under Austrian Littoral Parenzo became the seat of the regional Parliament, with schools, administrative and judiciary offices, and other services. During this time, it slowly became a shipbuilding center. It also became a popular tourist resort for the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy. Between 1902 and 1935 the Parenzana (from the name &#x27;Parenzaner Bahn&#x27;), a narrow-gauge railway line connected the town to Trieste.

After 1918, it became part of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1944, the city was bombed by the Allies 34 times, damaging 75% of the city.

====Yugoslav period (1945/47-1991)====
In 1947, two years after World War II, it was occupied by Yugoslavia and the city name was changed into Poreč. The Italian population left the city and was replaced by Slavic people from different regions of Yugoslavia.

From 1945 to 1991, Poreč was a city of Croatia, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

====Independent Croatia (since 1991)====
In 1991 Croatia became an independent state. Today, the city&#x27;s Italian name () is also used in an official capacity.
==Climate==

Situated on the western coast of Istria and cooled by sea breezes, the local climate is relatively mild and free of oppressive summer heat. The month of July is the hottest, with a maximum air temperature of 30°C in conditions of low humidity, while January is the coldest with an average of . There are more than 2,400 hours of sun a year, an average of more than 10 hours of sunshine during the summer days. Sea temperatures can reach , higher than one might expect compared to the coast of southern Croatia where the air temperatures are higher. The average annual rainfall of is more or less equally distributed throughout the year, although July and August are very dry. Winds here are the &quot;Bora&quot;, bringing the cold, clear weather from the north in the winter, and the &quot;Jugo&quot;, a warm southern wind bringing rain. The summer breeze that blows from the sea to the land is called the &quot;Maestral&quot;.

==Nearby sightseeing sites==

The Baredine Cave, the only open geological monument in Istria, is in the vicinity. Stalagmites in the cave are known for their curious shapes. One is said to resemble the Virgin Mary, another the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

Lim Bay is a 12-km long estuary with the aspect of a narrow canal, created by the river Pazinčica by eroding the ground on its way to the Adriatic Sea. Quartz boulders are occasionally found here, exposed by the sea.

==Vegetation and agriculture==
The landscape is rich in Mediterranean vegetation, with pine woods and green bushes, mostly of the holm oak and strawberry tree. For generations, the fertile blood-red land () has been used for agriculture, with cereals, orchards, olive groves and vegetables the main crops. Today the production of organic food is significant, including olives, grapes, and popular wines such as Malvazija, Borgonja, Merlot, Pinot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Teran.

== Transportation ==

Road traffic is the primary form of transportation. Poreč is well-connected with the rest of Istria and with larger cities such as Trieste, Rijeka (Fiume), Ljubljana and Zagreb. The nearest commercial airport is in Pula (Pola). Sea traffic is less important today than it was in previous centuries; these days it is primarily used for tourist excursions. The closest railway station is in Pazin (Pisino), which is the seat of the Istria County local authority. Between 1902 and 1937 the Parenzana, a narrow-gauge railway line connected the town to Trieste.

== Economy ==
Traditionally, economic activities have always been connected with the land and sea. The only significant industry in the area is food processing, but Croatia&#x27;s ongoing integration into the broader European economy has led to Poreč seeing growth in its trade, finance and communication sectors. However, the primary source of income is tourism.

Real estate prices are very high due to the city&#x27;s prime location.

A few houses from the Romanesque period have been preserved and beautiful Venetian Gothic palaces can be seen here. Originally a Gothic Franciscan church built in the 13th century, the &#x27;Dieta Istriana&#x27; hall was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century.

The Euphrasian Basilica, rebuilt in the 6th century under the Byzantine Empire and bishop Euphrasius, is the most important historical site in Parenzo. It is a protected World Heritage Site, so designated by UNESCO in 1997.
Between the 12th and 19th centuries, the city had defensive walls, as the better-known Dubrovnik still does today.

Porec also has one of the smallest streets in Europe the Ulica Stjepana Konzula Istranina.

==Tourism==
In 1844, the Austrian Lloyd steamship company opened a tourist line which called at Parenzo. The first tourist guide describing and depicting the town was printed as early as 1845. The oldest hotel is the Riviera, constructed in 1910. Later came the Parentino and others.

Today, tourist infrastructure is intentionally dispersed along the long coastline, between the Mirna River and the deep Lim valley. The south hosts self-contained centres like Plava Laguna (&quot;Blue Lagoon&quot;), Zelena Laguna (&quot;Green Lagoon&quot;), Bijela Uvala (&quot;White Cove&quot;) and Brulo. To the north, mirroring centres are Materada, Červar Porat, Ulika and Lanterna. In the high season, the area&#x27;s temporary population can exceed 120,000.

Poreč&#x27;s heritage can be seen in the historic town centre, in museums and galleries hosted in houses and palaces, many of them still private homes as they have been for centuries. In the off season, weekend visitors from Croatia, Slovenia, Austria and Italy visit the area. Sports complexes are developed and used year-round.

<doc id="436768" wikidata="Q504669" url="?curid=436768" title="Andrew File System">
<text>The Andrew File System (AFS) is a distributed file system which uses a set of trusted servers to present a homogeneous, location-transparent file name space to all the client workstations. It was developed by Carnegie Mellon University as part of the Andrew Project. Originally named &quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;Andrew&quot; refers to Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon. Its primary use is in distributed computing.

== Features ==

AFS has several benefits over traditional networked file systems, particularly in the areas of security and scalability. One enterprise AFS deployment at Morgan Stanley exceeds 25,000 clients. AFS uses Kerberos for authentication, and implements access control lists on directories for users and groups. Each client caches files on the local filesystem for increased speed on subsequent requests for the same file. This also allows limited filesystem access in the event of a server crash or a network outage.

AFS uses the weak consistency model. Read and write operations on an open file are directed only to the locally cached copy. When a modified file is closed, the changed portions are copied back to the file server. Cache consistency is maintained by callback mechanism. When a file is cached, the server makes a note of this and promises to inform the client if the file is updated by someone else. Callbacks are discarded and must be re-established after any client, server, or network failure, including a timeout. Re-establishing a callback involves a status check and does not require re-reading the file itself.

A consequence of the file locking strategy is that AFS does not support large shared databases or record updating within files shared between client systems. This was a deliberate design decision based on the perceived needs of the university computing environment. For example, in the original email system for the Andrew Project, the Andrew Message System, a single file per message is used, like maildir, rather than a single file per mailbox, like mbox. See AFS and buffered I/O Problems for handling shared databases.

A significant feature of AFS is the volume, a tree of files, sub-directories and AFS mountpoints (links to other AFS volumes). Volumes are created by administrators and linked at a specific named path in an AFS cell. Once created, users of the filesystem may create directories and
files as usual without concern for the physical location of the volume. A volume may have a quota assigned to it in order to limit the amount of space consumed. As needed, AFS administrators can move that volume to another server and disk location without the need to notify users; the operation can even occur while files in that volume are being used.

AFS volumes can be replicated to read-only cloned copies. When accessing files in a read-only volume, a client system will retrieve data from a particular read-only copy. If at some point, that copy becomes unavailable, clients will look for any of the remaining copies. Again, users of that data are unaware of the location of the read-only copy; administrators can create and relocate such copies as needed. The AFS command suite guarantees that all read-only volumes contain exact copies of the original read-write volume at the time the read-only copy was created.

The file name space on an Andrew workstation is partitioned into a &quot;shared&quot; and &quot;local&quot; name space. The shared name space (usually mounted as /afs on the Unix filesystem) is identical on all workstations. The local name space is unique to each workstation. It only contains temporary files needed for workstation initialization and symbolic links to files in the shared name space.

The Andrew File System heavily influenced Version 4 of Sun Microsystems&#x27; popular Network File System (NFS). Additionally, a variant of AFS, the DCE Distributed File System (DFS) was adopted by the Open Software Foundation in 1989 as part of their Distributed Computing Environment. Finally AFS (version two) was the predecessor of the Coda file system.

== Implementations ==

Besides the original, a few other implementations were developed. OpenAFS was built from source released by Transarc (IBM) in 2000. Transarc software became deprecated and lost support.
Arla was an independent implementation of AFS developed at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

A fourth implementation of an AFS client exists in the Linux kernel source code since at least version 2.6.10. Committed by Red Hat, this is a fairly simple implementation still incomplete .

== Available permissions ==

The following Access Control List (ACL) permissions can be granted:

;Lookup (l)
:allows a user to list the contents of the AFS directory, examine the ACL associated with the directory and access subdirectories.
;Insert (i)
:allows a user to add new files or subdirectories to the directory.
;Delete (d)
:allows a user to remove files and subdirectories from the directory.
;Administer (a)
:allows a user to change the ACL for the directory. Users always have this right on their home directory, even if they accidentally remove themselves from the ACL.

Permissions that affect files and subdirectories include:

;Read (r)
:allows a user to look at the contents of files in a directory and list files in subdirectories. Files that are to be granted read access to any user, including the owner, need to have the standard UNIX &quot;owner read&quot; permission set.
;Write (w)
:allows a user to modify files in a directory. Files that are to be granted write access to any user, including the owner, need to have the standard UNIX &quot;owner write&quot; permission set.
;Lock (k)
:allows the processor to run programs that need to &quot;flock&quot; files in the directory.

Additionally, AFS includes Application ACLs (A)-(H) which have no effect on access to files.

<text>Maynooth University (MU) (), is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland. Maynooth University was formerly know as National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM; ). It was Ireland&#x27;s youngest university until Technological University Dublin was established in 2019, having been founded by the Universities Act, 1997, from the secular faculties of the now separate St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, which was founded in 1795. Maynooth is also the only university town in Ireland, all other Irish universities are based in cities. 
The university consists of two connected campuses: an older southern campus, with 19th-century buildings, shared with St Patrick&#x27;s College, and a modern northern campus, occupying circa .

Over 16,000 students are enrolled in the university, employing over 1,00 staff from over 20 different countries. In 2009, Maynooth University was listed as a Top500 university in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;-QS World University Rankings. In 2008, it was named &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; &#x27;University of the Year&#x27;.

In 2023, Times Higher Education (THE) listed Maynooth University as the Number 1 Young University in Ireland. 

== History ==
=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

The university and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth have a common history from 1795 to 1997. The college in Maynooth was established by the government as a college for Catholic lay and ecclesiastical students in 1795. The lay college was based from 1802 in Riverstown House on the south campus. With the opening of Clongowes Wood, the lay college which had lay trustees was closed in 1817 and it functioned solely as a Catholic seminary for almost 150 years. In 1876 the college became a constituent college of the Catholic University of Ireland, and later offered Royal University of Ireland degrees in arts and science. The Pontifical Charter was granted to the college in 1896.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
The college became a recognised constituent college of the National University of Ireland in 1910. From this time, arts and science degrees were awarded by the National University of Ireland, while the Pontifical University of Maynooth continued to confer its own theology degrees, as these had been prohibited in the Royal University of Ireland, and continued to the National University of Ireland (its successor) until 1997.

In 1966 the college again allowed the entry of lay students; this greatly expanded the college and essentially set the foundation stone for Maynooth University. In 1997 the Universities Act resulted in the transfer of the faculties of arts, Celtic studies, philosophy and science of the &quot;recognised college&quot; of St Patrick&#x27;s College to the new university. The university has also expanded into finance and engineering since its creation in 1997. In 2007 the university added business studies, followed by law in 2008.

Any person who was a student at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, and was conferred with a National University of Ireland degree prior to the creation of the university, is legally considered a graduate of Maynooth University.

In 1994, W. J. Smyth was appointed to the position of Master of St. Patrick&#x27;s College Maynooth (NUI) and in 1997 he became president of MU. In 2004 W. J. Smyth was succeeded by John G. Hughes as president of Maynooth University. Thomas Collins was appointed interim president for 2010–2011, and Philip Nolan served in the role 2011–2021. On 1 October 2021, Finnish academic Eeva Leinonen became the first woman president of the institution.

== Campus ==

The university&#x27;s main campus straddles the main road from Maynooth to Kilcock. It is divided into the North Campus and the South Campus (also referred to by staff and students as the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; campuses respectively). The campuses were connected by means of a footbridge that crossed over the road until mid-2011. The footbridge was then decommissioned due to the construction of a library extension on the South Campus. The campuses are now connected by means of a pedestrian crossing on the Kilcock Road. The campus has four buildings for on-campus accommodation, namely Rye, Village, River, and Courtyard.

=== South Campus ===

The South Campus houses the facilities of St. Patrick&#x27;s College, as well as most of the administrative offices shared between college and university. A number of MU academic departments also have their offices on the South Campus including Law, Mathematics, Music, Geography, Economics and History. The main buildings, most of which were built in the 19th century, are the Aula Maxima; St. Patrick&#x27;s House (including the college chapel); the John Paul II Library (built in 1984). In December 2012 an extension to the John Paul II library was completed. The extension is 6,000m2 and accommodates 1,700 students. New, Dunboyne, Humanity and Stoyte Houses which collectively form St. Joseph&#x27;s Square; Logic House and Rhetoric House.
The first building to be completed on the South Campus was named after its designer, John Stoyte. Stoyte House, still a prominent presence on campus, stands in proximity to Maynooth Castle.
Over a period of 15 years, the site at Maynooth underwent rapid construction so as to cater for the influx of new students, and the buildings which now border St. Joseph&#x27;s Square (to the rear of Stoyte House) were completed by 1824. The university chapel is located on the South Campus, just off St. Joseph&#x27;s Square; masses and choir services are frequently held in the chapel, as is the traditional Christmas carol service. The South Campus also houses the National Science Museum and the Russell Library.

=== North Campus ===
The North Campus was developed far more recently than the South Campus, in the latter half of the 20th century. Here, the main buildings are the Students&#x27; Union building, Sports Complex, Biosciences, and Engineering Building, Callan Science Building (named after the inventor of the induction coil, Nicholas Callan), the Iontas Building, the Arts Building, the Science Building and the John Hume Building. The Eolas Building houses the department of Computer Science, the Business Incubation Centre, the Innovation Value Institute, as well as the Hamilton and Callan Institutes, along with several teaching spaces, while the Technology, Society and Innovation (TSI) Building houses living labs and break out rooms for interactive research; three large theatres of 500, 300 and 250-seat capacity, and research spaces for students, academics and collaboration with industry partners.

The student services function is also based on North Campus, and there are a number of playing fields and a sports complex, which includes a fully equipped gym and an astroturf field. The remainder of MU&#x27;s academic departments, as well as many research institutes such as the Institute of Microelectronics and Wireless Systems, the Hamilton Institute and the Institute of Immunology, are also located on the North Campus.

<doc id="436774" wikidata="Q8024162" url="?curid=436774" title="Windfields Farm (Ontario)">
<text>Windfields Farm was a six square kilometre (1,500 acre) Thoroughbred horse breeding farm that was founded by businessman E. P. Taylor in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.

==Origin==
The first stable and breeding operation of E. P. Taylor originated with a property north of the city of Toronto on Bayview Avenue. Taylor then acquired the Parkwood Stable in Oshawa when it was offered for sale in 1950 by Colonel Sam McLaughlin (of McLaughlin Motor Car Company fame), and he named his new purchase the National Stud Farm. In 1969, the name was changed to Windfields Farm Limited, Oshawa Division. As population growth overtook the operation, it eventually expanded to include a second farm, Windfields Farm (Maryland) in Chesapeake City, Maryland, United States.

==Northern Dancer==

Windfields Farm in Ontario was the birthplace of racing great and champion sire Northern Dancer, winner of the 1964 Kentucky Derby (in stakes record time), the Preakness Stakes, and the Queen&#x27;s Plate. Northern Dancer was retired after the 1964 racing season and started a career at stud in Ontario, before being moved in 1969 to the Maryland farm. Northern Dancer&#x27;s son, the English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky, was also bred by E. P. Taylor at Windfields in Ontario, as was another Northern Dancer colt, the 1977 Epsom Derby winner The Minstrel.

==Decline and closure==
In 1980, E. P. Taylor was incapacitated by a stroke, and his son Charles took over management of Windfields Farm. E.P. Taylor died in 1989 and Charles died in 1997, after which his widow Noreen and sister Judith Taylor Mappin took charge of the business. The Maryland site was sold in 1988, and Roland Farm and the Northview Stallion Station now occupy the land.

The downsizing that began following the death of E. P. Taylor resulted in large portions of Windfields Farm being sold to the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (now Ontario Tech University) and Durham College, which erected sports fields and parking lots on the farm&#x27;s southeast corner. Farmlands on the east side of Simcoe Street became housing developments. By 2008, the once-vast estate (that at its peak was home to more than 600 thoroughbreds) had devolved to just a small private farm.

In November 2009, the Windfields Farm breeding operations were wound up. Its broodmares and weanlings were sent to be auctioned at the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society Winter Mixed Sale, and its remaining bloodstock was sold at the Keeneland Sales in Lexington, Kentucky. Shortly afterwards, the contents of the farm, literally to the bare walls, was auctioned and the property was effectively abandoned.

Already engulfed by urban sprawl, Windfields sold much of the non-core portions of the property to real estate developers for the purpose of residential development. Some of the farm&#x27;s barns, the grave of Northern Dancer, plus a trillium forest where fifteen horses are interred, was reported to be preserved as a commemorative park, but as of the fall of 2012, these plans remained unfulfilled, and the future of the property and its historic structures and graves remained in a state of confusion. It appears that there were no firm plans put in place by the Taylor family, Durham College or UOIT before the final closure of the farm in order to ensure its preservation.

==Post closure==

=== 2009–2012 ===
After the farm&#x27;s closure, the planned preservation failed to materialize. The property, buildings and graves were left instead to fall into a state of decay and disrepair. Pictures began to appear of the grave sites of world-famous Northern Dancer and other notable Windfields horses with tall weeds surrounding them, as well as the historical structures covered in overgrowth. The property and its many buildings had begun falling prey to vandals, the elements, and time.
A small group of supporters who were disappointed in the apparent near-abandonment of the property (and what appeared to be a dismal future for its structures) began to advocate for the property in late 2009, with efforts beginning in earnest in 2010. The media was contacted and several stories were published in both local television and print media during 2010, 2011, and 2012, as well as a feature article in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper entitled &quot;Hero Racehorse Rests Amongst The Weeds&quot;, addressing the dismal condition and lack of respect for the farm and the famous horses interred there – most notably Northern Dancer. In addition, presentations were made to the City of Oshawa Council and a letter-writing campaign was also enacted, all of which served to bring the situation to public awareness.

The negative media attention garnered from the fall 2011 &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article spurred the owners of the &quot;Core&quot; property (Durham College and/or The University Of Ontario Institute of Technology, UOIT) to step up maintenance of the gravesite areas and pledge to better respect the property. They made no other commitments about the property at that time.

=== 2012 ===
In the fall of 2012, the City of Oshawa became an ally to the cause for proper respect for the Windfields Farm property and its legacy. At the behest of the city, UOIT agreed to form a &quot;Community Advisory Group&quot; to allow all interested parties to discuss the future of the farm in detail. The situation began to improve as UOIT began to exhibit a willingness to show the Windfields Farm legacy the respect it deserved. Unfortunately there appeared to be minimal followup from the formation of this group.

=== 2013 ===
During 2013, grounds maintenance was stepped up, including routine grass cutting and a general cleanup of overgrowth in the vicinity of the core buildings. Many repairs and changes were effected to the property and its buildings as well during the 2012 to 2014 period, including the following:

* Several buildings received roofing repairs (including an entire re-shingling of Barn 6) intended to halt water damage, which was causing rapid deterioration of several of the historic structures on the property.
* The heating systems in several of the remaining houses in the vicinity of the core were repaired and returned to service.
* Eaves troughs, lightning rods, and other metalwork on various buildings that had been stolen by scrap metal thieves during previous years were replaced.
* Security patrols were increased dramatically.
* Electricity was restored in many areas.
* Lighting was installed.
* Security cameras were installed in strategic locations around the property.
* Various buildings, the arena, and barns, many of which had been left unsecured for many years, were once again secured.
* Pumping systems that had failed, causing subsequent flooding of some areas, were restored to operational condition.

=== 2014 ===
In the late summer of 2014, the public was once again welcomed to the farm during &quot;Doors Open Oshawa&quot;, a citywide event that allows the public to visit venues which are normally closed to public access. This was the first time since the auction in 2009 that the public was able to legally access and visit the core property area of Windfields Farm in order to see the facilities, its heritage structures, and to pay their respects at the graves of Northern Dancer and the other horses interred at the main grave site. The event was well attended.

The core of the farm showed a dramatic turnaround from previous years, with the grounds (and grave site area) appearing well kept and the repair efforts (basic and otherwise) on the many core buildings being evident to those who had followed their plight. Although many of the buildings still showed areas of concern, it appears the preservation efforts and repairs made to date had at least halted further deterioration of the buildings. During the Doors Open event, it was shared that the university has begun exploratory meetings and discussions with regards to fundraising to allow further repairs to the buildings, barns, and the arena.

=== 2015–present ===
After the &quot;Doors Open&quot; event in 2014 to current day, the current owners of the core of the farm (The University of Ontario Institute of Technology) have taken a much less public approach to the property, having hosted no publicly accessible events since that date, although several private events have taken place. Although photos that have appeared online show that the core of the farm remains well tended and additional structure repairs have occurred, as of January 2018 there still appears to be no firm plans to fulfil many of the earlier promises of public access to the grave sites, and the property is clearly posted as &quot;Private Property&quot; with no public access whatsoever.

In 2016, the city of Oshawa followed up on some earlier plans with a &quot;Proposed Program for Honouring the Windfields Farm Legacy&quot; document detailing some studies funded by an earlier controversial donation of $150,000 by Minto Developments. The results, under the banner &quot;Program for Honouring the Windfields Farm Legacy&quot; were adopted on February 22, 2016, but since this date there has been little news with regards to forward progress on many of the goals.

2022-There are at least 4 plaques explaining about EP, Charles Taylor, Windfield Farms and the horse Cemetery.

These are on the west side of the new subdivision in the naturalized area. The horse cemetery is fenced with a new iron fence, but the grounds are unkept, likely keeping with the naturalization of the area.

== University re-purposing of structures==
Several structures upon the core of the farm have been repurposed for use by Ontario Tech University staff as either office space or storage. There is now increased activity on and around the core of the farm as a result, in addition to a regular security presence.

== TV filming ==
In January 2018, an episode of the television series &quot;Taken&quot; utilized &quot;Barn 2&quot; upon the Windfields core property as a filming location, with the barn and its many stalls taking the place of a jail. Exact filming dates were unclear.

== Former paddock lands development ==
In 2018, development of the majority of what used to be paddocks and open fields to the north of the core of the farm (some ) began on a new residential neighbourhood, with several streets now bordering onto the core of the farm itself. A large retail complex is also planned for the northeast portion of this section of property.

==Burials at Windfields Farm==
A non-exhaustive list of thoroughbred burials at Windfields Farm in Oshawa include:
* Archers Bay (1995–2002)
* Canadiana (1950–1971)
* New Providence (1956–1981)
* Northern Dancer (1961–1990)
* South Ocean (1967–1989)
* Vice Regent (1967–1995)
* Victoria Park (1957–1985)
* Windfields (1943–1969)

Numerous other lesser-known horses are buried at the separate &quot;Trillium&quot; grave site located slightly to the north of the core of the farm. The trillium grave site was afforded protection by the city and will be maintained as an area of importance to the history of Windfields, although its exact integration with the new housing subdivision is unclear to some.

Lesser yet known horses were also commonly buried at various other places on the once vast Windfields property, almost all in unmarked graves.

==Windfields Estate==

Windfields Estate was the home of E. P. Taylor and was situated at 2489 Bayview Avenue in North York, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. It now houses the Canadian Film Centre, founded by filmmaker Norman Jewison. The estate has been preserved as a heritage site.

<text>Henry Suzzallo (August 22, 1875 – September 25, 1933) was the president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926. He later served as director of the National Advisory Committee on Education and president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

== Biography ==
Of Venetian descent, Suzzallo was born in San Jose, California, just after his parents&#x27; emigration from the Dalmatia region of the Austrian Empire. The surname Suzzallo, whose name in the old country had been Zucalo, is also common in Herzegovina and Montenegro. Poor health in his youth resulted in mediocre grades during his primary and secondary education. He graduated from the State Normal School in San Jose (now San José State University), and later Stanford University in 1899. He eventually attended Columbia University Teachers College for graduate school, where he got his master&#x27;s degree in 1902 and his Ph.D. in 1905. His focus was educational sociology. He was deputy superintendent of city schools in San Francisco, professor of education at Stanford, and professor of educational sociology at Columbia, before becoming president of the University of Washington in 1915.

&quot;It was there (Columbia) that the Washington regents found him (Suzzallo) in 1915, and he returned to the coast of his birth gladly. The University of Pittsburgh tried to lure him east again in 1919, offering to double his salary. He refused. The Carnegie Foundation, the National Research Council, the English Speaking Union, the Hall of Fame, the Scouts, the International Institute of the University of Heidelberg, and a dozen or so literary, sociological, and scientific societies soon made inroads on his time, recognizing him for a man of creditable character and intelligence; hearing of him from his many friends as one in whom force combined with charm, integrity with flexibility of manner. His prime attention, however, he devoted to the institution that was now in his charge&quot; (&quot;Time&quot; magazine, October 18, 1926).

Suzzallo, along with two other University of Washington faculty members, Richard Frederick Scholz (History Professor - predicted the rise of fascism in Europe) and Dr. Robert Max Garrett (English Professor - humanitarian), became an honorary member and advisor of the Phi Lambda chapter of the Zeta Psi fraternity of North America upon its charter in December 1920. Suzzallo&#x27;s involvement with the Phi Lambda chapter of Zeta Psi is unusual because he did not become a member until after he was President of the University of Washington.

While at the University of Washington, Suzzallo fired head football coach Gil Dobie due to a scandal about players and testing irregularities. Although Dobie had a remarkable record of 58-0-3, Suzzallo fired him because he sided with the players.

During World War I, Suzzallo served as a chairman of the State Board of Defense, an advisor to the War Labor Board, and as a member of the Labor Industries Board. A labor dispute at the time concerned the eight hour workday in the logging and lumber industry, which Suzzallo favored and helped enact. Suzzallo&#x27;s actions enraged lumberman Roland H. Hartley, who was elected governor in 1924. In 1926, Hartley removed five of the seven members of the University of Washington&#x27;s Board of Regents and replaced them with his own appointees. The new board shortly thereafter announced Suzzallo&#x27;s &quot;leave of absence&quot; for no apparent reason. Enraged students threatened to strike, but were compelled not to upon Suzzallo&#x27;s request.

After his dismissal from the University of Washington, Suzzallo became associated with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which he became president of in 1930. Suzzallo died in Seattle, Washington in 1933. Suzzallo Library, the University of Washington&#x27;s central library, is named in honor of him.

<text>In the study of differential equations, a boundary-value problem is a differential equation subjected to constraints called boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.

Boundary value problems arise in several branches of physics as any physical differential equation will have them. Problems involving the wave equation, such as the determination of normal modes, are often stated as boundary value problems. A large class of important boundary value problems are the Sturm–Liouville problems. The analysis of these problems, in the linear case, involves the eigenfunctions of a differential operator.

To be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be well posed. This means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique solution, which depends continuously on the input. Much theoretical work in the field of partial differential equations is devoted to proving that boundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications are in fact well-posed.

Among the earliest boundary value problems to be studied is the Dirichlet problem, of finding the harmonic functions (solutions to Laplace&#x27;s equation); the solution was given by the Dirichlet&#x27;s principle.

==Explanation==
Boundary value problems are similar to initial value problems. A boundary value problem has conditions specified at the extremes (&quot;boundaries&quot;) of the independent variable in the equation whereas an initial value problem has all of the conditions specified at the same value of the independent variable (and that value is at the lower boundary of the domain, thus the term &quot;initial&quot; value). A boundary value is a data value that corresponds to a minimum or maximum input, internal, or output value specified for a system or component.

For example, if the independent variable is time over the domain [0,1], a boundary value problem would specify values for formula_1 at both formula_2 and formula_3, whereas an initial value problem would specify a value of formula_1 and formula_5 at time formula_2.

Finding the temperature at all points of an iron bar with one end kept at absolute zero and the other end at the freezing point of water would be a boundary value problem.

If the problem is dependent on both space and time, one could specify the value of the problem at a given point for all time or at a given time for all space.

Concretely, an example of a boundary value problem (in one spatial dimension) is 
:formula_7
to be solved for the unknown function formula_8 with the boundary conditions

:formula_9

Without the boundary conditions, the general solution to this equation is

:formula_10

From the boundary condition formula_11 one obtains
:formula_12
which implies that formula_13 From the boundary condition formula_14 one finds
:formula_15
and so formula_16 One sees that imposing boundary conditions allowed one to determine a unique solution, which in this case is 
:formula_17

==Types of boundary value problems==
===Boundary value conditions===
A boundary condition which specifies the value of the function itself is a Dirichlet boundary condition, or first-type boundary condition. For example, if one end of an iron rod is held at absolute zero, then the value of the problem would be known at that point in space.

A boundary condition which specifies the value of the normal derivative of the function is a Neumann boundary condition, or second-type boundary condition. For example, if there is a heater at one end of an iron rod, then energy would be added at a constant rate but the actual temperature would not be known.

If the boundary has the form of a curve or surface that gives a value to the normal derivative and the variable itself then it is a Cauchy boundary condition.

====Examples====
Summary of boundary conditions for the unknown function, formula_18, constants formula_19 and formula_20 specified by the boundary conditions, and known scalar functions formula_21 and formula_22 specified by the boundary conditions.
===Differential operators===
Aside from the boundary condition, boundary value problems are also classified according to the type of differential operator involved. For an elliptic operator, one discusses elliptic boundary value problems. For a hyperbolic operator, one discusses hyperbolic boundary value problems. These categories are further subdivided into linear and various nonlinear types.

==Applications==
===Electromagnetic potential===

In electrostatics, a common problem is to find a function which describes the electric potential of a given region. If the region does not contain charge, the potential must be a solution to Laplace&#x27;s equation (a so-called harmonic function). The boundary conditions in this case are the Interface conditions for electromagnetic fields. If there is no current density in the region, it is also possible to define a magnetic scalar potential using a similar procedure.

<doc id="436802" wikidata="Q3984070" url="?curid=436802" title="Fundamental theorem of poker">
<text>The fundamental theorem of poker is a principle first articulated by David Sklansky that he believes expresses the essential nature of poker as a game of decision-making in the face of incomplete information. 

The fundamental theorem is stated in common language, but its formulation is based on mathematical reasoning. Each decision that is made in poker can be analyzed in terms of the expected value of the payoff of a decision. The correct decision to make in a given situation is the decision that has the largest expected value. If a player could see all of their opponents&#x27; cards, they would always be able to calculate the correct decision with mathematical certainty, and the less they deviate from these correct decisions, the better their expected long-term results. This is certainly true heads-up, but Morton&#x27;s theorem, in which an opponent&#x27;s correct decision can benefit a player, may apply in multi-way pots.

==An example==
Suppose Bob is playing limit Texas hold &#x27;em and is dealt 9♣ 9♠ under the gun before the flop. He calls, and everyone else folds to Carol in the big blind who checks. The flop comes A♣ K♦ 10♦, and Carol bets.

Bob now has a decision to make based upon incomplete information. In this particular circumstance, the correct decision is almost certainly to fold. There are too many turn and river cards that could kill his hand. Even if Carol does not have an A or a K, there are 3 cards to a straight and 2 cards to a flush on the flop, and she could easily be on a straight or flush draw. Bob is essentially drawing to 2 outs (another 9), and even if he catches one of these outs, his set may not hold up.

However, suppose Bob knew (with 100% certainty) that Carol held 8♦ 7♦. In this case, it would be correct to &quot;raise&quot;. Even though Carol would still be getting the correct pot odds to call, the best decision for Bob is to raise. Therefore, by folding (or even calling), Bob has played his hand differently from the way he would have played it if he could see his opponent&#x27;s cards, and so by the fundamental theorem of poker, his opponent has gained. Bob has made a &quot;mistake&quot;, in the sense that he has played differently from the way he would have played if he knew Carol held 8♦ 7♦, even though this &quot;mistake&quot; is almost certainly the best decision given the incomplete information available to him.

This example also illustrates that one of the most important goals in poker is to induce the opponents to make mistakes. In this particular hand, Carol has practiced deception by employing a semi-bluff — she has bet a hand, hoping Bob will fold, but she still has outs even if he calls or raises. Carol has induced Bob to make a mistake.

==Multi-way pots and implicit collusion==
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker applies to all heads-up decisions, but it does not apply to all multi-way decisions. This is because each opponent of a player can make an incorrect decision, but the &quot;collective decision&quot; of all the opponents works against the player.

This type of situation occurs mostly in games with multi-way pots, when a player has a strong hand, but several opponents are chasing with draws or other weaker hands. Also, a good example is a player with a deep stack making a play that favors a short-stacked opponent because he can extract more expected value from the other deep-stacked opponents. Such a situation is sometimes referred to as implicit collusion. 

The fundamental theorem of poker is simply expressed and appears axiomatic, yet its proper application to the countless varieties of circumstances that a poker player may face requires a great deal of knowledge, skill, and experience.

<doc id="436803" wikidata="Q5033338" url="?curid=436803" title="Canonero II">
<text>Cañonero II (April 24, 1968 – November 11, 1981) was a Venezuelan champion Thoroughbred race horse that may be best remembered for winning the first two legs of the 1971 U.S. Triple Crown, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.

==Background==

Bred by Edward B. Benjamin in Greensboro, North Carolina, the bay colt was born with a noticeably crooked foreleg, so was considered to have no future in racing. He was sold as a yearling for $1,200 at the Keeneland Sales to Venezuelan breeders Ramon Echegaray and Luis Navas. Purchased by Edgar Caibett, the horse was shipped to his owner&#x27;s native Venezuela, where he earned an undistinguished record racing as a two-year-old in La Rinconada Hippodrome.

==Triple Crown races==

Because of his breeding, Cañonero II qualified for the Kentucky Derby, the most prestigious event in United States Thoroughbred horse racing. Trained by Juan Arias and ridden by jockey Gustavo Avila, in the spring of 1971, the horse was shipped to Louisville, Kentucky, for the big race. There, Cañonero II was dismissed as a horse that did not belong in such elite company and was listed at the bottom of the pack of the betting odds as part of a six-horse pool.

In the Derby&#x27;s 20-horse field, Cañonero II shocked everyone by coming from 18th place to storm past the competition, easily winning the race by 3 lengths. Arguably the most astonishing upset in the race&#x27;s history was deemed a fluke by many of horse racing&#x27;s experts, who predicted Cañonero II would never win another race. However, in the Preakness Stakes, the second of the Triple Crown races, Cañonero II won again.

The third leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes held near New York City, was run before the largest crowd in its history. The stands were filled with members of the city&#x27;s large Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Cañonero II, after taking the race lead, struggled across the finish line in fourth place. Despite this loss, he was named the winner of the 1971 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.

==Later career==

Sold to the King Ranch, Cañonero II was nursed back to health by Hall of Fame trainer Buddy Hirsch. The following year in the Stymie Handicap at Belmont Park, he set a track record while defeating the great three-year-old champion Riva Ridge.

Retired to stud at the end of 1972, Cañonero II died in 1981.

<text>Risen Star(March 25, 1985 – March 13, 1998) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in 1988.

==Background==
The dark bay colt was the son of the great Triple Crown winner Secretariat and out of the mare Ribbon. Bred by Arthur B. Hancock III and Leone J. Peters, Risen Star was bought by Louisianans Ronnie Lamarque and Louie Roussel III at the 1987 Calder Two-Year-Olds In Training sale. He was trained by Roussel, a devout Roman Catholic who was stricken by throat cancer but recovered. Ten percent of Risen Star&#x27;s winnings were donated to the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Roman Catholic order of nuns.

==Racing career==
As a two-year-old Risen Star was lightly raced, winning the Minstrel Stakes at Louisiana Downs.

Risen Star started his sophomore season by winning the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby under jockey Shane Romero. Then, two weeks prior to the Kentucky Derby he had another Grade 2 victory in the Lexington Stakes in which he was ridden by Jacinto Vasquez.

He went into the prestigious Kentucky Derby as the morning-line third choice. All the colts in the Derby laid off the pace, their jockeys believing that the front-running grey filly Winning Colors would tire at the end of the race. But she didn&#x27;t tire, and won the race by a neck going wire to wire. Under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, Risen Star was forced to the outside on the backstretch where he stayed until making a charge at the head of the stretch. He was too late to make up all the lost ground to the front runner and finished third.

Two weeks later in the Preakness Stakes, Risen Star and Delahoussaye won the second leg of the Triple Crown, turning the tables on his filly rival Winning Colors to win by 1 lengths over Brian&#x27;s Time, Winning Colors, and local favorite Private Terms. With his sire (Secretariat) and grandsire (Bold Ruler), three successive generations won the Preakness Stakes, a feat accomplished only one other time.

In the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown, Risen Star and Delahoussaye pulled away from the field to win by 14 lengths with a final time of 2:26. It is the fourth fastest Belmont Stakes behind Hall of Famers A.P. Indy, Easy Goer, and Secretariat. Because of his two Classic victories, Risen Star won the second $1,000,000 Chrysler Triple Crown Bonus that was awarded to the three-year-old with the best finishes in the three races.

==Retirement==
An injury that occurred in the Belmont forced Risen Star into early retirement. He won the Eclipse Award as 1988&#x27;s top three-year-old. By winning the Eclipse, he became the first third-generation Eclipse Award winner in the same category (his sire Secretariat won in 1973 and his grandsire Bold Ruler won in 1957). Risen Star was retired to stud and went on to sire the millionaire Grade One winner Star Standard, as well as German runner Risen Raven.

Risen Star died on March 13, 1998, at Walmac International, where he is buried. A top Kentucky Derby prep race, the Risen Star Stakes, is named in his honor. it is held annually at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana.

<text>Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO), often pronounced &quot;spenay-go&quot;, is a GSSAPI &quot;pseudo mechanism&quot; used by client-server software to negotiate the choice of security technology. SPNEGO is used when a client application wants to authenticate to a remote server, but neither end is sure what authentication protocols the other supports. The pseudo-mechanism uses a protocol to determine what common GSSAPI mechanisms are available, selects one and then dispatches all further security operations to it. This can help organizations deploy new security mechanisms in a phased manner.

SPNEGO&#x27;s most visible use is in Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;HTTP Negotiate&quot; authentication extension. It was first implemented in Internet Explorer 5.01 and IIS 5.0 and provided single sign-on capability later marketed as &quot;Integrated Windows Authentication&quot;. The negotiable sub-mechanisms included NTLM and Kerberos, both used in Active Directory. The HTTP Negotiate extension was later implemented with similar support in:
* Mozilla 1.7 beta
* Mozilla Firefox 0.9
* Konqueror 3.3.1
* Google Chrome 6.0.472

== History ==
* 19 February 1996 – Eric Baize and Denis Pinkas publish the Internet Draft &quot;Simple GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism&quot; (draft-ietf-cat-snego-01.txt).
* 17 October 1996 – The mechanism is assigned the object identifier &quot;1.3.6.1.5.5.2&quot; and is abbreviated snego. 
* 25 March 1997 – Optimistic piggybacking of one mechanism&#x27;s initial token is added. This saves a round trip.
* 22 April 1997 – The &quot;preferred&quot; mechanism concept is introduced. The draft standard&#x27;s name is changed from just &quot;Simple&quot; to &quot;Simple and Protected&quot; (spnego).
* 16 May 1997 – Context flags are added (delegation, mutual auth, etc.). Defenses are provided against attacks on the new &quot;preferred&quot; mechanism.
* 22 July 1997 – More context flags are added (integrity and confidentiality).
* 18 November 1998 – The rules of selecting the common mechanism are relaxed. Mechanism preference is integrated into the mechanism list.
* 4 March 1998 – An optimisation is made for an odd number of exchanges. The mechanism list itself is made optional.
* December 1998 (Final) – DER encoding is chosen to disambiguate how the MIC is calculated. The draft is submitted for standardisation as RFC 2478.
* October 2005 – Interoperability with Microsoft implementations is addressed. Some constraints are improved and clarified and defects corrected. Published as RFC 4178, although it is now non-interoperable with strict implementations of now-obsoleted RFC 2478.

<text>Gary Michael Gabelich (Croatian &quot;Gabelić&quot;; August 29, 1940 – January 26, 1984) was an American motorsport driver who set the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) Land Speed Record (LSR) with the rocket car Blue Flame on October 23, 1970, on a dry lake bed at Bonneville Salt Flats near Wendover, Utah.

==Personal life==
Gary Michael Gabelich was born 29 August 1940 and was raised in southern California and attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School. He grew up during the height of the Southern California race scene and became friends with many famous racers of the era like drag racer Tom McEwen. The nearby Lions Drag Strip was adjacent to Long Beach and he was influenced by the NHRA drag racing legend Big Joe Reath of the Reath Automotive Speed Shop in Long Beach. Gabelich married Rae Marie Ramsey (born 1946). She graduated Palo Alto High School Palo Alto, CA in 1964 and moved to Long Beach in 1968. Guy Michael Gabelich was born in the early 1980s. She was a flight attendant for United Airlines. 
Gabelich&#x27;s father was of Croatian American descent and his mother was Mexican American.

Gabelich died in January 1984 in a motorcycle crash. After his widow Rae Marie retired from United Airlines in 2003, she was elected to the Long Beach City Council in 2004, where she served for eight years.

==Career==
Gabelich drove a split window 1960 era Volkswagen delivery van for Vermillion&#x27;s Drug store in his younger days. He lived with his parents in the Bixby Knolls area of Long Beach, California during this time. He later went to work for North American Aviation which became North American Rockwell after a 1967 merger with Rockwell-Standard. Gabelich started in the mail room and stayed for nine years in various positions from staff assistant before becoming a part-time test subject for Project Apollo in the years 1968 and 1969. Gabelich served as an Apollo test astronaut in 1968-1969 as stated on the plaque his family dedicated to him in 2001.

Unlike the actual astronauts, he was not flying the capsules, but testing their long-term viability in weightless conditions, their tolerance and performance under conditions of extreme lateral forces and, though they seldom spoke of it on televised moon shots, the toilet facilities. Gabelich was Mercury Seven astronaut Wally Schirra&#x27;s exact size and he did a lot of space checkout for him and testing of capsules and equipment before they were man-rated for operational use. Project Mercury ended in the early 1960s and Wally Schirra went on to become commander of Apollo 7.

===Land speed record===
Gabelich broke the LSR by achieving average speeds of over a flying mile and over a flying kilometer. The thrust used during this attempt was between 13,000 pounds (58,000 newtons) and 15,000 pounds (67,000 newtons). A top speed of approximately was momentarily attained during one run.

The FIA rules dictate that a land speed mark is recognized only after two runs through the FIA measured kilometer and mile courses. The two corresponding speeds are then averaged for the official time and speed. Additionally both runs must be made within one hour.

Gabelich averaged on his first run and on his second run for an average speed of establishing a new kilometer FIA LSR. The mile FIA LSR was the first exceeding and remained unbeaten until 1983, when Richard Noble broke it driving Thrust 2. The faster kilometer FIA LSR remained unbroken for 27 years when ThrustSSC went supersonic in 1997.

===Racing career===

In 1969 Gabelich established a quarter mile Drag boat record of This is not the same as the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) Water Speed Record (WSR) in which Donald Campbell broke on 23 July 1955 in the Bluebird K7.

Gabelich was seriously injured in the crash of an experimental 4 wheel drive Funny Car in 1972 that careened out of control at during a quarter mile run almost severing his left forearm and broke his left leg so severely that more than a year later he still wore a cast. This incident ended his racing career and he never raced again, concentrating instead on a new supersonic vehicle.

==After racing==

In the early 1980s he established the &quot;Rocketman Corporation&quot; with Tom Daniel. The objective was to design and build a vehicle capable of reaching speeds in the range. This conceptual vehicle was named &quot;American Way&quot; but the project was cut short by his untimely death in January 1984 in a motorcycle crash.

Gabelich was part of the cast in the 1977 movie &quot;Joyride to Nowhere&quot; and he made a documentary, &quot;One Second from Eternity: The History of the Land Speed Record&quot; in 1971. Gabelich and his family appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; with Richard Dawson, where he presented the key to the city of Long Beach, California to Dawson.

In 2008 Gabelich was inducted into the Long Beach Motorsports Walk of Fame in front of the Convention Center on Pine Avenue. He was represented at the ceremony by his wife Rae, a Long Beach City Councilwoman who retired in 2012 after eight years of service.

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2016.

<doc id="436813" wikidata="Q2878277" url="?curid=436813" title="Bachelor of Fine Arts">
<text>A Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) is a standard undergraduate degree for students pursuing a professional education in the visual arts, Fine art, or performing arts. In some instances, it is also called a Bachelor of Visual Arts (BVA).

==Background==
The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in that the program is primarily composed of practical studio work, as opposed to lecture and discussion-based courses.

A Bachelor of Fine Arts degree often requires a specialization in an area such as acting, architecture, musical theatre, game design, animation, ceramics, computer animation, creative writing, dance, dramatic writing, drawing, fashion design, fiber, film production, graphic design, illustration, industrial design, interior design, metalworking, music, new media, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, stage management, technical arts, television production, visual arts, or visual effects. Alternatively, some schools provide students with a broad education across many disciplines within the arts.

Although a Bachelor of Fine Arts is traditionally considered a four-year degree, a BFA program may take more or less time to complete depending on the studio coursework required. After completing this degree, graduates may pursue a postgraduate degree: a Master of Fine Arts.

==BFA in countries==
===United States===
A typical BFA program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general liberal arts studies. In contrast, a BA in Art may reverse this ratio. The National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD), which accredits Bachelor of Fine Arts programs in visual art and design in the United States, states that &quot;the professional degree (BFA) focuses on intensive work in the visual arts supported by a program of general studies,&quot; whereas &quot;the liberal arts degree (BA) focuses on art and design in the context of a broad program of general studies.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a BA in Fine Arts is equivalent to a BFA. Some performing arts institutions in Australia, the US, and much of Europe use specific degrees such as the Bachelor of Dance or Bachelor of Drama.

===India===
In India, a Fine Arts undergraduate degree may also be known as BVA (Bachelor of Visual Arts). It is usually a four-year program, with the first year serving as a preparatory session. By the second year, learners specialize in areas such as Painting or Photography. However, some institutions have a three-year curriculum where students have already chosen a specialization. Specializations such as Acting, Dancing, and Singing fall under the Bachelor of Performing Arts (BPA).

In some countries, such a degree (BFA) is called a Bachelor of Creative Arts (BCA).

<text>are traditional Japanese mechanized puppets or automata, made from the 17th century to the 19th century. The dolls&#x27; gestures provided a form of entertainment. The word has also come to mean &quot;mechanisms&quot; or &quot;trick&quot; in Japanese. It is used to describe any device that evokes a sense of awe through concealment of its inner workings.

The name is thought to come from the Japanese verb , which means &quot;to pull, stretch, and move a thread&quot;. It is alternatively written in kanji as , , , , and archaically as .

== History ==
One of the earliest recorded references in Japan to similar automata devices is found in the , which references a mechanism known as a south-pointing chariot appearing during the reign of Empress Kōgyoku, in 658 CE.

 were further developed in Japan after the introduction of European clock-making technology sometime in the early 17th century, during the Sengoku period. The gears and cams used in clock-making were used to create moving dolls. The country embraced the mechanized puppet performance as a form of entertainment, and it became popular during the Edo period, which was considered the golden age of construction and use.

 were initially only known to upper-class Japanese, such as and , as the only members of society wealthy enough to afford them. However, gained widespread popularity through their use as part of floats during street festivals, such as the Toshogu Matsuri in Nagoya.

In 1662, clockmaker Takeda Omi completed the first , designed for stage performances, in the Dōtonbori neighborhood of Osaka. He then built several of these large puppets for theatrical exhibitions, and the theatre was passed down through several generations of his family.

In the 19th century, Tanaka Hisashige, the founder of Toshiba, gained a reputation by making technically sophisticated puppets. His masterpieces are and doll (letter-writing doll). In the case of , using mechanical power, a puppet shoots a target with a bow and arrow, and in the case of , a puppet a dips a brush into ink and writes characters on paper.
According to Kirsty Boyle, a student of one of the last puppet masters in Japan, the tradition focuses on the art of concealing technology with the belief that it would evoke feelings and emotions more effectively. It is also noted that, although the puppet resembles the human figure, it has a form of decisive movement that features rapid shifts that cannot be captured by the naked eye.

== Types ==
There are three main types of . were life-sized dolls designed for public performances such as theatres. were small and used in homes. Most of them were set on a table and performed a dance or beat drums, but some were designed to serve tea or sake. These were significantly expensive, and usually owned by a or other high-status person. were large mechanical dolls used in religious festivals, where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends.

There were also more inexpensive toys based on traditional . The tin toys that for a period were frequently made in Japan and sold for export were sometimes modeled after .

Some scholars note that the gestures and movements of the have influenced Noh, kabuki and theatre.
The most common example today of a mechanism is a tea-serving robot, which starts moving forward when a cup of tea is placed on the plate in its hands. This , also known as , was used in a situation when a host wanted to treat a guest in a recreational way. It moves in a straight line for a set distance, moving its feet as if walking, and then bows its head. The doll stops when the cup is removed. When it is replaced, the robot raises its head, turns around and returns to where it came from. It is typically powered by a wound spring made of whalebone, and the actions are controlled by a set of cams and levers.

<doc id="436819" wikidata="Q435875" url="?curid=436819" title="Krešimir Ćosić">
<text>Krešimir &quot;Krešo&quot; Ćosić (; 26 November 1948 – 25 May 1995) was a Croatian professional basketball player and coach. He was a collegiate All-American at Brigham Young University. He revolutionized basketball in Yugoslavia and was the first basketball player in the world to play all five positions.

In 1996, Ćosić became only the third international player ever elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (the second male player). He is one of 62 people in the world that received the FIBA Order of Merit. In 2006, he was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame, and in 2007, he was also an inaugural member of the FIBA Hall of Fame. The Croatian Basketball Cup, and KK Zadar&#x27;s home arena, are named after him. Ćosić was voted best Croatian athlete of the 20th century twice; by Croatian Sports News and by Croatian National Television. 

Ćosić was a notable church leader and missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as the deputy ambassador of Croatia to the U.S., in Washington, D.C. 

==Early club career==
Ćosić was born in Zagreb (PR Croatia, FPR Yugoslavia), on 26 November 1948, to Ante and Darinka Ćosić. He was raised in Zadar, and in 1965, he started his club basketball playing career, by playing with KK Zadar. While with Zadar, he won three Yugoslav League titles: in 1965, 1967, and 1968.

==College career and NBA draft==
In the summer of 1968, Ćosić was in a European team with Finnish player Veikko Vainio. Vainio, a student at Brigham Young University (BYU), told him about life in college, and invited him to play for the BYU Cougars. Ćosić accepted this invitation, and moved to the United States, in 1969. In his freshman year, he played in 12 games for the freshman team, averaging 17.4 points and 12.6 rebounds per game. In his sophomore year, he averaged 15.1 points and 12.6 rebounds per game, leading BYU to the 1971 WAC Championship.

In his junior year, he again led his team to the WAC Championship, averaging 22.3 points and 12.8 rebounds per game, and being awarded All-American Honors by the United Press International, making him the first non-American player to achieve that. In the 1972 NBA draft, he was picked by the Portland Trail Blazers, in the 10th round (144th overall), but he opted to stay with BYU.

As a senior, he averaged 20.2 points and 9.5 rebounds per game, and again was given All-American Honors, by the United Press International. His career college basketball averages were 18.9 points, and 11.8 rebounds per game.

The Marriott Center, at BYU, was built during Ćosić&#x27;s career at BYU, as the Smith Field House could not accommodate the growing number of fans, so there is a saying about the Marriott Center – Stan Watts built it, Marriott paid for it, and Krešo filled it.

==Late club career==
At the 1973 NBA draft, Ćosić was picked by the Los Angeles Lakers, in the 5th round (84th overall). He rejected several professional offers from the NBA and ABA, and returned home to Croatia, where he again played with KK Zadar, from 1973 to 1976. He was responsible for bringing the first American to play for a Yugoslav club team. He brought Doug Richards to Zadar.

After that, he played with AŠK Olimpija (1976–1978), with Virtus Bologna (1978–1980), and with Cibona Zagreb (1980–1983). Ćosić helped lead Cibona to their first European Cup.

==National team career==
Ćosić made his national team debut for Team Yugoslavia, at the age of 17, after being called up to the senior team by head coach Ranko Žeravica. He won a silver medal at the 1967 FIBA World Championship. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, he won another silver medal.

Ćosić holds the record for playing the most games for a national team (303) and was part of three generations and holds the most basketball awards/medals in Croatia. In total, Ćosić played in four Summer Olympic Games: 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980 in Moscow, when he led his team as captain to the gold medal. He previously had led Yugoslavia to a pair of FIBA World Cup gold medals, at the 1970 FIBA World Championship, and at the 1978 FIBA World Championship.

==Coaching career==
He first coached the Zadar team upon returning from BYU in 1973. However, he found it too exhausting being a coach, club director and player. In 1976 he coached the Ljubljana Brest team and was at the same time a player for Zadar (both teams played in the same league).
Following his playing days, Ćosić returned to coaching, and he led the senior Yugoslav national team to a silver medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and two bronze medals at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, and the 1987 EuroBasket. Even though no one agreed with him, Ćosić insisted on including young players in the national team and was the first to give them a chance, they included: Dino Rađa, Vlade Divac and Toni Kukoč.

He also recognized a young talent in Dejan Bodiroga, whom he helped set off his career.

== Off the basketball court ==
=== Diplomacy ===
Ćosić turned down coaching offers so that he could help Croatia during war-time in the early 1990s. He was positioned in the embassy of Croatia to the USA, as the deputy ambassador in Washington D.C. He was the only person at the time able to help in fixing misconceptions about the war. His strong connections helped Croatia and he received the Freedom Award for contributing to advancing peace and reconciliation to all ethnic groups in Croatia.

=== Church life ===
During his time at Brigham Young University, Ćosić converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he later served as the presiding priesthood holder in post-communist Croatia. He was baptized by Hugh Nibley, one of the Church&#x27;s most celebrated scholars. Ćosić also introduced the Church to Yugoslavia. He translated the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants into Croatian. According to Nibley, Ćosić told him, &quot;There are a hundred reasons why I should not join the Church, and only one reason why I should - &quot;because it is true&quot;.&quot;

=== Writer===
Ćosić was known to carry a suitcase full of books wherever he traveled. He was an atypical athlete, reading, analyzing and noting. He always had the latest gadget at hand and was obsessed with technology. He listened to classical music and loved the theater and arts. In the 1980s, he started writing his autobiography which was never completed. His daughter, Ana, published his writings in May 2019 in Croatian under the book name &quot;Play, Believe, Live&quot;. The book gives an inside view of Ćosić&#x27;s sports career and his theories about sports in general.

== Death ==

In the years following his career in basketball, Ćosić worked in the United States, as a diplomat, at the Croatian embassy in Washington, D.C., having helped secure the land where the embassy now stands. Ćosić died in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1995, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He was buried in the Mirogoj Cemetery, under the Arcades, in Zagreb, Croatia. People came from all over former Yugoslavia to his funeral, even though there was a war at the time. He was survived by his wife, Ljerka, his two daughters, and his son, Krešimir.

<doc id="436822" wikidata="Q2292021" url="?curid=436822" title="Eagles in Middle-earth">
<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, the Eagles or Great Eagles, are immense birds that are sapient and can speak. The Great Eagles resemble actual eagles, but are much larger. Thorondor is said to have been the greatest of all birds, with a wingspan of . Elsewhere, the Eagles have varied in nature and size both within Tolkien&#x27;s writings and in later adaptations.

Scholars have noticed that the Eagles appear as agents of eucatastrophe or &quot;deus ex machina&quot; throughout Tolkien&#x27;s writings, from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and the accounts of Númenor to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Where Elves are good, and fully sentient, and Orcs bad, Eagles amongst other races are in between; the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins fears he will become their supper, torn up like a rabbit, and is indeed served rabbit for supper. The scholar Marjorie Burns notes, too, that Gandalf&#x27;s association with Eagles is reminiscent of the god Odin in Norse mythology. Others have seen Biblical echoes, especially when the Eagle-messenger sings of the final victory to Faramir in phrases reminiscent of Psalm 24.

== Context ==
J. R. R. Tolkien was an English author and philologist of ancient Germanic languages, specialising in Old English; he spent much of his career as a professor at the University of Oxford. He is best known for his novels about his invented Middle-earth, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and for the posthumously published &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; which provides a more mythical narrative about earlier ages. He invented several peoples for Middle-earth, including Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Orcs, Trolls, and Eagles, among others. A devout Roman Catholic, he described &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as &quot;a fundamentally religious and Catholic work&quot;, rich in Christian symbolism.

== Appearances ==

=== First Age ===

Throughout &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the Eagles are associated with Manwë, the ruler of the sky and Lord of the Valar. It is stated that &quot;spirits in the shape of hawks and eagles&quot; brought news from Middle-earth to his halls upon Taniquetil, the highest mountain in Valinor, and in the &quot;Valaquenta&quot; of &quot;all swift birds, strong of wing&quot;. Upon their first appearance in the main narrative, it is stated that the Eagles had been &quot;sent forth&quot; to Middle-earth by Manwë, to live in the mountains north of the land of Beleriand, to &quot;watch upon&quot; Morgoth, and to help the exiled Noldorin Elves &quot;in extreme cases&quot;. The Eagles were ruled by Thorondor, &quot;Lord of the Eagles&quot;, and &quot;mightiest of all birds that have ever been&quot;. When Turgon built the Hidden City of Gondolin, the eagles of Thorondor became his allies, bringing him news and keeping spies and Orcs away. The eagles&#x27; watch was redoubled after the coming of Tuor, enabling Gondolin to remain undiscovered longer than any other Elvish kingdom in Beleriand. When the city fell, the eagles protected the fugitives from ambushing orcs. The Eagles fought alongside the army of the Valar, Elves, and Men during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age. In &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; it is recounted that after the appearance of winged dragons, &quot;all the great birds of heaven&quot; gathered under the leadership of Thorondor to Eärendil, and destroyed the majority of the dragons in an aerial battle.

=== Second Age ===

On the island of Númenor in the Second Age, three Eagles guarded the summit of the holy mountain Meneltarma, appearing whenever anyone approached it, and staying in the sky during the Númenórean &quot;Three Prayers&quot; religious ceremony. The Númenóreans called them &quot;the Witnesses of Manwë&quot;, believing he had sent them from Aman &quot;to keep watch upon the Holy Mountain and upon all the land&quot;. Another eyrie upon the tower of the King&#x27;s House in the capital Armenelos was always inhabited by a pair of eagles, until the days of Tar-Ancalimon and the coming of Shadow to Númenor. Many eagles lived upon the hills around Sorontil in the north of the island. When the Númenóreans began to speak openly against the Ban of the Valar, Manwë appeared as eagle-shaped storm clouds, called the &quot;Eagles of the Lords of the West&quot;, to try to reason with or threaten them.

===Third Age===

By the end of the Third Age, a colony of Eagles lived in the north of the Misty Mountains, as described in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. These Eagles opposed the goblins; however, their relationship with the local Woodmen was only cool, as the eagles often hunted their sheep. They rescued Thorin&#x27;s company from a band of goblins and Wargs, ultimately carrying the dwarves to the Carrock. Later, having seen the mustering of goblins in the Mountains, a great flock of Eagles participated in the Battle of the Five Armies.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Eagles of the Misty Mountains helped the Elves of Rivendell and the Wizard Radagast to gather news of the Orcs. Gwaihir the Windlord carries news to Isengard, rescues the wizard Gandalf from the top of the tower there, and again rescues Gandalf from the top of Celebdil after searching for him at Galadriel&#x27;s request. Gwaihir and his Eagles appear in great numbers towards the end of the book. The Eagles similarly arrive at the Battle of the Morannon, helping the Host of the West against the Nazgûl, while Gwaihir, Landroval, and Meneldor rescue Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee from Mount Doom after the One Ring had been destroyed.

== Analysis ==

=== Origins ===

Tolkien&#x27;s painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. According to Christopher Tolkien, the author based this picture on a painting by the Scottish ornithological artist Archibald Thorburn of an immature golden eagle, which Christopher found for him in Thomas Coward&#x27;s 1919 book &quot;The Birds of the British Isles and Their Eggs&quot;.

The Great Eagles appeared in &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, the first tale about Middle-earth that Tolkien wrote in the late 1910s. In Tolkien&#x27;s early writings, the eagles were distinguished from other birds: common birds could keep aloft only within the lower layer of the space above the Earth, while the Eagles of Manwë could fly &quot;beyond the lights of heaven to the edge of darkness&quot;. The eagle-shaped clouds that appeared in Númenor formed one of Tolkien&#x27;s recurring images of the downfall of the island; they appear, too, in his abandoned time-travel stories, &quot;The Lost Road&quot; and &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;.

===Sentient beings===
Tolkien faced the question of the Great Eagles&#x27; nature with apparent hesitation. In early writings there was no need to define it precisely, since he imagined that, beside the Valar, &quot;many lesser spirits... both great and small&quot; had entered the Eä upon its creation; and such sapient creatures as the Eagles or Huan the Hound, in Tolkien&#x27;s own words, &quot;have been rather lightly adopted from less &#x27;serious&#x27; mythologies&quot;. The phrase &quot;spirits in the shape of hawks and eagles&quot; in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; derives from that stage of writing. After completing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien moved toward a more carefully defined &quot;system&quot; of creatures. At the top were incarnates or Children of Ilúvatar: Elves and Men, those who possessed &quot;fëar&quot; or souls, with the defining characteristic of being able to speak; next were self-incarnates, the Valar and Maiar, &quot;angelic&quot; spirits that &quot;arrayed&quot; themselves in bodily forms of the incarnates or of animals, and were able to communicate both by thought and speech; and finally animals, mere beasts, unable to speak. For some time Tolkien considered the Eagles as bird-shaped Maiar; however, he realised that the statement about Gwaihir and Landroval&#x27;s descent from Thorondor had already appeared in print in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, while he had long before rejected the notion of their being &quot;Children&quot; of the Valar and Maiar. In the last of his notes on this topic, dated by his son Christopher to the late 1950s, Tolkien decided that the Great Eagles were animals that had been &quot;taught language by the Valar, and raised to a higher level—but they still had no &quot;fëar&quot; [souls].&quot;

The Tolkien scholars Paul Kocher and Tom Shippey note that in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the narrator provides a firm moral framework, with good elves, evil goblins, and the other peoples like dwarves and eagles somewhere in between. Shippey remarks that the eagles are in the narrator&#x27;s &quot;euphemistic&quot; words, &quot;not kindly birds&quot;. Marjorie Burns comments that the &quot;threat of being eaten [by the Eagle] is so dominant&quot; that the Hobbit Bilbo, who the Eagle described as being rather like a rabbit, is afraid of being torn up and eaten; he is relieved that he is not to become their supper, &quot;but rabbit is precisely what the eagles do bring them for supper&quot;.

===Norse mythology===

In Norse mythology, eagles were associated with the god Odin; for example, he escapes from Jotunheim back to Asgard as an eagle. Burns remarks the similarity with Gandalf, who repeatedly escapes by riding on an eagle. She comments that Tolkien&#x27;s Eagles, like his Dwarves, Dragons, and Trolls, all signal Norse influence on his stories.

===&quot;Deus ex machina&quot;===

Burns notes that Tolkien uses the Eagles three times to save his protagonists: to rescue Bilbo and company in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;; to lift Gandalf from imprisonment by Saruman in the tower of Orthanc; and finally, to save Frodo and Sam from Mount Doom when they have destroyed the One Ring. The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance describes these interventions as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, a sudden and unexpected mechanism to bring about a eucatastrophe. The screenwriter Brad Johnson, writing in &quot;Script&quot;, argues that this last &quot;deus ex machina&quot; instance is a complete surprise to the audience, and undesirable as the sudden appearance of the Eagles &quot;takes the audience out of the scene emotionally&quot;. Tolkien was aware of this problem, recognising the risky nature of the mechanism; in one of his letters, he wrote:

=== Biblical messenger ===

Shippey notes that throughout &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Tolkien carefully avoided direct reference to Christianity, so as not to make the story an allegory. He comments however that in one place &quot;Revelation seems very close and allegory does all but break through&quot;, namely the eucatastrophic moment when the Eagle-messenger sings to Faramir about Frodo and Sam&#x27;s destruction of the One Ring:

Shippey writes that this is certainly Biblical, indeed that it is specifically in the style of Psalm 24 in the King James Version of the Bible, with its phrases &quot;Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, for the King of glory shall come in&quot;. E. L. Risden, making a different connection with Christianity, describes the Eagles&#x27; rescue of Frodo and Sam as a &quot;ritual rebirth&quot;, and the rescuing bird as &quot;a symbol of the spirit&quot;, John the Evangelist&#x27;s traditional symbol.

== Adaptations ==

Different adaptations of Tolkien&#x27;s books treated both the nature of the Eagles and their role in the plots with varying level of faithfulness to originals. The first scenario for an animated motion-picture of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; proposed to Tolkien in 1957 was turned down because of several cardinal deviations, among which Tolkien&#x27;s biographer Humphrey Carpenter recorded that &quot;virtually all walking was dispensed with in the story and the Company of the Ring were transported everywhere on the backs of eagles&quot;.

According to the fantasy artist Larry Dixon, the digitally animated eagles in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy were based on a stuffed golden eagle he had provided to Weta Workshop.

A genus of Diapriid wasps in Australia was named &quot;Gwaihiria&quot; after the Eagle Gwaihir in 1982.

In the 2011 video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: War in the North&quot;, an eagle named Beleram acts as a supporting character, aiding the players in battle.

<text>Gerontology ( ) is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of aging. The word was coined by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in 1903, from the Greek (&#x27;), meaning &quot;old man&quot;, and (&#x27;), meaning &quot;study of&quot;. The field is distinguished from geriatrics, which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an aging population on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology created the first PhD, master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in gerontology in 1975.
==History==
In the Islamic Golden Age, several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including diet and remedies for problems including constipation. Arabic physician Ibn Al-Jazzar Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly. His scholarly work covers sleep disorders, forgetfulness, how to strengthen memory, and causes of mortality. Ishaq ibn Hunayn (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness.

While the number of aged humans, and the life expectancy, tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the Industrial Revolution that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as Michel Eugène Chevreul, who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. Élie Metchnikoff coined the term &quot;gerontology&quot; in 1903.

Modern pioneers like James Birren began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging—the National Institute on Aging—programs in gerontology at the University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles, and as past president of the Gerontological Society of America (founded in 1945).

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world&#x27;s population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden—the term &quot;geroscience&quot; emerged in the early 21st century.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid population aging in the next several decades. In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the United States. However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively. Notably, in the United States and across the world, the &quot;baby boomer&quot; generation began to turn 65 in 2011. Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States. The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010. However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period. It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and Canada will be aged 65 years and older by 2025. Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years. Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050. Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010. However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States. In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over). The sex ratio, which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females. In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population. However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the Census 2010 reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).

=== Geographic distribution of older adults in the United States ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census. In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the Census 2000, all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010. Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that Rhode Island was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010. Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.

== Sub-fields ==
As with many disciplines, over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries the field of gerontology has sub-divided into multiple specific disciplines focused on increasingly narrow aspects of the aging process.

=== Biogerontology ===
Biogerontology is the special sub-field of gerontology concerned with the biological aging process, its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. Aim of biogerontology is to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes or even eliminate aging per se. Some argue that aging fits the criteria of disease, therefore aging is disease and should be treated as disease. In 2008 Aubrey de Grey said that in case of suitable funding and involvement of specialists there is a 50% chance, that in 25–30 years humans will have technology saving people from dying of old age, regardless of the age at which they will be at that time. His idea is to repair inside cells and between them all that can be repaired using modern technology, allowing people to live until time when technology progress will allow to cure deeper damage. This concept got the name &quot;longevity escape velocity&quot;.

A meta analysis of 36 studies concluded that there is an association between age and DNA damage in humans, a finding consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.

=== Social gerontology ===
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in social work, nursing, psychology, sociology, demography, public health, or other social science disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with demography. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

==== Social theories of aging ====
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.

===== Activity theory =====
Activity theory was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults&#x27; self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation. Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.

===== Disengagement theory =====
Disengagement theory was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose &quot;ego-energy&quot; and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause—namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

===== Age stratification theory =====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form cohorts that define &quot;age strata&quot;. There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.

===== Life course theory =====
According to this theory, which stems from the life course perspective aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.

Also reflecting the life course focus, consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality, morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need to be reconceptualized.

===== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory =====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer, inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage &quot;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer&quot;. Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.

=== Environmental gerontology ===
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age. Studies of environmental gerontology indicate that older people prefer to age in their immediate environment, whereas spatial experience and place attachment are important for understanding the process.

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the longevity and quality of life of the elderly. Precisely, the natural environment (such as natural therapeutic landscapes, therapeutic garden) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.

=== Jurisprudential gerontology ===
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as &quot;geriatric jurisprudence&quot;) is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of elder law, which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as therapeutic jurisprudence, jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, end of life care, or nursing homes regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation. Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well-being of older persons.

<text>Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a medical specialty focused on addressing the unique health needs of older adults The term &quot;geriatrics&quot; originates from the Greek γέρων &quot;geron&quot; meaning &quot;old man&quot;, and ιατρός &quot;iatros&quot; meaning &quot;healer&quot;. It aims to promote health by preventing, diagnosing and treating disease in older adults. Older adults may be healthy, but they&#x27;re more likely to have chronic health concerns and require more medical care. There is not a defined age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of older people. Rather, this decision is guided by individual patient needs and the caregiving structures available to them. This care may benefit those who are managing multiple chronic conditions or experiencing significant age-related complications that threaten quality of daily life. Geriatric care may be indicated if caregiving responsibilities become increasingly stressful or medically complex for family and caregivers to manage independently.

There is a distinction between geriatrics and gerontology. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary study of the aging process, defined as the decline in organ function over time in the absence of injury, illness, environmental risks or behavioral risk factors. However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology.

== Scope ==
=== Differences between adult and geriatric medicine ===
Geriatric providers receive specialized training in caring for elderly patients and promoting healthy aging. The care provided is largely based on shared-decision making and is driven by patient goals and preferences, which can vary from preserving function, improving quality of life, or prolonging years of life. A guiding mnemonic commonly used by geriatricians in the United States and Canada is the 5 M&#x27;s of Geriatrics which describes mind, mobility, multicomplexity, medications and matters most to elicit patient values.

It is common for elderly adults to be managing multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidity). Age-associated changes in physiology drive a compounded increase in susceptibility to illness, disease-associated morbidity, and death. Moreover, common diseases may present atypically in elderly patients, adding further diagnostic and therapeutic complexity to patient care.

Geriatrics is highly interdisciplinary consisting of specialty providers from the fields of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social work, and physical and occupational therapy. Elderly patients can receive care related to medication management, pain management, psychiatric and memory care, rehabilitation, long-term nursing care, nutrition, and different forms of therapy including physical, occupational, and speech. Non-medical considerations include social services, transitional care, advanced directives, power of attorney, and other legal considerations.

===Increased complexity===
The decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Multiple problems may compound: A mild fever in elderly persons may cause confusion, which can advance to a fall and to a fracture of the neck of the femur (&quot;broken hip&quot;).The presentation of disease in elderly persons may be vague and non-specific, or it may include delirium or falls. (Pneumonia, for example, may present with low-grade fever and confusion, rather than the high fever and cough seen in younger people.) Some elderly people may find it hard to describe their symptoms in words, especially if the disease is causing confusion, or if they have cognitive impairment. Delirium in the elderly may be caused by a minor problem such as constipation or by something as serious and life-threatening as a heart attack. Many of these problems are treatable, if the root cause can be discovered.

===Cognition===

Cognitive aging is characterized by declines in fluid abilities like processing speed, working memory, and executive function, while crystallized abilities such as knowledge remain stable (Anstey &amp; Low, 2004; Murman, 2015). Age-related changes in brain structure and function correlate with these cognitive declines (Murman, 2015). Older adults show weaker occipital activity and stronger prefrontal and parietal activity during cognitive tasks, possibly reflecting compensation (Cabeza et al., 2004). Subjective cognitive complaints are common among older adults, particularly regarding working memory (Newson &amp; Kemps, 2006). Various factors influence cognitive aging, including genetics, lifestyle, and health (Bäckman et al., 2004). Cognitive impairments can progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (Mendoza-Ruvalcaba et al., 2018).

MCI is a transitional state between normal aging and Dementia, affecting 10-20% of adults over 65 (Schwarz, 2015). Geriatricians encounter MCI patients in various care settings, with diagnoses relying on clinical assessment and mental status examinations (Tangalos &amp; Petersen, 2018). MCI is highly prevalent among older adults with depression and may persist after depression remits (Lee et al., 2006). While MCI is considered a high-risk condition for developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, there is heterogeneity in its presentation and outcomes (Petersen et al., 2001).

Dementia is a prevalent condition in geriatric populations, affecting cognitive function and daily activities (Talawar, 2018; Mirzapure et al., 2022). Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is the most common cause, accounting for 40-80% of cases (Mirzapure et al., 2022; Chulakadabba et al., 2020). Geriatric patients with dementia often have comorbidities and other geriatric syndromes, requiring holistic and integrated care (Chulakadabba et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2023). Geriatricians play a crucial role in dementia care, but many feel current training is inadequate and seek more structured experiences (Mayne et al., 2014). Improving access to geriatricians and enhancing general practitioners&#x27; diagnostic skills could improve timely and accurate dementia diagnosis (Mansfield et al., 2022). However, there are significant shortages of dementia specialists, particularly in rural areas (Liu et al., 2024; Christley et al., 2022). Geriatricians support comprehensive post-diagnosis information provision, including sensitive topics like advance care planning (Mansfield et al., 2022). Collaboration between specialists and family physicians is essential, with specialists often handling contentious issues like driving competency (Hum et al., 2014). Geriatric training may influence end-of-life care patterns for dementia patients (Gotanda et al., 2023). A geriatrics perspective emphasizes prevention, considering lifestyle factors that promote healthy cognitive aging (Steffens, 2018).

=== Geriatric pharmacology ===
Elderly people require specific attention to medications. Elderly people particularly are subjected to polypharmacy (taking multiple medications) given their accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Many of these individuals have also self-prescribed herbal medications and over-the-counter drugs. This polypharmacy, in combination with geriatric status, may increase the risk of drug interactions or adverse drug reactions. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes arise with older age, impairing their ability to metabolize and respond to drugs. Each of the four pharmacokinetic mechanisms (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) is disrupted by age-related physiologic changes. For example, overall decreased hepatic function can interfere with clearance or metabolism of drugs and reductions in kidney function can affect renal elimination. Pharmacodynamic changes lead to altered sensitivity to drugs in geriatric patients, such as increased pain relief with morphine use. Therefore, geriatric individuals require specialized pharmacological care that is informed by these age-related changes.

=== Geriatric syndromes ===
Geriatric syndromes is a term used to describe a group of clinical conditions that are highly prevalent in elderly people. These syndromes are not caused by specific pathology or disease, rather, are a manifestation of multifactorial conditions affecting several organ systems. Common conditions include frailty, functional decline, falls, loss of continence, and malnutrition, amongst others.

==== Frailty ====
Frailty is marked by a decline in physiological reserve, increased vulnerability to physiological and emotional stressors, and loss of function. This may present as progressive and unintentional weight loss, fatigue, muscular weakness, and decreased mobility. It is associated with increased injuries, hospitalization, and adverse clinical outcomes.

==== Functional decline ====
Functional disability can arise from a decline in physical function and/or cognitive function. It is associated with an acquired difficulty in performing basic everyday tasks resulting in an increased dependence of other individuals and/or medical devices. These tasks are sub-divided into basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and are commonly used as an indicator of a person&#x27;s functional status.

Activities of daily living (ADL) are fundamental skills needed to care for oneself, including feeding, personal hygiene, toileting, transferring and ambulating. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) describe more complex skills needed to allow oneself to live independently in a community, including cooking, housekeeping, managing one&#x27;s finances and medications. Routine monitoring of ADL and IADL is an important functional assessment used by clinicians to determine the extent of support and care to provide to elderly adults and their caregivers. It serves as a qualitative measurement of function over time and predicts the need for alternative living arrangements or models of care, including senior housing apartments, skilled nursing facilities, palliative, hospice or home-based care.

==== Falls ====

Falls are the leading cause of emergency department admissions and hospitalizations in adults age 65 and older, many of which result in significant injury and permanent disability. As certain risk factors can be modifiable for the purpose of reducing falls, this highlights an opportunity for intervention and risk reduction. Modifiable factors include:

* Improving balance and muscle strength.
* Removing environmental hazards.
* Encouraging use of assistive devices.
* Treating chronic conditions.
* Adjusting medication.

==== Urinary incontinence ====
Urinary incontinence or overactive bladder symptoms is defined as unintentionally urinating oneself. These symptoms can be caused by medications that increase urine output and frequency (e.g. anti-hypertensives and diuretics), urinary tract infections, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic floor dysfunction, and diseases that damage the nerves that regulate bladder emptying. Other musculoskeletal conditions affecting mobility should be considered, as these can make accessing bathrooms difficult.

==== Malnutrition ====
Malnutrition and poor nutritional status is an area of concern, affecting 12% to 50% of hospitalized elderly patients and 23% to 50% of institutionalized elderly patients living in long-term care facilities such as assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities. As malnutrition can occur due to a combination of physiologic, pathologic, psychologic and socioeconomic factors, it can be difficult to identify effective interventions. Physiologic factors include reduced smell and taste, and a decreased metabolic rate affecting nutritional food intake. Unintentional weight loss can result from pathologic factors, including a wide range of chronic diseases that affect cognitive function, directly impact digestion (e.g. poor dentition, gastrointestinal cancers, gastroesophageal reflux disease) or may be managed with dietary restrictions (e.g. congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension). Psychologic factors include conditions including depression, anorexia, and grief.

=== Practical concerns ===
Functional abilities, independence, and quality of life issues are central concerns to geriatricians and their patients. Elderly people generally want to live independently as long as possible, which requires them to be able to engage in self-care and other activities of daily living. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refer people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate.

Frail elderly individuals may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Frail people are also at significant risk of complications following surgery and the need for extended care, and an accurate prediction—based on validated measures, rather than how old the patient&#x27;s face looks—can help older patients make fully informed choices about their options. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients&#x27; recovery trajectories. One frailty scale uses five items: unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed. A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with moderate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Frail elderly patients (score of 4 or 5) who were living at home before the surgery have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.

== Subspecialties and related services ==

Some diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults, e.g., dementia, delirium, falls. As societies aged, many specialized geriatric- and geriatrics-related services emerged including:

==History==
A number of physicians in the Byzantine Empire studied geriatrics, with doctors like Aëtius of Amida evidently specializing in the field. Alexander of Tralles viewed the process of aging as a natural and inevitable form of marasmus, caused by the loss of moisture in body tissue. The works of Aëtius describe the mental and physical symptoms of aging. Theophilus Protospatharius and Joannes Actuarius also discussed the topic in their medical works. Byzantine physicians typically drew on the works of Oribasius and recommended that elderly patients consume a diet rich in foods that provide &quot;heat and moisture&quot;. They also recommended frequent bathing, massaging, rest, and low-intensity exercise regimens.

In &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, written by Avicenna in 1025, the author was concerned with how &quot;old folk need plenty of sleep&quot; and how their bodies should be anointed with oil, and recommended exercises such as walking or horse-riding. Thesis III of the &quot;Canon&quot; discussed the diet suitable for old people, and dedicated several sections to elderly patients who become constipated.

The Arab physician Algizar (–980) wrote a book on the medicine and health of the elderly. He also wrote a book on sleep disorders and another one on forgetfulness and how to strengthen memory, and a treatise on causes of mortality. Another Arab physician in the 9th century, Ishaq ibn Hunayn (died 910), the son of Nestorian Christian scholar Hunayn Ibn Ishaq, wrote a &quot;Treatise on Drugs for Forgetfulness&quot;.

George Day published the &quot;Diseases of Advanced Life&quot; in 1849, one of the first publications on the subject of geriatric medicine. The first modern geriatric hospital was founded in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1881 by doctor Laza Lazarević.

The term &quot;geriatrics&quot; was proposed in 1908 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, Laurate of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and later by 1909 by Ignatz Leo Nascher, former Chief of Clinic in the Mount Sinai Hospital Outpatient Department (New York City) and a &quot;father&quot; of geriatrics in the United States.

Modern geriatrics in the United Kingdom began with the &quot;mother&quot; of geriatrics, Marjory Warren. Warren emphasized that rehabilitation was essential to the care of older people. Using her experiences as a physician in a London Workhouse infirmary, she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough; they needed diagnosis, treatment, care, and support. She found that patients, some of whom had previously been bedridden, were able to gain some degree of independence with the correct assessment and treatment.

The practice of geriatrics in the UK is also one with a rich multidisciplinary history. It values all the professions, not just medicine, for their contributions in optimizing the well-being and independence of older people.

Another innovator of British geriatrics is Bernard Isaacs, who described the &quot;giants&quot; of geriatrics mentioned above: immobility and instability, incontinence, and impaired intellect. Isaacs asserted that, if examined closely enough, all common problems with older people relate to one or more of these giants.

The care of older people in the UK has been advanced by the implementation of the National Service Frameworks for Older People, which outlines key areas for attention.

== Geriatrician training ==

===United States===
In the United States, geriatricians are primary-care physicians (D.O. or M.D.) who are board-certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatric medicine. Geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process, the impact of aging on illness patterns, drug therapy in seniors, health maintenance, and rehabilitation. They serve in a variety of roles including hospital care, long-term care, home care, and terminal care. They are frequently involved in ethics consultations to represent the unique health and diseases patterns seen in seniors. The model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on addressing working closely with other disciplines such as nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and social workers.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, most geriatricians are hospital physicians, whereas others focus on community geriatrics in particular. Although originally a distinct clinical specialty, it has been integrated as a specialization of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most geriatricians are, therefore, accredited for both. Unlike in the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom and are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists.

===Canada===
In Canada, there are two pathways that can be followed in order to work as a physician in a geriatric setting.
#Doctors of Medicine (M.D.) can complete a three-year core internal medicine residency program, followed by two years of specialized geriatrics residency training. This pathway leads to certification, and possibly fellowship after several years of supplementary academic training, by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.
# Doctors of Medicine (M.D.) can opt for a two-year residency program in family medicine and complete a one-year enhanced skills program in care of the elderly. This post-doctoral pathway is accredited by the College of Family Physicians of Canada.
Many universities across Canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public, such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents.

===India===
In India, Geriatrics is a relatively new speciality offering. A three-year post graduate residency (M.D) training can be joined for after completing the 5.5-year undergraduate training of MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery). Unfortunately, only eight major institutes provide M.D in Geriatric Medicine and subsequent training. Training in some institutes are exclusive in the Department of Geriatric Medicine, with rotations in Internal medicine, medical subspecialties etc. but in certain institutions, are limited to 2-year training in Internal medicine and subspecialities followed by one year of exclusive training in Geriatric Medicine.

==Minimum geriatric competencies==
In July 2007, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the John A. Hartford Foundation hosted a National Consensus Conference on Competencies in Geriatric Education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies (learning outcomes) that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients. Twenty-six (26) Minimum Geriatric Competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP). The domains are: cognitive and behavioral disorders; medication management; self-care capacity; falls, balance, gait disorders; atypical presentation of disease; palliative care; hospital care for elders, and health care planning and promotion. Each content domain specifies three or more observable, measurable competencies.

== Research ==

Changes in physiology with aging may alter the absorption, the effectiveness and the side effect profile of many drugs. These changes may occur in oral protective reflexes (dryness of the mouth caused by diminished salivary glands), in the gastrointestinal system (such as with delayed emptying of solids and liquids possibly restricting speed of absorption), and in the distribution of drugs with changes in body fat and muscle and drug elimination.

Psychological considerations include the fact that elderly persons (in particular, those experiencing substantial memory loss or other types of cognitive impairment) are unlikely to be able to adequately monitor and adhere to their own scheduled pharmacological administration. One study (Hutchinson et al., 2006) found that 25% of participants studied admitted to skipping doses or cutting them in half. Self-reported noncompliance with adherence to a medication schedule was reported by a striking one-third of the participants. Further development of methods that might possibly help monitor and regulate dosage administration and scheduling is an area that deserves attention.

Another important area is the potential for improper administration and use of potentially inappropriate medications, and the possibility of errors that could result in dangerous drug interactions. Polypharmacy is often a predictive factor. Research done on home/community health care found that &quot;nearly 1 of 3 medical regimens contain a potential medication error&quot;.

== Ethical and medico-legal issues ==
Elderly persons sometimes cannot make decisions for themselves. They may have previously prepared a power of attorney and advance directives to provide guidance if they are unable to understand what is happening to them, whether this is due to long-term dementia or to a short-term, correctable problem, such as delirium from a fever.

Geriatricians must respect the patients&#x27; privacy while seeing that they receive appropriate and necessary services. More than most specialties, they must consider whether the patient has the legal responsibility and competence to understand the facts and make decisions. They must support informed consent and resist the temptation to manipulate the patient by withholding information, such as the dismal prognosis for a condition or the likelihood of recovering from surgery at home.

Elder abuse is the physical, financial, emotional, sexual, or other type of abuse of an older dependent. Adequate training, services, and support can reduce the likelihood of elder abuse, and proper attention can often identify it. For elderly people who are unable to care for themselves, geriatricians may recommend legal guardianship or conservatorship to care for the person or the estate.

Elder abuse occurs increasingly when caregivers of elderly relatives have a mental illness. These instances of abuse can be prevented by engaging these individuals with mental illness in mental health treatment. Additionally, interventions aimed at decreasing elder reliance on relatives may help decrease conflict and abuse. Family education and support programs conducted by mental health professionals may also be beneficial for elderly patients to learn how to set limits with relatives with psychiatric disorders without causing conflict that leads to abuse.

<text>Étienne Fourmont (23 June 1683 – 8 December 1745) was a French scholar and Orientalist who served as professor of Arabic at the Collège de France and published grammars on the Arabic, Hebrew, and Chinese languages.

Although Fourmont is remembered as a pioneering sinologist who did careful and influential work on the nature of Chinese characters, his legacy is significantly tarnished by the fact that he earned his early reputation by stealing the work of Arcadius Huang, whom he had helped catalog the royal sinological collection, and that he frequently plagiarized the works of other scholars.

==Life and career==
Born at Herblay near Argenteuil, he studied at the Collège Mazarin in Paris and afterwards in the Collège Montaigu where his attention was attracted to Oriental languages. Shortly after leaving the college he published a &quot;Traduction du commentaire du Rabbin Abraham A ben Esra sur l&#x27;Ecclésiaste&quot;.
In 1711 Louis XIV appointed Fourmont to assist Arcadius Huang, a Catholic Chinese convert, in cataloging the French royal collection of works in Chinese and compiling a Chinese dictionary. One day, Fourmont was discovered copying Huang&#x27;s work, and after Huang&#x27;s death there was suspicion that Fourmont had not given Huang adequate credit. Huang died in 1716, and Fourmont immediately appropriated his work for himself. He completed Huang&#x27;s catalogue and published it in Paris in 1737 as &quot;Catalogus Codicum Manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Regiae&quot; (&quot;Royal Library Catalog of Manuscripts&quot;). He also wrote &quot;Réflexions critiques sur les histoires des anciens peuples&quot; (1735), and several dissertations printed in the Memoires of the Academy of Inscriptions. 
Fourmont&#x27;s most notable work was his 1737 grammar of Chinese: &quot;Linguae Sinarum mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatical duplex patine et cum characteribus Sinensium&quot;. This work is simply a copy of Francisco Varo&#x27;s earlier Chinese grammar, with the addition of Chinese characters.

He became professor of Arabic in the Collège de France in 1715. In 1713 he was elected a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, in 1738 a member of the Royal Society of London, and in 1742 a member of that of Berlin. He died at Paris on 8 December 1745.

His brother, Michel Fourmont (1690–1746), was also a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and professor of the Syriac language in the Royal College.

<text>Verbs constitute one of the main parts of speech (word classes) in the English language. Like other types of words in the language, English verbs are not heavily inflected. Most combinations of tense, aspect, mood and voice are expressed periphrastically, using constructions with auxiliary verbs.

Generally, the only inflected forms of an English verb are a third person singular present tense form ending in &quot;-s&quot;, a past tense (also called preterite), a past participle (which may be the same as the past tense), and a form ending in &quot;-ing&quot; that serves as a present participle and gerund. Most verbs inflect in a simple regular fashion, although there are about 200 irregular verbs; the irregularity in nearly all cases concerns the past tense and past participle forms. The copula verb &quot;be&quot; has a larger number of different inflected forms, and is highly irregular.

Although many of the most commonly used verbs in English (and almost all the irregular verbs) come from Old English, many others are taken from Latin or French. Nouns or adjectives can become verbs (see Conversion (word formation)). Adjectives like &quot;separate&quot; and &quot;direct&quot; thus became verbs, starting in the 16th century, and eventually it became standard practice to form verbs from Latin passive participles, even if the adjective didn&#x27;t exist. Sometimes verbs were formed from Latin roots that were not verbs by adding &quot;-ate&quot; (such as &quot;capacitate&quot;), or from French words (such as &quot;isolate&quot; from French &quot;isoler&quot;).

For details of the uses of particular verb tenses and other forms, see the article Uses of English verb forms.

==Inflected forms==
===Principal parts===
A regular English verb has only one principal part, from which all the forms of the verb can be derived. This is the base form or dictionary form. For example, from the base form &quot;exist&quot;, all the inflected forms of the verb (&quot;exist&quot;, &quot;exists&quot;, &quot;existed&quot;, &quot;existing&quot;) can be predictably derived. The base form is also called the bare infinitive; that is, the infinitive without the &quot;to&quot;.

Most irregular verbs have three principal parts, since the simple past and past participle are unpredictable. For example, the verb &quot;write&quot; has the principal parts &quot;write&quot; (base form), &quot;wrote&quot; (past), and &quot;written&quot; (past participle); the remaining inflected forms (&quot;writes&quot;, &quot;writing&quot;) are derived regularly from the base form. Some irregular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms (as the regular verbs do), as with &quot;send–sent–sent&quot;.

The infinitive, simple past and past participle are sometimes referred to as First (V1), Second (V2) and Third (V3) form of a verb, respectively. This naming convention has all but disappeared from American and British usage, but still can be found in textbooks and teaching materials used in other countries.

Some speakers have only two forms, collapsing the distinction between V2 and V3, though this is considered non-standard. For most verbs the forms are V1 and V2 (&quot;have they went yet?&quot;, with &#x27;gone&#x27; never being used, or &quot;a corporate-ran company&quot; rather than &quot;corporate-run&quot;), but for a few verbs they are V1 and V3 (&quot;I seen it, he done it&quot;, with &#x27;saw&#x27; and &#x27;did&#x27; not being used).

The verbs &quot;do&quot;, &quot;say&quot; and &quot;have&quot; additionally have irregular third person singular present tense forms (see below). The copular verb &quot;be&quot; is highly irregular, with the forms &quot;be&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot;, &quot;been&quot; and &quot;being&quot;. On the other hand, modal verbs (such as &quot;can&quot; and &quot;must&quot;) are defective verbs, being used only in a limited number of forms. For details on the forms of verbs of these types, see below.

=== Base form ===
The base form or &quot;plain form&quot; of an English verb is not marked by any inflectional ending.

Certain derivational suffixes are frequently used to form verbs, such as &quot;-en&quot; (&quot;sharpen&quot;), &quot;-ate&quot; (&quot;formulate&quot;), &quot;-fy&quot; (&quot;electrify&quot;), and &quot;-ise/ize&quot; (&quot;realise/realize&quot;), but verbs with those suffixes are nonetheless considered to be base-form verbs. Also, many base-form verbs contain prefixes, such &quot;un-&quot; (&quot;unmask&quot;), &quot;out-&quot; (&quot;outlast&quot;), &quot;over-&quot; (&quot;overtake&quot;), and &quot;under-&quot; (&quot;undervalue&quot;). Some verbs are formed from nouns and adjectives by conversion, as with the verbs &quot;snare&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;, &quot;dry&quot;, and &quot;calm&quot;.

The base form is used in the following ways:
*It serves as the bare infinitive, and is used in the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive (e.g. &quot;to write&quot;); for uses see below.
*It serves as the simple present tense, except in the third person singular: &quot;I/you/we/they write regularly&quot; (and except for the highly irregular &quot;to be&quot;).
*It is used as an imperative: &quot;Write these words.&quot;
*It is used as a subjunctive: &quot;I suggested that he write a novel.&quot;
For the verb &quot;be&quot;, which uses different forms for the simple present, and modal verbs, which are not used in the infinitive, imperative or subjunctive, see below.

=== Third person singular present ===
Almost all verbs have a third person singular present indicative form with the suffix &quot;-[e]s&quot;. In terms of spelling, it is formed in most cases by adding &quot;-s&quot; to the verb&#x27;s base form: &quot;run&quot; → &quot;runs&quot;. However if the base form ends in one of the sibilant sounds (, , , , , ) and its spelling does not end in a silent &quot;e&quot;, then &quot;-es&quot; is added: &quot;buzz&quot; → &quot;buzzes&quot;; &quot;catch&quot; → &quot;catches&quot;. Verbs ending in a consonant plus &quot;o&quot; also typically add &quot;-es&quot;: &quot;veto&quot; → &quot;vetoes&quot;. Verbs ending in a consonant plus &quot;y&quot; add &quot;-es&quot; after changing the &quot;y&quot; to an &quot;i&quot;: &quot;cry&quot; → &quot;cries&quot;.

In terms of pronunciation, the ending is pronounced as after sibilants (as in &quot;lurches&quot;), as after voiceless consonants other than sibilants (as in &quot;makes&quot;), and as otherwise (as in &quot;adds&quot;). These are the same rules that apply to the pronunciation of the regular noun plural suffix &quot;-[e]s&quot; and the possessive &quot;-&#x27;s&quot;. The spelling rules given above are also very similar to those for the plural of nouns.

The third person singular present of &quot;have&quot; is irregular: &quot;has&quot; (with the weak form when used as an auxiliary, also contractable to &quot;-&#x27;s&quot;). The verbs &quot;do&quot; and &quot;say&quot; also have irregular forms, &quot;does&quot; and &quot;says&quot; , which however look like regular forms in writing.

For the verb &quot;be&quot;, modal verbs and other auxiliaries, see below.

The form described in this section is used with third person singular subjects as the simple present tense (in the indicative mood): &quot;He writes novels all the time.&quot; (This tense has other uses besides referring to present time; for example, in &quot;I&#x27;ll be glad if he writes&quot;, it refers to future time.)

=== Past tense ===

The past tense, or preterite, may be formed regularly or irregularly.

With regular verbs, the past tense is formed (in terms of spelling) by adding &quot;-ed&quot; to the base form (&quot;play&quot; → &quot;played&quot;). Normal rules for adding suffixes beginning with a vowel apply: If the base form ends in &quot;e&quot; then only &quot;d&quot; is added (&quot;like&quot; → &quot;liked&quot;); if the base form ends in a consonant followed by &quot;y&quot; then the &quot;y&quot; is changed to &quot;i&quot; before adding the ending (&quot;try&quot; → &quot;tried&quot;; an exception is the verb &quot;&quot; (a ball), which can form &quot;skied&quot; or &quot;skyed&quot;). Three words ending in &quot;-ay&quot; (&quot;lay&quot;, &quot;pay&quot; and &quot;say&quot;) change &quot;y&quot; to &quot;i&quot; and add &quot;-d&quot; (&quot;laid&quot;, &quot;paid&quot;, &quot;said&quot;).

Various rules apply for doubling final consonants. If the base form ends in a single vowel followed by a single consonant (except &quot;h&quot;, silent &quot;t&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot;), then unless the final syllable is completely unstressed the consonant is doubled before adding the &quot;-ed&quot; (&quot;ship&quot; → &quot;shipped&quot;, but &quot;fathom&quot; → &quot;fathomed&quot;). In general this is considered something to keep the vowel before the final consonant short (i.e. if the word were spelled &quot;shiped&quot; it would have a long i.) However, there are 2 words, &quot;control&quot; and &quot;patrol&quot;, which follow this rule even though the vowel before the final consonant is long. For most base forms ending in &quot;c&quot;, the doubled form used is &quot;ck&quot;, used regardless of stress (&quot;panic&quot; → &quot;panicked&quot;; exceptions include &quot;zinc&quot; → &quot;zincked&quot; or &quot;zinced&quot;, &quot;arc&quot; → usually &quot;arced&quot;, &quot;spec&quot; → &quot;specced&quot; or &quot;spec&#x27;ed&quot;, &quot;sync&quot; → sometimes &quot;synched&quot;). In British English, the doubling of &quot;l&quot; occurs regardless of stress (&quot;travel&quot; → &quot;travelled&quot;; but &quot;paralleled&quot; is an exception), and when two separately pronounced vowels precede the &quot;l&quot; (&quot;dial&quot; → &quot;dialled&quot;, &quot;fuel&quot; → &quot;fuelled&quot;). If the final syllable has some partial stress, especially for compound words, the consonant is usually doubled: &quot;backflip&quot; → &quot;backflipped&quot;, &quot;hobnob&quot; → &quot;hobnobbed&quot;, &quot;kidnap&quot; → &quot;kidnapped&quot; etc. In some cases both alternatives are acceptable, e.g. &quot;dialog&quot;† → &quot;dialogued&quot; or &quot;dialogged&quot;†, &quot;hiccup&quot; → &quot;hiccupped&quot; or &quot;hiccuped&quot;, &quot;program&quot; → &quot;programed&quot;† or &quot;programmed&quot;. However &quot;catalog&quot;† → &quot;cataloged&quot;†, &quot;pyramid&quot; → &quot;pyramided&quot;, &quot;format&quot; → &quot;formatted&quot; (but &quot;combat&quot; → &quot;combat(t)ed&quot;). Other variations not entirely consistent with these rules include &quot;bus&quot; → &quot;bused&quot;† or &quot;bussed&quot;, &quot;bias&quot; → &quot;biased&quot; or &quot;biassed&quot;† and &quot;focus&quot; → &quot;focused&quot; or &quot;focussed&quot;. (The forms marked † are not used in British English, and the doubled consonant is not used for many words of non-Anglo-Saxon origin.)

The pronunciation of the past tense ending follows similar rules to those for the third person present tense ending described above: if the base form ends in or then a new syllable or is added (as in &quot;drifted&quot;, &quot;exceeded&quot;); if the base form ends in an unvoiced consonant sound other than then the ending is pronounced (as in &quot;capped&quot;, &quot;passed&quot;); otherwise the ending is pronounced (as in &quot;buzzed&quot;, &quot;tangoed&quot;). Consequently, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the latter two pronunciations were routinely spelled &quot;-&#x27;d&quot;, but &quot;-ed&quot; was later restored.

For the past tense of irregular verbs, see English irregular verbs. Many of these can be classed as Germanic strong verbs, such as &quot;sing&quot; (past &quot;sang&quot;), while others are weak verbs with irregularly pronounced or irregularly spelt past forms, such as &quot;say&quot; (past tense &quot;said&quot; ).

The verb &quot;be&quot; has two past tense forms: &quot;was&quot; (first and third person singular) and &quot;were&quot; (plural and second person).

The past tense (preterite) form is used in what is called the simple past, in sentences such as &quot;We lit the fire&quot; and &quot;He liked to dance&quot;. One of the uses of this tense is to refer not to a past situation, but to a hypothetical (present or future) situation in a dependent clause: &quot;If I knew that, I wouldn&#x27;t have to ask.&quot; This is sometimes called the &quot;past subjunctive&quot;, particularly in the case of &quot;were&quot;, which can replace &quot;was&quot; in such sentences; see English subjunctive.

=== Past participle ===
The past participle of regular verbs is identical to the preterite (past tense) form, described in the previous section.

For irregular verbs, see English irregular verbs. Some of these have different past tense and past participle forms (like &quot;sing–sang–sung&quot;); others have the same form for both (like &quot;make–made–made&quot;). In some cases the past tense is regular but the past participle is not, as with &quot;show–showed–shown&quot;.

For uses of the past participle, see below.

=== Present participle ===
The present participle form, which is also used for the gerund, is formed by adding the suffix &quot;-ing&quot; to the base form: &quot;go&quot; → &quot;going&quot;. A final silent &quot;e&quot; is dropped (&quot;believe&quot; → &quot;believing&quot;); final &quot;ie&quot; changes to &quot;y&quot; (&quot;lie&quot; → &quot;lying&quot;), and consonant doubling applies as for the past tense (see above): &quot;run&quot; → &quot;running&quot;, &quot;panic&quot; → &quot;panicking&quot;.

Exceptions include forms such as &quot;singeing&quot;, &quot;dyeing&quot;, &quot;ageing&quot;, &quot;rueing&quot;, &quot;cacheing&quot; and &quot;whingeing&quot;, where the &quot;e&quot; may be retained to avoid confusion with otherwise identical words (e.g. &quot;singing&quot;), to clarify pronunciation (for example to show that a word has a soft &quot;g&quot; or &quot;ch&quot;), or for aesthetic reasons.

In standard English the ending is pronounced , although in many regional dialects the final consonant sound is pronounced , sometimes represented in eye dialect by spellings such as &quot;huntin&quot;&#x27; (see &quot;g&quot;-dropping).

For uses of the present participle and gerund, see below.

===Copular, auxiliary and defective verbs===
The copular verb &quot;be&quot; has multiple irregular forms in the present tense: &quot;am&quot; for first person singular (which together with the subject pronoun is often contracted to &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;), &quot;is&quot; for third person singular (often contracted to&quot; &#x27;s&quot;), and &quot;are&quot; for plural and second person (often contracted to&quot; &#x27;re&quot; chiefly after the pronouns &quot;you&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;they&quot;). It also has two past tense forms: &quot;was&quot; for first and third person singular, and &quot;were&quot; for plural and second person (also used as a past subjunctive with all persons; see English subjunctive). It has the following negative forms: third person singular present &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, other present &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; (including first person for the question &quot;aren&#x27;t I&quot;), first and third person singular past &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, and other past &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot;. The past participle is &quot;been&quot;, and the present participle and gerund is the regular &quot;being&quot;. The base form &quot;be&quot; is used regularly as an infinitive, imperative and (present) subjunctive. For archaic forms, see the next section.

English has a number of modal auxiliary verbs which are defective. These verbs mostly have only positive and negative present and past tense forms &quot;can&quot;/&quot;can&#x27;t&quot;/&quot;cannot&quot; and &quot;could&quot;/&quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might&quot;/&quot;mightn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;/&quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;should&quot;/&quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;will&quot;/&quot;won&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;would&quot;/&quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot;, as well as &quot;need&quot;/&quot;needn&#x27;t&quot;. &quot;Ought&quot; and &quot;must&quot; are also defective and have only a positive and negative form. In some dialects, &quot;dare&quot; also has a negative form. 

Other verbs used as auxiliaries include &quot;have&quot;, chiefly in perfect constructions (the forms &quot;has&quot; , &quot;have&quot; and &quot;had&quot; can contract to&quot; &#x27;s&quot;,&quot; &#x27;ve&quot; and&quot; &#x27;d&quot;); &quot;do&quot; (&quot;does&quot;, &quot;did&quot;) in emphatic, inverted and negated constructions (see &quot;do&quot;-support).

For more detail of the above, including contractions of negated forms (&quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, etc.), see English auxiliaries and contractions.

Another example of a defective verb is &quot;beware&quot;, which is used only in those forms in which &quot;be&quot; remains unchanged, namely the infinitive, subjunctive and imperative.

=== Archaic forms ===
Formerly, particularly in the Old English period, the English language had a far greater degree of verb inflection than it does now (some other Germanic languages retain a greater variety of inflected forms than English does). Some of the forms used in Early Modern English have now fallen out of use, but are still encountered in old writers and texts (e.g. Shakespeare, the King James Bible) and in archaisms.

One such form was the third person singular form with the suffix &quot;-eth&quot; , pronounced as a full syllable. This was used in some dialects rather than the modern &quot;-s&quot;, e.g. &quot;he maketh&quot; (&quot;he makes&quot;), &quot;he runneth&quot; (&quot;he runs&quot;), &quot;he goeth&quot; (&quot;he goes&quot;). In some verbs, a shortened form &quot;-th&quot; appears: &quot;he hath&quot; (&quot;he has&quot;), &quot;he doth&quot; (&quot;he does&quot;; pronounced as if written &quot;duth&quot;), &quot;he saith&quot; or &quot;he sayeth&quot; (&quot;he says&quot;). The forms &quot;hath&quot; and &quot;doth&quot; are found in some proverbs (&quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&quot;, &quot;The lady doth protest too much&quot;).

Another set of forms are associated with the archaic second person singular pronoun &quot;thou&quot;, which often have the ending &quot;-est&quot;, pronounced as a full syllable, e.g. &quot;thou makest&quot; (&quot;you make&quot;), &quot;thou leadest&quot; (&quot;you lead&quot;). In some verbs, a shortened form &quot;-st&quot; appears: &quot;thou hast&quot; (&quot;you have&quot;), &quot;thou dost&quot; (&quot;you do&quot;; rhymes with &quot;must&quot;). In the case of the verb &quot;be&quot;, such forms included &quot;art&quot; (present tense), &quot;wast&quot; (past), &quot;wert&quot; (past subjunctive) and &quot;beest&quot; (present subjunctive; pronounced as two syllables). In all other verbs, the past tense is formed by the base past tense form of the word (e.g. &quot;had&quot;, &quot;did&quot;, &quot;listened&quot;) plus&quot;-&#x27;st&quot;, not pronounced as a full syllable, e.g. &quot;thou had&#x27;st&quot; (&quot;you had&quot;), &quot;thou did&#x27;st&quot; (&quot;you did&quot;), &quot;thou listened&#x27;st&quot; (&quot;you listened&quot;). Modal verbs except &quot;must&quot; also have &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-st&quot; added to their form, e.g. &quot;thou canst&quot; (&quot;you can&quot;), &quot;thou wilt&quot; (&quot;you will&quot;), &quot;thou wouldst&quot; (&quot;you would&quot;), &quot;thou mightst&quot; (&quot;you might&quot;), except &quot;may&quot;, which is &quot;thou mayest&quot; (&quot;you may&quot;).

For example, several such forms (as well as other archaic forms such as &quot;yea&quot; for &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;thy&quot; for &quot;your&quot;, and &quot;mine enemies&quot; for &quot;my enemies&quot;) appear in Psalm 23 from the King James Bible:

: The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
: He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
: He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name&#x27;s sake.
: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
: Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

For more information see Old English verbs, English subjunctive, and Indo-European copula (for the history of the verb &quot;be&quot;).

==Syntactic constructions==

===Expressing tenses, aspects and moods===
Besides the synthetic (inflected) forms described above, there are a number of periphrastic (multi-word) constructions with verb forms that serve to express tensed, aspectual or modal meanings; these constructions are commonly described as representing certain verb tenses or aspects (in English language teaching they are often simply called tenses). For the usage of these forms, see below. More detail can be found in the article Uses of English verb forms.

====Progressive====
The progressive (or continuous) aspect is expressed with a form of &quot;be&quot; together with the present participle of the verb. Thus present progressive (present continuous) constructions take forms like &quot;am writing&quot;, &quot;is writing&quot;, &quot;are writing&quot;, while the past progressive (past continuous, also called &quot;imperfect&quot;) forms are &quot;was writing&quot;, &quot;were writing&quot;. There is a progressive infinitive &quot;(to) be writing&quot; and a progressive subjunctive &quot;be writing&quot;. Other progressive forms, made with compound forms of &quot;be&quot;, are described below.

====Perfect====
The perfect aspect is expressed with a form of the auxiliary &quot;have&quot; together with the past participle of the verb. Thus the present perfect is &quot;have written&quot; or &quot;has written&quot;, and the past perfect (pluperfect) is &quot;had written&quot;. The perfect can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the present perfect progressive (continuous) &quot;have/has been writing&quot; and the past perfect progressive (continuous) &quot;had been writing&quot;. There is a perfect infinitive &quot;(to) have written&quot; and a perfect progressive infinitive &quot;(to) have been writing&quot;, and corresponding present participle/gerund forms &quot;having written&quot; and &quot;having been writing&quot;. A perfect subjunctive (&quot;have written&quot;) is also sometimes used. Future and conditional perfect forms are given below.

====Future and conditional====
What is often called the future tense of English is formed using the auxiliary &quot;will&quot;. The simple future is &quot;will write&quot;, the future progressive (continuous) is &quot;will be writing&quot;, the future perfect is &quot;will have written&quot;, and the future perfect progressive (continuous) is &quot;will have been writing&quot;. Traditionally (though now usually in formal English only) &quot;shall&quot; is used rather than &quot;will&quot; in the first person singular and plural; see &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;.

The conditional, or &quot;future-in-the-past&quot;, forms are made analogously to these future forms, using &quot;would&quot; (and &quot;should&quot;) in place of &quot;will&quot; (and &quot;shall&quot;).

==== Imperative ====
In the second person, the imperative mood is normally expressed with the base form of the verb but without a subject: &quot;Take this outside! Be good!&quot; It is possible to add the second person pronoun &quot;you&quot; for emphasis: &quot;You be good!&quot; The first person plural is normally expressed with the contraction &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; (let us) and the base form.

More details can be found in the article imperative mood.

===Expressing passive voice===
The passive voice in English is normally expressed with a form of the copula verb &quot;be&quot; (or sometimes &quot;get&quot;) together with the past participle of the main verb. In this context &quot;be&quot; is not a stative verb, so it may occur in progressive forms. Examples:
*&quot;The house was built last year.&quot;
*&quot;The house is being built at the moment.&quot;
*&quot;The house will be built by our firm.&quot; (a prepositional phrase with &quot;by&quot; expresses the performer of the action)
*&quot;I was given a blueprint.&quot; (here the subject of the passive corresponds to the indirect object of the active)
*&quot;He was said to know the house&#x27;s dimensions.&quot; (special construction related to indirect speech)

For details, see English passive voice.

===Questions, negation, inversion and emphasis===
Questions are formed by subject–auxiliary inversion (unless the interrogative word is part of the subject). If there is otherwise no auxiliary, the verb &quot;do&quot; (&quot;does&quot;, &quot;did&quot;) is used as an auxiliary, enabling the inversion. This also applies to negation: the negating word &quot;not&quot; must follow an auxiliary, so &quot;do&quot; is used if there is no other auxiliary.

Inversion is also required in certain other types of sentences, mainly after negative adverbial phrases; here too &quot;do&quot; is used if there is no other auxiliary.

The construction with &quot;do&quot; as auxiliary is also used to enable emphasis to be added to a sentence.

For details of the above constructions, see &quot;do&quot;-support.

==Use of verb forms==
This section describes how the verb forms introduced in the preceding sections are used. More detail can be found in the article Uses of English verb forms and in the articles on the individual tenses and aspects.

===Finite forms===
In referring to an action taking place regularly (and not limited to the future or to the past), the simple present is used: &quot;He brushes his teeth every morning&quot;. For an action taking place at the present time, the present progressive construction is used: &quot;He is brushing his teeth now&quot;. With some verbs expressing a present state, particularly the copula &quot;be&quot; and verbs expressing a mental state, the present simple is generally used: &quot;They are here&quot;; &quot;I know that&quot;. However other state verbs use the present progressive or present simple depending on whether the state is considered temporary or permanent: &quot;The pen is lying on the table&quot;; &quot;Paris lies on the Seine&quot;.

For past actions or states, the simple past is generally used: &quot;He went out an hour ago&quot;; &quot;Columbus knew the shape of the world&quot;. However, for completed actions for which no past time frame is implied or expressed, the present perfect is normally used: &quot;I have made the dinner&quot; (i.e. the dinner is now ready). For an action in the course of taking place, or a temporary state existing, at the past time being referred to (compare uses of the present progressive above), the past progressive is used: &quot;We were sitting on the beach when...&quot; For an action that was completed before the past time being referred to, the past perfect is used: &quot;We had sat down on the blanket when...&quot;

For actions or events expected to take place in the future, the construction with &quot;will&quot; can be used: &quot;The president will arrive tomorrow.&quot; Future events are also often expressed using the &quot;be going to&quot; construction: &quot;She is going to arrive tomorrow.&quot; Planned events can also be referred to using the present progressive (&quot;She is arriving tomorrow&quot;) or, if precisely scheduled, the simple present (&quot;She arrives tomorrow&quot;). The future progressive and future perfect can be used analogously to the past equivalents: &quot;We will be sitting on the beach this afternoon&quot;; &quot;We will have left the house by 4 o&#x27;clock&quot;. However, in subordinate clauses expressing a condition or a time reference, present forms are used rather than the forms with &quot;will&quot;: &quot;If/When you get&quot; (not &quot;will get&quot;) &quot;there...&quot;

When expressing actions or events lasting up to a specified time, the appropriate perfect construction is used (with the progressive if expressing a temporary state that would generally be expressed with a progressive form): &quot;We have been having some problems lately&quot;; &quot;I have lived here for six years&quot;; &quot;We had been working since the previous evening&quot;; &quot;We will have been working for twelve hours by the time you arrive&quot;.

The use of tense and aspectual forms in condition and conditional clauses follows special patterns; see conditional mood. For use of tenses in indirect speech, see sequence of tenses. For the use of subjunctive forms, see English subjunctive.

===Non-finite forms===

The bare infinitive, identical to the base form of the verb, is used as a complement of most modal verbs and certain other verbs (&quot;I can write; &quot;They made him write; &quot;I saw you write), including in negated and inverted sentences formed using &quot;do&quot;-support (&quot;He doesn&#x27;t write; &quot;Did you write?&quot;).

Preceded by &quot;to&quot;, it forms the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive, which has a variety of uses, including as a noun phrase (To write is to learn) and as the complement of many verbs (&quot;I want to write), as well as with certain adjectives and nouns (&quot;easy to ride; &quot;his decision to leave), and in expressions of purpose (&quot;You did it to spite me).

The past participle has the following uses:
*It is used with the auxiliary &quot;have&quot; in perfect constructions: &quot;They have written; &quot;We had written before we heard the news&quot;. (With verbs of motion, an archaic form with &quot;be&quot; may be found in older texts: &quot;he is come.)
*It is used as a passive participle, with &quot;be&quot; or &quot;get&quot;, to form the passive voice: &quot;This book was written last year&quot;; &quot;Trees sometimes get gnawed down by beavers.&quot;
*It is used to form passive participial phrases, which can be used adjectivally or adverbially (&quot;a letter written on his computer; Beaten to a pulp, he was carried away&quot;) and as complements of certain verbs (&quot;I got my car mended; &quot;They had me placed on a list).
*It may be used as a simple adjective: as a passive participle in the case of transitive verbs (&quot;the written word&quot;, i.e. &quot;the word that is written&quot;), and as a perfect active participle in the case of some intransitive ones (&quot;a fallen tree&quot;, i.e. &quot;a tree that has fallen&quot;).

The present participle has the following uses:
*It is used with forms of &quot;be&quot;, in progressive (continuous) constructions: &quot;He is writing another book&quot;; &quot;I intend to be sitting on the beach&quot;. 
*It can form participial phrases, which can be used adjectivally or adverbially: &quot;The man sitting over there is drunk&quot;; Being a lawyer, I can understand this&quot;; &quot;I saw her sitting by the tree.
*It can serve as a simple adjective: &quot;It is a thrilling book.&quot;

The same form used as a gerund has the following uses:
*It forms verbal phrases that are then used as nouns: &quot;Lying in bed is my favorite hobby.&quot;
*It forms similar phrases used as a complement of certain verbs: &quot;He tried writing novels&quot;.

The logical subject of a phrase formed with a gerund can be expressed by a possessive, as in &quot;I do not like&quot; your/Jim&#x27;s &quot;drinking wine&quot;, although a non-possessive noun or pronoun is often used instead, especially in informal English: &quot;I do not like&quot; you/Jim &quot;drinking wine&quot;. The latter usage, though common, is sometimes considered ungrammatical or stylistically poor; it is given names like &quot;fused participle&quot; and &quot;geriple&quot; since it is seen to confuse a participle with a gerund. For more information see fused participle.

Gerund forms are often used as plain verbal nouns, which function grammatically like common nouns (in particular, by being qualified by adjectives rather than adverbs): &quot;He did some excellent writing&quot; (compare the gerund: &quot;He is known for writing excellently&quot;). Such verbal nouns can function, for instance, as noun adjuncts, as in &quot;a writing desk&quot;.

== Objects and complements ==
Verbs are used in certain patterns which require the presence of specific arguments in the form of objects and other complements of particular types. (A given verb may be usable in one or more of these patterns.)

A verb with a direct object is called a transitive verb. Some transitive verbs have an indirect object in addition to the direct object. Verbs used without objects are called intransitive. Both transitive and intransitive verbs may also have additional complements that are not considered objects.

A single (direct) object generally follows the verb: &quot;I love you. If there is an indirect object, it precedes the direct object (&quot;I gave him the book&quot;), although an indirect object can also be expressed with a prepositional phrase following the direct object (and this method is usual when the direct object is a personal pronoun): &quot;I gave the book to John; &quot;I bought them for you&quot;.

Other complements may include prepositional phrases, non-finite clauses and content clauses, depending on the applicable verb pattern. These complements normally follow any objects. For example:
*&quot;I insist on coming.&quot; (this use of the verb &quot;insist&quot; involves a prepositional phrase with &quot;on&quot;)
*&quot;I expect to arrive tomorrow.&quot; (this use of &quot;expect&quot; involves a to-infinitive phrase)
*&quot;I asked him whether he was coming.&quot; (this use of &quot;ask&quot; involves a direct object &quot;(him)&quot; and an interrogative content clause)

More examples can be found at Verb patterns with the gerund.

English has a number of ergative verbs: verbs which can be used either intransitively or transitively, where in the intransitive use it is the subject that is receiving the action, and in the transitive use the direct object is receiving the action while the subject is causing it. An example is &quot;sink&quot;: &quot;The ship sank&quot; (intransitive use); &quot;The explosion sank the ship&quot; (transitive use). Other common examples include &quot;open, sink, wake, melt, boil, collapse, explode, freeze, start, sell&quot;.

For more details on how verbs are built up into clauses, see English clause syntax.

==Phrasal verbs==

Many English verbs are used in particular combinations with adverbial modifiers such as &quot;on&quot;, &quot;away&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, etc. Often these combinations take on independent meanings. They are referred to as phrasal verbs. (This term may also include verbs used with a complement introduced by a particular preposition that gives it a special meaning, as in &quot;take to (someone)&quot;.)

The adverbial particle in a phrasal verb generally appears close after the verb, though it may follow the object, particularly when the object is a pronoun: &quot;Hand over the money&quot; or &quot;Hand the money over&quot;, but &quot;Hand it over&quot;.

<text>Special education (also known as special-needs education, aided education, alternative provision, exceptional student education, special ed., SDC, and SPED) is the practice of educating students in a way that accommodates their individual differences, disabilities, and special needs. This involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community, which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.

Special education aims to provide accommodated education for disabled students such as learning disabilities, learning difficulties (such as dyslexia), communication disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, physical disabilities (such as osteogenesis imperfecta, down syndrome, lissencephaly, Sanfilippo syndrome, and muscular dystrophy), developmental disabilities (such as autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disabilities) and other disabilities. Disabled students are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, a resource room, or a separate classroom.

Some scholars of education may categorize gifted education under the umbrella of &quot;special education&quot;, but this pedagogical approach is different from special education because of the students&#x27; capabilities. Intellectual giftedness is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialized teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term &quot;special education&quot; is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of disabled students.

Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with learning disabilities, remedial education can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why. For example, if a person&#x27;s education was disrupted, for example, by internal displacement during civil disorder or a war.

In most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments. Integration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many students.

The opposite of special education is general education, also known as mainstream education. General education is the standard curriculum presented without special teaching methods or supports. Sometimes special education classrooms and general special education classrooms mix. This is called an inclusive classroom.

==History==

In the past, most students with special needs have been excluded from school. On November 19, 1975, The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was passed by President Gerald Ford. The IDEA law provides free appropriate education with services to individuals with disabilities. Such exclusion still affects about 23 million disabled children worldwide, particularly in poor, rural areas of developing countries. National Special Needs Day is celebrated every December 9th of the year.

==Identifying students or learners with special needs==
Some children are easily identified as candidates for special needs due to their medical history. For example, they may have been diagnosed with a genetic condition that is associated with intellectual disability, may have various forms of brain damage, may have a developmental disorder, may have visual or hearing disabilities, or other disabilities.

On the other hand, for students with less obvious disabilities, such as those who have borderline intellectual disability or specific learning difficulties (dyslexia, dyscalculia, etc.), two primary methods have been used for identifying them: the &quot;discrepancy model&quot; and the &quot;response to intervention model&quot;. The discrepancy model depends on the teacher noticing that the students&#x27; achievements are noticeably below what is expected, at which point the teacher may make the decision for the student to receive support from a special education specialist. Before doing so, the teacher must show documentation of low academic achievement. The response to intervention model advocates earlier intervention.

In the discrepancy model, a student receives special education services for a specific learning difficulty (SLD) if the student has at least normal intelligence and the student&#x27;s academic achievement is below what is expected of a student with his or her IQ. Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach (e.g., Aaron, 1995, Flanagan and Mascolo, 2005) among researchers. One reason for criticism is that diagnosing SLDs on the basis of the discrepancy between achievement and IQ does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who also have low IQ appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who have normal or high intelligence.

The alternative approach, response to intervention, identifies children who are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a reading remediation program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this area and not in music or sports.

==Individual needs==

A special education program should be customized to address each student&#x27;s needs. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with various disabilities receive multiple degrees of support based on their individual needs. It is crucial for special education programs to be individualized so that they address the unique combination of needs in a given student.

In the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals use a student&#x27;s Individualized Education Program (IEP). Another name for a student&#x27;s Individualized Education Plan is a student&#x27;s Individual Learning Plan (ILP).

&quot;The IEP is meant to address each child&#x27;s unique learning issues and include specific educational goals. It is a legally binding document [in the US]. The school must provide everything it promises in the IEP.&quot;

In the US, for children who are not yet three years old, an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) contains information on the child&#x27;s present level of development in all areas; outcomes for the child and family; and services the child and family will receive to help them achieve the outcomes.

In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal law that requires every school system to provide a free and appropriate public education for every child, ages 3 to 22, regardless of how or how seriously that child may be disabled. To ensure that this federal law is obeyed, the government requires every school system provide this type of education to each student in order to receive federal funding. This changed a little in 2004 when the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) decided to update the law. After the law was updated into the Disabilities Education Improvement Act, the ability to identify special needs children and give them the appropriate education environment was improved.

Students with all forms of special needs are assessed to determine their specific strengths and weaknesses. The earlier these students with special needs are assessed, the faster they get the accommodations that they need, and the better it is for their education. Placement, resources, and goals are determined on the basis of the student&#x27;s needs. Accommodations and modifications to the regular program may include changes in the curriculum, supplementary aids or equipment, and the provision of specialized physical adaptations that allow students to participate in the educational environment as much as possible. Students may need this help to access subject matter, physically gain access to the school, or meet their emotional needs. For example, if the assessment determines that the student cannot write by hand because of a physical disability, then the school might provide a computer for typing assignments, or allow the student to answer questions verbally instead. If the school determines that the student is severely distracted by the normal activities in a large, busy classroom, then the student might be placed in a smaller classroom such as a separate classroom or resource room.

Parents of students with a learning disability must be aware of what type of disability their child has, so they can get access to accommodations such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education. For example, if a student takes an academic test and it indicates that the student struggles with reading comprehension, parents can request speech and language support or classroom accommodations, such as extra time to complete reading and writing tasks.

==Methods of provision==
In most developed countries, schools use different approaches to providing special education services to students. These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to how much contact the student with special needs has with non-disabled students (using North American terminology):

* Inclusion&quot;:&quot; In this approach, students with special needs spend all, or most of the school day with students who do not have special needs. Due to the fact that inclusion can require substantial modification of the general curriculum, most schools use it only for selected students with mild to moderate special needs, which is accepted as a best practice. Specialized services may be provided inside or outside the regular classroom, depending on the type of service. Students may occasionally leave the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a separate classroom, resource room, or to receive other related services that might require specialised equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class, such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, rehabilitation counseling. They might also leave the regular classroom for services that require privacy, such as counseling sessions with a social worker.
* &quot;Mainstreaming&quot; refers to the practice of educating students with special needs in classes with non-disabled students during specific time periods based on their skills. Students with special needs are segregated in separate classrooms exclusively for students with special needs for the rest of the school day.
* Segregation in a separate classroom or special school for students with special needs: In this model, students with special needs do not attend classes with non-disabled students. Segregated students may attend the same school where regular classes are provided, but spend all instructional time exclusively in a separate classroom for students with various disabilities. If their special class is located in an ordinary school, they may be provided opportunities for social integration outside the classroom, such as by eating meals with non-disabled students. Alternatively, these students may attend a special school. It may also occur when a student is in hospital, housebound, or detained by the criminal justice system. These students may receive one-on-one instruction or group instruction. Students who have been suspended or expelled are not considered segregated in this sense.

* Co-teaching: In this setting, disabled students are placed in a general education classroom to learn along with their disabled peers and non-disabled peers. A general education teacher and a special education teacher work as partners in instruction. Types of co-teaching include &quot;one teaching/one helping&quot; in which one teacher instructs while the other circulates around the class to evaluate and offer help, &quot;parallel teaching&quot; in which both teachers teach the same content to two groups of students of equal size, &quot;station teaching&quot; in which both teachers present differing content to different groups of students simultaneously and students rotate through each station, &quot;alternative teaching&quot; in which one teacher works with a smaller group or individual students while the other works with the rest of the class, and &quot;team teaching&quot; in which both teachers plan and teach a lesson together.

===Effective instruction for disabled students===

* &quot;Goal-directed&quot;: Each child must have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that distinguishes their particular needs. The child must get the services that are designed for them. These services will allow them to reach their annual goals which will be assessed at the end of each term along with short-term goals that will be assessed every few months.
* &quot;Research-based methods&quot;: A lot of research has been done regarding disabled students and the best way to teach them. Testing, IQs, interviews, the discrepancy model, etc. should all be used to determine where to place the child. Once that is determined, the next step is the best way for the child to learn. There are a number of different programs such as the Wilson Reading Program and Direct Instruction.
* &quot;Guided by student performance&quot;: While the IEP goals may be assessed every few months to a year, constant informal assessments must take place. These assessments will guide instruction for the teacher. The teacher will be able to determine if the material is too difficult or too easy.

===Special schools===
A special school is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to learning difficulties, physical disabilities, or behavioral problems. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools.

Special schools provide individualized education, addressing specific needs. Student to teacher ratios are kept low, often 6:1 or lower depending upon the needs of the children. Special schools will also have other facilities for children with special needs, such as soft play areas, sensory rooms, or swimming pools, which are necessary for treating students with certain conditions.

In recent times, places available in special schools are declining as more children with special needs are educated in mainstream schools. However, there will always be some children, whose learning needs cannot be appropriately met in a regular classroom setting and will require specialized education and resources to provide the level of support they require. An example of a disability that may require a student to attend a special school is intellectual disability. However, this practice is often frowned upon by school districts in the US in the light of the least restrictive environment as mandated in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

An alternative is a special unit or special classroom, also called a self-contained classroom, which is a separate classroom dedicated solely to the education of students with special needs within a larger school that also provides general education. This classroom is typically staffed by a specially trained teacher, who provides specific, individualized instruction to individuals and small groups of students with special needs. Separate classrooms, because they are located in a general education school, may have students who remain in the separate classroom full-time, or students who are mainstreamed in certain general education classes. An alternative to the separate classroom full-time for a student would be a one-to-one aide in the general education setting. In the United States, a one-on-one aide for a student with a disability is called a paraprofessional. In the United States a part-time alternative that is appropriate for some students is sometimes called a resource room. Another alternative would be attending a separate classroom for a specific subject such as social studies.

Seclusion is the practice of involuntarily locking a student in an isolated room, utility closet or office alone without the ability to leave until school staff allows. The use of a seclusion room is often misused as a form of punishment for disrespecting staff or leaving the classroom.

====History of special schools====
One of the first special schools in the world was the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles in Paris, which was founded in 1784. It was the first school in the world to teach blind students. The first school in U.K. for the Deaf was established 1760 in Edinburgh by Thomas Braidwood, with education for visually impaired people beginning in the Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765.

In the 19th century, people with disabilities and the inhumane conditions where they were supposedly housed and educated were addressed in the literature of Charles Dickens. Dickens characterized people with severe disabilities as having the same, if not more, compassion and insight in &quot;Bleak House&quot; and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;.

Such attention to the downtrodden conditions of people with disabilities brought resulted in reforms in Europe including the re-evaluation of special schools. In the United States reform came more slowly. Throughout the mid half of the 20th century, special schools, termed institutions, were not only accepted, but encouraged. Disabled students were housed with people with mental illnesses, and they were not educated much, if at all.

Deinstitutionalization proceeded in the US beginning in the 1970s following the exposes of the institutions, and it has taken sometime before the Education for All Handicapped Children&#x27;s Act of 1974, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and then Individuals with Disabilities Educational Improvement Act (IDEIA) have come into fruition. School integration was supported as early as the 1970s, and teacher preparation programs in higher education have carefully taught and instructed graduates on inclusion at the classroom, individual, school, and district levels for decades resulting in dual certification of &quot;regular teachers&quot;.

With the Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997, school districts in the United States began to slowly integrate students with moderate and severe special needs into regular school systems. This changed the form and function of special education services in many school districts and special schools subsequently saw a steady decrease in enrollment as districts weighed the cost per student. It also posed general funding dilemmas to certain local schools and districts, changed how schools view assessments, and formally introduced the concept of inclusion to many educators, students and parents.

==Instructional strategies==

The student can be taught in either a classroom or outside environment. Both environments can be interactive for the student to engage better with the subject. Different instructional techniques are used for some students with special educational needs. Instructional strategies are classified as being either &quot;accommodations&quot; or &quot;modifications&quot;.

===Accommodation===
An &quot;accommodation&quot; is a reasonable adjustment to teaching practices so that the student learns the same material, but in a format that is more accessible to the student. Accommodations may be classified by whether they change the presentation, response, setting, or scheduling of lessons. For example, the school may accommodate a student with visual impairments by providing a large-print textbook. This is a presentation accommodation. 

;Examples of accommodations
* Response accommodations: Typing homework assignments rather than hand-writing them (considered a modification if the subject is learning to write by hand). Having someone else write down answers given verbally.
* Presentation accommodations: Examples include listening to audiobooks rather than reading printed books. These may be used as substitutes for the text, or as supplements intended to improve the students&#x27; reading fluency and phonetic skills. Similar options include designating a person to read to the student, or providing text to speech software. This is considered a modification if the purpose of the assignment is reading skills acquisition. Other presentation accommodations may include designating a person to take notes during lectures or using a talking calculator rather than one with only a visual display.
* Setting accommodations: Taking a test in a quieter room. Moving the class to a room that is physically accessible, e.g., on the first floor of a building or near an elevator. Arranging seating assignments to benefit the student, e.g., by sitting at the front of the classroom.
* Scheduling accommodations: Students may be given rest breaks or extended time on tests (may be considered a modification, if speed is a factor in the test). Use a timer to help with time management. Students with a disability that can flare up unexpectedly may be allowed to turn in an assignment or take a test shortly after the episode has resolved. This system, called &quot;flexible deadlines&quot;, treats an occasional, unexpected episode of illness or incapacity caused by a disability similar to an equivalent episode of an unexpected viral infection. These students or their families should inform the teachers of the problem and turn in the missed work soon after the student is well enough to return to school (typically, one to three days after the return to class).
* Students can be offered a flexible setting in which to take tests. These settings can be a new location to provide for minimal distractions.

All developed countries permit or require some degree of accommodation for students with special needs, and special provisions are usually made in examinations which take place at the end of formal schooling.

===Modification===
A &quot;modification&quot; changes or adapts the material to make it simpler. Modifications may change what is learned, how difficult the material is, what level of mastery the student is expected to achieve, whether or how the student is assessed, or any other aspect of the curriculum. For example, the school may modify a reading assignment for a student with reading difficulties by substituting a shorter, easier book. A student may receive both accommodations and modifications.

;Examples of modifications
* Skipping subjects: Students may be taught less information than typical students, skipping over material that the school deems inappropriate for the student&#x27;s abilities or less important than other subjects. For example, students with poor fine motor skills may be taught to print block letters, but not cursive handwriting.
* Simplified assignments: Students may read the same literature as their peers but have a simpler version, such as Shakespeare with both the original text and a modern paraphrase available.
* Shorter assignments: Students may do shorter homework assignments or take shorter tests.
* Extra aids: If students have deficiencies in working memory, a list of vocabulary words, called a &quot;word bank&quot;, can be provided during tests, to reduce lack of recall and increase chances of comprehension. Students might use a calculator when other students do not.
* Extended time: Students with a slower processing speed may benefit from extended time for assignments and/or tests in order to have more time to comprehend questions, recall information, and synthesize knowledge.

===Non-academic services===
In addition to how the student is taught the academic curriculum, schools may provide non-academic services to the student. These are intended ultimately to increase the student&#x27;s personal and academic abilities. Related services include developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a student with learning disabilities and includes speech and language pathology, audiology, psychological services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, counseling services, music therapy, including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, medical services as defined by regulations, parent counseling and training, school health services, school social work, assistive technology, other appropriate developmental or corrective support services, appropriate access to recreation and other support services. In some countries, most related services are provided by the schools; in others, they are provided by the normal healthcare and social services systems.

As an example, students who have poor impulse control, behavioral challenges, or are autistic may learn self-management techniques, be kept closely on a comfortingly predictable schedule, or given extra cues to signal activities.

A university field, termed &quot;severe disabilities&quot;, also is taught throughout the US university sector in schools of education. Advanced instruction is based upon community-referenced instruction, and alignment with transition to adulthood and progressive community practices.

Rehabilitation counseling personnel are often association with supported employment services, and typically with &quot;transition to adulthood&quot; in which multi-decade recommendations for better coordination between the school and the community service sectors have been made at the federal and university levels.

== Integrating technology in special education classrooms ==
=== Autism ===
Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), refers to a range of conditions. These conditions involve challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. They also involve unique strengths and differences.

Autism is a disability that impairs the social interactions and communication skills of a person. People who are autistic tend to think and act differently from others. Many autistic children find themselves comfortable with a device in their hands. For students with autism, there are apps called &quot;visual scene displays&quot; that are most helpful for children who are having difficulty with verbal skills, according to Jules Csillag, a speech–language pathologist who focuses on special ed tech. Apps such as SceneSpeak and Speech with Milo help autistic children develop storytelling skills with text-to-speech voice and interactive storybooks. Using apps like these in a classroom can improve autistic student&#x27;s verbal skills.

There are several controversies surrounding the diagnoses and causes of autism. It is now believed that there is no single cause of autism. Research seems to suggest that autism is normally the result of both genetic and environmental influences.

=== Down syndrome ===
If a student has Down syndrome, assistive technology can help with their learning experience. Author of &quot;Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together,&quot; Terry Hassold, who got his PhD in human genetics, explains that students with Down syndrome have delays with cognitive ability. Their brains have a late reaction when their neurological system sends a message for any task. Because of this late reaction, they tend to take longer to complete a task than an average student. Assistive technology is crucial in helping students with Down syndrome with their writing ability. Children with Down syndrome tend to have shorter fingers and a lowered thumb making their ability to write more difficult. Also, some of the usual wrist bones are not formed, making it difficult to hold objects. Slanted desks are one type of assisted technology that can aid in the successful ability to write. A three-ring binder can be used to create a slanted desk by turning the binder sideways. Also, students with Down syndrome often try to hold their pencils by anchoring them against the thumb rather than using the tip of their thumb. Shortened pencils or triangular-shaped pencils encourage students to hold them correctly. Using any of these assistive technologies can help students with Down syndrome during their educational process.

== Special education and sports ==
=== Benefits ===
Many people with special needs are denied when they want to participate in a sport. In the U.S., the Office for Civil Rights ensures students with disabilities always have opportunities to participate in extracurricular athletics equal to other students. Special education students can benefit from sports in many ways. For example, studies show it boosts self confidence and improves the participant&#x27;s skills in relationship building and working as part of a team.

=== Types of sports ===
Almost any sport can be altered for special education purposes. Some of the popular sports are swimming, wheelchair soccer, handball, gymnastics, and weightlifting.

=== Organizations and programs ===
Many competitive organizations are available for special needs student athletes. For example, the Special Olympics is an annual, world-wide competition held for intellectually disabled children that want to participate in sports. Other organizations include the Paralympic Games and Unified Sports, the latter which pairs participants with and without intellectual disabilities on the same team. Educational institutions can also promote Adapted Physical Education, which tailors sports for students with certain disabilities. Organizations like S.T.R.I.D.E. Adaptive Sports help educational institutions in providing opportunities for special education student athletes. Some of these sports might include wheelchair basketball or sledge hockey.

Some sports even have their own organizations. For example, in baseball athletes can participate in the Miracle League or Little League Challenger Division. Another organization that soccer athletes can participate in US Youth Soccer TOPSoccer or Just for Kicks.

Other sports which can be played or adapted include track and field, quad rugby, tennis, bowling, and skiing.

==Impact==
A 2021 study that examined the impact of a sharp reduction in the provision of special education services in Texas found that this policy change substantially reduced the high school completion rates and college enrollment rates of the students who were denied access to special education.

==Criticism==

===Access to special education===
Disabled children are often denied their right to education. The collection of data on children with disabilities is not straightforward, but data are vital to ensure that policies are in place to address the constraints these children face.

By one estimate, 93 million children under age 14, or 5.1% of the world&#x27;s children, were living with a &#x27;moderate or severe disability&#x27; in 2004. According to the World Health Survey, in 14 of 15 low and middle income countries, disabled people of working age were about one-third less likely to have completed primary school. For example, in Bangladesh, 30% of people with disabilities had completed primary school, compared with 48% of those with no disabilities. The corresponding shares were 43% and 57% in Zambia; 56% and 72% in Paraguay.

It has been shown that children with a higher risk of disability are far more likely to be denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, Bhutan and Iraq, children with mental impairments were most likely to be denied this right. In Iraq, for instance, 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds with no risk of disability had never been to school in 2006, but 19% of those at risk of having a hearing impairment and 51% of those who were at higher risk of mental disability had never been to school. In Thailand, almost all 6- to 9-year-olds who had no disability had been to school in 2005–2006, and yet 34% of those with walking or moving impairments had never been to school.

Disabled children require access to services that can support them throughout their time in school, such as more individual attention from instructors. According to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, about 2% of children with disabilities have access to these services. Those without access to these services are excluded from education and unable to attend school. Due to the need of certain services and facilities, the estimated cost of providing education for a disabled child is 2.3 times higher than a child without disabilities. Given the poverty levels in a variety of developing countries, the education of children with disabilities does not become a priority. Children with physical disabilities are less likely to attend school in comparison with students who do not have a disability and children with an intellectual ability are even less likely than children with physical disabilities. In the Global South, 90% of children with some form of disability do not receive any form of structured education. While current initiatives toward inclusive education internationally have been implemented, such as the Education for All program, some countries in the Global South still challenge the lack of ability to provide children with disabilities access to education due to issues such as lack of resources and schools being overcrowded.

One large issue are limited resources enabling individuals with special needs to receive an education in the developing world. As a consequence, 98 percent of children with special needs in developing countries do not have access to education. Funding cuts can affect special education students who don&#x27;t have access to proper equipment or education. The National Coalition for Personal Shortages did a survey and almost 100% of the teachers said that they are not able to give the proper rights to disabled children. Teachers are getting cut off from work due to the budget cuts. There is a financial debate that covers the use and allotment of special education government funding. The three views on this topic are that too much money is already spent, not enough money is being spent, or that the money that is given is not spent properly. The argument for the first is that the amount of money spent on one special needs child is enough to cover a large group of general education students, and sometimes even causes several students to experience budget cuts on general programs to support one child. The evidence for special education not having enough money is the lack of teachers, burnt-out teachers and a limited variety of teaching tools for each student. The argument to spend the money differently states that there is a lot of money set aside, but that it is being wasted by spending too much time on paperwork, inefficient IEP meetings or spending money on things that do not actually benefit the child.

===Eligibility criteria===
Some parents, advocates, and students have concerns about the eligibility criteria and their application. In some cases, parents and students protest the students&#x27; placement into special education programs. For example, a student may be placed into the special education programs due to a mental health condition such as obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, panic attacks or ADHD, while the student and his parents believe that the condition is adequately managed through medication and outside therapy. In other cases, students whose parents believe they require the additional support of special education services are denied participation in the program based on the eligibility criteria.

Whether it is useful and appropriate to attempt to educate the most severely disabled children, such as children who are in a persistent vegetative state, is debated. While many severely disabled children can learn simple tasks, such as pushing a buzzer when they want attention, some children may be incapable of learning. Some parents and advocates say that these children would be better served by substituting improved physical care for any academic program. In other cases, they question whether teaching such non-academic subjects, such as pushing a buzzer, is properly the job of the school system, rather than the health care system.

===Inclusion===
The practice of inclusion in mainstream classrooms has been criticized by advocates and some parents of children with special needs because some of these students require instructional methods that differ dramatically from typical classroom methods. Critics assert that it is not possible to deliver effectively two or more very different instructional methods in the same classroom. As a result, the educational progress of students who depend on different instructional methods to learn often fall even further behind their peers.

Parents of typically developing children sometimes fear that the special needs of a single &quot;fully included&quot; student will take critical levels of attention and energy away from the rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.

Linked to this, there is debate about the extent to which disabled students, whether in mainstream or special settings, should have a specific pedagogy, based on the scientific study of particular diagnostic categories, or whether general instructional techniques are relevant to all students including those with special needs.

===Watered-down===
Some special education classes such as separate classroom and resource room have been criticized for a watered-down curriculum.

===At-risk students===
At-risk students with educational needs that are not associated with a disability are often placed in classes with disabled students. Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as disabled students may impede the educational progress of disabled people.

===Seclusion and restraint practices===
The use of seclusion and restraint practices is a highly controversial practice in the special education system involving the physical restraint of students or involuntarily locking students in seclusion rooms.

==National approaches==
===Africa===
====Nigeria====
The Federal Ministry of Education constituted a committee to develop exclusively the first broad -based National Policy on Special Needs Education (SNE) in Nigeria. The constitution of the drafting committee with the mandate to formulate a national policy on special-needs education gave birth to the National Situation Analysis Report. This implies that the status has changed to a national policy on special education in 2015 (an expanded version), thereby widening its scope and activities.

====South Africa====
White papers in 1995 and 2001 discuss special education in the country. Local schools are given some independent authority.

Both modifications and accommodations are recommended, depending on the student&#x27;s individual needs.

===Asia===
====China====

China holds the largest system of education in the world and features a state run public school system under the order of the Ministry of Education.
====Iran====
For special needs children Education bureau has a , Behzisti helps operate some trainable rehabilitation and empowerment schools too.

====Japan====
Japanese students with special needs are placed in one of four different school arrangements: special schools, special classrooms with another school, in resource rooms (which are called ), or in regular classrooms. Some local areas such as Koto Ward in Tokyo are expanding these (or, , &quot;classrooms&quot;) to cover all junior high schools within the next few years.

Special schools are reserved for students with severe disabilities who cannot be accommodated in their local school. They do not use the same grading or marking systems as mainstream schools, but instead assess students according to their individualized plans.

Special classes are similar, and may vary the national curriculum as the teachers see fit. are resource rooms that students with milder difficulties use part-time for specialized instruction individually in small groups. These students spend the rest of the day in the mainstream classroom. Some students with special needs are fully included in the mainstream classroom, with accommodations or modifications as needed.

Depending on the local authority, state elementary schools may also hold a (, &#x27;close friends&#x27;) class group in addition to the six grades, where students who struggle to adapt to mainstream classrooms are gathered and given life skills as well as completing their studies at a more adaptable pace. This is different to in that although all-school activities are regularly held together, the majority of time is spent as a class.

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student&#x27;s disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more disabled students.

====Pakistan====

After independence (1947), Pakistan had to face some serious challenges, due to which no proper emphasis was given to special education and even education. Among other reasons, lack of resources, financial as well as human, was the major one in this context. The need and importance of special education was felt in different educational policies of Pakistan in different times. At the first time, in its report, the Commission on National Education (1959) highlighted the importance of special education. After that the Education Policy (1972) and the National Policy and Implementation Programme (1979) gave some importance to this sector. The same was also reflected in different medium-term (five-year) plans. This was felt more seriously when the Directorate General of Special Education, Islamabad formulated a draft National Policy for Special Education in 1986 and revised it in 1988 to bring it in line with the emerging needs of the disabled population. After that a special education policy was launched in 1999. The Government of Pakistan has launched a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities in 2002, which is dynamically being implemented.
====Singapore====
Special education is regulated centrally by the Singapore Ministry of Education. Both special schools and integration into mainstream schools are options for students with special educational needs, but most disabled students are placed in special schools.

Disabled students who want accommodations on national exams must provide appropriate documentation to prove that they are disabled. Accommodations, but not modifications (e.g., simpler questions) are normally approved if they are similar to the accommodations already being used in everyday schoolwork, with the goal of maintaining the exam&#x27;s integrity while not having students unfairly disadvantaged by factors that are unrelated to what is being tested. The accommodations are listed on the Primary School Leaving Exam.

===Australia===
Australian Association of Special Education Inc (AASE)&#x27;s position is informed by the Disability Standards for Education 2005 which require that disabled students are treated on the same basis as other students in regards to enrollment and participation in education.

With respect to standardized tests, special consideration procedures are in place in all states for disabled students. Students must provide documentation. Not all desired forms of accommodations are available. For example, students who cannot read, even if the inability to read is due to a disability, cannot have the exam read to them, because the exam results should accurately show that the student is unable to read. Reports on matriculation exams do not mention whether the student received any accommodations in taking the test.

===Europe===
Each country in Europe has its own special education support structures. Thirty-one European countries are covered by the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education.

====Bulgaria====
====Czech Republic====
Schools must take students&#x27; special education needs into account when assessing their achievements. Disabled students are normally included in their neighborhood school, although may be placed in special schools.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, 99% of students with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia are educated alongside students without any learning challenges.

====Finland====
Schools adapt the national guidelines to the needs of individual students. Students with special educational needs are given an individualized plan.

They may be exempted from some parts of school examinations, such as students with hearing impairments not taking listening comprehension tests. If the student receives modifications to the school-leaving exams, this is noted on the certificate of achievement. If they are not following the national core curriculum, then they are tested according to the goals of their individual educational program.

====France====
According to the 11 February 2005 Law, all children have the right to be enrolled in their neighborhood school, although children may be placed in medico-social institutions if their personalized plan calls for it. Each student&#x27;s personalized school plan describes teaching methods, psychological, medical and paramedical services that the school will provide to the student. 

The different paths available for children with disabilities at school in France are:

* Mainstream school: either with a one-on-one or mutalized aid, and/or with material or technical support.
* ULIS (): within mainstream schools, students are separated in a special class and given an adapted curriculum according to their specific needs.

Outside of the school system, children may also attend different types of medico-social institutions run by private organizations or charities paid for by the healthcare system. These include:

* IME (&quot;instituts médicoéducatifs&quot;) for intellectual disabilities and/or autism 
* IEM () for motor disabilities without intellectual disability
* ITEP () for disabilities that do not include intellectual disability
* UEMA () and UEEA () which are medico-social classrooms within mainstream schools for children with autism from ages 3–6 and 6–12 respectively.

====Germany====
Most students with disabilities in Germany attend a special school that serves only children with special needs. These include:
* (special school for learning disabilities): for children who have challenges that impair learning
* (school for cognitive development): for children with very severe learning challenges
* (school for emotional and social development): for children who have special emotional needs
* (school for the blind): for blind children
* (school for the visually impaired): for children who are visually disabled
* (school for the deaf): for deaf children
* (school for the hearing impaired): for children who are hearing impaired
* (school for children with physical disabilities): for children with physical disabilities
* (school for children with language disorders): for children with language disorders
* (school for the deafblind): for children who are deafblind
* (school for ill children): for children who are too ill to attend school or are hospitalized for a longer period of time.
* (school for children with severe and multiple disabilities): for children with severe and multiple disabilities who need very special care and attention. Sometimes these children are only susceptible for very basic emotional and sensory stimulation. Thus teachers at these school (as well as at schools for the deafblind) are highly specialized professionals.

One in 21 German students attends a special school. Teachers at those schools are specially trained professionals who have specialized in special needs education while in university. Special schools often have a very favorable student-teacher ratio and facilities other schools do not have.

Some special needs children in Germany do not attend a special school, but are educated in a mainstream school such as a &quot;Hauptschule&quot; or &quot;Gesamtschule&quot; (comprehensive school).

Students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests.

====Greece====
Greek students with special needs may attend either mainstream schools or special schools.

Students whose disabilities have been certified may be exempted from some standardized tests or given alternative tests. Accommodations are responsive to students&#x27; needs; for example, students with visual impairments may take oral tests, and students with hearing impairments take written tests. Accommodations and modifications are noted on the certificate of achievement.

====Hungary====
Special education is regulated centrally.

According to the 1993 Act on Public Education, students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests. They have a right to extra time, a choice of formats for the tests (e.g., oral rather than written), and any equipment that they normally use during the school day.

As of 2006, disabled students received a significant bonus (eight points) on the university entrance examination, which has been criticized as unfair.

====Republic of Ireland====
The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) supports students with physical and intellectual disabilities.

====The Netherlands====
As a general rule, students with special educational needs are integrated into their regular, mainstream schools with appropriate support, under the &quot;Going to School Together&quot; policy (). Four types of disability-specific special schools exist. The national policy is moving towards &quot;suitable education&quot; (), based on the individual&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses.

A strong emphasis is placed on the specific needs and positive capabilities of the individual, rather than on limitations. Disabilities are normally documented by experts.

====Norway====
The National Support System for Special Needs Education (Statped) is managed by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training. The general objective for Statped is to give guidance and support to those in charge of the education in municipalities and county administrations to ensure that children, young people and adults with major and special educational needs are secured well-advised educational and developmental provisions. The institutions affiliated with Statped offer a broad spectrum of services. Statped consists of 13 resource centres owned by the state, and four units for special education, where Statped buys services. These centres offer special educational guidance and support for local authorities and county administrations.

====Portugal====
Disabled students have a &quot;guaranteed right&quot; to appropriate accommodations on assessments. Schools are generally considered autonomous.

====Slovenia====
On national tests, the National Examination Center normally grants most requests for accommodations that are supported by the local school&#x27;s examination committee. Legislation opposes the use of modifications that would be unfair to non-disabled students.

====Spain====
Schools are required to provide services and resources to students with special educational needs so that they make progress and participate in school. If the local school is unable to provide appropriately for an individual student, then the student may be transferred to a special school.

Spanish non-governmental organizations like ONCE have traditionally provided significant services to disabled students.

====Sweden====
Local schools have significant autonomy, based on national guidelines. Schools are expected to help students meet the goals that are set for them.

There are special schools () for students with low abilities to attend normal education. In 2012 and 2013, the media criticized how students with disabilities that are considered more mild, such as dyslexia, have been placed in special schools, saying that this may seriously hamper their chances on the labour market.

====Switzerland====
Education is controlled by the 26 cantons, and so special education programs vary from place to place. However, integration is typical. Students are assessed according to their individual learning goals.

====Turkey====
At a young age students who have special needs in Turkey are provided special education from The Ministry of Education, who are responsible in giving them the education that they need.

In order to get special education you are required certain things:
* Residency certificate
* Written application by the parents to the school administration
* Personal development report of the child (if already registered)
* Child&#x27;s health report from the hospital.
All special-needs students receive an Individualized Education Program (BEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student&#x27;s individual needs. The Özel Eğitim Kurumları Yönetmeliği (ÖEKY) requires that students with special needs be provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment that is appropriate to the student&#x27;s needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a special school.

The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student&#x27;s individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student&#x27;s potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as speech therapy, if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 10 percent of all school-aged children currently receive some type of special education services.

As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.

Poor people and refugees are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, &quot;thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education.&quot; Teacher efficacy, tolerance, gender, and years of experience and special education referrals.

====United Kingdom====

In England and Wales, the acronym &quot;SEN&quot; (for Special Educational Needs) denotes the condition of having special educational needs, the services which provide the support and the programmes and staff which implement the education. In England &quot;SEN PPS&quot; refers to the Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Service. &quot;SENAS&quot; is the special educational needs assessment service, which is part of the Local Authority. &quot;SENCO&quot; refers to a special educational needs coordinator, who usually works with schools and the children within schools who have special educational needs. The Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Services help parents with the planning and delivery of their child&#x27;s educational provision. The Department for Education oversees special education in England.

Most students have an individual educational plan, but students may have a group plan in addition to, or instead of, an individual plan. Group plans are used when a group of students all have similar goals.

In Scotland the Additional Support Needs Act places an obligation on education authorities to meet the needs of all students in consultation with other agencies and parents. In Scotland the term Special Educational Needs (SEN), and its variants are not official terminology although the very recent implementation of the Additional Support for Learning Act means that both &quot;SEN&quot; and &quot;ASN&quot; (Additional Support Needs) are used interchangeably in current common practice.

=== Latin America ===
Before 1978, little action was taken to educate disabled children in Colombia. Children would be left home without much interaction with the outside world. In 1985, special education was researched across the country and education programs were created. After 1990, disabled people were given access to public school classes. Awareness and recognition of this group&#x27;s educational rights led to an increase in advocacy for accessibility for disabled children. While there have been improvements, development of special education programs and special education policy is still slow.

==== Colombia ====
Statistics from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) state that there are 2,624,898 disabled people who reside in Colombia, representing 6.3% of the country&#x27;s population. According to 2010 research 90% of disabled students in Colombia did not attend a mainstream school, and only 26% of them are able to attend school at all.

The history of special education in Colombia can be categorized into three time periods: the period of neglect, the period of diagnosis and planning, and the emergence of special education. The period of planning ran from the years 1978 to the year 1990. The Ministry of Colombia in 1995 implemented a national plan for the development of special education called . The purposes of the plan were to create a national diagnosis of special education and to initiate programs for individuals with disabilities. In 1994, the Ministry of education put the first law into action to introduce special classes in public schools that include disabled students, called Law 115. In 2011, Colombia entered into the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities, an agreement among the United Nations Education Scientific and Culture Organization (UNESCO) to protect people living with disabilities.

The most recent development of special education in Colombia was Article 11 of Law 1618, which was passed in 2013. The law states that &quot;the Ministry of Education will define the policy and regulate the scheme of education for persons with special educational needs, promoting educational access and quality under a system based on inclusion in the educational services&quot;. The Colombian government has also made financial strides into special education, investing over $12.3 million in 2015.

===North America===
In North America, special education is commonly abbreviated as &quot;special ed&quot;, &quot;SpecEd&quot;, &quot;SPED&quot;, or &quot;SpEd&quot; in a professional context.

====Canada====
Education in Canada is the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories. As such, rules vary somewhat from place to place. However, inclusion is the dominant model.

For major exams, Canadian schools commonly use accommodations, such as specially printed examinations for visually impaired students, when assessing the achievements of students with special needs. In other instances, disabled students may receive alternative assessments or modifications that simplify tests, or they may be exempted from the tests entirely.

====United States====

All special-needs students receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student&#x27;s individual needs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment that is appropriate to the student&#x27;s needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as receiving special education services at home or hospital.

The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student&#x27;s individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student&#x27;s potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as speech therapy, if the student needs these services.

Educators working in special education must meet specific credentialing requirements, which vary by state. In California, for example, teachers pursue specialized certification pathways to address diverse student needs in inclusive and specialized settings.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 6 million children (roughly 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services. As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services. Poor, black and Latino urban schools are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, &quot;thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education.&quot;

During the 1960s, in some part due to the civil rights movement, some researchers began to study the disparity of education amongst people with disabilities. The landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision, which declared unconstitutional the &quot;separate but equal&quot; arrangements in public schools for students of different races, paved the way for &quot;PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&quot; and &quot;Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia&quot;, which challenged the segregation of students with special needs. Courts ruled that unnecessary and inappropriate segregation of disabled students was unconstitutional. Congress responded to these court rulings with the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975 (since renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)). This law required schools to provide services to students previously denied access to an appropriate education.

In US government-run schools, the dominant model is inclusion. In the United States, three out of five students with academic learning challenges spend the overwhelming majority of their time in the regular classroom.

<text>Thomas Jacob Hilfiger ( ; born March 24, 1951) is an American fashion designer and the founder of Tommy Hilfiger Corporation.

After starting his career by co-founding a chain of jeans/fashion stores called People&#x27;s Place in upstate New York in the 1970s, he began designing preppy clothing for his own eponymous menswear line in the 1980s. The company later expanded into women&#x27;s clothing and various luxury items such as perfumes and went public in 1992. 

Hilfiger&#x27;s collections are often influenced by the fashion of music subcultures and marketed in connection with the music industry, with celebrities such as American R&amp;B artist Aaliyah in the 1990s. In 2005, contestants in the CBS reality show &quot;The Cut&quot; competed for a design job with Hilfiger in a similar fashion to &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. In 2006, Hilfiger sold his company for $1.6 billion to Apax Partners, who next sold it in 2010 to Phillips-Van Heusen for $3 billion. He remains the company&#x27;s principal designer, leading the design teams and overseeing the entire creative process. In 2012, Hilfiger was awarded the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.

==Business and fashion career==
Hilfiger graduated from the Elmira Free Academy high school in 1969. His parents wanted him to get a college education and pursue a traditional career, and for a time he attended GST BOCES Bush Campus in Elmira.

===People&#x27;s Place and early lines (1970s–1983)===
Hilfiger spent the summer of 1969 working in a clothing store on Cape Cod, and afterwards he decided to use his life savings of $150 to open a clothing store in 1971 as People&#x27;s Place. The first store was located in downtown Elmira in what is now the site of First Arena and had a hair salon, a record shop, and rock concerts in the basement. To stock the store, Hilfiger and a friend drove to New York City to buy clothing such as bell-bottoms, peasant blouses, and leather jackets. Unsatisfied with this, he began sketching his own designs, and would later write that &quot;designing made me happier than anything I&#x27;d ever done. I knew from that early work that designing would be my life.&quot;

The People&#x27;s Place went bankrupt in 1977. Hilfiger enrolled in classes on commerce and the business side of the fashion industry. After then moving to New York City and working for several different labels, he set up a company called Tommy Hill in 1979. One of his first clients was Jordache Jeans, and as Hilfiger&#x27;s company expanded beyond denim, he spent time in India, learning more about his trade: &quot;I would sit in the factory with my pile of sketches and watch them being made, tweaking as I went. There&#x27;s no better design school in the world.&quot; In 1981 he founded the company 20th Century Survival, and the following year he founded Click Point, which designed women&#x27;s clothing.

===Founding Tommy Hilfiger Inc. (1984–1990s)===

In 1984, Hilfiger was approached by businessman Mohan Murjani, to pursue his goal of designing and heading a men&#x27;s sportswear line. Murjani backed the necessary investment for Hilfiger to establish his own brand. Later Hilfiger oversaw the design of the Coca-Cola clothing line for Murjani.

In 1985, he founded the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation with support from The Murjani Group. The new clothing line made its debut with a high-profile marketing campaign, for example setting up a large billboard in Times Square designed by George Lois. Hilfiger left Murjani International in 1989, with Silas Chou instead providing financial backing to the Hilfiger brand, and former executives of Ralph Lauren brought on board as executives of the newly formed company Tommy Hilfiger, Inc. The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation went public in 1992, introducing Hilfiger&#x27;s signature menswear collection. Hilfiger was named Menswear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1995.

After licensing Pepe Jeans USA in 1995, in 1996, Tommy Hilfiger Inc. began distributing women&#x27;s clothing. By the end of 1997 Hilfiger had opened his first store in Beverly Hills. This was followed by a store in London in 1998. Hilfiger was serving as the company&#x27;s co-chairman by 1997, and that year he published his first book, titled &quot;All American: A Style Book&quot;.

===Increased brand exposure (1990s–2004)===
A professed lifelong fan of rock and roll, Hilfiger&#x27;s collections are often influenced by the fashion of music subcultures. The clothes are also marketed in connection with the music industry, and as early as 1993 Hilfiger was an official sponsor for Pete Townshend&#x27;s Psychoderelict tour. Hilfiger has also sponsored several musical events, including Sheryl Crow&#x27;s If It Makes You Happy tour in 1997, Britney Spears&#x27; 1999 ...Baby One More Time Tour as main sponsor, and Lenny Kravitz&#x27;s 1999 Freedom tour. By the mid-1990s, Hilfiger&#x27;s style of clothing was popular with both the American &quot;preppy&quot; scene and as hip hop fashion. American R&amp;B icon Aaliyah became the much-publicized spokesperson for Tommy Hilfiger Corporation in 1997.

Hilfiger had a cameo in the fashion spoof &quot;Zoolander&quot; in 2001, and from 2002 to 2006 Tommy Hilfiger Inc. owned the naming rights to the Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theatre venue. Largely due to declining sales in the early 2000s, Hilfiger began reworking the brand, striving to retain the designer brand exclusivity of the Hilfiger label by signing a deal to distribute the best-selling Hilfiger lines at Macy&#x27;s only.

The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation continued to work closely with musicians into the 2000s, focusing on fragrances as well as clothes. Sweetface Fashion, which owns the J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez line, was bought out by Tommy Hilfiger in 2003. True Star, a fragrance endorsed by Hilfiger and released in 2004, featured Beyoncé as its poster girl. The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation company had revenues of approximately $1.8 billion, and 5,400 employees by 2004.

===Media appearances and sale of clothing brand (2005–2011)===

In 2005, a CBS reality show called &quot;The Cut&quot; tracked the progress of sixteen contestants as they competed for a design job with Tommy Hilfiger and their own fashion line under Hilfiger&#x27;s label. The show progressed in a similar fashion to Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. After a final competition that involved setting up the display window for Macy&#x27;s Herald Square location in New York, Hilfiger chose Chris Cortez as the &quot;next great American designer.&quot;

In December 2005, Tommy Hilfiger sold the clothing brand for $1.6 billion, or $16.80 a share, to Apax Partners, a private investment company. The transaction was completed in May 2006. In 2008 Hilfiger, Rives, and Bar Refaeli co-hosted the Bravo special program &quot;Tommy Hilfiger Presents Ironic Iconic America&quot;. Based on the book &quot;Ironic Iconic America&quot; written by Hilfiger and designer George Lois, the program examined how pop culture has influenced American tastes and styles. In 2009 Hilfiger was a guest judge on an episode of &quot;Project Runway&quot;, and he presented the Best African Artist award to Akon at the 2010 World Music Awards.

In March 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen, owner of Calvin Klein and Izod, bought the Tommy Hilfiger brand from Apax Partners for $3 billion. The Tommy Hilfiger online and in-store ad campaign called &quot;Meet The Hilfigers&quot; began in August 2010 and ran through August 2011. In 2011, Hilfiger and a partner signed a contract to buy the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower building for $170 million, planning to transform it into Hilfiger&#x27;s first hotel, with luxury condos. Hilfiger backed off the project in September 2011. A guest judge on the finale of &quot;Project Runway: All Stars&quot; along with Neiman Marcus fashion director Ken Downing in 2012, shortly afterwards he served as a fashion consultant to contestants on season 11 of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

===Recent years and memoir (2012–2016)===

Hilfiger was instrumental in the creation of the Marc Anthony Collection in 2012, as Marc Anthony had never been interested in the fashion business until Hilfiger called him and convinced him a line was worthwhile. In 2012, Hilfiger was awarded the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Global sales in retail for the brand in 2013 were US$6.4 billion, and $6.7 billion in 2014.

Hilfiger remains the company&#x27;s principal designer, leading the design teams and overseeing the entire creative process. In 2016, he collaborated with model Gigi Hadid on clothing designs launching the TommyXGigi clothing collection. On February 8, 2017, the brand will hold its ready-to-wear show in Los Angeles, in the first time the brand will not be part of New York Fashion Week.

In January 2015, Hilfiger announced that he was working on his memoirs. The book was written chronologically over a year, with Hilfiger explaining &quot;I was hesitant to write it, but thought I better do it now because someday I may forget.&quot; Co-writer Peter Knobler had full access to interview friends and family, with Hilfiger citing the candor of Diane von Furstenberg&#x27;s memoirs as an inspiration. Calling the writing process &quot;great therapy&quot; and &quot;interesting,&quot; Hilfiger asserted that he &quot;wanted to give people a sneak peek of what goes on behind the curtain [of] how the fashion industry works.&quot; He read selections from the book in June 2016 at the Literacy Partners Evening of Readers and Gala Dinner Dance.

Hilfiger&#x27;s memoir, &quot;American Dreamer: My Life in Fashion &amp; Business&quot;, co-written with Peter Knobler, was published in November 2016. In a statement, Hilfiger described it as &quot;a roadmap of the moments that have defined both my [40-year fashion career] and my personal life,&quot; and the book covers his childhood, his early business ventures, and his later life in fashion. With &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; calling it &quot;an honest, straightforward, mostly entertaining autobiography,&quot; Hilfiger made an appearance for the book at the Miami Book Fair shortly after its release. &quot;American Dreamer&quot; appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers List in December 2016

==Charity work==

In 1995 Hilfiger launched The Tommy Hilfiger Corporate Foundation. With an emphasis on health, educational and cultural programs, the organization supports charities that focus on at-risk American youth. In 1998 Hilfiger was one of several sponsors along with Moet and Chandon, Christie&#x27;s Auction House, and &quot;The Advocate&quot; of the charity LIFEbeat – The Music Industry Fights AIDS. He is personally involved in charities and causes such as Autism Speaks and the MLK, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, and he has served on the board of directors for The Fresh Air Fund, a New York-based group that helps underprivileged children attend summer camp. The Fresh Air Fund&#x27;s Camp Pioneer program was renamed Camp Tommy in 1999, in honor of Hilfiger&#x27;s patronage.

Since 2008, Hilfiger has designed limited-edition handbags in support Breast Health International (BHI), an international organization focused on finding a cure for breast cancer. A portion of the handbag sales proceeds is donated to BHI&#x27;s Fund For Living program, with celebrity ambassadors appointed for each seasonal campaign. In 2013, Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell modeled the BHI bag in a photoshoot with photographer Patrick Demarchelier.

Millennium Promise, a non-profit organization focused on eradicating extreme poverty, hunger and preventable disease in impoverished regions, classifies Hilfiger as a Millennium Promise MDG Global Leader, and in 2009 Hilfiger made a five-year $2 million commitment to Millennium Promise. The donation went towards relief efforts in a Ugandan city, with the aim of improving residents&#x27; access to necessities like clean water, education, and farming techniques.

In 2012, all philanthropic activities of The Tommy Hilfiger Corporate Foundation were renamed Tommy Cares, a wider-reaching global initiative that further integrates the brand&#x27;s non-profit partnerships, charitable contributions, and employee involvement. On a global scale, Tommy Cares continues to support organizations such as Save the Children, the World Wildlife Fund, War Child, and Millennium Promise. Hilfiger and his wife are on the board of Autism Speaks as of 2012, and through the organization, Hilfiger became a sponsor of the Golden Door Film Festival in September 2014.

Hilfiger has continuously cited the important role inclusivity, diversity and self-expression have had in the brand&#x27;s development and contributions to pop culture.

In 2016, Hilfiger also echoed his support for dressing Melania Trump, telling WWD that &quot;any designer should be proud to dress her.&quot;

In 2020, Hilfiger sold his 22.4 acre estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, for $47.5 million.

== Criticisms ==
Hilfiger has been criticized for having manufactured clothes in sweatshop conditions in the United States territory of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. As a U.S. Commonwealth, clothes made there can be labeled &quot;Made in the USA&quot;, but federal labor laws, including the minimum wage, do not apply. In March 2000, the company, along with other defendants, settled a class action suit brought by Saipanese garment workers, which had alleged mistreatment by over 20 large U.S. clothing manufacturers.

==Style and impact==

While Hilfiger&#x27;s earliest designs drew on 1960s counterculture and fashion, since the 1980s his designs typically draw from classic American New England preppy styles. His initial lines for the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation were primarily designed to appeal to young men looking for designer clothing, and Tommy Hilfiger became one of the most prominent brands in 1990s sportswear, with Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Nautica, DKNY, and Donna Karan also popular. Each of these companies created distinctive wardrobes based upon stylish but wearable, comfortable and interchangeable multi-purpose clothes, all with a focus on luxury.

Hip hop fashion at large began incorporating the Hilfiger brand in the 1990s, and when Snoop Doggy Dogg wore a Hilfiger sweatshirt during an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, it sold out of New York City stores the next day. Moreover, Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market, and rappers like Puffy and Coolio walked during his runways shows. Specific items like Tommy Hilfiger carpenter jeans became particularly popular, with the trademark logo displayed on the hammer loop.

Hilfiger continues to maintain multiple fashion lines, some focused on wearable &quot;casual&quot; clothes while others take on various haute couture commissions. Aside from the preppy styles of his youth, Hilfiger has also always been influenced by the style of a wide variety of American icons, including Grace Kelly, James Dean, Deborah Harry, Iggy Pop, Farrah Fawcett, Steve McQueen, Jackie and John F. Kennedy, and Andy Warhol. Many of his designs draw prominently from the styles of hard rock and the pop music industry.

==Personal life==
Hilfiger was born on March 24, 1951, in Elmira, New York, the second of nine children. Both of his parents were practicing Catholics. His father Richard was a watchmaker of German-Swiss descent, and his mother Virginia (née Gerrity) was a nurse of Irish descent. Hilfiger also claims direct descent from Gilbert Burns, brother of the Scottish poet Robert Burns. His paternal family originated from Safenwil, Canton of Aargau, Switzerland with the original spelling of his family name being &quot;Hilfiker&quot; and being americanized after emigration by his ancestors.

Hilfiger has described his upbringing as very happy. He credits his parents with instilling a good work ethic and compassion for others. He has dyslexia. Hilfiger had an early interest in sports, fashion, and the music industry, a trend that ran in his family. One of his brothers, Andy Hilfiger, went on to work as a musician and designer, while Hilfiger&#x27;s other brother, Billy Hilfiger, would join King Flux and other bands as a guitarist.

In 1976, Hilfiger met Susan Cirona, an employee at the People&#x27;s Place in Ithaca; they married in 1980. Together they had four children: one son and three daughters. In 2003 Hilfiger&#x27;s daughter Ally was part of the MTV reality series &quot;Rich Girls&quot;. His son, Richard (&quot;Ricky Hil&quot; or &quot;Rich Hil&quot;), is a rapper and musician. The Hilfigers divorced in 2000.

On December 12, 2008, he married Dee Ocleppo; the couple had a son in 2009.
