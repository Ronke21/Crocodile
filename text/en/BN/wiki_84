<text>Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava (March 21, 1931 – February 11, 1975) was a Malagasy politician and soldier who served as the head of state of Madagascar for six days in February 1975 before his assassination in office.

==Biography==

He was born in 1931 and was a Merina from a Merina family. A graduate of the French Saint Cyr military college, Ratsimandrava served throughout French Africa before returning to Madagascar when that country gained independence in 1960. He joined the army, attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel by 1968. In 1972 President Gabriel Ramanantsoa established a military government to replace the independence government of Philibert Tsiranana, and Ratsimandrava was appointed Minister of the Interior. Several senior officers were able to manipulate the army, which led to the ousting of Ramanantsoa on February 5, 1975.

== Death ==
Six days following his taking office, Ratsimandrava was gunned down at 8 p.m. while driving from the presidential palace to his home. His death was announced by the new ruling military committee. It claimed that the President had been killed by members of the Republican Security Forces (Groupe Mobile de Police-GMP), a counterinsurgency outfit dissolved by his predecessor. The event nearly plunged the country into civil war between supporters of the military government and former President Tsiranana. In 2006, on the 31st anniversary of colonel&#x27;s murder, a conference was held in Madagascar.

<text>High Anxiety is a 1977 American satirical comedy mystery film produced and directed by Mel Brooks, who also plays the lead. This is Brooks&#x27; first film as a producer and first speaking lead role (his first lead role was in &quot;Silent Movie&quot;). Veteran Brooks ensemble members Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, and Harvey Korman are also featured. It is a parody of psychoanalysis and Alfred Hitchcock films.

==Plot==
Arriving at LAX, Dr. Richard Thorndyke has several odd encounters (such as a flasher impersonating a police officer, and a passing bus with a full orchestra playing). He is taken by his driver and photographer, Brophy, to the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, where he has been hired to replace Dr. Ashley, who died mysteriously—though Brophy suspects foul play. Upon his arrival, Thorndyke is greeted by the staff, Dr. Philip Wentworth, Dr. Charles Montague, and Nurse Charlotte Diesel. Thorndyke also reunites with Professor Vicktor Lillolman, a past mentor now employed by the institute. Thorndyke suffers from &quot;high anxiety&quot;, which is not helped by the fact that the institute is on the top of an oceanside cliff, though Lillolman offers to help him through it.

Later, Thorndyke hears strange noises coming from Diesel&#x27;s room and he and Brophy go to investigate. Diesel claims it was the TV, but it was actually a passionate session of BDSM with Montague. The next morning, Thorndyke is alerted by a light shining through his window, coming from the violent ward. Montague takes Thorndyke to the light&#x27;s source, the room of patient Arthur Brisbane, who thinks he is a Cocker Spaniel.

Wentworth wants to leave the institute, arguing with Diesel. After she lets him go, he drives home, but the radio is rigged to blast deafening rock music. He is trapped in his car, his ears hemorrhage, and he dies from a stroke, aggravated by the loud music.

Thorndyke and Brophy travel to San Francisco, where Thorndyke is to speak at a psychiatric convention. He checks into the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, where much to his chagrin, he is assigned a top-floor room, his reservation mysteriously changed by &quot;Mr. MacGuffin&quot;. Thorndyke pesters the bellboy with repeated requests for a newspaper, wanting to look in the obituaries for information about Wentworth&#x27;s demise. He then takes a shower, during which the bellboy enters and, in a frenzy, mimics stabbing Thorndyke with the paper while screaming, &quot;Here&#x27;s your paper! Happy now?! Happy?&quot; The paper&#x27;s ink runs down the drain.

After his shower, Victoria Brisbane, the daughter of Arthur Brisbane, bursts through the door, wanting help removing her father from the institute. She claims Diesel and Montague are exaggerating the illnesses of wealthy patients so they can milk rich families of millions (through methods demonstrated earlier). Discovering the patient he met was not the real Arthur Brisbane, Thorndyke realizes that Dr. Ashley discovered what Diesel and Montague were doing and was killed before he had a chance to fire them; he agrees to help.

To stop Thorndyke, Diesel and Montague hire &quot;Braces&quot;, the silver-toothed man behind Ashley&#x27;s and Wentworth&#x27;s murders, to impersonate him and shoot a man in the lobby. Thorndyke must prove his innocence to the police. After he is attacked by pigeons in gastrointestinal distress, he meets up with Victoria and realizes Brophy took a picture of the shooting, in which the real Thorndyke was in one of the glass elevators at the time, so he should be in the photo.

Enlarging the photograph, Brophy finds that Thorndyke is indeed visible in it, but Diesel and Montague capture Brophy and take him to the North Wing. Meanwhile, &quot;Braces&quot; finds Thorndyke at a phone booth calling Victoria, and tries to strangle him; however, Thorndyke kills him with a shard of glass from the booth&#x27;s broken window. Thorndyke and Victoria head back to Los Angeles where they rescue Brophy and see Montague and Diesel taking the real Arthur Brisbane to a tower to kill him.

Thorndyke&#x27;s high anxiety prevents him from climbing the tower&#x27;s steep stairs to help Brisbane, but with Lillolman&#x27;s help, he overcomes his phobia. Thorndyke knocks Norton the orderly out a tower window, saving Brisbane. Diesel leaps out from the shadows and attacks Thorndyke with a broom, but falls out the tower window, laughing hysterically and riding the broom to her death on the rocky coast below. Montague appears from the shadows and gives up before being accidentally knocked unconscious by a trapdoor being opened. Victoria is reunited with her father, marries Thorndyke, and they embark on their honeymoon.

==Cast==

* Mel Brooks as Dr. Richard Harpo Thorndyke. Throughout the film, Thorndyke suffers from and attempts to overcome a nervous disorder called &quot;high anxiety&quot;, a sort of mix of acrophobia and vertigo.

* Cloris Leachman as Nurse Charlotte Diesel. She schemes to institutionalize wealthy people, claim they are mentally ill, and extort millions of dollars from their families.
* Harvey Korman as Dr. Charles Montague. Smarmy and pompous, he is in cahoots with Diesel and is submissive in his relationship with her.
* Ron Carey as Brophy, an avid photographer who is also Thorndyke&#x27;s driver and sidekick
* Howard Morris as Professor Vicktor Lillolman, Thorndyke&#x27;s mentor who diagnosed him with the disorder &quot;high anxiety&quot;

* Jack Riley as a Hyatt Regency San Francisco desk clerk
* Charlie Callas as a demented patient who thinks he is a Cocker Spaniel
* Ron Clark as Zachary Cartwright, a patient believed to be deranged. Clark also worked as a writer on the film.

==Production==

The film is a parody of the suspense films of Alfred Hitchcock: &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, and &quot;The Birds&quot;. The film was dedicated to Hitchcock, and Brooks consulted Hitchcock when writing the screenplay. It also contains parodies of Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot;, and Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, in the camera tracking through walls, and even James Bond films with an assassin who shares a similarity with the Bond villain Jaws, played by Richard Kiel.
Most of the story takes place at the fictional Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, with exteriors filmed at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University in Los Angeles. Los Angeles International Airport also appears at the beginning of the film. Near the middle of the movie, the story moves to San Francisco, taking advantage of settings used in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;, including the Golden Gate Bridge and the Mission San Juan Bautista tower. It also includes the then-new Hyatt Regency Hotel with its tall atrium lobby.

Brooks took great pains to not only parody Hitchcock films, but also to emulate the look and style of his pictures. In an interview he said, &quot;I watch the kind of film we&#x27;re making with the [director of photography], so he knows not to be frivolous. He&#x27;s got to get the real lighting, the real texture. For &quot;High Anxiety&quot;, it was &#x27;What is a Hitchcock film? What does it look like? What does it feel like? How does he light them? How long is a scene? What is the cutting? When does he bring things to a boil?&#x27; We just watch everything.&quot;

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Uneven but hilarious when it hits, this spoof of Hitchcock movies is a minor classic in the Mel Brooks canon.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on five critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. After viewing the film himself, Alfred Hitchcock sent Brooks a case of six magnums of 1961 Château Haut-Brion wine with a note that read, &quot;A small token of my pleasure, have no anxiety about this.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;One of the problems with Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;High Anxiety&quot; is that it picks a tricky target: It&#x27;s a spoof of the work of Alfred Hitchcock, but Hitchcock&#x27;s films are often funny themselves. And satire works best when its target is self-important.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; agreed, writing that the film &quot;is as witty and as disciplined as &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, though it has one built-in problem: Hitchcock himself is a very funny man. His films, even at their most terrifying and most suspenseful, are full of jokes shared with the audience. Being so self-aware, Hitchcock&#x27;s films deny an easy purchase to the parodist, especially one who admires his subject the way Mr. Brooks does. There&#x27;s nothing to send up, really.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; shared the same objection, writing that &quot;Brooks seems to be under the impression that he&#x27;s adding a satirical point of view, but it&#x27;s a child&#x27;s idea of satire; imitation, with a funny hat and a leer. Hitchcock&#x27;s suspense melodramas are sparked by his perverse wit; they&#x27;re satirical to start with.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that the parodies of &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot; &quot;are clever, funny, and recommend the film.&quot; He also wrote, however, that too much of the film &quot;is piddled away with juvenile sex jokes&quot; that &quot;are simply beneath a comic mind as fertile as the one that belongs to Mel Brooks.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;probably the most coherent of the Brooks movies since &quot;The Producers&quot;, in the sense of sustaining a tone and story line and characterizations from start to finish. As an homage, it is both knowing and reverential. As such, it is I suppose also the quietest of the Brooks films, with fewer bellylaughs and more appreciative chuckles.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The film rarely rises above the level of tame, wayward homage ... Despite its occasional bright ideas, the movie lacks a unifying bright idea about how to exploit the cast in a sustained, organically conceived parody of Hitchcock. The script is plot-heavy, yet it fails to contrive an amusing plot from Hitchcock sources.&quot; In addition to parodying Hitchcock films, &quot;High Anxiety&quot; became noteworthy for frequently mocking popular psychoanalysis theories at the time, with &quot;New Statesman&quot; journalist Ryan Gilbey stating that &quot;viewers were familiar enough with the babble and buzzwords of psychoanalysis to respond instinctively to the film&#x27;s wittiest sequence, when Brooks&#x27; speech at a psychiatric conference has to be spontaneously modified so as not to impinge upon the innocence of two young children who have joined the audience. &#x27;Penis envy&#x27; becomes &#x27;pee-pee envy&#x27;; the womb is temporarily rechristened &#x27;the woo-woo.&#x27;&quot;

Before its release, Brooks held a private screening for Hitchcock and feared the worst when Hitchcock did not react while watching and left without saying a word. Days later, Hitchcock would send Brooks a bottle of wine and a note of his approval.

<text>Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster. Carlsen is a five-time World Chess Champion, five-time World Rapid Chess Champion, and the reigning (shared with Ian Nepomniachtchi) eight time World Blitz Chess Champion. He has held the position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world. His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess at 125 games.

A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly after he turned 13 and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and later became the youngest ever player to qualify for the Candidates Tournament in 2005. At 17, he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19, he reached in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so.

Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019 and 2022. He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen declined to defend his title in 2023, citing a lack of motivation.

Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the utility of pre-game computer analysis. In 2025, he signed with esports organization Team Liquid.

== Childhood ==

Carlsen was born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990 to Sigrun Øen (1963–2024), a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age. At two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14.

His father, a keen amateur chess player, taught him to play at the age of five, although he initially showed little interest in it. Magnus has three sisters; he has said his original motivation to study chess seriously was a desire to be able to beat his elder sister.
Carlsen developed his early chess skills by playing by himself. Carlsen had an exceptional memory and could recall the locations, populations, flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by the age of five. He participated in his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at 8 years and 7 months, and scored 6/11.

Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country&#x27;s top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein, who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil &quot;Drillo&quot; Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy. In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and GM, as Ringdal served a one-year &quot;siviltjeneste&quot; (an alternative civilian service programme) at the college.

Over the course of that year, Carlsen&#x27;s rating rose from 904 in June 2000 to 1907. His breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where he scored 3½/5 against the country&#x27;s top junior players and gained a (TPR) of around 2000. Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, his favourite pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics. He also practised skiing until the age of ten.

From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002, Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games, as well as in several blitz tournaments, and participated in other minor events. In October 2002, he placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Peñiscola. The following month, he tied for first place in the 2002 World Under-12 Championship in Heraklion, placing second to Ian Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak. He then obtained three IM norms in relatively quick succession: the first at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters (score 7/10, 2453 PR); the second at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm (6/9, 2470 PR); and the third at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen (8/11, 2503 PR). He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003.

After finishing primary school, Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess tournaments in Europe during the autumn of 2003, then returned to complete secondary education at a sports school. During the year away from school, he placed joint-third in the European Under-14 Championship and ninth in the 2003 World Under-14 Championship.

== Chess career ==
=== 2004 ===

Carlsen made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13, in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee. He obtained a score of 10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, Duško Pavasovič). As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a of 2702. Particularly notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves. His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, to give him the title &quot;the Mozart of chess&quot; (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the nickname had been given to many illustrious predecessors). Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and played an unusually wide range of openings. Carlsen&#x27;s prowess caught the attention of Microsoft, which became his sponsor.

Carlsen obtained his second GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February. On 17 March, in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland, he defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov. It was a preliminary event leading up to a rapid knockout tournament beginning the next day. In that event, Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov, then the top-rated player in the world. Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game but lost the second, and was thus knocked out of the tournament.

In the sixth Dubai Open Chess Championship, held 18–28 April, Carlsen obtained his third GM norm, which made him the world&#x27;s youngest GM at the time, and the second-youngest GM in history at the time (after Sergey Karjakin, who earned the title at 12 years and 7 months). Carlsen played in the FIDE World Chess Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to participate in one, but was knocked out in the first round by Levon Aronian.

In July, Carlsen and Berge Østenstad, then the reigning Norwegian champion, tied for first in the Norwegian Chess Championship, each scoring 7/9. A two-game match between them was arranged to decide the title. Both games were drawn, which left Østenstad the champion because he had superior tiebreaks in the tournament.

=== 2005 ===
In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov, then ranked in the world, as well as the co-winner of the tournament. In the semi-finals of the Ciudad de León rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan Anand, who was ranked in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess Championship. Anand won 3–1.

In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again finished in shared first place, this time with his mentor Simen Agdestein. A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores in the event of a 1–1 tie had been revoked. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the second—so it went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the first rapid game, Agdestein the second. Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game.

In October, Carlsen took first place at the Arnold Eikrem Memorial in Gausdal with a score of 8/9 and a of 2792.

At the end of 2005, Carlsen participated at the Chess World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. In the knockout tournament, he upset 44th-ranked Zurab Azmaiparashvili in round one, and proceeded to defeat Farrukh Amonatov and Ivan Cheparinov to reach the round of 16. There he lost to Evgeny Bareev, but won against Joël Lautier and Vladimir Malakhov before losing again to Gata Kamsky. Carlsen finished in tenth place and became the youngest player to be an official World Championship Candidate.

=== 2006 ===
Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004. His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with 9/13 (+6−1=6) qualified him to play in the Corus group A in 2007.

At the 2006 international &#x27;Bosna&#x27; tournament in Sarajevo, Carlsen shared first place with Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu (who won on tiebreak evaluation) and Vladimir Malakhov; this could be regarded as Carlsen&#x27;s first &quot;A&quot; elite tournament win, although it was not a clear first.

Carlsen was close to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad dropped him into another tie for first place with Agdestein. It also prevented Carlsen from beating Agdestein&#x27;s record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever. Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19 to 21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.

Carlsen won the Glitnir Blitz Tournament in Iceland. He achieved a 2–0 win over Viswanathan Anand in the semi-finals and achieved the same score in the finals. He scored 6/8 in the 37th Chess Olympiad and achieved a PR of 2820.

In the Midnight Sun Chess Tournament in Tromsø, Carlsen finished second to Sergei Shipov. In the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, he placed second, beating the tournament winner Alexander Morozevich twice.

In the NH Chess Tournament held in Amsterdam in August, Carlsen participated in an &quot;Experience&quot; vs. &quot;Rising Stars&quot; Scheveningen team match. The &quot;Rising Stars&quot; won the match 28–22, with Carlsen achieving the best individual score for the Rising Stars team (6½/10) and a 2700 PR, thus winning the right to participate in the 2007 Melody Amber tournament.

With a score of 7½/15, Carlsen placed 8th out of 16 participants at the World Blitz Championship in Rishon LeZion, Israel. In the rapid chess tournament &quot;Rencontres nationales et internationales d&#x27;échecs&quot; in Cap d&#x27;Agde, France, he reached the semi-final, losing there to Sergey Karjakin. In November, Carlsen achieved a shared 8th place of 10 participants in the Mikhail Tal Memorial in Moscow with two losses and seven draws. He finished ninth in a group of 18 participants in the associated blitz tournament, which was won by Anand.

=== 2007 ===

Playing in the top group of the Corus chess tournament for the first time, Carlsen placed last with nine draws and four losses, scoring 4½/13. In the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen played against top-rated players Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler, Alexander Morozevich, Levon Aronian, Peter Leko, and Vasyl Ivanchuk. Despite being rated significantly lower than any of them, he finished in second place on tiebreaks with 7½/14, having scored four wins, seven draws and three losses, and achieving a PR of 2778.

Carlsen played for the first time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament in Monte Carlo in March. In the 11 rounds, he achieved eight draws and three losses in the blindfold games, as well as three wins, seven draws and one loss in the rapid games. This resulted in a shared ninth place in the blindfold, shared second place in the rapid (behind Anand), and a shared eighth place overall.

In May and June, he participated in the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007, facing Levon Aronian in a six-game match at standard time controls, which Carlsen drew (+2−2=2) by coming from behind twice. The four-game rapid playoff was drawn as well (+1−1=2), with Carlsen winning the last game to stay in the match. Eventually, Aronian eliminated Carlsen from the tournament after winning both tiebreak blitz games.

In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 record and a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game. Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight underperformance in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034) after having a lost position at one point. A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.

Carlsen reached the semi-final round of the World Chess Cup in December, after defeating Michael Adams in the round of 16 and Ivan Cheparinov in the quarterfinals. In the semi-final, he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Gata Kamsky, scoring ½–1½.

=== 2008 ===

In the top group A of the 69th Corus chess tournament, Carlsen scored 8/13, achieving a PR of 2830. Carlsen won five games, lost two and drew six, sharing first place with Levon Aronian. At the Linares chess tournament, Carlsen had another 2800+ PR, scoring 8/14. He finished in sole second place, ½ point behind the winner World Champion Viswanathan Anand.

In March, Carlsen played for the second time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament, held in Nice for the first time. In the 11 rounds he achieved four wins, four draws and two losses in the blindfold, and three wins, two losses, and six draws in the rapid. This resulted in a shared fifth place in the blindfold, shared third place in the rapid and a shared second place in the overall tournament.

Carlsen was one of 21 players in the six-tournament FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, a qualifier for the World Chess Championship 2012. In the first tournament, in Baku, Azerbaijan, he finished in a three-way tie for first place, with another 2800 PR. He later withdrew from the Grand Prix cycle despite his initial success, criticising FIDE for &quot;changing the rules dramatically in the middle of a World Championship cycle&quot;.

Carlsen won a rapid match against Peter Leko held in Miskolc, Hungary, scoring 5–3. In June, Carlsen won the annual Aerosvit chess tournament, finishing undefeated with 8/11 in a category 19 field and achieving a PR of 2877, his best PR at that point in his career.

He tied for second place with Veselin Topalov at the M-Tel Masters (category 21) tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria. He lost to eventual winner Alexei Shirov in their final game, dropping him from first.

Carlsen won the category 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world&#x27;s highest-rated player at the time. He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, this was one of the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002. Chess statistician Jeff Sonas has declared it one of the 20 best tournament performances of all time, and the best chess performance of all time by a teenager.

In the Tal Memorial, played from 5 to 14 November, Carlsen started with seven straight draws, but finished with wins over former FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov and Peter Leko. This result put Carlsen in shared second place behind former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik and equal with Ivanchuk. After the Tal Memorial, Carlsen won the World Blitz Championship, played from 16 to 18 November in Moscow, Russia. His score of 28 wins, 6 draws and 8 losses left him three points ahead of Anand, who finished in second place.
Carlsen entered the London Chess Classic as the top seed in a field including Kramnik, Hikaru Nakamura, Michael Adams, Nigel Short, Ni Hua, Luke McShane and David Howell. He defeated Kramnik in round one and went on to win the tournament with 13/21 (three points were awarded for a win, and one for a draw; using classical scoring he finished with 5/7) and a PR of 2844, one point ahead of Kramnik. This victory propelled him to of the FIDE rating list, surpassing Veselin Topalov.

Based on his average ranking from the July 2009 and January 2010 FIDE lists, Carlsen qualified for the Candidates Tournament that would determine the challenger to World Champion Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2012. In November 2010, however, Carlsen announced he was withdrawing from the Candidates Tournament. Carlsen described the 2008–12 cycle as &quot;[not] sufficiently modern and fair&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Reigning champion privileges, the long (five-year) span of the cycle, changes made during the cycle resulting in a new format (Candidates) that no World Champion has had to go through since Kasparov, puzzling ranking criteria as well as the shallow ceaseless match-after-match concept are all less than satisfactory in my opinion.&quot;

In early 2009 Carlsen engaged former World Champion Garry Kasparov as a personal trainer. In September their partnership was revealed to the public by Norwegian newspapers.

Responding to a question in an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine in December 2009 as to whether he used computers when studying chess, Carlsen explained that he does not use a chess set when studying on his own.

=== 2010 ===
Carlsen won the 72nd Corus chess tournament played 16–31 January with 8½ points. His ninth-round loss to Kramnik ended a streak of 36 rated games undefeated. Carlsen struggled in the last round against Fabiano Caruana, but saved a draw, leaving him half a point ahead of Kramnik and Shirov.

In March it was announced that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer use him as a trainer, although Carlsen later stated that they would remain in contact and he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov.

Carlsen shared first place alongside Ivanchuk in the Amber blindfold and rapid tournament. Scoring 6½/11 in the blindfold and 8/11 in the rapid, Carlsen accumulated 14½ from a possible 22 points. Carlsen helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championship 2010 against Veselin Topalov, which Anand won 6½–5½ to retain the title. Carlsen had also helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championships in 2007 and 2008.

Carlsen won the Bazna Kings Tournament in Romania in June, two points ahead of Radjabov and Boris Gelfand. In August, Carlsen played in the Arctic Securities Chess Stars tournament in Kristiansund, Norway., defeating Anand 1½–½ in the two-game final to win the championship.

Carlsen suffered setbacks in his next two tournaments. In the 39th Chess Olympiad he scored 4½/8, losing three games, to Baadur Jobava, Michael Adams, and Sanan Sjugirov; these were his first losses with the black pieces in more than a year. His team, Norway, finished 51st out of 149 teams.

Carlsen played in the Grand Slam Masters Final in October, which he had qualified for automatically by winning three of the previous year&#x27;s four Grand Slam chess events. The average Elo of the participants at the time was 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen&#x27;s second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world ranking in jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat in the latter part of the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6; Kramnik won the event with 4/6.

In October, Carlsen competed at the Pearl Spring chess tournament in Nanjing, China. This was the only tournament in 2010 to feature Anand, Carlsen and Topalov, at the time the top three players in the world, and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800. Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black. This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world ; his final score of 7/10 (with a PR of 2903) was a full point ahead of runner-up Anand.
On 5 November, Carlsen withdrew from the 2011 Candidates Tournament, having qualified as the highest rated challenger, citing dissatisfaction with the World Championship cycle format.

=== 2011 ===
Carlsen competed in the GM-A group of the 73rd Tata Steel Chess Tournament (formerly called the Corus chess tournament) on 14–30 January in Wijk aan Zee in an attempt to defend his title; the field included World Champion Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Hikaru Nakamura, Ruslan Ponomariov, among others. Despite losing games with white against Anish Giri and reigning Russian champion Ian Nepomniachtchi, Carlsen finished with 8/13, including victories over Kramnik and tournament winner Nakamura. Although Carlsen&#x27;s performance raised his rating from 2814 to 2815, Anand&#x27;s 8½/13 score elevated his rating to 2817, making him the world for the March 2011 FIDE rating list.

The first tournament victory of the year came in the Bazna Kings tournament, a double round robin played in Mediaș, Romania on 11–21 June. Carlsen finished with 6½/10, equal with Sergey Karjakin but with a better tiebreak score. Carlsen won his White games against Nakamura, Nisipeanu, and Ivanchuk and drew the rest of the games.

He took clear first place with a score of 19/30 (+5−1=4; three points for a win) in a field comprising Fabiano Caruana, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexander Morozevich, Alexey Shirov and Yannick Pelletier, two points ahead of Morozevich. This was Carlsen&#x27;s second title.

The Grand Slam Chess Final was held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo (25 September – 1 October) and Bilbao (5–11 October). Although Carlsen had a slow start, including a loss against bottom-ranked Francisco Vallejo Pons, he finished +3−1=6, equal with Ivanchuk (whose +4−3=3 finish was equal due to three points for a win). Carlsen then won the blitz tiebreak against Ivanchuk. The other players were Anand, Aronian, Nakamura, and Vallejo Pons.

Another tournament victory was achieved in the Tal Memorial in Moscow 16–25 November as a round robin with ten players. Carlsen won two games, against Gelfand and Nakamura, and drew the rest. Although he finished equal on points with Aronian, he placed ahead since the tiebreak was determined by the number of black games; Carlsen had five black games, while Aronian only had four.

In the London Chess Classic, played 3–12 December, Carlsen&#x27;s streak of tournament victories ended when he finished third, behind Kramnik and Nakamura. Carlsen won three games and drew five.

In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 scoring system, with 7/10.

The Grand Slam Chess Final was again held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo and Bilbao. Carlsen started with a loss against Caruana, but after three wins in the second (Bilbao) round, finished +4−1=5, equal first with Caruana, and ahead of Aronian, Karjakin and Anand. Carlsen won the tournament by winning both tiebreak games against Caruana.

In February, Carlsen participated in the Champions Chess Tour Chessable Masters competition, where he won the grand finale for a $30,000 prize.

In February, Carlsen organized and played in the Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge, which was an over-the-board Fischer random chess tournament which included some of the top players in the world. He placed fifth in the round-robin rapid portion of the tournament, which determined the pairings for the main event, which was played under classical time controls. He won the main event, beating Fabiano Caruana in the final for a $60,000 prize. It was the first ever classical Fischer random chess super-tournament.

In September, Carlsen won his fourth Speed Chess Championship title, defeating GM Alireza Firouzja in the finals held in Paris, France. Carlsen displayed a dominant performance, finishing with a score of 23.5-7.5, winning 21 games, drawing 5, and losing only 5 in the four-hour match. Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura remain the only players to have won the tournament since its inception in 2016. Also in September, Carlsen played in the 45th Chess Olympiad for Team Norway, and they placed 14th out of 188 countries. Carlsen finished with a score of 6/8, conceding draws to Mustafa Yilmaz, and Parham Maghsoodloo, while only losing to Vladimir Fedoseev. A notable win was against Vietnam GM Liem Le. To finish September, Carlsen also took home the 2024 Julius Baer Generation Cup, by going undefeated and beating Alireza Firouzja 2.5-1.5 in the Grand Final.

On 21 December, Carlsen defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the finals of Champions Chess Tour 2024, winning the tournament for a fifth consecutive time.

On 27 December, following round six of the World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen was warned and fined USD$200 for wearing jeans. He refused to change his jeans after being given the opportunity to change attire, causing him to not be paired for round nine. He proceeded to withdraw himself from both the Rapid and the World Blitz Chess Championship tournaments, remarking in an interview, &quot;They can enforce their rules, that&#x27;s fine by me [...] my response is that fine, then I&#x27;m out, like, fuck you.&quot; On December 29, after a loosening of the dress code, Carlsen reversed his decision and announced he would take part in the Blitz tournament. International Chess Federation President Arkady Dvorkovich acknowledged that the incident brought attention to the importance of the organization&#x27;s ability to adapt to the &quot;evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport&quot; regarding the application of its rules. He also professed his &quot;regret&quot; for a resolution not being able to be found before Carlsen&#x27;s withdrawal. Carlsen went on to jointly win the Blitz championship when he and Ian Nepomniachtchi agreed to share the title having been deadlocked after seven games in the final. Carlsen&#x27;s decision received applause from the live audience, but met negative reactions online from professional chess players and fans. Dissenters included American chess grandmaster Hans Niemann, who tweeted, &quot;The chess world is officially a joke. [...] I can’t believe that the official body of chess is being controlled by a singular player [&quot;for the second time this week&quot;].&quot;

=== 2025 ===
On 14 February, 2025, Carlsen was announced as the second chess player to be signed by Dutch esports organization Team Liquid, after Fabiano Caruana the prior day. As part of the deal, Carlsen will represent Liquid during the Champions Chess Tour 2025.

== Honours ==
Carlsen won the Chess Oscars from 2009 to 2013. The Chess Oscar, organised by the Russian chess magazine &quot;64&quot;, was awarded to the year&#x27;s best player according to a worldwide poll of leading chess critics, writers, and journalists, but it was no longer awarded after 2013, as &quot;64&quot; ceased publication.

The Norwegian tabloid &quot;Verdens Gang&quot; (VG) has awarded Carlsen the &quot;Name of the Year&quot; (&quot;Årets navn&quot;) twice, in 2009 and 2013. VG also named him &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; in 2009. Carlsen has also won the &quot;Folkets Idrettspris&quot;, a people&#x27;s choice award from the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot;, in 2009 and 2010.

In 2011, he was awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, a Norwegian prize awarded annually to &quot;a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Carlsen one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

== Rating ==

In the January 2006 FIDE rankings, at the age of 15 years and 32 days, Carlsen attained a 2625 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2600 (the record has since been broken by Wesley So, Wei Yi, John M. Burke, and Yağız Kaan Erdoğmuş). In the July 2007 FIDE rankings, at the age of 16 years and 213 days, Carlsen attained a 2710 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2700 (the record has since been broken by Wei Yi).

On 5 September 2008, after winning in round 4 of the Bilbao Masters, Carlsen, aged 17 years and 280 days old, briefly became on the unofficial live ratings list. Carlsen&#x27;s victory in the 2009 Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801, making him, aged 18 years and 336 days, at the time the youngest player ever to surpass 2800 (a record subsequently broken by Alireza Firouzja). The youngest before Carlsen to achieve this feat was Vladimir Kramnik at the age of 25, and up until this point only Kasparov, Topalov, Kramnik, and Anand had achieved a 2800+ rating.

The FIDE rankings in January 2010 recorded Carlsen&#x27;s rating at 2810, which made him rated player in the world. This meant that Carlsen became, at the age of 19 years and 32 days, the youngest ever world , as well as the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rankings since Bobby Fischer in 1971.

The March 2010 FIDE rankings showed Carlsen with a new peak rating of 2813, a figure that only Kasparov had bettered at that time. On the January 2013 FIDE rankings, Carlsen reached 2861, thus surpassing Garry Kasparov&#x27;s 2851 record from July 1999. In the May 2014 rankings, Carlsen achieved an all-time high record of 2882, with a peak of 2889 on the live ratings list achieved on 21 April 2014. In August 2019 he equalled his peak FIDE rating of 2882.

 Carlsen is also ranked in the FIDE rapid rating list with a rating of 2838, and in the FIDE blitz rating list with a rating of 2890.

== Playing style ==
Carlsen had an aggressive style of play as a youth, and, according to Simen Agdestein, his play was characterised by &quot;a fearless readiness to offer material for activity&quot;. As he matured, Carlsen found that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the elite of the chess world. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting much out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen&#x27;s style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus making it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis. He said in 2015 that the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to &quot;pure chess&quot;.

In a 2016 interview, Anish Giri said: &quot;Magnus and I are very close in terms of style, but in our approach to the game we&#x27;re total opposites. Magnus tries to put the accent only on play, getting away from preparation, but for me preparation plays an enormous role.&quot;

Garry Kasparov, who coached Carlsen from 2009 to 2010, said that Carlsen has a positional style similar to that of past world champions such as Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov, rather than the of Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Tal, and Kasparov himself. In a 2013 interview, Peter Heine Nielsen said: &quot;The days of big novelties are over, and that fits Magnus&#x27; style well.&quot; According to Carlsen, however, he does not have any preferences in playing style. Kasparov said in 2013 that &quot;Carlsen is a combination of Karpov [and] Fischer. He gets his positions [and] then never lets go of that bulldog bite. Exhausting for opponents.&quot; Carlsen has also stated that he follows in the traditions of Karpov and Fischer, but additionally mentions Reuben Fine as a player who &quot;was doing in chess similar to what I am doing&quot;.

Anand said of Carlsen in 2012: &quot;Magnus has an incredible innate sense. ... The majority of ideas occur to him absolutely naturally. He&#x27;s also very flexible, he knows all the structures and he can play almost any position.&quot; He also compared Carlsen to Boris Spassky in his prime, and stated that &quot;Magnus can literally do almost everything.&quot; Kasparov expressed similar sentiments: &quot;[Carlsen] has the ability to correctly evaluate any position, which only Karpov could boast of before him.&quot;
When asked in a 2016 interview whether Carlsen&#x27;s style resembles his own, Karpov answered: &quot;It is quite possible. He grew up when I was in power, and perhaps he studied my games. He can convert a minimal advantage into a real one.&quot;

In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik stated that Carlsen&#x27;s &quot;excellent physical shape&quot; was a contributing factor to his success against other top players as it prevents &quot;psychological lapses&quot;, which enables him to maintain a high standard of play over long games and at the end of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped. Levon Aronian said in 2015: &quot;Magnus&#x27; main secret is his composure and the absence of any soul-searching after mistakes during a game.&quot;
Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen&#x27;s playing style: &quot;Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his &#x27;nettlesomeness,&#x27; to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan, of the University at Buffalo. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response.&quot;

Carlsen&#x27;s endgame prowess has been singled out for praise. Jon Speelman, analysing several of Carlsen&#x27;s endgames from the 2012 London Classic (in particular, his wins against McShane, Aronian, and Adams), described what he calls the &quot;Carlsen effect&quot;: ... through the combined force of his skill and no less important his reputation, he drives his opponents into errors. ... He plays on for ever, calmly, methodically and, perhaps most importantly of all, without fear: calculating superbly, with very few outright mistakes and a good proportion of the &quot;very best&quot; moves. This makes him a monster and makes many opponents wilt.

An artificial intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the &quot;Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse&quot; (&quot;Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute&quot;), which compares chess grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish—a chess engine that outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen as the best player of all time as he had the highest probability among all World Chess Champions to play the moves that Stockfish suggested.

Carlsen also plays speed chess online under many screen names. He is known for meme openings such as the Bongcloud Attack and exceptionally strong play, despite banter and gags.

== Business endeavours ==

Carlsen modelled for G-Star Raw&#x27;s Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The campaign was shot by Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn. The campaign was coordinated with the RAW World Chess Challenge in New York, an event in which Carlsen played an online team of global chess players, who voted on moves suggested by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Hikaru Nakamura and Judit Polgár. Carlsen, playing white, won in 43 moves. In February 2014, he appeared in G-Star Raw&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole.

Film director J. J. Abrams offered Carlsen a role in the movie &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; as &quot;a chess player from the future&quot;, but Carlsen was unable to get a work permit in time for shooting. In 2012, Carlsen was featured in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment and appeared as a guest on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. He was also interviewed by Rainn Wilson for SoulPancake in 2013.

, Carlsen is the only active chess professional with a full-time manager; Espen Agdestein, a FIDE Master and brother of Carlsen&#x27;s former trainer Simen Agdestein, began working as an agent for Carlsen in late 2008. Agdestein&#x27;s work consisted initially of finding sponsors and negotiating media contacts but, since 2011, he has taken over management tasks formerly performed by Carlsen&#x27;s father Henrik. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Carlsen earned US$1.2 million in 2012, the bulk of which was from sponsorships.

In August 2013, Carlsen became an ambassador for Nordic Semiconductor, and in November was selected as one of the &quot;sexiest men of 2013&quot; by &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. In 2017, Carlsen made a special guest appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in an episode where Homer&#x27;s chess history is revealed. In 2020, Carlsen announced that he had signed a two-year sponsorship deal with gambling company Unibet to act as a &quot;global ambassador&quot;. Unibet parent company Kindred Group is also a sponsor of Offerspill Chess Club. Offerspill was founded by Carlsen in 2019 after the Norwegian Chess Federation turned down Kindred&#x27;s sponsorship offer. It is now Norway&#x27;s largest chess club; Carlsen is its current chairman. In April 2022, the Kindred Group (through Unibet) extended its partnership with Carlsen for another two years, and also extended its sponsorship of Offerspill.

In December 2024, Carlsen became the official chess ambassador for the Esports World Cup, an esports tournament series that takes place in Saudi Arabia, as part of the introduction of chess in the 2025 edition.

===Play Magnus===

In October 2013, Carlsen co-founded a company, Play Magnus AS, with Espen Agdestein and Anders Brandt. Based in Oslo, Norway, Play Magnus&#x27; first product was an iOS app, called &quot;Play Magnus&quot;, that allows the user to play a chess engine created using a database of thousands of Carlsen&#x27;s recorded games from the age of five and up. Carlsen stated he wished for the app to encourage more people to play chess.

In March 2019, Play Magnus AS merged with chess24.com, consolidating into the Play Magnus Group. On 8 October 2020, Play Magnus Group was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Magnus Chess, an entity controlled by Carlsen and his family, then owned 9.5% of Play Magnus Group.

In August 2022, Chess.com finalised an offer of acquisition for Play Magnus Group, which officially closed on 16 December 2022. As part of the acquisition, Carlsen signed as a brand ambassador for Chess.com.

=== Take Take Take ===
In October 2024, Magnus Carlsen cofounded Take Take Take. It was the first app in Chess World which offered text-based commentary to fantasy chess, from live games to post-game recaps, and from challenges to some app exclusive content. Take Take Take then tied with Chess.com to jointly organise Champions Chess Tour Finals in December 2024.

== Personal life ==

<text>In information science and information retrieval, relevance denotes how well a retrieved document or set of documents meets the information need of the user. Relevance may include concerns such as timeliness, authority or novelty of the result.

== History ==

The concern with the problem of finding relevant information dates back at least to the first publication of scientific journals in the 17th century.

The formal study of relevance began in the 20th century with the study of what would later be called bibliometrics. In the 1930s and 1940s, S. C. Bradford used the term &quot;relevant&quot; to characterize articles relevant to a subject (cf., Bradford&#x27;s law). In the 1950s, the first information retrieval systems emerged, and researchers noted the retrieval of irrelevant articles as a significant concern. In 1958, B. C. Vickery made the concept of relevance explicit in an address at the International Conference on Scientific Information.

Since 1958, information scientists have explored and debated definitions of relevance. A particular focus of the debate was the distinction between &quot;relevance to a subject&quot; or &quot;topical relevance&quot; and &quot;user relevance&quot;.

== Evaluation ==
The information retrieval community has emphasized the use of test collections and benchmark tasks to measure topical relevance, starting with the Cranfield Experiments of the early 1960s and culminating in the TREC evaluations that continue to this day as the main evaluation framework for information retrieval research.

In order to evaluate how well an information retrieval system retrieved topically relevant results, the relevance of retrieved results must be quantified. In Cranfield-style evaluations, this typically involves assigning a &quot;relevance level&quot; to each retrieved result, a process known as &quot;relevance assessment&quot;. Relevance levels can be binary (indicating a result is relevant or that it is not relevant), or graded (indicating results have a varying degree of match between the topic of the result and the information need). Once relevance levels have been assigned to the retrieved results, information retrieval performance measures can be used to assess the quality of a retrieval system&#x27;s output.

In contrast to this focus solely on topical relevance, the information science community has emphasized user studies that consider user relevance. These studies often focus on aspects of human-computer interaction (see also human-computer information retrieval).

== Clustering and relevance ==

The cluster hypothesis, proposed by C. J. van Rijsbergen in 1979, asserts that two documents that are similar to each other have a high likelihood of being relevant to the same information need. With respect to the embedding similarity space, the cluster hypothesis can be interpreted globally or locally. The global interpretation assumes that there exist some fixed set of underlying topics derived from inter-document similarity. These global clusters or their representatives can then be used to relate relevance of two documents (e.g. two documents in the same cluster should both be relevant to the same request). Methods in this spirit include:
* cluster-based information retrieval
* cluster-based document expansion such as latent semantic analysis or its language modeling equivalents. It is important to ensure that clusters – either in isolation or combination – successfully model the set of possible relevant documents.

A second interpretation, most notably advanced by Ellen Voorhees, focuses on the local relationships between documents. The local interpretation avoids having to model the number or size of clusters in the collection and allow relevance at multiple scales. Methods in this spirit include:
* multiple cluster retrieval
* spreading activation and relevance propagation methods
* local document expansion
* score regularization
Local methods require an accurate and appropriate document similarity measure.

==Problems and alternatives==

The documents which are most relevant are not necessarily those which are most useful to display in the first page of search results. For example, two duplicate documents might be individually considered quite relevant, but it is only useful to display one of them. A measure called &quot;maximal marginal relevance&quot; (MMR) has been proposed to manage this shortcoming. It considers the relevance of each document only in terms of how much new information it brings given the previous results.

In some cases, a query may have an ambiguous interpretation, or a variety of potential responses. Providing a diversity of results can be a consideration when evaluating the utility of a result set.

<text>Relevance is the connection between topics that makes one useful for dealing with the other. Relevance is studied in many different fields, including cognitive science, logic, and library and information science. Epistemology studies it in general, and different theories of knowledge have different implications for what is considered relevant.

== Definition ==
&quot;Something (&quot;A&quot;) is relevant to a task (&quot;T&quot;) if it increases the likelihood of accomplishing the goal (&quot;G&quot;), which is implied by &quot;T&quot;.&quot;

A thing might be relevant, a document or a piece of information may be relevant. Relevance does not depend on whether we speak of &quot;things&quot; or &quot;information&quot;.

== Epistemology ==
If you believe that schizophrenia is caused by bad communication between mother and child, then family interaction studies become relevant. If, on the other hand, you subscribe to a genetic theory of relevance then the study of genes becomes relevant. If you subscribe to the epistemology of empiricism, then only intersubjectively controlled observations are relevant. If, on the other hand, you subscribe to feminist epistemology, then the sex of the observer becomes relevant.

== Logic ==
In formal reasoning, relevance has proved an important but elusive concept. It is important because the solution of any problem requires the prior identification of the relevant elements from which a solution can be constructed. It is elusive, because the meaning of relevance appears to be difficult or impossible to capture within conventional logical systems. The obvious suggestion that q is relevant to p if q is implied by p breaks down because under standard definitions of material implication, a false proposition implies all other propositions. However though &#x27;iron is a metal&#x27; may be implied by &#x27;cats lay eggs&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be relevant to it the way in which &#x27;cats are mammals&#x27; and &#x27;mammals give birth to living young&#x27; are relevant to each other. If one states &quot;I love ice cream&quot;, and another person responds &quot;I have a friend named Brad Cook&quot;, then these statements are not relevant. However, if one states &quot;I love ice cream&quot;, and another person responds &quot;I have a friend named Brad Cook who also likes ice cream&quot;, this statement now becomes relevant because it relates to the first person&#x27;s idea.

Another proposal defines relevance or, more accurately, irrelevance information-theoretically. It is easiest to state in terms of variables, which might reflect the values of measurable hypotheses or observation statements. The conditional entropy of an observation variable e conditioned on a variable &quot;h&quot; characterizing alternative hypotheses provides a measure of the irrelevance of the observation variable &quot;e&quot; to the set of competing hypotheses characterized by &quot;h&quot;. It is useful combined with measures of the information content of the variable &quot;e&quot; in terms of its entropy. One can then subtract the content of &quot;e&quot; that is irrelevant to &quot;h&quot; (given by its conditional entropy conditioned on &quot;h&quot;) from the total information content of &quot;e&quot; (given by its entropy) to calculate the amount of information the variable e contains about the set of hypotheses characterized by &quot;h&quot;. Relevance (via the concept of irrelevance) and information content then characterize the observation variable and can be used to measure its sensitivity and specificity (respectively) as a test for alternative hypotheses.

More recently a number of theorists have sought to account for relevance in terms of &quot;possible world logics&quot; in intensional logic. Roughly, the idea is that necessary truths are true in all possible worlds, contradictions (logical falsehoods) are true in no possible worlds, and contingent propositions can be ordered in terms of the number of possible worlds in which they are true. Relevance is argued to depend upon the &quot;remoteness relationship&quot; between an actual world in which relevance is being evaluated and the set of possible worlds within which it is true.

== Application ==
=== Cognitive science and pragmatics ===
In 1986, Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson drew attention to the central importance of relevance decisions in reasoning and communication. They proposed an account of the process of inferring relevant information from any given utterance. To do this work, they used what they called the &quot;Principle of Relevance&quot;: namely, the position that &quot;any utterance addressed to someone automatically conveys the presumption of its own optimal relevance&quot;. The central idea of Sperber and Wilson&#x27;s theory is that all utterances are encountered in some context, and the correct interpretation of a particular utterance is the one that allows most new implications to be made in that context on the basis of the least amount of information necessary to convey it. For Sperber and Wilson, relevance is conceived as relative or subjective, as it depends upon the state of knowledge of a hearer when they encounter an utterance.

Sperber and Wilson stress that this theory is not intended to account for every intuitive application of the English word &quot;relevance&quot;. Relevance, as a technical term, is restricted to relationships between utterances and interpretations, and so the theory cannot account for intuitions such as the one that relevance relationships obtain in problems involving physical objects. If a plumber needs to fix a leaky faucet, for example, some objects and tools are relevant (e.g. a wrench) and others are not (e.g. a waffle iron). And, moreover, the latter seems to be irrelevant in a manner which does not depend upon the plumber&#x27;s knowledge, or the utterances used to describe the problem.

A theory of relevance that seems to be more readily applicable to such instances of physical problem solving has been suggested by Gorayska and Lindsay in a series of articles published during the 1990s. The key feature of their theory is the idea that relevance is goal-dependent. An item (e.g., an utterance or object) is relevant to a goal if and only if it can be an essential element of some plan capable of achieving the desired goal. This theory embraces both propositional reasoning and the problem-solving activities of people such as plumbers, and defines relevance in such a way that what is relevant is determined by the real world (because what plans will work is a matter of empirical fact) rather than the state of knowledge or belief of a particular problem solver.

=== Economics ===

The economist John Maynard Keynes saw the importance of defining relevance to the problem of calculating risk in economic decision-making. He suggested that the relevance of a piece of evidence, such as a true proposition, should be defined in terms of the changes it produces of estimations of the probability of future events. Specifically, Keynes proposed that new evidence &quot;e&quot; is irrelevant to a proposition &quot;x&quot;, given old evidence &quot;q&quot;, if and only if = , otherwise, the proposition is relevant.

There are technical problems with this definition, for example, the relevance of a piece of evidence can be sensitive to the order in which other pieces of evidence are received.

=== Law ===

The meaning of &quot;relevance&quot; in U.S. law is reflected in Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. That rule defines relevance as &quot;having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determinations of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence&quot;. In other words, if a fact were to have no bearing on the truth or falsity of a conclusion, it would be legally irrelevant.

=== Library and information science ===
This field has considered when documents (or document representations) retrieved from databases are relevant or non-relevant. Given a conception of relevance, two measures have been applied: Precision and recall:

Recall = &quot;a&quot; : (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot;), where
: &quot;a&quot; is the number of retrieved, relevant documents,
: &quot;c&quot; is the number of non-retrieved, relevant documents (sometimes termed &quot;silence&quot;).
Recall is thus an expression of how exhaustive a search for documents is.

Precision = &quot;a&quot; : (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;), where
: &quot;a&quot; is the number of retrieved, relevant documents,
: &quot;b&quot; is the number of retrieved, non-relevant documents (often termed &quot;noise&quot;).

Precision is thus a measure of the amount of noise in document-retrieval.

Relevance itself has in the literature often been based on what is termed &quot;the system&#x27;s view&quot; and &quot;the user&#x27;s view&quot;. Hjørland (2010) criticize these two views and defends a &quot;subject knowledge view of relevance&quot;.

=== Politics ===
During the 1960s, &quot;relevance&quot; became a fashionable buzzword, meaning roughly &#x27;relevance to social concerns&#x27;, such as racial equality, poverty, social justice, world hunger, world economic development, and so on. The implication was that some subjects, e.g., the study of medieval poetry and the practice of corporate law, were not worthwhile because they did not address pressing social issues.

<doc id="442689" wikidata="Q6662537" url="?curid=442689" title="Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon">
<text>Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon, (5 October 1732 – 4 April 1802), was a British politician and barrister, who served as Attorney General, Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice. Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with John Dunning, who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and Lord Thurlow who secured for him the Chief Justiceship of Chester in 1780. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon the same year, serving repeatedly as Attorney General under William Pitt the Younger. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of Charles James Fox, and was rewarded with a baronetcy; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP.

On 27 March 1784, he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said &quot;I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all&quot;. On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work &quot;restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law&quot;. He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802.

==Early life and education==
Kenyon was born on 5 November 1732 in Gredington, Flintshire, to Lloyd Kenyon, a country gentleman and Justice of the peace, and his wife, Jane Eddowes. He was initially educated at a school in Hanmer – it was written that &quot;no man ever set out on his career with fewer advantages&quot; than Kenyon. When he was 12 he was sent to Ruthin School, where he learnt French and Latin, and was considered one of the best students at the school. His knowledge of Greek was non-existent, and his scientific training minor; &quot;he was said to have believed to his dying day that the sun goes around the earth&quot;. As a second son, he had initially considered joining the clergy, but instead decided on the law and spent 5 years working as a clerk to Mr W. J. Tomkinson, an attorney. He proved to be an excellent clerk, becoming a &quot;rapid and accurate conveyancer&quot;. Originally happy with the idea of being a simple attorney, after the death of his older brother it was instead assumed he would become a barrister, and Kenyon joined the Middle Temple in November 1750. In February 1755 he left Tomkinson&#x27;s practice and moved to London, where he was called to the Bar on 10 February 1756.

==Career as a barrister==
Without the education or connections that a university education would have provided he was almost entirely unemployed for several years. Kenyon instead lived off an £80 allowance from his father, and money from his richer relatives, spending the time watching Lord Mansfield conduct cases at the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. His early business was almost entirely conveyancing, and to make extra money he began to attend the Welsh Circuit, where Tomlinson&#x27;s contacts allowed him to pick up some small cases. After several years of this he also began attending quarter sessions at Oxford, Stafford and Shrewsbury, &quot;where he was more successful&quot;. While his work slowly began to increase, his main rise was due to his friendship with John Dunning, at the time a similarly near-unemployed barrister. In 1762 one of the leaders of the Northern Circuit died, and his work was given to Dunning; as he found himself with too many cases, he gave many to Kenyon. In 1767, for example, Kenyon dealt with 20 of Dunning&#x27;s cases. As a result of his speedy and efficient work attorneys began to employ him directly, and within 10 years he was making £3,000 a year just from opinions.

Kenyon&#x27;s next rise came about as a result of his introduction to the Duke of Richmond, who was struggling with Sir James Lowther for the control of several Parliamentary constituencies. Kenyon went with Richmond to Carlisle and Cockermouth as his lawyer, and secured the constituencies for Richmond; as a result, Richmond chose to employ Kenyon as his lawyer from then onwards. In 1780 he successfully defended Lord George Gordon for high treason, assisted by Thomas Erskine, and the resulting fame was enough to propel him further up the ranks of his profession and within the political sphere. At the same time he became friends with Lord Thurlow, and when the holder of the Chief Justiceship of Chester died that year, Thurlow ensured that it was given to Kenyon. The rise of Kenyon&#x27;s work in the Court of Chancery was also attributed to his friendship with Thurlow, who as Lord Chancellor was the head of the Court.

==Political career==
When Parliament was dissolved in 1780, Thurlow ensured that Kenyon was returned as a Member of Parliament for Hindon. In April 1782, on the formation of the Rockingham government, Kenyon was made Attorney-General for England and Wales, despite having never sat in the lower office of Solicitor-General or spoken in Parliament. As Attorney General he spoke on only one subject, on 18 June 1782, in regards to the amount of money owed to the Exchequer by the Paymaster of the Forces. This provoked the opposition of Charles James Fox, whose father, Lord Holland, had profited greatly by that office; Kenyon&#x27;s programme could have ruined Fox by making him liable for refunding his father&#x27;s profits as Paymaster. On the death of Rockingham Kenyon continued in his post under the Shelburne Ministry, but left office in April 1783 when that government fell to the Fox-North Coalition. He instead allied himself with William Pitt the Younger, leading the opposition to the first Act of the new government and strongly supporting an opposition bill to reform the Exchequer. When the new government was dismissed on 19 December and Pitt took control, Kenyon was again made Attorney-General. He again took the lead on the issue of the Paymaster of the Forces, and commanded that Richard Rigby, Paymaster until 1782, &quot;do deliver to the House an account of the balance of all public money remaining in his hands on the 13th day of November last&quot;, something Rigby complained was against common practice.

In 1784 Thomas Sewell died, and, as was tradition, Kenyon succeeded him as Master of the Rolls on 27 March. Initially intending to withdraw from Parliament, Kenyon was persuaded to remain as an MP and Attorney General to increase Pitt&#x27;s majority. Having purchased the seat of Tregony he &quot;was resolved to go the whole hog&quot;, and became one of the strongest and most visible supporters of Pitt. With his contacts in Wales, he secured votes for several ministerial candidates in Welsh constituencies. In an attempt to have Charles James Fox removed as an MP he had Fox&#x27;s ballot challenged; while this backfired, he was awarded with a baronetcy for the effective sacrifice of his political career. As a result of this controversy he stated that &quot;legislation was a task to which he had by no means thought himself equal&quot;, and stayed silent in Parliament for the rest of his life.

==Judicial career==
Having withdrawn from politics, Kenyon instead switched his focus to his job as Master of the Rolls. As a judge of the Court of Chancery he was required to deal with cases of equity; though he was almost entirely unfamiliar with the Roman law it was based on, he had previously practised in the Chancery. He was not considered as good as his successor, Sir William Grant, but Lord Eldon wrote that &quot;I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all&quot;. With the retirement of Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, Kenyon succeeded him on 9 June 1788, and was made Baron Kenyon of Gredington, in the county of Flint.

Kenyon&#x27;s appointment was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, as he had practised in a court of equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an &quot;excess of zeal&quot; in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say &quot;My Lord... it would be well if you would stick to your good law and leave off your bad Latin&quot;. As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that a court of law could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he &quot;restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law&quot;. After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.

==Personal life==
In 1773 he married his cousin, Mary Kenyon, with whom he had three sons; Lloyd, who predeceased him, George, and Thomas. Kenyon was noted by John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell as &quot;a man of wonderful quickness of perception, of considerable intellectual nimbleness, of much energy of purpose, and of unwearied industry&quot;, although Campbell noted that, thanks to Kenyon&#x27;s lack of a university education, he knew only &quot;the corner of jurisprudence which he professionally cultivated; he had not even the information generally picked up by the clever clerk of a country attorney&quot;. He was noted as arrogant, despising things he did not understand and condemning any opinions he disagreed with regardless of his knowledge of them. He never attempted to reform the judicial system, and &quot;his habits of sordid parsimony brought discredit on the high station which he filled&quot;. Campbell, however, has been criticized as a biographer. When his &quot;Lives of the Chief Justices&quot; was published, which included his biography of Lord Kenyon, the &quot;Law Magazine&quot; commented that &quot;Lord Campbell has confounded, or not rightly understood, the distinction between true and false. His political virus oozes out in sly general remarks and bantering innuendoes.&quot; (&quot;Law Magazine&quot; vol.43, p5, 209.) Despite this, as a judge he was seen as &quot;profound in legal erudition, patient in judicial discrimination, and of the most determined integrity&quot;.

<text>Città di Castello (); &quot;Castle Town&quot;) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Perugia, in the northern part of Umbria. It is situated on a slope of the Apennines, on the flood plain along the upper part of the river Tiber. The city is north of Perugia and south of Cesena on the motorway SS 3 bis. It is connected by the SS 73 with Arezzo and the A1 highway, situated 38 km (23 mi) west. The &quot;comune&quot; of Città di Castello has an exclave named Monte Ruperto within Marche.

==History==

The town was founded by the ancient Umbri, an Italic tribe, on the left bank of the Tiber River. The town may have come into conflict with the nearby Etruscans. Beginning in the third century BC it became a &quot;civitates federata&quot; of Rome and was subsequently inserted into the &quot;Sexta Regio&quot; of Roman Italy. The Romans knew it as &quot;Tifernum Tiberinum&quot; (&quot;Tifernum on the Tiber&quot;). 

Nearby Pliny the Younger built his &quot;villa in Tuscis&quot;, which is identified with walls, mosaic floors and marble fragments surviving at a place now called Colle Plinio, the &quot;Hill of Pliny&quot;.

In 550 AD Tifernum was largely destroyed during the Ostrogothic campaign by Fantalogus at the orders of Totila. The town was subsequently rebuilt by its bishop Floridus around a castle and renamed first Castrum Felicitatis by Lombards and later Civitas Castelli. By the Donation of Pepin of the Frankish king Pepin the Short in 752, it went to the Papal States.

It became an independent commune in the first half of the 12th century. Among its various rulers was Pier Saccone Tarlati di Pietramala, brother of Guido, Bishop of Arezzo. Pier Saccone sold it in 1322 to Guido Alberto de&#x27; Guidi di Modigliana. In the Middle Ages, the Diocese of Città di Castello included also many territories that are today in the provinces of Arezzo, Forlì-Cesena, Pesaro and Rimini. In the later Middle Ages, it was governed successively by the Guelphs and Ghibellines. In 1375 Città di Castello joined the insurrection of other cities of the States of the Church. Cardinal Robert of Geneva, later Antipope Clement VII, tried to capture it using Breton mercenaries, but was repulsed. Under Pope Martin V in 1420 it was taken by the condottiero Braccio da Montone. Later Niccolò Vitelli, aided by Florence and Milan, became absolute ruler. Antonio da Sangallo the Younger built an extensive palace for the Vitelli family.

In 1474 Sixtus IV sent his nephew Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, later Pope Julius II, to rule the town. After fruitless negotiations, he laid siege to the city, but Vitelli did not surrender until he knew that the command of the army had been given to Duke Federico III da Montefeltro. The following year Vitelli tried unsuccessfully to recapture the city. Cesare Borgia through a conspiracy in Senigallia ordered Vitellozzo Vitelli, who had inherited the city to be strangled on the evening of 31 December 1502 and Città di Castello were added to the Papal possessions.

On 11 September 1860, Città di Castello was occupied by Piedmontese troops. On 17 March 1861, it became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

Towards the end of the twentieth century, the city has seen a considerable expansion northwards toward San Giustino, with industrial parks tracking the river, railroad and main highway. In the area, several kinds of mechanical goods, textiles, ceramics and furnishings are produced. Agriculture is at a very advanced level. Today it&#x27;s the main economic centre in the region.

==Geography==
===Overview===
The town is located in northern Umbria, near the borders with Tuscany and Marche, and the Tiber river flows along its western side. The municipality borders with Apecchio (PU), Arezzo (AR), Citerna, Cortona (AR), Mercatello sul Metauro (PU), Monte Santa Maria Tiberina, Monterchi (AR), Montone, Pietralunga, San Giustino, Sansepolcro (AR), Sant&#x27;Angelo in Vado (PU) and Umbertide.

==Culture==
The dialect is particular and derives in turn from the Romagnolo Gaelic and the eastern Tuscan dialects. The comune territory is one of the largest in Italy, for this reason, dialect changes a lot according to the considered zone. Culture is linked to Marche, Romagna and Tuscany ones.

The art historian Vittorio Sgarbi has referred to the town as the place of the origin of the Renaissance or its capital.

==Main sights==

The city is mostly built of brick, since the local sandstone deriving from the Apennines erodes very rapidly. Its principal monuments include the medieval &quot;Palazzo Comunale&quot;, the tall civic tower or &quot;Torre Comunale&quot;, and the &quot;Pinacoteca Comunale&quot;, an art museum with mostly Renaissance works by Raphael, Luca Signorelli, Andrea della Robbia, Lorenzo Ghiberti, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and others, notable for its external decorations by Giorgio Vasari.

The much-reworked cathedral, from the 18th century with an unfinished 17th-century façade, has an altar frontal (&quot;Paliotto&quot;) of chased silver dating to the 12th century, and a crosier from the 15th. It also houses works by Niccolò Circignani, Rosso Fiorentino and Raffaellino del Colle. The bell tower is in Romanesque style of the 11th century. The cathedral&#x27;s museum is home to the Canoscio hoard, a set of Late Antique silver spoons and plates with Christian motifs, as well as a silvered altarpiece donated by Pope Celestine II in the 12th century, a &quot;Madonna&quot; by Pinturicchio (1486) and &quot;Angels&quot; by Giulio Romano. It also houses a letter by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.

Other religious structures of interest include:
*Sanctuary of the Madonna di Belvedere

The city has memorialized the abstract painter and sculptor Alberto Burri, who was born in Città di Castello, with the &quot;Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri&quot; housing a large permanent museum of his works in the former Palazzo Albizzini.
The Palazzo Terranova in Ronti and the nearby Castello di Santa Eurasia near Monte Tezio in the countryside of Città di Castello are owned by Alexander Lebedev.

<text>Beidaihe District () is a popular beach resort and a district of the city of Qinhuangdao, Hebei province on China&#x27;s Bohai Sea coast. It has an area of and, , a population of 130,104, as well as a coastline of . It is also known as a birding haven.

The Beidaihe Beach Resort stretches from east to west, from the Yinjiao Pavilion to the mouth of the Daihe river. The beach itself is covered with fine yellow sand stretching some 100 meters to the sea. The water is shallow. Mount Lianfeng near the beach has two peaks covered by abundant green pines and cypresses. Lush vegetation, caves, decorated pavilions, secluded paths and winding bridges have made it attractive to visitors from throughout China.

==Use by Communist Party==

Because of its proximity to the capital, Beidaihe has been the location of many important official conferences, and has become well known as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#x27;s summer retreat. It is still commonly used by the CCP&#x27;s highest leadership each July to slip away from the summer heat of Beijing and to plan important strategies in the privacy Beidaihe offers. &quot;Beidaihe,&quot; an American diplomat once said, &quot;is China&#x27;s &#x27;smoke-filled room.&#x27;&quot;

After Mao Zedong led the CCP to power in 1949, the new rulers also developed a taste for seaside atmosphere. Mao himself had a summer resort here. Sanatoriums sprang up to reward the efforts of model workers from every industry. A very large Friendship Guesthouse was constructed in 1954, one of dozens across China, to receive the Soviet &quot;elder brothers&quot; who came to assist Chinese development prior to tensions emerging between Soviet and Chinese leadership.

The most infamous event which occurred here involved Lin Biao, who on 13 September 1971, after he was accused of plotting a coup, fled to his villa here with his wife and a son and boarded a plane for the Soviet Union at the local airport; the plane crashed in Mongolia, killing everyone on board.

These conferences were abandoned by order of Hu Jintao in 2003, mainly for two reasons. First, a conference in a resort area appeared to contradict Hu and Wen Jiabao&#x27;s goal in projecting a frugal image for the party. Second, it was a desire of the leadership under Hu to work through formal party and state mechanisms rather than informal gatherings. However, the Beidaihe meetings resumed in July 2007, when political deliberation took place in anticipation of the 17th Party Congress.

==Administrative divisions==
There are two subdistricts and two towns in Beidaihe.

Subdistricts:
*Xishan Subdistrict (), Dongshan Subdistrict ()

Towns:
*Haibin (), Daihe (), Niutouya ()

<doc id="442696" wikidata="Q336138" url="?curid=442696" title="Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden">
<text>Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden (7 October 1762 – 4 November 1832), was a British barrister and judge who served as Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench between 1818 and 1832. Born in obscure circumstances to a barber and his wife in Canterbury, Abbott was educated initially at a dame school before moving to The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury in 1769. He was noted as an excellent student, receiving an exhibition scholarship from the school in March 1781, when he matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Here he was elected a fellow, and also served as a tutor to the son of Sir Francis Buller, which first made him consider becoming a barrister. He joined the Middle Temple in 1787, transferring to the Inner Temple in 1793, and was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1796. Abbott was noted as an excellent barrister, earning more than any other during his time at the Bar, despite being considered unimaginative and a poor speaker. He was offered a position as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1808, which he turned down; he accepted the same offer in 1816, receiving the customary knighthood and being appointed a Serjeant-at-Law.

Three months after he started sitting as a judge he was transferred to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, where he was initially rather poor, being unfamiliar with the court&#x27;s business. Within two years he showed &quot;the highest judicial excellence&quot;, and when Lord Ellenborough had a stroke in 1818, Abbott was chosen to replace him as Lord Chief Justice. His reign at the head of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench saw the court flourish, with strong justices and his own much-admired abilities. He was appointed to the peerage in 1827, sitting as Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden, and initially attended the House of Lords regularly. His opposition to the Reform Act 1832, which he claimed treated city corporations &quot;with absolute contempt&quot;, led to his refusal to attend the Lords. Continuing to sit as Lord Chief Justice, Abbott gradually grew weaker, and finally fell ill halfway through a two-day trial. His disease baffled doctors, and he died on 4 November 1832 at his home in Queen Square, London.

==Early life and education==
Abbott was born 7 October 1762 in Canterbury to John Abbott, a barber, and his wife Alice. Abbot lived in a &quot;small, mean-looking house&quot; near the Cathedral, and was initially educated at a dame school. During his childhood he was noted as &quot;industrious, apprehensive, regular and correct in all his conduct&quot;. He attended The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, from 1769, where he was such a good student that he received an exhibition scholarship on his matriculation at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in March 1781. At the time there were only two awards at Oxford: the Chancellor&#x27;s medals for English and Latin prose. After an initial attempt to win them which failed, he won the Latin prize in his second year and the English prize in the third. Abbot was then elected a fellow of Corpus Christi where, acting as a tutor to the son of Sir Francis Buller, he first considered becoming a barrister. On 16 November 1787 he became a member of the Middle Temple, transferring to the Inner Temple in 1793, and worked for two years under Sir George Wood as a special pleader; it was said that he had finished his work as a special pleader faster than &quot;any man before or since&quot;. He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1796.

==Career==

Abbott began practising on the Oxford Circuit; while travelling there he had a fall from his horse, which broke his leg in two places and left him permanently lame. In 1802, he published a legal tract, &quot;On Merchants&#x27; Ships and Seamen&quot;, which was praised by his fellow lawyers and earned him a large amount of commercial work; it was later republished in the United States, where it was misattributed to Charles Abbot, the Speaker of the House of Commons. He would be &quot;as eminent and prosperous as a counsel can be at the English bar&quot;, although he refused to apply for silk. From 1802 to 1816 he served as &quot;Devil to the Attorney General&quot;, opening all government prosecutions, and was standing counsel for the Bank of England and many Deans and Prelates in the Church of England. By 1807, he was making £8,000 a year, and later exceeded this amount; it was remarked that he earned more money than any other barrister of that time. Abbott was not a &quot;flashy&quot; barrister; although known as an excellent lawyer, his speeches were monotonous and he lacked an imagination.

In 1808 he was offered a position as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, but refused it. After eight more years of work, however, he felt that his health could no longer take the strain, and accepted a position in the Court of Common Pleas on 24 January 1816, along with becoming a Serjeant-at-Law as required. Abbott was granted the customary knighthood, with the motto &quot;Labore&quot;, which he also used for his peerage. He stayed in this post for barely three months, with no records of his work there surviving, before being transferred against his will to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench on 3 May to replace Simon Le Blanc.

Abbott, unfamiliar with the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (having been a regional lawyer rather than a London-based one), was initially a disappointment, but soon improved. By 1818, he showed &quot;the highest judicial excellence&quot;, although he was criticised for snapping at boring barristers and for taking the government&#x27;s side in prosecutions. 

That year, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Ellenborough had a stroke, forcing his retirement. Most of the other judges and legal figures were inappropriate for the role; Sir Samuel Shepherd, for example, was while an able lawyer too deaf to sit as a judge. As a result, Abbott was appointed, and formally took up his position on 4 November 1818. 

As Lord Chief Justice he saw the Court of King&#x27;s Bench flourish, with competent Justices and his own abilities; &quot;[Abbott] had more knowledge of mankind than any of [the Justices], and was more skilful as a moderator in forensic disputation&quot;. Abbott&#x27;s central weakness as a judge was seen to be his support of James Scarlett, his leader when Abbott was a barrister; &quot;The timid junior, become Chief Justice, still looked up to his old leader with dread, was afraid of offending him, and was always delighted when he could decide in his favour&quot;.

On 30 April 1827, Abbott was made Baron Tenterden, of Hendon in the County of Middlesex; having feared that &quot;Lord Abbott&quot; would leave him open to ridicule, he instead picked the name of a Kentish town near his roots. On 24 May, Abbott formally took up his position, attending the House of Lords regularly, and was the last Chief Justice to wear his official robes to the Lords (other than those acting as interim Speakers). 

In 1830, he introduced several bills to Parliament following reports on the state of the Ecclesiastical Courts, common law courts and law of real property; all were passed, except the ecclesiastical bills, as Parliament ran out of time to hear them. They were heard during the next Parliamentary session in 1831, and both passed; they &quot;by no means established for him the reputation of a skilful legislator... the judges have found it infinitely difficult to put a reasonable construction upon them&quot;. The Reform Act 1832 led to his departure from the Lords, and is considered to have greatly shortened his life; he fought strongly for the city corporations, which he claimed the bill treated &quot;with absolute contempt&quot;, but would be defeated. Having threatened that, should it pass, &quot;Never, never my Lords, shall I enter the doors of this House&quot;, he was true to his word, and never returned to politics, although from 8 August to 3 September 1827 he was interim Chancellor of the Exchequer, following the convention that, when vacant, the position should be held by the Lord Chief Justice.

==Death==
Abbott first began to grow ill in May 1832, when he wrote to Sir Egerton Brydges that &quot;My spirit is so depressed, that when I am not strongly excited by some present object that admits of no delay, I sink into something very nearly approaching torpidity&quot;. Although he got somewhat better, giving his annual dinner to the King&#x27;s Counsel, it was noticed that he was unable to drink his wine properly. 

He went to the Midland Circuit in June, as it was the easiest one, but he suffered from &quot;a violent cough&quot; and other symptoms, returning to his home in Hendon. After the first day of a two-day case he found himself losing his appetite and suffering from a fever, which caused him to talk incoherently and become delirious. The disease baffled doctors, and finally killed him on 4 November 1832 at his home in Queen Square, London; his last words were &quot;and now, gentlemen of the jury, you will consider of your verdict&quot;. He was interred at the Foundling Hospital, of which he was a governor.

==Personal life==
Abbott married Mary Lamotte on 30 July 1795. He enjoyed the domestic element of his life, and records show love poetry written to his wife. Prior to their marriage Mary had sent him a lock of her hair; in exchange, he wrote a poem for her entitled &quot;The Answer of a Lock of Hair to the Inquiries of its Former Mistress&quot;. The couple had two sons and two daughters; John (2nd Baron Tenterden), Charles, Mary, and Catherine. Catherine later married John Rowland Smyth.

Abbott was considered cautious, with an &quot;aversion to all that was experimental&quot; and a &quot;want of fancy&quot; which were considered excellent traits for a judge, giving him &quot;a very prominent rank indeed amongst our ablest judges&quot;. He possessed a violent disposition; &quot;his temper was naturally bad; it was hasty and it was violent; forming a natural contrast with the rest of his mind&quot;, but he successfully controlled this. This occasionally came out in court, however, and he was noted as particularly caustic and intolerant of unnecessarily complex sentences. When one witness, an apothecary, used a particularly complex medical phrase, Abbott shouted that he should &quot;Speak English sir, if you can, or I must swear in an interpreter&quot;. He was considered &quot;dull in private life as well as in public; and neither crimes nor follies could ever be imputed upon him&quot;; despite this he was &quot;a great magistrate, and his judgments [were] studied and admired&quot;. 

Edward Foss wrote of him that &quot;no judge ever sat on the bench who displayed greater learning, cleverness and discrimination; nor whose judgments have ever been so undisputed.

<doc id="442703" wikidata="Q7097302" url="?curid=442703" title="Operation Mountain Resolve">
<text>Operation Mountain Resolve was launched by a coalition led by the United States on 7 November 2003 in the Nuristan province and Kunar province in Afghanistan. It involved an airdrop into the Hindu Kush mountains by the U.S. 10th Mountain Division and resulted in the killing of Hezbi commander Ghulam Sakhee, a few clashes, and the finding of some minor weapon caches.

==Background==

Elements of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment (2–22 IN), 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), were relocated to Bagram Airfield (BAF) from Kandahar in early November, 2003. Their mission was to conduct combat operations in conjunction with the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF). After spending a week in the planning process, Alpha, Bravo and 2nd Platoon of Charlie Company, 2–22 IN, were inserted into the Nuristan region of Afghanistan, to conduct a &quot;hammer and anvil&quot; operation. The &quot;hammer&quot; would consist of the elements from 2–22 IN, with the &quot;anvil&quot; being three different elements of various CJSOTF operating in three northern sectors. 2–22 IN was tasked with pushing up the Waygal River Valley in an effort to push suspected Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces further north, into the net established by CJSOTF.

On the night of 6 November 2003, two full companies and one platoon of 2–22 IN (A Co, B Co and C Co&#x27;s 2nd Platoon) inserted by CH-47 Chinook helicopter into farm fields on the outskirts of Namgalam Village in the eastern Afghan province of Nuristan. 1st and 3rd Platoon of C Co. 2–22 IN were held in reserve as a quick reaction force at BAF. B Co. 2–22 IN was the lead element, with A Co. 2–22 IN screening along B Co&#x27;s flank on the eastern ridgeline that formed the Waygal River Valley. Approximately 1 kilometer to the front of B Co. was a Scout/ Sniper team providing route reconnaissance and early warning. 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment (10th MTN DIV), established a fire base in the vicinity of the insertion landing zone (LZ), which would provide 105 mm howitzer and 120 mm mortar support as well as secure lines of communication and resupply. Due to the restrictive terrain, it became near impossible to conduct a tactical movement using formations other than single file. The first half of the operation occurred over the course of five days, ending with the establishment of resupply LZ&#x27;s, with B Co. 2 kilometers north of the village of Tazagul Kala, and A Co. approximately 3 kilometers to the southeast near the village of Moladis. In the early evening of 10 November, B Co was ordered to cross the Waygal River and scale the mountain to the east, designated Objective Winchester, to confirm or deny the presence of suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. The Scout/ Sniper team was already moving across elevated terrain to the objective but had been delayed by an injury to a soldier who required aerial medical evacuation. Upon reaching Objective Winchester, several detainees were taken for questioning but evidence suggested that the majority of Anti-Coalition militants had fled to the north 1–2 days prior. B Co. remained on OBJ Winchester throughout the night. A Navy SEAL command and control team co-located on the resupply LZ at the base of the mountain directed AC 130 Specter Gunship fires onto enemy positions observed by the aircraft, but no battle damage assessment was able to be conducted from the ground due to the restrictive terrain. The next morning all 2–22 IN elements were extracted and returned to BAF.

==Follow Up==

One week later, 2–22 IN elements, again from A Co, B Co and C co. 2nd Platoon were sent back into the Waygal River Valley based on intelligence received indicating the possible presence of a High Value Target (HVT) in the vicinity of the village of Aranas, located approximately 8–10 kilometers northeast of the extraction LZ from the previous week. 1st and 2nd Platoons from B Co. inserted into blocking positions on the terraced farm fields surrounding Aranas. 3rd Platoon B Co. moved from a blocking position and began searching the village. A Co. was inserted into almost hip deep snow, to establish an outer cordon 4–5 kilometers to the northeast. The search yielded similar results as Objective Winchester, signs of ACM presence, but the militants having pushed to the northeast 1–2 days prior. Due to the severely restrictive terrain, in order to be extracted, the companies had to move to their prior extraction LZ, making the 15 kilometer movement in less than 3 hours to make the extraction time. All companies extracted on time and returned to BAF via CH-47 Chinook. All told, the planning and conduct of Operation Mountain Resolve encompassed nearly one month. The actions of the CJSOTF operating to the north are currently classified so the final results of the operation are unknown.

==Problems Encountered==

Tactical Movement was difficult, and near impossible in any formation other than a file. In this region which bordered Pakistan, the large signature created by the massive Air Assault gave ACMs the opportunity to flee across the border. Individual Soldier Loads were cumbersome but necessary due to the extended nature of the operation. At one point, local pack mules were procured and used to haul equipment into higher elevations.

<doc id="442706" wikidata="Q333102" url="?curid=442706" title="Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman">
<text>Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman, (23 July 177926 September 1854) was an English lawyer, judge and politician. He served as Lord Chief Justice between 1832 and 1850.

==Background and education==
Denman was born in London, the son of Dr Thomas Denman. In his fourth year, he attended Palgrave Academy in Suffolk, where his education was supervised by Anna Laetitia Barbauld and her husband. He continued to Eton and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1800. In 1806 he was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and at once entered upon practice.

==Legal and judicial career==

His success was rapid, and in a few years he attained a position at the bar second only to that of Henry Brougham and James Scarlett. He distinguished himself by his defence of the Luddites; but his most brilliant appearance was as one of the counsel for Queen Caroline. His speech before the House of Lords was very powerful, and some competent judges even considered it not inferior to Brougham&#x27;s. It contained one or two daring passages, which made the King his bitter enemy, and retarded his legal promotion. Unfortunately he made a notable gaffe when he compared the Queen to the Biblical woman taken in adultery, who was told to &quot;go away and sin no more&quot;. This suggested that her counsel had no belief in the Queen&#x27;s innocence, and produced the mocking satire:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Most Gracious Queen, we thee implore
To go away and sin no more
Or if that effort be too great
To go away at any rate&quot;.
&lt;/poem&gt;

At the general election of 1818 he was returned Member of Parliament for Wareham, and at once took his seat with the Whig opposition. In the following year, he was returned for Nottingham, which seat he represented until 1826 and again from 1830 until his elevation to the bench in 1832. His liberal principles had caused his exclusion from office till in 1822 he was appointed Common Serjeant of London by the corporation of London. In 1830 he was made Attorney General under Lord Grey&#x27;s administration and was knighted on 24 November that year.

Two years later he was made Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench and was sworn of the Privy Council two days later. In 1834, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Denman, &quot;of Dovedale, in the County of Derby&quot;. As a judge he is best remembered for his decision in the important privilege case of &quot;Stockdale v. Hansard&quot; (9 Ad. &amp; El. I.; II Ad. &amp; El. 253). In 1841 he presided, as Lord High Steward, over the trial in the House of Lords of the Earl of Cardigan for attempted murder. In &quot;O&#x27;Connell v the Queen&quot;, in 1844, he led the majority of the Lords in quashing the conviction for sedition of Daniel O&#x27;Connell. This is a tribute to his integrity since O&#x27;Connell was regarded with aversion by the British ruling class; but Denman, as he made clear, could not accept that he had received a fair trial. In 1850 he resigned from his chief justiceship and retired into private life. He was a Governor of the Charter House, and a Vice-President of the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. He also strove with great energy, both as a writer and as a judge, to effect the abolition of the slave trade.

==Family==
Lord Denman married Theodosia Anne, daughter of Reverend Richard Vevers, in 1804. His Derbyshire seat was Middleton Hall, Stoney Middleton. He died at Stoke Albany, Northamptonshire aged 75, and was succeeded in the barony by his oldest son Thomas. Another son, Joseph, was a Royal Navy officer, while another, George, was an MP and High Court judge.

==Cases==
*&quot;Williams v. Carwardine&quot; (1833) 4 B. &amp; Ad. 621
*&quot;Stockdale v. Hansard&quot; 9 Ad. &amp; El. I.; II Ad. &amp; El. 253
*&quot;Lynch v. Nurdin&quot; 1 QB 29, (1841) Arn and H 158, (1841) 113 ER 1041
*&quot;O&#x27;Connell v The Queen&quot; [1844] 11 Cl. &amp; Fin. 155

==Albums and EPs==
===&quot;Please&quot;===
Recorded and mixed in February/March 1993 in a house in Van Nuys, California. Most of the songs were written while Nathanson was in high school and a freshman at Pitzer College in Claremont, CA. Before this, Nathanson had recorded only demos. This was his first collection of songs ever put on CD. &quot;Please&quot; was released in the spring of 1993.

===&quot;Ernst&quot;===
Recorded in San Francisco in the winter of 1997. An entirely acoustic record, the instrumentation is mostly acoustic guitar with some accordion, cellos and percussion. This record was mixed at Toast Studios in San Francisco, by Jaquire King.

===&quot;Not Colored Too Perfect&quot;===
This record is a compilation of unreleased material, the bulk of which was recorded in San Rafael, CA in the fall of 1997. Two other songs on this compilation, &quot;You&#x27;re Smiling&quot; and &quot;Wait Up&quot; were recorded in Santa Barbara, CA in the summer of 1995. The final two songs, &quot;Trace of a Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; and &quot;Vandalized&quot; were taken from the unreleased record by Nathanson&#x27;s college band Here Comes Everybody. The HCE album was recorded in Claremont, CA, in the spring of 1995 but was never released. Both these songs were written by the drummer in the band, Bill Foreman.

===&quot;Still Waiting for Spring&quot;===
Recorded December 1998 in Cotati, CA. and January 1999 at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco, with Mark Weinberg. This record features David Immergluck &amp; Charlie Gillingham of Counting Crows on tracks including the song &quot;Loud&quot;, which was featured on the television show Dawson&#x27;s Creek. The record was mixed at Different Fur in San Francisco and released spring of 1999.

===&quot;When Everything Meant Everything&quot;===
Recorded in the Winter of 2002, at Trakworx in South San Francisco. An entire album of songs was recorded but the release was shortened to an EP when Nathanson signed to Universal Records halfway through the mixing process. Studio versions of &quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; appear only on this EP. It was produced by Mark Weinberg and Nathanson and released in the fall of 2002.

===&quot;Beneath These Fireworks&quot;===
Recorded in Los Angeles in the winter of 2003, the team included drummer Matt Chamberlain, guitar player David Garza, and Glen Phillips of the band Toad The Wet Sprocket for background vocals. &quot;Lucky Boy&quot;, from &quot;Still Waiting for Spring&quot; was re-recorded for this record, as were most of the songs from the &quot;When Everything Meant Everything&quot; EP/sessions. It was mixed by Mark Endert in Los Angeles and released on October 14, 2003. &quot;Suspended&quot; and &quot;I Saw&quot; were released as singles, and more than half the record was licensed to television shows like &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;, and &quot;Men in Trees&quot;.

===&quot;At the Point&quot;===
Upon deciding that the major label world was not for him, Nathanson got out of his contract with Universal Records and released &quot;At the Point.&quot; Recorded live over the course of 3 nights at The Point in Bryn Mawr, PA in June 2005, it was Nathanson&#x27;s only live album until his 2020 release &quot;Live in Paradise: Boston&quot;. This record was released in April 2006 and debuted at #29 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart the week of its release.

===&quot;Some Mad Hope&quot;===
&quot;Some Mad Hope&quot; was recorded between August 2005 and March 2007 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Cotati, CA. The album was made independently, and Nathanson partnered with Vanguard Records for its release in August 2007. It debuted at #60 on the Billboard Top 200 and was on the charts for 34 weeks. Various songs on the record were placed on television shows, including &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;90210&quot;, &quot;Vampire Diaries&quot;, and &quot;American Idol&quot;.

===&quot;Modern Love&quot;===
Nathanson&#x27;s album &quot;Modern Love&quot; was released on June 21, 2011. The first single, &quot;Faster&quot;, was released in March. In addition to the second single with Sugarland, &quot;Run&quot;, the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Modern Love&quot; reached the top 15 on the MusicBase Adult Album Alternative chart in September 2012 due to considerable airplay on AAA formatted radio stations. Nathanson was the opening act on select dates for Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s Stronger Tour January 13, 2012 to April 10, 2012.

In an interview with &quot;Broken Records Magazine&quot;, Nathanson said &quot;Modern Love&quot; was a &quot;powerful record&quot; and that he aimed to model its sound and production after his favorite 80&#x27;s bands and songs.

The tour kicked off in Portland, Oregon on September 20 and ended in Austin, Texas on November 23, with 45 dates total.

In a statement to his fans, Nathanson said they should expect, &quot;new songs, new stories, a white Bengal tiger and confetti cannons (ok, not the last two).&quot; The next single to be released was &quot;Kinks Shirt&quot;.

===&quot;Show Me Your Fangs&quot;===

Nathanson&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Show Me Your Fangs&quot;, was released in the U.S. on October 2, 2015. The first single, &quot;Headphones&quot;, featuring Lolo was released in June 2014.

In May 2015, the next single &quot;Gold in the Summertime&quot;, was released and Nathanson headed out on a nationwide tour with Train and The Fray. The tour kicked off on May 21 at Sleep Train Amphitheatre at Sacramento in Marysville CA, with shows throughout the U.S. The tour wrapped up on July 25 at Gorge Amphitheatre in Quincy, Wash. &quot;Giants&quot;, the third single off the newest album, was released in August, 2015. &quot;Giants&quot; was used as the theme song for the 2016 World Series of Poker on ESPN.

===&quot;Pyromattia&quot;===
Matt Nathanson released an EP of Def Leppard covers titled &quot;Pyromattia&quot; in the U.S. on Friday, June 8, 2018. The title is a play on Def Leppard&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Pyromania&quot;. &quot;Pyromattia&quot; features songs from that album as well as 1981&#x27;s &quot;High &#x27;N&#x27; Dry&quot;, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Hysteria&quot;, and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Euphoria&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Nathanson said that Def Leppard singer Joe Elliott liked the album, specifically commenting about his cover of &quot;Stage Fright&quot;. In a post on Facebook, Nathanson indicated he was a lifelong Def Leppard fan. In that same post, he also teased a forthcoming album of original material, but gave no details.

=== &quot;Boston Accent&quot; ===
On July 29, 2022, Nathanson released his 12th studio album, &quot;Boston Accent.&quot; Produced by Butch Walker, the album is &quot;about being jealous of the cool kids who got to spend their summers on Nantucket and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. It&#x27;s about how the hint of a Boston accent can make me drop my guard and feel connected to a complete stranger.&quot; Nathanson noted in an interview that he left his native Massachusetts at age 18 for California and &quot;never looked back...&quot;

<doc id="442713" wikidata="Q5080374" url="?curid=442713" title="Charles Lucy">
<text>Charles Lucy (1814 – 18 May 1873) was a British historical painter active during the Victorian era. Born in Hereford, he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and Royal Academy of Arts. He won multiple prizes in art competitions held during the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament, but none were ultimately displayed within the building. Various engravings and sketches were made of his works, which included historical scenes alongside portraits of various historical and contemporary political figures. He served as the co-founder and instructor of a drawing school in Camden Town, London. Following years of declining health, he died in 1873.

==Biography==
Lucy was born in Hereford in 1814. He began work as an apprentice to his uncle, a chemist, but pursued art as a hobby from an early age. He produced his first painting while in Hereford, an allegorical celebration of the Reform Bill, which was hung in the offices of the &quot;Hereford Times&quot;. After a brief stay in London, he travelled to Paris in order to attend the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under the Romanticist Paul Delaroche. After some time in Paris, he returned to London to study at the Royal Academy of Arts. As a student, he supported himself through commissions. Following graduation, he was hired as a copyist and created various copies of historic works held at Paris and the Hague.

=== Career ===

He first exhibited a portrait at the Royal Academy in 1838, where he was recorded as living in Hereford. He exhibited &quot;The Interview between Milton and Galileo&quot; at the Royal Academy in 1840, followed by two additional paintings in 1843. An &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; obituary describes a fourteen-year stay at the French artist colony of Barbizon, but this is not attested in other biographies. By 1845, he lived in London, where he shared a studio with fellow historical painter Ford Madox Brown. He founded a drawing school at Camden Town alongside Cave Thomas and Thomas Seddon, where he would teach for a number of years.

In 1844, for the second contest of the Fine Arts Commission (created to furnish the reconstructed Houses of Parliament) he created a large fresco, &quot;The Roman empress Agrippina interceding with the emperor Claudius,&quot; &quot;on behalf of the family of Caractacus&quot;. He won a £100 premium, but was not appointed to create a work for the House of Lords. Two later pieces produced in 1845 and 1847 were rejected by the Commission, but he was awarded a £200 premium in 1847 for &quot;The Departure of the Pilgrim Fathers&quot;. A large painting measuring 10 by 13 feet, it depicts the Pilgrims departing from Delfshaven. It was ultimately not included within the House, but exhibited across much of the United Kingdom during the early 1850s, and was later donated to the Pilgrim Hall Museum. The same subject matter was ultimately painted in the House of Lords by Charles West Cope. A now-lost painting by Lucy, depicting the Pilgrim&#x27;s arrival at Plymouth Rock, served the basis for a heavily circulated engraving produced .

Lucy produced various historical paintings which later served the basis for engravings. His &quot;Nelson meditating in the cabin of the Victory previously to the battle of Trafalgar&quot; was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1854, before being sold to Robert Peel the following year. Joshua Walmsley commissioned eight portrait paintings from Lucy in 1869, now held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was plagued with health problems in his later years, and died at Notting Hill in London on 18 May 1873, leaving behind a number of unfinished commissions. He had one son, Charles Hampden Lucy.

<text>A temple garment, also referred to as garments, the garment of the holy priesthood, or Mormon underwear, is a type of underwear worn by adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement after they have taken part in the endowment ceremony. Garments are required for any individual who previously participated in the endowment ceremony to enter a temple. The undergarments are viewed as a symbolic reminder of the covenants made in temple ceremonies and are seen as a symbolic and/or literal source of protection from the evils of the world.

The garment is given as part of the washing and anointing portion of the endowment. Today, the temple garment is worn primarily by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and by members of some Mormon fundamentalist churches. Adherents consider them to be sacred and not suitable for public display. Anti-Mormon activists have occasionally publicly displayed or defaced temple garments to express their opposition to the LDS Church.

== Purpose ==

According to the LDS Church, the temple garments serve a number of purposes. First, the garment provides the member &quot;a constant reminder&quot; of the covenants they made in the temple. Second, the garment &quot;when properly worn ... provides protection against temptation and evil.&quot; Wearing the garment is also &quot;an outward expression of an inward commitment&quot; to follow Jesus Christ. General authority Carlos E. Asay adds that the garment &quot;strengthens the wearer to resist temptation, fend off evil influences, and stand firmly for the right.&quot;

The nature of the protection believed to be afforded by temple garments is ambiguous and varies between adherents. Researchers who interviewed a sample of Latter-day Saints who wear the temple garment reported that virtually all wearers expressed a belief that wearing the garment provided &quot;spiritual protection&quot; and encouraged them to keep their covenants. Some of those interviewed &quot;asserted that the garment also provided physical protection, while others seemed less certain of any &quot;physical&quot; aspect to protection.&quot; In Mormon folklore, tales are told of Latter-day Saints who credit their temple garments with helping them survive car wrecks, fires, and natural disasters.

In 2014, the LDS Church released an explanatory video online that showed photographs of both temple garments and the outer clothing used in temple worship. The video states that there &quot;is nothing magical or mystical about temple garments.&quot;

== Sanctity among members ==

To members of the LDS Church, the temple garment represents the sacred and personal aspects of their relationship with God. Church president Joseph F. Smith taught that the garment was to be held as &quot;the most sacred of all things in the world, next to their own virtue, next to their own purity of life.&quot; For this reason, most church members feel uncomfortable discussing the garment in a casual or disrespectful manner. Some church leaders have compared the garment to the clerical vestments worn by clergy of other churches. Church leaders have publicly discussed the above principles and beliefs in general terms since the mid-1840s. Many Latter-day Saints view the garment associated with the temple rites as sacred. Some church members have criticized the sale of garments on online auction sites. Members are instructed not to dispose of old or torn garments by throwing them in the trash, but rather to cut them to pieces with scissors, or burn them instead.

==Garment origins and evolution==
The garment as first described in the 1840s was a one-piece undergarment extending to the ankles and the wrists, resembling a union suit, with an open crotch and a collar. It was made of unbleached cotton and was held together with ties in a double knot. Most garments were home-made.

=== Garment markings ===

The original garment had four marks that were snipped into the cloth as part of the original Nauvoo endowment ceremony. These marks were a reverse-L-shaped symbol on the right breast, a V-shaped symbol on the left breast, and horizontal marks at the navel and over the right knee. These cuts were later replaced by embroidered or screen-printed symbols.

The marks in the garments are sacred symbols.
The V-shaped symbol on the left breast was referred to as &quot;The Compasses&quot;, while the reverse-L-shaped symbol on the right breast was referred to by early church leaders as &quot;The Square&quot;.

According to a description by church president John Taylor in 1883, the &quot;Square&quot; represents &quot;the justice and fairness of our Heavenly Father, that we will receive all the good that is coming to us or all that we earn, on a square deal&quot;, and the &quot;Compasses&quot; represents &quot;the North Star&quot;. In addition to the Square and Compasses, Taylor described the other symbols as follows: the collar represented the idea that the Lord&#x27;s &quot;yoke is easy and [his] burden is light&quot;, or the &quot;Crown of the Priesthood&quot;; the double-knotted strings represented &quot;the Trinity&quot; and &quot;the marriage covenant&quot;; the navel mark represents &quot;strength in the navel and marrow in the bones&quot;; and the knee mark represents &quot;that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ&quot;.

In 1926, LDS Church apostle David O. McKay offered an updated description that was later incorporated into the church&#x27;s endowment ceremony. According to McKay&#x27;s explanation, the &quot;mark of the Compass&quot; represents &quot;an undeviating course leading to eternal life; a constant reminder that desires, appetites, and passions are to be kept within the bounds the Lord has set; and that all truth may be circumscribed into one great whole&quot;; the &quot;mark of the Square&quot; represents &quot;exactness and honor&quot; in keeping the commandments and covenants of God; the navel mark represents &quot;the need of constant nourishment to body and spirit&quot;; and the &quot;knee mark&quot; represents &quot;that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is the Christ&quot;. Unlike Taylor, McKay did not describe the symbolism of the collar or the tie-strings because those elements of the garment had been eliminated in 1922.

===Garment color===

In 1893, the church expressed an official preference for white garments, which has since become the standard color, with the exception of military garments. Members of the military can submit regulation military T-shirts of any color to the church for custom addition of the symbolic markings. While sand-colored or &quot;coyote tan&quot; garments were once available, the church&#x27;s preferred supplier no longer manufactures them.

=== Design ===

For several decades after its introduction in the 1840s, the original 19th-century union-suit style was accepted within Mormon doctrine as being unalterable. In 1906, church president Joseph F. Smith characterized as a &quot;grievous sin&quot; any attempt, in the name of changing fashion trends, to modify the 1840s garment pattern, which he characterized as &quot;sacred, unchanged, and unaltered from the very pattern in which God gave them.&quot; However, while the original pattern of the garment is still in use by some Mormon fundamentalists, the LDS Church has updated the original pattern, which the fundamentalists denounce.

In 1923, a letter from church president Heber J. Grant to stake and temple presidents, stated that after careful and prayerful consideration the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church had unanimously decided that specific modifications would be permitted to the garments: sleeves could end at the elbow; legs could be shortened to just below the knee; and buttons could be used instead of strings. The collar was eliminated and the open crotch closed. Other changes were made after 1923 which shortened the sleeves and legs further and eliminated buttons.

In the 1930s, the LDS Church built Beehive Clothing Mills, which was responsible for manufacturing and selling garments. This led to a more standardized design. During this time women&#x27;s garments were one-piece designs that ended just above the knees and had a cap sleeve. In the 1970s, the first two-piece garment became available and Mormons generally accepted the change. Today, garments are made in both styles with a variety of different fabrics. Feminine styles are sold with either a rounded or a sweetheart neckline with cap sleeves, with sweetheart necklines usually following the line of the bra. There are also two styles of necklines for men.

Endowed church members can purchase garments through church distribution centers worldwide, through the mail, and online. They are sold at a moderate price that is assumed to be near cost. To purchase temple garments, members must have received their temple endowment. To purchase garments online, they must provide their membership record number. Endowed members can find their membership record number on their temple recommend or by obtaining a copy of their Individual Ordinance Summary.

As late as 1977, church members were instructed they could make their own garments with the approval of their local leaders. As of 2010, the official documentation of church institutional policies known as &quot;Handbook 2: Administering the Church&quot; states that, of both garments and temple clothing in general, only temple aprons may be hand made, and only then using &quot;the approved apron embroidery and sewing kit that is available through Church Distribution Services.&quot;

== LDS Church teachings ==

In the church&#x27;s &quot;General Handbook&quot;, leaders are instructed to tell members they should wear garments throughout their lives, and that they should not alter them. In the temple recommend interview, members are asked if they wear the garment as instructed in the temple. Members are told that they should not partially or completely remove any portion of the garment to participate in activities that can &quot;reasonably be done with the garment worn properly beneath the clothing&quot;.

Garment wearers are also instructed that they should not adjust garments or wear them in a way that would accommodate the wearing certain styles of clothing. This includes uncovering areas of the body that would normally be covered by the garment, such as the shoulders and lower thighs. Prior to the disposal of old garments, members are instructed to cut out the markings on them.

== Biblical references and LDS scholarship ==

The temple garment is usually identified by Mormon scholars with the sacred &quot;linen breeches&quot; (michnasayim/mikhnesei bahd) and the &quot;coat of linen&quot; (kuttoneth) that ancient Israelite priests were commanded to wear, as referenced in Exodus 28:39-43.

Additionally, the temple garment has been compared to the modern tallit katan, a sacred undershirt of Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Judaism. Both the temple garment and the tallit katan are meant to be worn all day under regular clothing as a constant reminder of the covenants, promises, and obligations the wearer is under.

==Use in protests==

Some church opponents have used public occasions, like the biannual church conferences, to publicly mock and parody the wearing of temple garments. During the October 2003 LDS Church General Conference, some anti-Mormon demonstrators outside the LDS Conference Center reportedly spat and stomped on garments in view of those attending the conference. One protester blew his nose into a garment he wore around his neck. A scuffle broke out between a protester and two members of the church who attempted to take the garments from him. To avoid a repeat of the conflict, the municipality of Salt Lake City planned new protest buffer zones for the April 2004 conference in Salt Lake City.

<text>A Mind Forever Voyaging (&quot;AMFV&quot;) is an interactive fiction game designed and implemented by Steve Meretzky and published in 1985 by Infocom. The game was intended as a polemical critique of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s politics.

==Plot==
The story is set in the United States of North America, which is similar to the real-world United States, in the year 2031. The player controls PRISM, the world&#x27;s first sentient computer.

PRISM is instructed by its creator, Dr. Abraham Perelman, to run a simulation of Senator Richard Ryder&#x27;s &quot;Plan for Renewed National Purpose&quot;. This plan is intended to address the nation&#x27;s failing economy, the high teenage suicide rate, and to strengthen the nation&#x27;s position in a nuclear arms race.

PRISM simulates the life of a man called Perry Simm, ten years after the plan has gone into effect. The player experiences some time in Perry&#x27;s life. The plan appears to have had positive effects. Based on this simulation, the plan is deemed viable and preparations are set in motion.

However, Perelman feels that the ten-year simulation isn&#x27;t enough, and makes PRISM do a simulation of the situation 20 years after the plan started, and then 30 years. Perelman is concerned by the simulations, but he needs more evidence to discredit the plan, as there are powerful people behind it. PRISM does a 40-year simulation, and with that still not quite satisfying Perelman, a 50-year simulation. The simulations show the situation becoming worse and worse with time.

PRISM goes into sleep mode while Perelman is preparing to present the findings to the government. When it wakes up, the facility is locked down by the military. Senator Ryder comes into Perelman&#x27;s office and starts shouting at him. PRISM starts recording his words. After Ryder has left, suspicious &quot;maintenance workers&quot; come to the facility and make their way to PRISM&#x27;s core, but PRISM renders them harmless. Then a news interface becomes available, and PRISM broadcasts the recording of Ryder&#x27;s intimidation. The plan is thoroughly discredited and Senator Ryder is publicly disgraced.

== Development ==
Meretzky, the author, said in an interview that his intent with the game was to convey a negative view of Reagan&#x27;s policies. In another interview, he said that he had hoped for &quot;AMFV&quot; to cause controversy with its political content, expressing disappointment at the lack of hate mail.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that parts of &quot;AMFV&quot; are &quot;transcendent&quot;. In a 1998 retrospective review, AllGame gave the Macintosh version three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that the game provides fun exploration, but has hardly any replay value. In 2014, &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; gave the game four stars out of five in its retrospective review, calling it &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot;, but saying that it does not quite reach its goals.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; listed it as number 66 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in 1996, commenting that &quot;This Steve Meretzky triumph is one of the few games ... to attempt something more deep in the interactive entertainment medium than killing or humor. It presents a grim view of a dark future not by telling you about it, but rather by letting you experience it and do things for yourself.&quot;

<doc id="442736" wikidata="Q296847" url="?curid=442736" title="ARP spoofing">
<text>In computer networking, ARP spoofing (also ARP cache poisoning or ARP poison routing) is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker&#x27;s MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.

ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to intercept data frames on a network, modify the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, man in the middle, or session hijacking attacks.

The attack can only be used on networks that use ARP, and requires that the attacker has direct access to the local network segment to be attacked.

==ARP vulnerabilities==
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a widely used communications protocol for resolving Internet layer addresses into link layer addresses.

When an Internet Protocol (IP) datagram is sent from one host to another in a local area network, the destination IP address must be resolved to a MAC address for transmission via the data link layer. When another host&#x27;s IP address is known, and its MAC address is needed, a broadcast packet is sent out on the local network. This packet is known as an &quot;ARP request&quot;. The destination machine with the IP in the ARP request then responds with an &quot;ARP reply&quot; that contains the MAC address for that IP.

ARP is a stateless protocol. Network hosts will automatically cache any ARP replies they receive, regardless of whether network hosts requested them. Even ARP entries that have not yet expired will be overwritten when a new ARP reply packet is received. There is no method in the ARP protocol by which a host can authenticate the peer from which the packet originated. This behavior is the vulnerability that allows ARP spoofing to occur.

==Attack anatomy==
The basic principle behind ARP spoofing is to exploit the lack of authentication in the ARP protocol by sending spoofed ARP messages onto the LAN. ARP spoofing attacks can be run from a compromised host on the LAN, or from an attacker&#x27;s machine that is connected directly to the target LAN.

An attacker using ARP spoofing will disguise as a host to the transmission of data on the network between the users. Then users would not know that the attacker is not the real host on the network.

Generally, the goal of the attack is to associate the attacker&#x27;s host MAC address with the IP address of a target host, so that any traffic meant for the target host will be sent to the attacker&#x27;s host. The attacker may choose to inspect the packets (spying), while forwarding the traffic to the actual default destination to avoid discovery, modify the data before forwarding it (man-in-the-middle attack), or launch a denial-of-service attack by causing some or all of the packets on the network to be dropped.

==Defenses==

===Static ARP entries===
The simplest form of certification is the use of static, read-only entries for critical services in the ARP cache of a host. IP address-to-MAC address mappings in the local ARP cache may be statically entered. Hosts don&#x27;t need to transmit ARP requests where such entries exist. While static entries provide some security against spoofing, they result in maintenance efforts as address mappings for all systems in the network must be generated and distributed. This does not scale on a large network since the mapping has to be set for each pair of machines resulting in &quot;n&quot;2-&quot;n&quot; ARP entries that have to be configured when &quot;n&quot; machines are present; On each machine there must be an ARP entry for every other machine on the network; &quot;n-1&quot; ARP entries on each of the &quot;n&quot; machines.

===Detection and prevention software===
Software that detects ARP spoofing generally relies on some form of certification or cross-checking of ARP responses. Uncertified ARP responses are then blocked. These techniques may be integrated with the DHCP server so that both dynamic and static IP addresses are certified. This capability may be implemented in individual hosts or may be integrated into Ethernet switches or other network equipment. The existence of multiple IP addresses associated with a single MAC address may indicate an ARP spoof attack, although there are legitimate uses of such a configuration. In a more passive approach, a device listens for ARP replies on a network, and sends a notification via email when an ARP entry changes.

AntiARP also provides Windows-based spoofing prevention at the kernel level. ArpStar is a Linux module for kernel 2.6 and Linksys routers that drops invalid packets that violate mapping, and contains an option to repoison or heal.

Some virtualized environments such as KVM also provide security mechanisms to prevent MAC spoofing between guests running on the same host.

Additionally some Ethernet adapters provide MAC and VLAN anti-spoofing features.

OpenBSD watches passively for hosts impersonating the local host and notifies in case of any attempt to overwrite a permanent entry.

===OS security===
Operating systems react differently. Linux ignores unsolicited replies, but, on the other hand, uses responses to requests from other machines to update its cache. Solaris accepts updates on entries only after a timeout. In Microsoft Windows, the behavior of the ARP cache can be configured through several registry entries under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters, ArpCacheLife, ArpCacheMinReferenceLife, ArpUseEtherSNAP, ArpTRSingleRoute, ArpAlwaysSourceRoute, ArpRetryCount.

==Legitimate usage==

The techniques that are used in ARP spoofing can also be used to implement redundancy of network services. For example, some software allows a backup server to issue a gratuitous ARP request in order to take over for a defective server and transparently offer redundancy. Circle and CUJO are two companies that have commercialized products centered around this strategy.

ARP spoofing is often used by developers to debug IP traffic between two hosts when a switch is in use: if host A and host B are communicating through an Ethernet switch, their traffic would normally be invisible to a third monitoring host M. The developer configures A to have M&#x27;s MAC address for B, and B to have M&#x27;s MAC address for A; and also configures M to forward packets. M can now monitor the traffic, exactly as in a man-in-the-middle attack.

<doc id="442742" wikidata="Q22708" url="?curid=442742" title="Pterygota">
<text>Pterygota ( ) is a subclass of insects that includes all winged insects and groups who lost them secondarily.

Pterygota group comprises 99.9% of all insects. The orders not included are the Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) and the Zygentoma (silverfishes and firebrats), two primitively wingless insect orders. Unlike Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, the pterygotes do not have styli or vesicles on their abdomen (also absent in some zygentomans), and with the exception of the majority of mayflies, are also missing the median terminal filament which is present in the ancestrally wingless insects.

The oldest known representatives of the group appeared during the mid-Carboniferous, around 328–324 million years ago, and the group subsequently underwent rapid diversification. Claims that they originated substantially earlier during the Silurian or Devonian based on molecular clock estimates are unlikely based on the fossil record, and are likely analytical artefacts.

==Systematics==
Traditionally, this group was divided into the infraclasses Paleoptera and Neoptera. The former are nowadays strongly suspected of being paraphyletic, and better treatments (such as dividing or dissolving the group) are presently being discussed. In addition, it is not clear how exactly the neopterans are related among each other. The Exopterygota might be a similar assemblage of rather ancient hemimetabolous insects among the Neoptera like the Palaeoptera are among insects as a whole. The holometabolous Endopterygota seem to be very close relatives, indeed, but nonetheless appear to contain several clades of related orders, the status of which is not agreed upon.

The following scheme uses finer divisions than the one above, which is not well-suited to correctly accommodating the fossil groups.

<doc id="442744" wikidata="Q2091996" url="?curid=442744" title="National Association of Evangelicals">
<text>The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) is an American association of Evangelical Christian denominations, organizations, schools, churches, and individuals, member of the World Evangelical Alliance. The association represents more than 45,000 local churches from about 40 different Christian denominations and serves a constituency of millions. The mission of the NAE is to honor God by connecting and representing Evangelicals in the United States.

The NAE seeks to strengthen denominations and ministries by offering resources to inform and inspire Evangelical leaders, and facilitating collaboration among Evangelical leaders and groups. The NAE also represents its membership&#x27;s concerns to the U.S. Congress, the White House, and courts. The NAE Chaplains Commission endorses and supports chaplains in the U.S. military and other institutions. World Relief is the NAE&#x27;s humanitarian arm.

While the NAE headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., its staff and constituency live and work all throughout North America. The association is currently led by NAE President Walter Kim.

==History==
The National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) was formed by a group of 147 people who met in St. Louis, Missouri on April 7–9, 1942. The Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy and the related isolation of various evangelical denominations and leaders provided the impetus for developing such an organization.

Early leaders in the movement included Harold Ockenga, David Otis Fuller, Will Houghton, Harry A. Ironside, Bob Jones, Sr., Paul S. Rees, Leslie Roy Marston, John R. Rice, Charles Woodbridge, and J. Elwin Wright. Houghton called for a meeting in Chicago, Illinois in 1941. A committee was formed with Wright as chairman, and a national conference for United Action Among Evangelicals was called to meet in April 1942. Harold Ockenga was appointed the first president (1942–44).

Carl McIntire and Harvey Springer led in organizing the American Council of Christian Churches (now with 7 member bodies) in September 1941. It was a more militant and fundamentalist organization set up in opposition to the Federal Council of Churches (now National Council of Churches with 36 member bodies). McIntire invited the &quot;Evangelicals for United Action&quot; to join with them, but those who met in St. Louis declined the offer.

The organization provisionally founded in 1942 was called the &quot;National Association of Evangelicals for United Action&quot;. In 1943 the proposed constitution and doctrinal statement were amended and adopted, and the name shortened to the &quot;National Association of Evangelicals&quot;.

By the 1950s, NAE&#x27;s Washington, D.C., office gained a reputation as a service organization that could get things done. President Eisenhower welcomed an NAE delegation to the White House – a first-time honor for the association.

At the NAE&#x27;s 1983 conference in Orlando, Florida, the Rev. Arthur Evans Gay, Jr., NAE President, introduced President Ronald Reagan for what was to become known as his &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech. The 50th anniversary of the organization was celebrated in 1992 at the annual March Convention at the Chicago Hyatt Hotel. President George H. W. Bush spoke to the World Relief annual luncheon at the invitation of the organization&#x27;s president Arthur Gay, making Bush the third President to address the NAE. During the convention Billy Graham spoke for the last time at an NAE gathering, calling on evangelicals to a renewed commitment to spread the gospel.

In a move signaling its primary focus, the NAE changed its annual convention venue from hotels and convention centers to churches. In 2003, the first church-hosted convention was held at Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. President George W. Bush, running for reelection in 2004, visited the NAE convention at New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colo., via satellite link and told the delegates, &quot;You cannot endorse me, but I endorse you.&quot; In 2004, the NAE adopted &quot;For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility&quot; document as its framework for engagement in political action.

Ted Arthur Haggard (/ˈhæɡərd/; born June 27, 1956), an American evangelical pastor and founder and former pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, served as President of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006. Haggard made national headlines in November 2006 in sex and drug use scandal. Haggard resigned his post shortly after the allegations became public.

Leith Anderson served as interim president twice before he was named president in October 2007. During Anderson&#x27;s presidency, the NAE stabilized and grew with expanded membership, significant grant funding and many new staff and programs, including an annual retreat of denomination leaders, NAE Talk consultations, Evangelical Leaders Survey, Evangelicals magazine, Today&#x27;s Conversation podcast, and documents and publications including &quot;Code of Ethics for Pastors,&quot; &quot;When God and Science Meet,&quot; &quot;Theology of Sex,&quot; and &quot;For the Health of the Nation&quot; (revised), among others. As NAE president, Anderson regularly taught in seminaries, addressed evangelical concerns with elected officials, counseled denominational executives, and provided theological and cultural commentary to leading news outlets.

Walter Kim was elected NAE president at the October 2019 board meeting to begin his role in January 2020. Other leadership elections were made at that board meeting including John Jenkins, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Glenarden, to the office of chair of the NAE board; and Jo Anne Lyon, general superintendent emerita and ambassador of The Wesleyan Church, to the office of vice chair.

==Initiatives==

===National Religious Broadcasters===
In 1944, the NAE formed the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) at its convention in Columbus, Ohio. NRB was the first of many related service agencies NAE would charter with a particular purpose in mind. Following the lead of CBS and NBC, the Mutual Radio Network had announced it would no longer sell time for religious broadcasting and turned the Protestant broadcasting slot over to the Federal Council of Churches. NRB, after holding its own constitutional convention later that year, responded to the challenge, eventually persuading the networks to reverse their policies. NRB is now a separate organization.

===Evangelical Chaplains Commission===
In addition to NRB, NAE created the Chaplains Commission in 1944 to assist evangelical chaplains in the U.S. military. The NAE Chaplains Commission continues to provide support and endorsement for evangelicals to minister as military chaplains to three branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Free exercise and expression of faith in U.S. military institutions is a primary cause that the Evangelical Chaplains Commission supports. The commission also supports institutional chaplains who serve in hospitals, prisons, workplaces, and other areas of ministry.

===World Relief===
The War Relief Commission was formed in 1944 to address the needs of war-torn Europe. The War Relief Commission sent clothing and food to victims of World War II. After the war, the War Relief Commission expanded its outreach beyond war relief, and its name changed to World Relief. As the humanitarian arm of the NAE, World Relief offers assistance to victims of poverty, disease, hunger, war, disasters and persecution. The organization has offices worldwide. It is supported by churches and individual donors, as well as through United States Government grants from USAID and other agencies. World Relief&#x27;s core programs focus on microfinance, AIDS prevention and care, maternal and child health, child development, agricultural training, disaster response, refugee resettlement and immigrant services.

===Missio Nexus===
In 1945, NAE created the Evangelical Foreign Missions Association (later called the Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, then The Mission Exchange, and now Missio Nexus). It was chartered to handle the special needs of missionaries and their agencies and is the largest missionary association in the world. Missio Nexus now operates independently of the NAE, though it is a member of the NAE.

===New International Version===
An NAE initiative in the 1950s with long-range consequences was the formation of a committee in 1957 to explore the possibility of a new translation of the Bible. The National Council had five years earlier released the Revised Standard Version, but the new translation did not prove popular among many evangelicals. The NAE committee began meeting with a similar committee commissioned by the Christian Reformed Church in 1961. By 1965, the two committees formed the independent Committee on Bible Translation and two years later, the New York Bible Society (today the International Bible Society) became the official sponsor. In 1978, the first copies of the New International Version of the Bible came off the presses.

===For the Health of the Nation===
The Evangelical Project for Public Engagement was initiated at the 60th annual convention of the NAE in March 2001. The project team worked to articulate a framework for evangelical civic and political engagement for the 21st century under the direction of Richard Cizik, then-vice president of governmental affairs. The project generated a major volume edited by Diane Knippers and Ronald Sider and published by Baker Books titled &quot;Toward an Evangelical Public Policy.&quot;

&quot;For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility&quot; calls evangelicals to address seven spheres of social involvement from a biblical framework and also provides specific principles of engagement. The NAE&#x27;s political action is based on the document, which outlines eight different issues that are important to evangelicals, including religious freedom, family life and protection of children, sanctity of life, caring for the poor and vulnerable, human rights, racial justice and reconciliation, peacemaking, and caring for creation.

While the underlying principles of the document have not changed, the NAE Board of Directors updated and adopted the revised version in 2018. New attention has been called to long-time social ills, including the broken immigration system, sexual harassment and abuse, human trafficking, racial injustice and white supremacy. Concern about these issues was implicit in the original document and is further elaborated in the updated edition, notably through the addition of a section on racial justice and reconciliation.

<text>Neoptera (Ancient Greek &quot;néos&quot; (&quot;new&quot;) + &quot;pterón&quot; (&quot;wing&quot;)) is a classification group that includes most orders of the winged insects, specifically those that can flex their wings over their abdomens. This is in contrast with the more basal orders of winged insects (the &quot;Palaeoptera&quot; assemblage), which are unable to flex their wings in this way.

==Classification==

The taxon Neoptera was proposed by А.М. Martynov in 1923 and 1924, in the following classification:
Pterygota
*division Palaeoptera
**order Odonata
**order Agnatha (correct name: Ephemeroptera)
**†order Dictyoneuridea
**†order Megasecoptera
**†order Meganisoptera
**†order Protephemeroidea
*division Neoptera
**superorder Endopterygota
***order Coleoptera
***order Strepsiptera
***order Neuroptera
***order Raphidioptera
***order Megaloptera
***order Diptera
***order Mecoptera
***order Trichoptera
***order Lepidoptera
***order Hymenoptera
**subdivision Polyneoptera
***superorder Orthopteroidea (Anartioptera)
****order Orthoptera
****order Plecoptera
****order Dermaptera
****order Embioptera
****order Phasmatodea
***superorder Blattopteroidea (senior name: Pandictyoptera)
****order Blattodea
****order Mantodea
***subdivision Paraneoptera
****order Hemiptera 
*****suborder Auchenorrhyncha
*****suborder Coleorrhyncha
*****suborder Heteroptera
*****suborder Sternorrhyncha
****subdivision Oligoneoptera
The order Thysanoptera originally had uncertain systematic position, and later was attributed to Paraneoptera.
Other classifications were proposed, subordinating Neoptera either directly to Pterygota (as in Martynov&#x27;s classification), or to Metapterygota:

* Pterygota Gegenbaur 1878 
** Ephemeroptera Hyatt &amp; Arms 1890 
** Metapterygota Börner 1909 
*** Odonata Fabricius 1793 
*** Neoptera Martynov 1923

==Phylogeny==

The phylogeny of Neoptera is shown in the cladogram, using the molecular phylogeny of Wipfler et al. 2019 for the Polyneoptera, Johnson et al 2018 for the Paraneoptera (where Psocomorpha contains Phthiraptera), and Kjer et al 2016 for the Holometabola.

<text>Washing and anointing is a Latter-day Saint practice of ritual purification. It is a key part of the temple endowment ceremony as well as the controversial Second Anointing ceremony practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Mormon fundamentalists. It was also part of the female-only healing rituals among Latter-day Saints until at least the 1940s. 

In preparation for the temple endowment, a person, generally over the age of 18, is sprinkled with water, then anointed with perfume or oil as a cleansing before God. Once washed and anointed, the participant is dressed in the temple garment, a symbolic white undergarment. The ordinance performed by the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood, and by an officiator of the same sex as the participant, is &quot;mostly symbolic in nature, but promis[es] definite, immediate blessings as well as future blessings,&quot; contingent upon continued righteous living. These ordinances of washing and anointing are referred to often in the temple as &quot;initiatory ordinances&quot; since they precede the endowment and sealing ordinances. 

Like other temple ordinances, washings and anointings are also conducted on behalf of deceased individuals as a type of &quot; ordinance&quot;.

The LDS Church states the origins of these rituals can be traced back to the biblical period, where anointings were used to sanctify individuals and objects, while washings were used for ritual purification. The LDS Church introduced washings and anointings in the Kirtland Temple in 1836, before revising the rituals in Nauvoo, Illinois in 1842. The modern LDS Church only performs these rites in temples set apart and dedicated for sacred purposes according to a January 19, 1841 revelation that Joseph Smith stated was from Jesus Christ.

Washing and anointing also plays a key role in the Second Anointing ritual practiced by the LDS Church, in which participants are anointed as a &quot;priest and king&quot; or a &quot;priestess and queen&quot;, and are sealed to the highest degree of salvation in LDS theology. This is the most secretive ritual practiced by Latter-day Saints, and most church members are unaware of its existence.

==History==

=== Old Testament period ===

Ritual anointings were a prominent part of religious rites in the biblical world. Recipients of the anointing included temple officiants (e.g., Aaron), prophets (e.g., Elisha), and kings (e.g., Jehu, Solomon). In addition, sacral objects associated with the Israelite sanctuary were anointed. Of equal importance in the religion of the Israelites were ablutions (ceremonial washings). To ensure religious purity, Mosaic law required that designated individuals receive a ritual washing, sometimes in preparation for entering the temple.

=== New Testament period ===

In the New Testament Jesus washes his disciples&#x27; feet prior to his crucifixion. Joseph Smith published his own version of these New Testament passages, adding new materials which said, &quot;Now this was the custom of the Jews under their law; wherefore, Jesus did this that the law might be fulfilled.&quot;

Cleansing rituals such as &quot;tevilah&quot; and &quot;netilat yadayim&quot; have existed in Judaism for millennia. However, rabbinical scholars argue that these rituals served the purpose of removing impurity after activities that would make one &quot;impure&quot; such having contact with a corpse, or bodily discharge of a sick person.

Smith&#x27;s claim that the foot-washing was part of Jewish &quot;law&quot; is not supported by historical sources.

=== Kirtland period ===
As the Latter Day Saints were completing their first temple in Kirtland, Ohio, founder Joseph Smith led many of the prominent male church members in a pre-endowment ritual patterned after similar washings and anointings described in the Bible. This ritual took place over several days, beginning on 21 January 1836 in the attic of a printing office. 

These ritual meetings were opened by Joseph Smith praying, speaking, and even singing in tongues. Each participant washed their own hands, faces, and feet with water. After this, Joseph &quot;girded himself with a towel&quot; and personally washed the feet of each participant, wiping them with the towel. When he reached his father Joseph Smith Sr., he asked his father for a blessing before he would wash his father&#x27;s feet. Smith Sr. placed his hands upon Joseph&#x27;s head, &quot;pronouncing upon his head that he should continue in his Priests office untill Christ come.&quot; 

Soon after the temple&#x27;s dedication on 27 March 1836, about 300 Latter Day Saint men participated in a further ritual washing of feet and faces.

=== Nauvoo period ===
Several years later, after Latter Day Saints moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, Smith revised the washing and anointing rituals as part of the new Nauvoo endowment. On 4–5 May 1842, nine prominent male church members were inducted into this endowment ceremony in the upper story of Smith&#x27;s store. The first woman (Smith&#x27;s first wife, Emma) was inducted into the endowment ceremony on 28 September 1843.

As the washings and anointings were practiced in Nauvoo, men and women were taken to separate rooms, where they disrobed and, when called upon, passed through a canvas curtain to enter a tub where they were washed from head to foot while words of blessing were recited. Then oil from a horn was poured over the head of the participant, usually by another officiator, while similar words were repeated. As part of the ceremony, participants were ordained to become kings and queens in eternity. Men performed the ritual for men, and women performed the ritual for women. Also, as part of the ceremony, participants were given a new name and a ritual undergarment in which symbolic marks were snipped into the fabric.

=== Early-Utah period ===
After the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, women continued to administer washings and anointings in their homes as well as in temples. The in-home rituals were part of a practice of administering to the sick. These washings and anointings were encouraged by church leaders of the time including Brigham Young. In one instance Ezra T. Benson called on women who were ordained to wash and anoint to get rid of a disease affecting the Cache Valley. This practice of washing and anointing in the home was curtailed in the 1880s and by the April 1921 general conference, the consensus was that blessings performed by Melchizedek Priesthood holders should be sought whenever possible. In 1946, Joseph Fielding Smith sent a letter to Belle S. Spafford saying these washings and anointings were discouraged.

==Use in LDS female healing rituals==
Historically, Latter-day Saint women performed special washings and anointings to heal the sick and afflicted. Joseph Smith officially sanctioned female healing in 1842. This practice continued in the LDS Church until at least the 1940s. A sick person was washed, anointed with oil, and given a priesthood blessing by the &quot;laying on of hands&quot;.

One of the first recorded female healings took place at the Relief Society meeting on April 19, 1842. Sarah Cleveland and Elizabeth Ann Whitney, who were counselors in the Relief Society Presidency, administered to Abigale Leonard &quot;for the restoration of health.&quot; Minute notes also indicate that Sister Martha Sessions may have laid her hands on Eliza R. Snow to give her a blessing during this meeting.

In the following Relief Society meeting, on April 28th, 1842, Joseph Smith said that anyone who has faith can give priesthood blessings to heal the sick. Smith said that God had sanctioned female healing by the laying on of hands and that anyone who disagreed should &quot;hold their tongues.&quot;

Brigham Young and Ezra T. Benson encouraged women to perform these healing rituals at home. However, by the April 1921 general conference the consensus was that healings should only be performed by Melchizedek Priesthood holders (who are exclusively male). 

In 1946, Joseph Fielding Smith sent a letter to Belle S. Spafford, the General Relief Society President at the time, discouraging the practice of female healing, indicating that it was likely still happening at this time. 

==Administration==
In response to a commandment to gather the saints and to build a house &quot;to prepare them for the ordinances and endowments, washings, and anointings&quot;, these ordinances were introduced in the Kirtland Temple on January 21, 1836. These modern rites are now only performed for LDS Church members in temples set apart and dedicated for sacred purposes, according to a January 19, 1841 revelation that Joseph Smith stated was from Jesus Christ.

== Symbolic interpretations ==

Many symbolic meanings of washings and anointings are traceable in the scriptures. Ritual washings (Heb. 9:10) symbolize the cleansing of the soul from sins and iniquities. They signify the washing-away of the pollutions of the Lord&#x27;s people (Isa. 4:4). Psalm 51:2 expresses the human longing and divine promise: &quot;Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin&quot;. The anointing of a person or object with sacred ointment represents sanctification and consecration, so that both become &quot;most holy&quot; unto the Lord. In this manner, profane persons and things are sanctified in similitude of the &quot;messiah&quot; (Hebrew &quot;anointed one&quot;), who is &quot;Christ&quot; (Greek &quot;anointed one&quot;).

<text>The American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC) is a fundamentalist organization set up in opposition to the Federal Council of Churches (now National Council of Churches).

The council&#x27;s motto is Jude 3, &quot;Earnestly contending for the Faith&quot;.

==History==
ACCC was founded in 1941 under the leadership of Carl McIntire.

Membership in the American Council of Christian Churches is available to denominations and individual Christians, who are admitted by a 3/4 majority vote. Agreement with the purposes and doctrinal statement are required and membership is specifically denied to those who have affiliations with 
The ACCC has remained small in comparison to the National Association of Evangelicals and the National Council of Churches. This is due in part to its strong separatist stance, and in part because separatist denominations will often not participate in &quot;cross-denominational&quot; organizations.

Dan Greenfield currently serves as Executive Secretary. Offices are in Orwell, Ohio.

In July 2007, the leadership of the ACCC issued a statement criticizing a recent declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the meaning of the phrase &quot;subsistit in&quot; which re-emphasized the role of the Catholic Church as the subsisting Church of Christ.

StuffIt has been a target of criticism and dissatisfaction from Mac users in the past as the file format changes frequently, notably during the introduction of StuffIt version 5.0. Expander 5.0 contained many bugs, and its file format was not readable by the earlier version 4.5, leaving Mac users of the time without a viable compression utility.

The latest stand-alone version for Windows is 2011 (15.0). Unlike the version before it (12.0), which was only able to decompress the newer (and ZIP) archives, version 2009 claims to be able to decompress over 30 formats, some listed below. The executables require both, the .NET v2.0 framework and MSVC 2008 (9.0) runtimes. The previous stand-alone version able to decompress and other classic Mac OS-specific archives was 7.02, distributed with StuffIt v7.0.x for Windows.

From versions 7.5.x to 11 the Expander capabilities were actually performed by the StuffIt Standard Edition, that allowed decompression even after the end of the trial period. To start StuffIt in Expander mode the following command line switches were used: . Note that the registration reminder dialogue box is not shown in this case. With older versions of StuffIt Expander on the classic Mac OS platform, such as StuffIt Expander 3.5, it was possible to enhance the capabilities of StuffIt Expander and to add support for decompressing additional archive formats by means of the shareware DropStuff with Expander Enhancer software from Aladdin Systems.

There is also a command line DOS application called UNSTUFF v1.1 that allows decompression of files.

StuffIt Expander 2009 decompresses files in the following formats:

<doc id="442756" wikidata="Q981493" url="?curid=442756" title="Matthew Hayden">
<text>Matthew Lawrence Hayden (born 29 October 1971) is an Australian cricket commentator and former cricketer. His career spanned fifteen years. Hayden was a powerful and aggressive left-handed opening batsman who, along with opening partners Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist, contributed heavily to Australia&#x27;s success during its &quot;golden era&quot; (2000–2008) in Test and ODI (One Day International) cricket respectively. He holds the record of highest individual score by an Australian batsman in Tests, having scored 380 against Zimbabwe during Zimbabwe&#x27;s 2003 tour of Australia. This stands as the second-highest individual score in test cricket (behind Brian Lara‘s 400*). It is the highest score by an opening batsman in Tests, though infamously he never faced the opening ball in Tests with Langer, always batting at No2. Hayden was a member of the Australian team that won both the 2003 Cricket World Cup, and the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

Domestically, Hayden played for the state he was born in, Queensland, and also played for the state&#x27;s Twenty20 (T20) competition team, the Brisbane Heat. Hayden retired from all forms of cricket in September 2012. In 2017, Hayden was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. In September 2021, Hayden was appointed as the Batting Coach of Pakistan for the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup.

==Personal life and beyond cricket==
Hayden competed in the Gladiator Team Sports Challenge in 1995, Hayden&#x27;s boat capsized near North Stradbroke Island; he and his two companions (one of whom was Queensland and Australian teammate Andrew Symonds and the other was Trent Butler) were forced to swim a kilometre to safety. Hayden subsequently appeared in a campaign promoting marine safety. In his spare time, Hayden is a keen cook and occasionally prepared meals for his teammates while on tour. A collection of his recipes was published in Australia in 2004 as &quot;The Matthew Hayden Cookbook&quot;. A second book, &quot;The Matthew Hayden Cookbook 2&quot;, was published in 2006. Prior to using a Mongoose, Hayden used a Gray-Nicolls bat with a fluorescent pink grip, to highlight and support research into a cure for breast cancer. This is at least in part inspired by his teammate Glenn McGrath&#x27;s wife, who died due to breast cancer. He is married to Kellie and has three children

Hayden is a devout Roman Catholic and said, &quot;&quot;When I’m in trouble, I ask: ‘What would Christ do?&quot;&#x27;&quot; He also routinely crossed himself on the field after reaching a century. When asked about faith in modern society, Hayden said, &quot;I think it’s very challenging to live as a Christian, or any sort of religion, in terms of modern day society. I think it’s very difficult as a young adult, and I think I really struggled with that over a long period of time&quot;. Hayden was awarded the Australian Sports Medal on 14 July 2000. In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Matthew Hayden was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;. On 26 January 2010 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to cricket, and to the community through support for a range of health, youth and charitable organisations. Hayden is an Ambassador for the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation.

==Domestic career==
===First-class career===
Hayden played Sheffield Shield cricket for Queensland, playing 101 matches, and scoring 8831 runs at an average of 54.85. He also played in the English County Championship, first with Hampshire in 1997 and prominently as captain of Northamptonshire in 1999–2000; his County record is 3461 runs at 55.82. Hayden&#x27;s first-class career yielded 24,603 runs at an average of 52.57.

===Twenty20 (T20) career===

Matthew Hayden played for the Chennai Super Kings in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) in April 2008, contracted for $375,000. Hayden became one of the foremost players in the league, and in 2009 won the Orange Cap as the season&#x27;s highest run-scorer, with 572 runs.

In 2011–12, Hayden resigned from his positions on the Queensland and Australian cricket boards to take part for the Brisbane Heat in Australia&#x27;s Big Bash League.

On 11 March 2010, Hayden announced his intention to use the Mongoose Cricket Bat, a bat specially tailored to the needs of Twenty20 cricket, during the 2010 IPL. Reactions to the bat were mixed. Stuart Law said that he would think &#x27;twice&#x27; before using the Mongoose, while MS Dhoni said in his column that he believed in Hayden&#x27;s ability &#x27;no matter what means he uses&#x27;. After a quiet start to the third edition of the IPL, Hayden scored 93 off 43 deliveries to kickstart his campaign.

==International career==
=== Test career ===
Hayden and Michael Slater were both picked for the 1993 tour of England, but Slater performed better in the tour games, and secured the opening position alongside vice-captain Mark Taylor for the next few years. Hayden played a single test in the 4–8 March 1994 Test Match against South Africa in Johannesburg, scoring 15 and 5, filling in for an injured Taylor.

His next Test selection was in the 1996–97 season, with three tests each against the West Indies and South Africa. He made his maiden century (125 against the West Indies in Adelaide), but averaged only 24.1 over the six tests, including four ducks. He was dropped from the team, as the selectors favoured other openers, initially Taylor and Matthew Elliott, then later Slater and Greg Blewett, for the next few years. At the time, he was compared occasionally to Graeme Hick, a fine domestic performer but not quite good enough to make it at the highest level.

During these years, Hayden was a prolific batsman for the Queensland first-class cricket team. Weight of domestic cricket runs, and persistence, resulted in a resurrection of his international career for the 1999–2000 tour of New Zealand and the following 2000–01 summer against the West Indies. His results in those series were unconvincing, but he was still picked for the 2001 tour of India.

On that tour of India, Hayden scored 549 runs, an Australian record for a three-Test series, at an average of 109.80. Before the 2001 India tour, Hayden averaged 24.36 from 13 Tests, with one century. After that, he was an automatic selection for the Test side. He scored over 1,000 Test runs in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, the first man to achieve the feat five times. He was selected as one of Wisden&#x27;s five 2003 Cricketers of the Year.

In the first innings of the First Test against Zimbabwe on 10 October 2003 at the WACA, Hayden scored 380 runs from only 437 balls to set a new world record for an individual Test innings, passing the previous record of Brian Lara (375), set in April 1994. Hayden&#x27;s total remained the record until 12 April 2004, when Lara scored 400 not out. As of June 2024, it remains the second-highest innings in Test history, and is the highest ever by an Australian. For his performances in 2004, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

Hayden suffered a considerable form-slump towards the end of 2004, and went for sixteen consecutive tests without scoring a century. This continued into the highly anticipated 2005 Ashes, where Hayden failed to reach 40 in any of the first four tests, which put pressure on his position in the team; a hard-fought 138 from 303 balls in the Fifth Test at The Oval arguably saved his career. This signalled a return to form for Hayden for the 2005/06 season, and he scored centuries in four consecutive Tests, including the Oval Test, then home Tests against the ICC World XI and West Indies.

Hayden&#x27;s form in the 2006-07 Ashes series against England was average; he failed to reach 40 in the first three innings of the series, but again returned to form with scores of 92 in Perth, and 153 in the Boxing Day Test. For his performances in 2006, he was again named in the World Test XI by ICC.

Hayden scored 30 centuries in his 103 tests. As of January 2025, this makes him one of only four Australians to have scored more test centuries than Don Bradman (29 centuries in 52 tests), the other three being Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh and Steve Smith. He also scored 29 half-centuries in Tests.

In 2007–2008, Hayden became the third Australian, after Donald Bradman (four centuries in five Tests in 1947–48) and David Boon (three tons in five Tests in 1991–92) to register three or more hundreds in a Test series against India. For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

Hayden has recorded three or more centuries in successive Tests three times: 2001–02 season, he registered four centuries in successive Tests against South Africa, at Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Johannesburg; during 2005–06 with centuries against England at The Oval in 2005, against a World XI at Sydney, and against the West Indies at Brisbane and Hobart in 2005–06; and in 2007–2008 he scored three centuries in successive Tests against India.

The 2008–09 season was Hayden&#x27;s final season of Test cricket. In nine Tests against India, New Zealand and South Africa, Hayden managed only 383 runs at 23.94, with two half-centuries and three ducks. His career ended when he was dropped from the ODI Australian team. Soon after Hayden announced his retirement from all international and first-class cricket prior to the tour of South Africa in 2008–09. His place was filled by young New South Wales opener Phillip Hughes. He finished his test career with 8625 runs at an average of 50.73.

Hayden&#x27;s most notable opening batting partner was Justin Langer. The opening pair represented Australia in more than 100 Test innings. The pair made 5654 runs while batting together in opening partnerships, with an average of 51.88 runs per partnership; as of January 2019, only Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes of the West Indies have scored more Test runs as an opening partnership, with 6,482 at an average of 47.31.

Hayden was a regular and successful slip fielder for Australia, and he took 128 catches during his Test career.

===ODI career===
Hayden played as an opening batsman in the Australian team in 160 One Day Internationals throughout his career. He made his ODI debut for Australia in 1993 against England, but after playing 13 ODIs in 1993 and 1994, he was dropped from the team until 2000.

Hayden played in the Australian side that won the 2003 One Day International Cricket World Cup. He was dropped from the ODI squad because of poor form after The Ashes in 2005, but returned to the Australian squad in the 2006–07 Australian season after Simon Katich fell out of favour and Shane Watson was injured.

On 20 February 2007, Matthew Hayden posted his highest ODI score (181 not out) against New Zealand at Seddon Park in Hamilton. It was at the time the highest ODI score ever by an Australian and gave Hayden the unique distinction of holding both the Test and ODI record scores for an Australian batsman until the ODI record was broken by Shane Watson who scored 185* in 2011. His knock of 181* is the second highest ODI innings in a losing cause in ODI history just after Charles Coventry&#x27;s 194*.

He dominated the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies the tournament&#x27;s best batsman, scoring three centuries before the completion of the Super 8s section of the tournament; he was only the third person to achieve this feat (the previous being Mark Waugh and Sourav Ganguly). The century against South Africa came off just 66 balls and broke John Davison&#x27;s record for the fastest century in a World Cup. The Prime Minister of St Kitts and Nevis awarded Hayden with honorary citizenship after the match. His record was broken by Irish batsman Kevin O&#x27;Brien in the 2011 World Cup when he struck a century off 50 balls against England. Hayden also became only the second player in World Cup history to surpass 600 runs in a single tournament; he scored 659 runs for the tournament at an average of 73.22. In September 2007, Hayden was named ODI Player of the Year after his dominating performance throughout the World Cup. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo. For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC and ESPNcricinfo.

Hayden played only one more season of ODI cricket, his last match for Australia being the second final of the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series.

===Twenty20 Internationals===
Hayden played nine Twenty20 Internationals for Australia, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. He was the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, with 265 runs. He scored 308 runs in T20Is with the average of 51.33 when retiring. He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup.

For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World T20I XI by ESPNcricinfo.

==Controversies==
In the 2003 New Year&#x27;s Test in Sydney against England, Hayden smashed a pavilion window in anger, after disagreeing with an umpire&#x27;s decision to give him out. He was fined for this incident.

He was a party to the controversy that emerged from the Second Test, 2007-08 Border-Gavaskar Trophy racism charges pressed by Australia against India, and was one of the witnesses for Andrew Symonds&#x27;s charges against Harbhajan Singh. As a fallout of that instance in February 2008, Hayden was charged for a code of conduct violation by Cricket Australia, for calling the Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh an &quot;obnoxious little weed&quot;, and for inviting Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma for a boxing bout, during an interview aired on Brisbane radio station. He was reprimanded for his comment by Cricket Australia,
but maintained his innocence.

He was strongly criticised by the BCCI and former Pakistan team captain Wasim Akram for reportedly calling India a third world country. Back home after a 2–0 series defeat by India, Hayden spoke about what he perceived to be poor ground conditions and inordinate delays during the matches &quot;that happen in Third World countries&quot;. However, Hayden defended his remarks.

==International retirement==
On 13 January 2009, Hayden held a press conference at the Gabba and officially announced his retirement from representative cricket. The announcement followed a series of relatively poor performances in New Zealand and South Africa&#x27;s tour of Australia, in which he failed to pass fifteen runs in nine innings. Paying tribute on his retirement, Hayden was hailed by teammates Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer as being the greatest ever opener from Australia. Hayden was recognised as statistically the best opener ever produced by the country.

Hayden was appointed by the Queensland Government in March 2013 to head a tourism campaign aiming to attract more Indian tourists to Australia.

==Career best performances==
==International centuries==
With 30 Tests and 10 ODI centuries, Hayden is considered one of the best Australian openers of his era. He also scored 29 Test, 36 ODI and three T20I half-centuries.

==Post retirement==
Hayden has also been working with Cricket Australia in raising the profile of cricket among the indigenous population of Australia. In 2010, he captained the Indigenous All-stars XI against the ACA Masters XI as part of the Imparja Cup held in Alice Springs, Northern Territory. Hayden is also an Ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation.

He was inducted into Australian Cricket Hall of Fame at the 2016/17 Allan Border Medal ceremony in Sydney. On September 13, 2021, he was announced as a head coach of Pakistan for 2021 T20 World Cup. This was his first major coaching assignment. In September 2022, he was appointed as the Pakistan team&#x27;s mentor for 2022 T20 World Cup.

<text>Joseph Nicolas Nicollet (July 24, 1786 – September 11, 1843), also known as Jean-Nicolas Nicollet, was a French geographer, astronomer, and mathematician known for mapping the Upper Mississippi River basin during the 1830s. Nicollet led three expeditions in the region between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, primarily in Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota.

Before emigrating to the United States, Nicollet was a professor of mathematics at Collège Louis-le-Grand, and a professor and astronomer at the Paris Observatory with Pierre-Simon Laplace. Political and academic changes in France led Nicollet to travel to the United States to do work that would bolster his reputation among academics in Europe. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1842.

Nicollet&#x27;s maps were among the most accurate of the time, correcting errors made by Zebulon Pike, and they provided the basis for all subsequent maps of the American interior. They were also among the first to depict elevation by hachuring and the only maps to use regional Native American placenames. Nicollet&#x27;s &quot;Map of the Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi&quot; was published in 1843, following his death. Nicollet Tower, located in Sisseton, South Dakota is a monument to Nicollet and his work and was constructed in 1991.

==Early life and education==

Nicollet was born at Cluses in Savoy. He was very bright, showing aptitude in mathematics and astronomy that earned him a scholarship to the Jesuit college in Chambéry. He began teaching mathematics at age 19. In 1817, he was appointed as a professor and astronomer at the Paris Observatory and worked with scientist and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace. While working at the observatory, Nicollet discovered a comet and built a reputation as an expert in astronomy and physical geography. During the 1820s, he worked as a mathematics professor at the Collège Louis-le-Grand.

==Emigration, 1832==
Nicollet encountered financial and professional difficulties resulting from political turbulence in France following the July Revolution (1830) and the rising dominance of physics as a laboratory science. Penniless, he emigrated to the United States in 1832, sailing from the port of Brest. Nicollet hoped to boost his reputation among European academics through his work in the US. He intended to make a &quot;scientific tour&quot; of the country and had a goal of using his expertise to accurately map the Mississippi River Valley. He arrived in Washington, D.C., where he met with scientists and government officials, discussing scientific surveys of the country. He traveled to New Orleans, from where he intended to proceed to St. Louis, Missouri, but due to a cholera outbreak, travel by steamboat was practically halted. Instead he spent the next three years traveling throughout the south, primarily between New Orleans and Baltimore. Nicollet finally arrived in St. Louis in 1835.

==Mapping the Mississippi==
Upon his arrival 1835 in St. Louis, Nicollet gained support for his plan to map the Mississippi River from the American Fur Company and the wealthy Choteau family (who had helped found St. Louis and long had a fur trading monopoly with the Osage tribe based on contracts with former Spanish authorities and later status as U.S. Indian agent). From St. Louis, he took a boat up the river to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. Over the next 4 years Nicollet led three expeditions exploring the Upper Mississippi, mostly in the area that is now Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.

===First expedition, 1836–37===

The first expedition took place in 1836–37 and was privately funded by American Fur and the Choteaus. Nicollet departed Fort Snelling by canoe on July 29, 1836, accompanied by Chagobay, an Ojibwe chief, his nine-year-old son, and a half-French guide named Brunia. Nicollet explored the Mississippi to its source of Lake Itasca and the nearby Mississippi tributary, the St. Croix River. The results of this expedition corrected an error in Zebulon Pike&#x27;s 1805 map, which placed the mouth of the Crow Wing River too far to the west, rendering all maps of this area inaccurate.

===Second expedition, 1838===
Upon his return to Washington, D.C. to report his findings, Nicollet was appointed to head the newly formed Corps of Topographical Engineers and lead a War Department-funded expedition to map the area between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in order to correct the western maps affected by Pike&#x27;s mistake. The expedition party set out on June 18, 1838, from Traverse des Sioux. The party was composed of John C. Frémont, who was appointed by the War Department to assist on the expedition in lieu of a military escort, Joseph Renville Jr., and Joseph LaFromboise, an agent for the American Fur Company who was half French, half Native American. On July 4, 1838, the expedition arrived at Pipestone Quarry, where the party members carved their initials on a rock. From there, the party proceeded along the Minnesota and Blue Earth Rivers toward Spirit Lake, Iowa.

===Third expedition===
In his third and final expedition, guided by Louison Freniere, Nicollet retained the assistance from Frémont and was joined for part of his journey by the Jesuit Missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet. De Smet used skills learned from Nicollet to make his own maps of the Missouri River basin. On this and on his second expedition, botanist Charles Geyer took extensive notes cataloging the area&#x27;s native plants. This journey was also government funded and took Nicollet northwest from Iowa along the Missouri River toward Fort Pierre, South Dakota. His efforts were hampered as the Steamboat &quot;Pirate&quot; carrying his supplies sank in April 1839. On July 11, 1839, the second leg of his trip set out from Fort Pierre for Devil&#x27;s Lake, North Dakota. From there, Nicollet travelled back across the Coteau des Prairies to Fort Snelling.

===Death===
On September 11, 1839, Nicollet returned to Washington, D.C. where he worked on consolidating the information collected into the Report to the Senate. He fully intended to return to Minnesota to continue his work, but failing health led to his death in Washington in 1843. He is buried at the Congressional Cemetery, his gravestone noting &quot;He will triumph who understands how to conciliate and combine with the greatest skill the benefits of the past with the demands of the future.&quot;

==Legacy==

Later in 1843, a book containing much of his work, &quot;Map of the Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi&quot;, was published. The maps in the book were highly accurate and covered a region more than half the size of Europe. Morever, Nicollet&#x27;s maps were among the first in the world to depict elevation by hachuring and are among the only sources for original Native American place names in the region. Many of Nicollet&#x27;s sketches and journals from his expeditions are housed at the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Archives. In 1847, one of his expeditions&#x27; private sponsors, Pierre Chouteau Jr., established Fort Benton as the furthest fur-trading post on the Upper Missouri River, in what became known as Chouteau County, Montana in his honor.

Nicollet&#x27;s own name is applied to several places in the region he explored, including Nicollet Island, Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, Nicollet County and the city of Nicollet, all located in Minnesota.

In 1991, the Joseph N. Nicollet Tower and Interpretive Center was constructed in Sisseton, South Dakota near the path Nicollet had taken from Devil&#x27;s Lake back to Fort Snelling on his final expedition. A banker and Sisseton resident became fascinated with Nicollet&#x27;s story and work after reading &quot;Joseph N. Nicollet on the Plains and Prairies&quot;, a translation of Nicollet&#x27;s journals, and raised $335,000 from seven local donors to build the monument. The 80-foot tall tower with 96 steps was primarily built of Douglas-fir from Idaho with concrete pillars and steel bolts. From the top, six counties in three states (South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota) can be seen, including a view of the Laurentian Divide, the Coteau des Prairies, and the ancient glacial valley that Nicollet mapped. The Interpretive Center houses 2,400 square feet of classroom space and exhibits, including Nicollet&#x27;s map and a mural of Nicollet&#x27;s meeting with Wanata, chief of the Yankton Dakota.

<doc id="442760" wikidata="Q1486964" url="?curid=442760" title="Rondel dagger">
<text>A rondel dagger or roundel dagger is a type of stiff-bladed dagger used in Europe in the late Middle Ages (from the 14th century onwards), used by a variety of people from merchants to knights. It was worn at the waist and could be used as a utility tool, or worn into battle or in a jousting tournament as a side arm.

==Design and construction==

The blade is made of steel, and is typically long and slim with a tapering needle point, measuring or more; the whole dagger can be as long as . &quot;Rondel&quot; means &#x27;round&#x27; or &#x27;circular&#x27;; the dagger gets its name from its round (or similarly shaped, e.g. octagonal) hand guard and round or spherical pommel (knob on the end of the grip).

The blade&#x27;s tang extends through the handle, which is cylindrical, normally carved from wood or bone. In cross section, the blade is usually diamond-shaped, lenticular, or triangular. These blades have a sharpened point, and either one or both edges are also sharpened, while some had no sharpened edges at all. They were principally designed for use with a stabbing action, either underarm, or over arm with a reverse grip (reminiscent of an ice pick). The long straight blade does not lend itself to a slashing or sabre action. 

Rondel daggers were designed to be ideal for close-quarter combat which often requires grappling. They were used for puncturing and bursting the links in mail armour and they could penetrate the weaker points in plate armour and helmets, such as areas of thinner plate, any gaps and the various joints. The wide, spherical pommel might have assisted by making it easier for the user to push or punch the point of the dagger home. As armour improved, puncturing in such ways was one of the only ways in which the heavy armour of men-at-arms could be breached.

Examples also exist of four-edged rondel daggers, the blade having a cruciform profile. These blades are not suited for cutting, or use as a general utility tool; they were worn as a side-arm in battle as a thrusting weapon, foreshadowing the appearance of the stiletto in the 16th century. Rondel daggers which have survived and found their way into museums and collections are usually those with fine craftsmanship and often ornate decoration. The blades may be engraved, the grips ornately carved, and the hand guards and pommels highly decorated.

==Use==
The rondel dagger evolved in the 14th century from the early knightly dagger of the 12th to 13th centuries, matching the evolution of full plate armour.
By the 15th century it had become the standard side-arm for knights, and was carried into battle, such as the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The contemporary post-mortem on the remains of King Richard III showed that at the Battle of Bosworth, in 1485, he suffered a sharp blow from a pointed weapon such as a rondel dagger on the crown of the head, before other fatal wounds were administered. They were a knight&#x27;s backup weapon to be used in hand-to-hand fighting, and as such one of their last lines of defense. Since they were able to penetrate a suit of armour (at the joints, or through the visor of the helmet), rondel daggers could be used to force an unseated or wounded knight to surrender and be kept for ransom.

In the 15th century, the rondel dagger also rose to popularity among the emerging middle class. In a scene from a miniature by Girart de Roussillon, depicting the construction of twelve churches in France (c. 1448), merchants and tradesmen can be seen wearing rondel daggers at their waists.

Hans Talhoffer, in his combat manuals of the 1440s to 1460s, includes numerous examples of techniques for fighting with the rondel dagger, both in unarmoured combat and in single combat in armour.

<text>Edwin Leonard Waller (November 4, 1800 – January 3, 1881) was an American businessman, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, the first mayor of Austin, Texas, and the designer of its downtown grid plan.

==Texas independence==
He was born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, United States, in 1800 to a family settled in the state since colonial times when they emigrated from Buckinghamshire, England. His family later settled in Missouri.

In April 1831, he immigrated to the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. On July 20, he received a land grant from the government in present-day Brazoria County. He began a shipping business, transporting cotton from Velasco, Texas, to New Orleans, Louisiana, using his ship, the &quot;Sabine&quot;, and was once briefly arrested in Velasco for refusing to pay Mexican customs duty.

He very quickly became active in the movement for Texas independence from Mexico. On June 26, 1832, he fought and was wounded at the Battle of Velasco, an early skirmish in the Texas Revolution. In 1833, he became the alcalde of Brazoria Municipality. In 1835, he represented the Columbia Municipality at the Consultation in San Felipe de Austin, where he was chosen by the members to serve in the General Council of the Provisional Government of Texas.

On February 1, 1836, he was elected as the Brazoria delegate to the Convention of 1836 in Washington-on-the-Brazos, where he signed the newly adopted Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2. At the convention, he served on the committee that helped draft the Constitution of the Republic of Texas.

==1839 Austin city plan==

In 1839, he was chosen by Texas President Mirabeau Lamar to survey the site, sell lots, and erect public buildings for the new state capital in Austin. The original land site for the capital was narrowed to 640 acres (2.6 km2) that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin&#x27;s first city plan, commonly known as the Waller Plan, dividing the site into a fourteen-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th streets. On August 1, the first auction of 306 lots was held. The grid plan that Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of the streets of downtown Austin.

==Other pursuits==

On October 13, 1839, he offered his house for the meeting place to establish the first Masonic Lodge in Austin.

On January 13, 1840, he was elected the first mayor of Austin. He resigned before the end of his term, however, and moved to Austin County. A new county formed from parts of Austin County and neighboring Grimes County was renamed Waller County in his honor in 1873.

In 1861, Waller represented Austin County at the Texas secession convention. As one of the last living signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence, he was given the honor of signing the secession ordinance first after Convention President Oran Milo Roberts. The convention again regathered on March 4 to affirm its decision to leave the union and approve the &quot;Constitution of the Confederate States of America&quot;; although the Provisional Confederate Congress admitted Texas on March 1.

In 1873, Waller served as the first president of the Texas Veterans Association.

He died on January 3, 1881, in Austin, where he moved shortly before his death to live with one of his daughters. He was buried in Waller County, but his remains were later moved to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

<doc id="442764" wikidata="Q158235" url="?curid=442764" title="William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">
<text>William IV (French: &quot;Guillaume Alexandre&quot;; 22 April 1852 – 25 February 1912) was Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 17 November 1905 until his death in 1912. He succeeded his father, Adolphe. Like his father, William mostly stayed out of politics despite being vested with considerable power on paper by the Constitution.

William was a Protestant, the religion of the House of Nassau. He married Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, believing that a Catholic country ought to have a Catholic monarch. Thus his heirs have been Catholic.

At the death of his uncle, Prince Nikolaus-Wilhelm in 1905, the only other legitimate male in the House of Nassau-Weilburg was William&#x27;s cousin, Georg Nikolaus, Count of Merenberg, the product of a morganatic marriage. So in 1907, William declared the Counts of Merenberg non-dynastic, naming his own eldest daughter Marie-Adélaïde (1894–1924) as heiress presumptive to the grand ducal throne. She became Luxembourg&#x27;s first reigning grand duchess upon her father&#x27;s death in 1912, and upon her own abdication in 1919, was succeeded by her younger sister Charlotte (1896–1985). Charlotte&#x27;s descendants reign until the present day.

To date, William is the last monarch of Luxembourg to die on the throne, and the last to bear a regnal number.

==Marriage==
On 21 June 1893 in Fischhorn Castle, Zell am See, he married Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, daughter of former King Miguel I of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. The couple had six daughters:

* Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg (1894–1924) who remained unmarried and childless
* Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg (1896–1985) who married her first cousin Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, a son of Marie Anne&#x27;s younger sister.
* Princess Hilda (15 February 1897 in Berg Castle – 8 September 1979 in Berg Castle), married in Berg Castle on 29 October 1930 Adolf 10th Prince of Schwarzenberg (18 August 1890 in Frauenberg – 27 February 1950 in Bordighera), without issue
* Princess Antonia (1899–1954), who married Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria as his second wife
* Princess Elisabeth (7 March 1901 in Luxembourg City – 2 August 1950 in Schloss Hohenburg), married in Schloss Hohenburg on 14 November 1922 Prince Ludwig Philipp of Thurn and Taxis (2 February 1901 in Regensburg – 22 April 1933 in Schloss Niederaichbach), son of Albert I, Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and had issue
* Princess Sophie (14 February 1902 in Berg Castle – 24 May 1941 in Munich), married at Schloss Hohenburg on 12 April 1921 Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony (9 December 1896 in Dresden – 14 June 1971 in Neckarhausen), youngest son of king Frederick Augustus III of Saxony, and had issue

<doc id="442771" wikidata="Q5188262" url="?curid=442771" title="Cross Country Checkup">
<text>Cross Country Checkup is a Canada-wide open-line phone-in talk radio show that airs Sunday afternoons on CBC Radio One. Beginning in 2021, the first hour of the program has also been simulcast on television on CBC News Network.

The program has been hosted by Ian Hanomansing since September 2020; he was initially announced as an interim host for the 2020–21 season while previous host Duncan McCue was on an eight-month sabbatical, although his time with the program continued into 2022 before he was announced as the permanent host in June of that year.

Every week, the show features a lively discussion on an issue of national interest or importance and invites listeners to call in with their opinions and thoughts. The topics are usually related to Canadian politics. In addition to the host, the show has commentators who are experts or involved in the issue. They are interviewed by the host and answer questions from callers.

==Format==
The program is broadcast Sundays live at 4 p.m. Eastern Time Zone across the country, unlike most other Radio One programs, which air at the same local time in each time zone. The recording of the live show is rerun in a condensed format on Monday afternoons at 3 p.m. EST as &quot;Cross Country in an Hour&quot;. On extraordinary news occasions, the show may also produce a special episode outside of its regular broadcast time.

Close to half-a-million listeners tune in every Sunday afternoon to hear a lively exchange of ideas between callers and invited guests, and a broad cross-section of opinion on the topic of the day. On average, 5,000 to 10,000 people attempt to call the program during the broadcast to join the discussion.

The show&#x27;s current format takes calls on two topics for the show, one for each hour. The show previously had a segment called &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; in which listeners were invited to call or write to ask a guest expert questions. However, that feature has been supplanted by a new live Saturday afternoon show, &quot;Just Asking&quot;, which is dedicated to that activity.

==History==

The show was first broadcast on May 16, 1965, when it was started to provide a nationwide forum to discuss the then-proposed national health insurance system now in place in Canada. The first host was CBC Montreal announcer Bob Cadman, and its first guest was Dr Victor Goldbloom, then president of the Canadian Medical Association. When &quot;Checkup&quot; started broadcasting as a weekly series on November 24, 1965, Jim Schrumm was the first regular host. Subsequent hosts have included Brad Crandall, Moses Znaimer, Percy Saltzman, Betty Shapiro, John Dafoe, Pierre Pascau, Harry Elton, Elizabeth Gray, Wayne Grigsby, Dennis Trudeau, Augusta La Paix, Dale Goldhawk, Peter Downie, Royal Orr and Rex Murphy, who maintained the position for 21 years.

In September 2015, Murphy announced that he would be retiring from the program as of September 20. The program was hosted by a series of guest hosts through the first half of 2016, until McCue&#x27;s appointment as the new permanent host was announced in July.

On occasions in the past, the program has gone to air as &quot;Cross-Continent Checkup&quot; by involving a radio network in at least one other foreign country, such as National Public Radio in the United States, London Broadcasting Company (as it was then known) in Britain or the CBC&#x27;s own Radio Canada International, and taking calls from English-speaking callers in all involved countries. In each case, callers generally call a toll-free number in their own country. &quot;Checkup&quot;, nevertheless, often receives calls from callers outside Canada.

For the 2016–2017 season, the show changed the signature music that opened the programme since at least the early 1970s.

<text>Monte Kenton Solberg, (born September 17, 1958) is a Canadian businessman and politician. Solberg is a former Member of Parliament, representing the riding of Medicine Hat in the House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and later served as the Minister of Human Resources and Social Development. He has also served as Critic for Foreign Affairs, National Revenue, and Human Resources Development.

Solberg is now a Principal at New West Public Affairs, a Canadian national public affairs firm based in western Canada, and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta.

Solberg was the owner of the right-wing news aggregate website, News Hub Nation, from which he frequently blogged about current events and features exclusive content from conservative personalities.

==Early life==
Solberg was born in Calgary, Alberta. A former broadcaster and businessman, Solberg is of Norwegian ancestry.

==Political career==
He was elected as a Reform Party Member of Parliament (MP) in 1993 and 1997, and as a Canadian Alliance MP in 2000. In 2001, Solberg was one of 13 MPs who were suspended from the Canadian Alliance caucus for criticizing the leadership of Stockwell Day. He sat as an Independent Alliance MP for the summer, joining the Democratic Representative Caucus in September before returning to the Alliance in April 2002. He was also one of four Alliance MPs who agreed to sit with the Progressive Conservative caucus (to preserve their official party status) after the December 9, 2003, creation of the merged Conservative Party, as the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parliamentary caucuses were not officially merged until a few weeks later. He was re-elected as a Conservative MP in the 2004 election.

Solberg kept a high-profile blog, and in 2005, is thought to have made history when, using his BlackBerry, he blogged from the floor of the House of Commons immediately upon the passage of Bill C-38, which provided legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Solberg was opposed to the bill. In 2006, Solberg again won his Medicine Hat riding, with 79.7% of the vote, the second highest winning percentage in the country for the 2006 federal election. He suspended updating his blog after being appointed Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.

In the January 4, 2007, cabinet shuffle, Solberg was appointed the new minister of Human Resources and Social Development, replacing Diane Finley.

==Retirement and present status==
Thought by some to seek a leadership bid of the Conservative party, Solberg surprised many when he announced on September 4, 2008, that he was retiring from politics and would not be a candidate in the 40th Canadian federal election.

Solberg is a columnist with the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot;, a contributor to Sun News Network, formerly a full-time consultant for Fleishman-Hillard Canada, and now Principal at New West Public Affairs, a public affairs firm based in Calgary. He also serves as a Governor with the International Development Research Centre, a crown corporation dedicated to generating and applying new knowledge to meet the challenges facing the world&#x27;s poorest countries.

<doc id="442774" wikidata="Q1158270" url="?curid=442774" title="Damascus affair">
<text>The Damascus affair of February 1840 was the disappearance of an Italian monk and his servant, for which a large number of Jews were summarily tortured until they &quot;confessed&quot; to murder. As an instance of antisemitism and a blood libel, news of the case spread, across the Middle East, to Europe, and the Western world.

The Christians were supported in their accusation by the French consul at Damascus, Ulysse de Ratti-Menton, a person described by historians as antisemitic and known to favour Christian merchants and advisers over their Jewish counterparts. Ratti-Menton ordered that an investigation be carried out in the Jewish quarter where both men had last been seen and encouraged the Egyptian governor of Damascus to act upon the matter, which resulted in the accused being imprisoned and interrogated under torture after which they confessed to the murder.

Antisemitism increased, with Muslims and Christians alike becoming violent, and attacking innocent Jewish people. This drew international attention, and European Jewry were horrified. Sir Moses Montefiore of Great Britain and Adolphe Crémieux of France were publicly outraged. In contrition, Muhammad Ali of Egypt released the remaining prisoners, but refused to acquit them. It was not until November 1840, after Egyptian withdrawal and the restoration of Ottoman Syria, that Sultan Abdulmejid I decreed all charges should be lifted.

==Background==
In 1840 Damascus belonged to the Ottoman Empire (1299–1922). Under Ottoman rule, the society was organized by the so-called millet system, which divided the Ottoman subjects into different millets based on their religious affiliation. This system guaranteed considerable autonomy to the different millets as long as its members remained loyal to the sultan. The Muslim millet was by far the biggest since Islam was the most dominant religion in the area. Christians and Jews were considered dhimmis—a class of non-Muslims possessing some limited rights under Muslim rule—and allowed to practice their own religion. In return, the Christians and the Jews had to pay &quot;jizya&quot; (a special tax imposed on non-Muslim subjects), and they possessed a lower legal and social status than their fellow Muslim citizens. Under the pressure of European powers, who sought to establish a better status for the Christian communities in the Ottoman Empire, sultan Abdülmecid decreed in 1839 that all subjects, regardless of their religion, were equal before the law. This edict of Gülhane signalled the start of almost three decades of modernization, known as the Tanzimat period, which was aimed at a reorganization of the Empire.

Since the beginning of the sixteenth century, Syria had been part of the Ottoman Empire (1299–1922). However, in 1831, eight years before the Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman Syria had come under the control of the Egyptian Muhammad Ali, the viceroy of Ottoman Egypt who had turned against the sultan. Muhammad Ali was said to have been influenced by European powers, particularly by France, which often attempted to safeguard and ameliorate the position of members of Catholic orders in the region. Under the rule of Muhammed Ali, the rights afforded to the Christian population increased and, like the Muslim inhabitants of the region, they were conscripted into the army. These new rights strained the relationship between the Muslim majority and their non-Muslim counterparts. However, the relationship between other non-Muslim groups could become tense as well. The relation between Jewish and Christian communities was tense as the result of economic rivalry between both communities in which the Jewish merchants often acquired the most economic prosperity. In this economic struggle, both groups sought the support of the Muslim majority. In general, the relationship between Jewish and Muslim communities was better than the relation between Muslim and Christian communities, which was partially caused by Muslims&#x27; resentment at the new rights afforded to the Christians under the rule of Muhammad Ali.

== Disappearance and accusations ==

On February 5, 1840, Father Thomas, an Italian monk belonging to a Franciscan Capuchin friar from the Island of Sardinia, and his Muslim servant, Ibrahim Amrah, disappeared in Damascus. Soon after their disappearance the Jewish community was accused by the Christians of murdering Father Thomas and his servant, and to have extracted their blood in order to bake matzo. The accusation that the blood of Christians was used by Jewish people for their Passover bread is commonly known as the blood libel which has its roots in medieval Europe. In 1840 Damascus, the Christians were supported in their accusation by the French consul at Damascus, Ulysse de Ratti-Menton, an antisemite who was known to favour Christian merchants and advisers over their Jewish counterparts. Upon Father Thomas&#x27; disappearance, Ratti-Menton ordered that an investigation be carried out in the Jewish quarter where both men had last been seen. Because French officials had a good relationship with Muhammad &#x27;Ali, who then controlled Ottoman Syria, Ratti-Menton got the support of Sharif Pasha, the Egyptian governor (wali) of the city and the son-in-law of Muhammad &#x27;Ali.

Under torture a confession was extracted from a Jewish barber called Negrin who told the persecutors that he, together with seven other notable Jewish men (including members of the influential Farḥī family), had killed Father Thomas on the night of his disappearance. These other men were interrogated under torture as well, during which five of the seven prisoners confessed to the murder of the Father and his servant. Although there is no consensus among scholars about the number, it is certain that some prisoners died during their interrogation. More atrocities occurred later as authorities seized sixty-three Jewish children as hostages to hold until their mothers revealed the location of the blood.

When bones were discovered in a Jewish quarter, Ratti-Menton and Sharif Pasha considered this discovery as a confirmation of the confession extracted from the imprisoned Jews. More Jews were accused and arrested on charges of involvement in the murder of Father Thomas. In the direct aftermath of the blood libel and the arrests, the Christians and Muslims of Damascus committed violence against the Jewish population. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia (1901-1906) the synagogue in the suburb Jobar was pillaged by a mob in a reaction to the blood libel and the scrolls of the Law were destroyed.

=== Release of the prisoners ===
The Damascus Affair increased the concern of European Jews about the situation of their Arab co-religionists. The Austrian Consul in Aleppo Eliahu Picciotto reported the incident to the Jewish communities in Europe, and made representations to Ibrahim Pasha, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s son in Egypt, who then ordered an investigation into the matter. Sir Moses Montefiore, a British politician and leader of the British Jewish community, and the French lawyer Adolphe Crémieux, called on Muhammed &#x27;Ali to release the Jewish prisoners. Negotiations about their release lasted from 4 to 28 August. In the end, Muhammed &#x27;Ali released the prisoners who had remained alive, but without officially acquitting the prisoners of the charged brought against them. Only in November 1840, when Syria fell under Ottoman rule again, Sultan Abdülmecid I issued a firmān (edict) denouncing the blood libel of Damascus. The edict declared that blood libel accusations are a slander against Jews and are prohibited throughout the Ottoman Empire. A part of the edict reads: &quot;... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth...&quot;.The Damascus Affair is illustrative of the tensions that existed between the Jewish and Christian populations of Syria. The incident is also notable for being an exception to the rule of Jewish-Muslim relations. During the Tanzimat period, Jewish-Muslim relations were generally much better than Christian-Muslim relations, which had been strained by the economic ascendancy afforded to the Christian community with the relaxation and the eventual elimination of the dhimmi status rules in the 1850s. While occasional outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence erupted during this time, far more serious outbreaks of violence occurred between Muslims and Christians and between Christians and Druzes.

In the remainder of the 19th century and into the 20th century, there were many instances of the blood libel in Ottoman lands. These instances most often came from Christian communities, sometimes with the connivance of Greek or French diplomats. The Jews could usually count on the goodwill of the Ottoman authorities and increasingly on the support of British, Prussian and Austrian representatives.

==Reactions and aftermath==

In a new and groundbreaking effort, the American Jewish community of 15,000 protested in six American cities on behalf of their Syrian brethren. &quot;For the first time in American Jewish life, Jews ... organized themselves politically to help Diaspora Jewry in distress.&quot; Among the new ethnic immigrant populations to the United States, the Jews were the first to attempt to sway the government to act on behalf of their kin and co-religionists abroad; with this incident, they became involved in the politics of foreign policy, persuading but not pressuring President Van Buren to protest officially. The United States consul in Egypt expressed the protest.

According to Hasia R. Diner, in &quot;The Jews of the United States, 1654 to 2000&quot;, &quot;For the Jews, the Damascus affair launched modern Jewish politics on an international scale, and for American Jews it represented their first effort at creating a distinctive political agenda. Just as the United States had used this affair to proclaim its presence on the global scale, so too did American Jews, in their newspapers and at mass meetings, announce to their coreligionists in France and England that they too ought to be thought of players in global Jewish diplomacy.&quot;

According to Johannes Valentin Schwarz, the events also encouraged the growth of a modern Jewish press. &quot;As a result, a sense of solidarity was evoked among the Jewish communities of Europe they had never experienced before. Thus, the Damascus Affair gave birth to modern Jewish press especially in Western Europe, such as to the long-lived papers &quot;Les Archives Israélites de France&quot; (1840–1935) in Paris or &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; (1841 ff.) in London.&quot;

==Later references to the affair ==
Accusations of the affair were published in the Egyptian daily &quot;Al Akhbar&quot; in 2000 and again in 2001 in an article titled &quot;The Last Scene in the Life of Father Toma&quot;. In 2002, the Middle East Media Research Institute reported that some of the 1840 accusations emerged in a 1983 book &quot;The Damascus Blood Libel (1840)&quot; by the Syrian Minister of Defense, Mustafa Tlass. The book was described as being influential in international antisemitic circles as a reliable source of information on &quot;ritual murder by the Jews.&quot; In 1983, Tlass wrote and published &quot;The Matzah of Zion&quot;, which is a treatment of the Damascus affair of 1840 and repeats the ancient &quot;blood libel&quot;, that Jews use the blood of murdered non-Jews in religious rituals such as baking Matza bread. In this book, he argues that the true religious beliefs of Jews are &quot;black hatred against all humans and religions&quot;, and that no Arab country should ever sign a peace treaty with Israel. Tlass re-printed the book several times, and he stands by its conclusions. Following the book&#x27;s publication, Tlass told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that this accusation against Jews was valid and that his book is &quot;an historical study ... based on documents from France, Vienna and the American University in Beirut.&quot;

In 2007, Lebanese poet Marwan Chamoun, in an interview aired on Télé Liban, referred to the &quot;... slaughter of the priest Tomaso de Camangiano ... in 1840... in the presence of two rabbis in the heart of Damascus, in the home of a close friend of this priest, Daud Al-Harari, the head of the Jewish community of Damascus. After he was slaughtered, his blood was collected, and the two rabbis took it.&quot;

The novel &quot;Death of a Monk&quot; (2004), written by the Israeli author Alon Hilu, is based on the affair.

The blood libel was featured in a scene in the Syrian TV series &quot;Ash-Shatat&quot; in 2003, while in 2013 the Israeli website &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot; reported cases of Israeli Arabs asking &quot;where Jews find the Christian blood they need to bake matza&quot;.

The Audio drama &quot;The Damascus Affair – for Narrator and Orchestra&quot;, created by Israeli composer Nissim Khalifa (text by Elioz Hefer Antebi), is based on the affair and writings of Rabbi Ya&#x27;akov Antebi.

<doc id="442778" wikidata="Q159075" url="?curid=442778" title="Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg">
<text>Marie-Adélaïde (, ; 14 June 1894 – 24 January 1924), was Grand Duchess of Luxembourg from 1912 until her abdication in 1919. She was the first Grand Duchess regnant of Luxembourg (after five grand dukes), its first female monarch since Duchess Maria Theresa (1740–1780, who was also Austrian Archduchess and Holy Roman Empress) and the first Luxembourgish monarch to be born within the territory since Count John the Blind (1296–1346).

Named as heiress presumptive by her father Grand Duke William IV in 1907 to prevent a succession crisis due to his lack of a son, Marie-Adélaïde became Grand Duchess in 1912. She ruled through the First World War, and her perceived support for the German occupation forces led to great unpopularity in Luxembourg as well as neighbouring France and Belgium. On the advice of Parliament and under enormous pressure from the Luxembourgish people, she abdicated on 14 January 1919 in favour of her younger sister Charlotte, who managed to save the monarchy and the dynasty in a national referendum later that year.

Following her abdication, Marie-Adélaïde retired to a convent in Italy, before leaving due to ill health. She died of influenza in Germany on 24 January 1924, at the age of 29.

==Early years==
Marie-Adélaïde was born on 14 June 1894 in Berg Castle as the eldest child of Grand Duke William IV and his wife, Marie Anne of Portugal.

Since her father had six daughters and no sons, he proclaimed Marie-Adélaïde as the heiress presumptive on 10 July 1907, in order to solve any succession crisis due to the use of Salic law in the monarchy.

Due to that same Salic Law, the elder branch of the House of Nassau, called &quot;Nassau-Weilburg&quot; (present-day &quot;Luxembourg-Nassau&quot;) inherited in 1890 the throne of Luxembourg from the younger branch called &quot;Nassau-Orange&quot;, which was not only supplying the Grand Dukes of Luxembourg from 1815 to 1890, but was also in a personal union the reigning dynasty of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Thus, when her father died on 25 February 1912, she succeeded to the throne at the age of 17, becoming the first reigning Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Her mother served as regent until Marie-Adélaïde&#x27;s eighteenth birthday on 18 June 1912, when the President of the Chamber Auguste Laval swore her in as the first Luxembourgish monarch to be born in the territory since Count John the Blind (1296–1346). Laval&#x27;s speech to the Chamber of Deputies (parliament) during the ceremony was:

Marie-Adélaïde&#x27;s own speech at the ceremony was:

==Reign==

Marie-Adélaïde was deeply interested in politics and took an active part in the government and the political life of the Grand Duchy in accordance with the Luxembourgish Constitution which at that time granted the monarch extensive political powers. She was a devout Roman Catholic, with strong religious convictions and very conservative political views. On the day of her ascension to the throne – 25 February 1912 – she refused to sign a new law reducing the role of Roman Catholic priests within the education system. Later, in 1915, she hesitated before appointing the mayors of Differdange and Hollerich, both known for their anticlerical views.
With the outbreak of World War I, Luxembourg found itself in a dangerous position, unable to defend itself from German invasion because of its neutral status (see Treaty of London (1867)). When Germany violated Luxembourg&#x27;s neutrality on August 2, on the pretext of safeguarding the railroads, Marie Adelaide and her government responded with formal protests. However, these protests proved ineffective in halting the subsequent military occupation of the country. 

Marie-Adélaïde and the government refrained from further opposing the German invasion, which spared the population of the Grand Duchy from military conflict on its soil, and resulted in the Germans leaving the Luxembourgish state intact during the occupation. During the war, Marie-Adélaïde, her sisters and their mother were personally involved in the work of the Red Cross in Luxembourg, and cared for both German and French soldiers. 

Political conflict in Luxembourg, however, continued. Diane Mozcar writes:

Meanwhile, in late 1915 the Grand Duchess caused controversy by dissolving the Chamber of Deputies to solve the deadlock faced by the Loutsch Ministry, which was composed of Party of the Right members and did not have a majority in the Chamber. Marie-Adélaïde ordered the Chamber dissolved and new elections held on 23 December 1915. This action was permissible under the Constitution, but regarded as unconventional, and provoked an outcry and long-term resentment among the socialists and liberals in parliament, who saw it as resembling a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

After the end of the war, Luxembourg was harshly criticised by the Entente for its attitude, and the perception of the Grand Duchess as pro-German led the French government to declare: &quot;The French Government does not consider it possible to have contact or negotiations with the Government of the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, whom it considers as gravely compromised …,&quot; and French Minister Raymond Poincaré claimed the following about the Grand Duchy: &quot;This country has not done its duty and does not deserve to be maintained in its present state.&quot;

Although she had not done anything in contradiction with the Luxembourgish Constitution of 1868, voices in Parliament began to demand her abdication in January 1919. However, leftists wanted to do away with the monarchy in its entirety. Furthermore, Belgium sought to annex Luxembourg, a plan that was even supported by some of Marie-Adélaïde&#x27;s political opponents at home.

On 9 January, a group of Socialist and Liberal Luxembourgish Members of Parliament (&quot;Deputies&quot;) publicly proclaimed a republic after losing a vote in parliament to abolish the monarchy, a situation which was followed by public unrest in the streets requiring even the intervention of the French Army to restore order. Under intense national (and international) pressure, and after consulting with the Prime Minister, the 24-year-old Grand Duchess abdicated on 14 January 1919. She was succeeded by her younger sister, Princess Charlotte. The constitution was also revised. Diane Mozcar writes that &quot;Charlotte and her successors, however, were not to wield the political power and authority previously accorded to the sovereign by the constitution.&quot;

===Governments===
Marie-Adélaïde&#x27;s reign saw the following Prime Ministers and Governments:
* Paul Eyschen (Eyschen Ministry)
* Mathias Mongenast (Mongenast Ministry)
* Hubert Loutsch (Loutsch Ministry)
* Victor Thorn (National Union Government)
* Léon Kauffman (Kauffman Ministry)
* Émile Reuter (Reuter Ministry)

==Post-abdication==

After her abdication, Marie-Adélaïde went into exile by travelling through Europe. She entered a Carmelite convent in Modena, Italy, in 1920. Later, she joined the Little Sisters of the Poor in Rome, taking the name &quot;Sister Marie of the Poor&quot;. Her worsening health did not allow her to remain a nun, however, and she eventually had to leave the convent. She then moved to Schloss Hohenburg in Bavaria, where, surrounded by her family, she died of influenza aged 29 on 24 January 1924. She had not married or had children. On 22 October 1947, her body was interred in the Grand Ducal Crypt of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Luxembourg City.

<doc id="442785" wikidata="Q6490253" url="?curid=442785" title="Larry Elder">
<text>Laurence Allen Elder (born April 27, 1952) is an American conservative political commentator and talk radio host. He hosts &quot;The Larry Elder Show&quot;, based in California. The show began as a local program on Los Angeles radio station KABC in 1993 and ran until 2008, followed by a second run on KABC from 2010 to 2014. The show is nationally syndicated, first through ABC Radio Networks from 2002 to 2007 and then Salem Media Group from 2015 to 2022. He maintains ties to &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, a newspaper published by the new religious movement Falun Gong. While Elder is primarily known as a conservative, he also self-identifies as a &quot;small l&quot; libertarian, summarizing his political ideology as &quot;I believe that a government that governs less governs best.&quot;

Elder, a former attorney, has written nonfiction books and a nationally syndicated column through Creators Syndicate. He is the author of &quot;As Goes California: My Mission to Rescue the Golden State&quot; and &quot;Save the Nation.&quot;

In 2021, Elder launched his first run for public office, as a Republican candidate in the recall election of California&#x27;s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. The recall was defeated by a wide margin, although Elder placed first among the replacement candidates. On April 20, 2023, Elder announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election, but dropped out on October 26.

== Early life and education ==

Laurence Allen Elder was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the city&#x27;s Pico-Union and South Central areas, the middle child of three brothers. His father Randolph (1915–2011), who was born in Athens, Georgia, was a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and moved to California from Georgia after the war during the Second Great Migration. After working as a janitor at Nabisco, Randolph Elder opened a cafe in Pico-Union . After his father&#x27;s death in 2011, Larry Elder recalled: &quot;Gruff and blunt, my dad often intimidated my two brothers and me. But we never doubted his love or his commitment to his family.&quot; In 2013, Elder and his brother Kirk accepted a Congressional Gold Medal from U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher on their father&#x27;s behalf. Larry Elder&#x27;s mother Viola (née Conley, 1924–2006) was originally from Toney, Alabama. She was a clerical worker for the United States Department of War during World War II. His father was a Republican, and his mother a Democrat.

An honors student who also took advanced courses at Fairfax High School, Elder graduated from Crenshaw High School in 1970 and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1974 from Brown University. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1977.

==Career==
After graduation from law school, Elder joined the Cleveland-based law firm Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey. In 1980, he founded Laurence A. Elder and Associates, a legal executive search firm. Elder stepped down from operating Elder and Associates but continued to own the firm until 1995. Elder&#x27;s license to practice law in Ohio has been administratively suspended since December 2005, according to The Supreme Court of Ohio Attorney Directory website, which notes not keeping up registration requirements.

===Media career===

====Television, film and video====

Elder began co-hosting &quot;Fabric&quot;, a topic-oriented television show produced by Dennis Goulden that aired on Cleveland&#x27;s PBS member station WVIZ in 1988.

In 1997, he hosted the PBS program &quot;National Desk&quot; along with fellow conservatives Fred Barnes and Laura Ingraham. Elder hosted the segments &quot;Redefining Racism: Fresh Voices From Black America&quot; and &quot;Title IX and Women in Sports: What&#x27;s Wrong With This Picture&quot;, which criticized Title IX.

In 2000, Elder won a Los Angeles Area Emmy Award for his KCAL-TV News special &quot;Making Waves – LAUSD&quot;. Between 2000 and 2001, Elder hosted the court series &quot;Moral Court&quot;, distributed by Warner Brothers Television. In 2004, he hosted &quot;The Larry Elder Show&quot;, a syndicated talk show distributed by Warner Bros.

In 2005, he created a self-financed film called &quot;Michael &amp; Me&quot;, in which he offers a rebuttal to filmmaker Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;.

In 2007, Elder was one of the rotating talk hosts auditioning for the slot vacated by the now-canceled &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; on MSNBC. However, the job went to Joe Scarborough instead.

As of 2024, Elder stars in &quot;The New Norm&quot; as Charlie, Norm&#x27;s like-minded best friend and boss.

Elder is a columnist with Creators Syndicate. His newspaper and online column are carried by &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot;, &quot;World Net Daily&quot;, &quot;Townhall.com&quot;, &quot;Jewish World Review&quot; and &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;. He hosts a video series published by &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;.

====Radio====
Elder hosted a weekday evening talk show on Los Angeles talk radio station KABC from 1994 until December 2008. He then launched a daily live podcast as well as a webcast in December 2009. Elder returned to KABC in September 2010.

In December 2014, Elder was fired from KABC after one of his afternoon broadcasts. He was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015. In June 2015, Elder joined the lineup of CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks. In August 2015, &quot;The Larry Elder Show&quot; began national syndication through the Salem Radio Network, including Los Angeles station KRLA.

Jean Guerrero, in a 2020 interview on NPR, said that Elder had told her that he had invited Stephen Miller on his radio show as a guest a total of 69 times, having been impressed with Miller after he had first called in to the show as a high school student. Miller, who cites Elder as an influence, later became a Trump administration official and the architect of Trump&#x27;s immigration policies.

Elder left his Salem Radio afternoon slot as of , after a six-year run. His regular fill-in host, Carl Jackson, who had substituted for Elder&#x27;s during the latter&#x27;s run for the California Governor seat, has again been named as the temporary fill-in host until a permanent replacement is named.

====Writing====
In the late 1980s, Elder wrote op-eds for local newspapers in Cleveland. In 1998, Elder began writing a nationally syndicated column through Creators Syndicate. Elder wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; until April 2012.

==Political activism==

&quot;Roll Call&quot; reported that Elder contemplated a possible run for the United States Senate against California Senator Barbara Boxer in 2010.

=== 2021 California gubernatorial recall election ===

In July 2021, Elder announced his candidacy to replace Governor Gavin Newsom in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election. He said that he was encouraged to run by fellow conservative talk-radio figure Dennis Prager, a mentor to Elder.

California Secretary of State Shirley Weber initially omitted Elder&#x27;s name from the list of candidates to be on the ballot, saying that he failed to submit complete tax return information that was required according to Senate Bill 27, which was enacted in 2019; the law mandated tax return disclosure for both presidential and gubernatorial candidates in order to appear on a &quot;primary&quot; ballot (the presidential requirement was later struck down by the courts). Elder sued, saying that his paperwork was properly submitted and that Weber was required to fix the alleged errors. On July 21, 2021, Judge Laurie Earl of the Sacramento County Superior Court ordered Elder&#x27;s reinstatement to the recall ballot, holding that Weber improperly disqualified Elder, who had &quot;substantially complied&quot; with disclosure requirements, and that the recall election&#x27;s tax return disclosure requirements imposed by Secretary of State Weber were invalid, since the special recall election was not a &quot;direct primary election&quot;. Weber&#x27;s office did not appeal the ruling.

After his entry, Elder had been regarded as the front-runner on the election&#x27;s replacement question. He refused to participate in debates with other Republican recall candidates, such as former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, and business owner John Cox, and had refused to share a stage with certain other candidates at Republican Party events. Former California Governor Pete Wilson was one of Elder&#x27;s campaign advisors. If elected governor, Elder pledged to replace one of California&#x27;s two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein, with a Republican.

In September 2021, while the recall election was underway, Elder claimed without evidence that there would be &quot;shenanigans&quot; in the voting process. Four days before election day, and before election results were known, a website paid for by Elder&#x27;s campaign already referred to the election having &quot;twisted results&quot;, baselessly stating that analyses &quot;detected fraud in California resulting in Governor Gavin Newsom being reinstated as governor.&quot;

On the night of the election, after Newsom defeated the recall effort, Elder told his supporters to be &quot;gracious in defeat&quot;, stating that &quot;we may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war&quot;, proceeding to repeatedly criticize Newsom.

In January 2022, Elder announced that he would not run against Newsom in the state&#x27;s gubernatorial election later that year, and would instead focus on a new political action committee called &quot;Elder for America&quot; in order to help Republicans win back the House and Senate.

=== 2024 presidential election ===

Over a year after the recall, Elder began floating the idea of running for president.

On April 20, 2023, Elder officially announced his candidacy for president of the United States in the 2024 election. During a television appearance announcing his decision, Elder said &quot;My father was a World War II vet, He served on the island of Guam. He was a Marine. My older brother, late older brother, Kirk, was in the Navy during the Vietnam era. My little brother Dennis actually served in Vietnam in the Army. I&#x27;m the only one who didn&#x27;t serve, and I don&#x27;t feel good about that. I feel I have a moral, religious and a patriotic duty to give back to a country that&#x27;s been so good to my family and me. And that is why I am doing this.&quot; According to Elder, &quot;America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m running for President.&quot;

While Elder announced his candidacy on Fox News, he appeared to break the news to the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; one week earlier, on April 14, 2023.

Since announcing his candidacy, Elder has appeared on various cable news shows, podcasts, and other media platforms to make his case for the presidency, including &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and Valuetainment&#x27;s &quot;PBD Podcast&quot;.

Elder claims, “America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable.” He has made addressing crime a campaign priority, criticizing district attorneys with connections to billionaire George Soros for failing to “protect people and property.” Elder is known for highlighting crime rates in cities like Chicago, Illinois. As a member of the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, he is also critical of the Biden administration for &quot;portraying black males as victims&quot; and &quot;ignoring the root causes of their struggles,&quot; accusing Democrats of &quot;turning their backs on the very people they claim to support.&quot;

In July 2023, Elder criticized the Republican National Committee&#x27;s (RNC) primary debate qualification rules, requiring each candidate to secure 40,000 individual donors and then hand over their donor information to the RNC. In an op-ed column published in &quot;The Hill&quot;, he called the requirements &quot;artificial and arbitrary,&quot; refusing to &quot;serve as a piggy bank for a political party.&quot;

Elder has proposed a &quot;Blind Spot&quot; initiative, promising to sign an executive order that would prevent family members of presidents, vice presidents, and members of Congress from profiting off of those positions, both while their family members are in office and five years after the fact. He also supports making illegal immigration a felony at the state level, urging U.S. states to punish &quot;illegal aliens&quot; themselves.

On August 22, Elder disclosed his financials, in which he reported to have made $1-$5 million from &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; and between $100,001 and $1 million from the anti-inflammatory supplement Relief Factor. Elder&#x27;s disclosure violates guidance from the Office of Government Ethics which requires candidates to provide their exact income, not in ranges as he did.
Despite believing to qualify for the first presidential debate in Wisconsin, the RNC officially announced their list of candidates for the debate and Elder was left out. Elder then responded calling the process corrupt, and announced he would take further action in the form of legal prosecution to ensure he was on the debate stage.

After being left out of the first Republican primary debate in late August, Elder criticized the RNC for excluding select polls from Rasmussen Reports, due to alleged connections to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign. Rasmussen denied any connection to Trump, prompting Elder to state that “the rules of the game were rigged” to bar him from the debate stage.

Elder subsequently filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, accusing the RNC and Fox News of conspiring to leave him out of the debate by failing to apply the debate qualification standards equally.

Elder blames Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, with more than two million illegal migrants crossing the border for the second consecutive fiscal year in 2023. He also claims Biden is &quot;stuck&quot; with Harris as his running mate in 2024, criticizing the president for aligning himself with Gavin Newsom and his &quot;unaffordable dystopia&quot; in California.

On October 26, 2023, Elder ended his campaign for president, endorsing Donald Trump.

== Political views ==
Elder holds conservative and right-wing views. Elder is a registered Republican; in 2021, he stated that he had voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1980 after voting for Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. Elder labels himself a &quot;small-l libertarian&quot; as opposed to a member of the Libertarian Party. He has summed up his political philosophy as “I believe that a government that governs less governs best.”

He is an ardent supporter of former president Donald Trump, frequently praising him on Twitter. He was an early supporter of Trump&#x27;s 2016 candidacy for president. In 2019, speaking to an audience about the election of Trump, Elder said, &quot;It was a miracle. He is almost God-sent.&quot; After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Donald Trump made claims of fraud while refusing to concede, Elder said that he did not believe that Biden won the 2020 election fairly. Elder has argued that it is unfair to blame Trump for the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Elder opposed the first tariffs imposed by Trump and Trump&#x27;s decision to draw down U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

&quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; pointed out his ties to &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, a newspaper considered to be far-right, which is published by the Falun Gong movement.

=== Economic issues ===
In his 2000 book, &quot;The Ten Things You Can&#x27;t Say In America&quot;, Elder laid out a 10-point plan to &quot;save America&quot;. He called for abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, creating a national sales tax, reducing government by 80%, ending welfare and entitlements, abolishing the minimum wage, and eliminating corporate taxes.

Elder opposes minimum wage laws, arguing that &quot;The ideal minimum wage is $0.00.&quot; He opposes universal basic income. Elder opposes California&#x27;s unpaid family leave law. In his 2020 film &quot;Uncle Tom: An Oral History of the American Black Conservative&quot;, Elder criticizes the War on Poverty.

On a CNN &quot;Crossfire&quot; segment in 2013 along with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Elder criticized Christie for accepting the &quot;architecture of the welfare state&quot; and claimed that &quot;government took almost 50 percent of the American people&#x27;s money&quot; through mandates, a claim he supported by referring to an analysis by the conservative advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform. PolitiFact rated his claim &quot;Mostly False&quot;.

Elder has been critical of public-sector labor unions, especially the California Teachers Association. He contends that some 15,000 California teachers are &quot;incompetent&quot; and previously proposed that thousands of teachers in the state be fired. He later said that he favored more charter schools and private schools instead.

Elder proposes to cap government spending at 10 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, while preventing the sitting president and all members of Congress from running for re-election in the next cycle if the spending cap is exceeded.

=== Social issues ===
In August 2021, Elder came under criticism for his long history of disparaging statements about women. Elder has contended that &quot;Women know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events&quot; when citing a 2017 Cambridge study by Toni Alexander Ihme and Markus Tausendpfund; mocked women who took part in the 2017 Women&#x27;s March as &quot;obese&quot;; mocked premenstrual syndrome by saying PMS stands for &quot;Punish My Spouse&quot;; endorsed pregnancy discrimination by employers; reposted an article on his website that likened single mothers on welfare to stray cats; and claimed that statistics about domestic violence against women are exaggerated to promote feminism. Elder has asserted that Democrats achieve more success among women voters because they have &quot;emotionally driven, but often unsound policies.&quot;

Elder has often denied that a gender wage gap exists. Elder contends that employers should be allowed to discriminate in employment against women who plan to have children, and in his 2002 book he wrote that women who choose to have children are not &quot;dedicated&quot; to their jobs and suggested that they lacked a &quot;commitment&quot; to work. Elder reiterated these views in 2021, while he ran for governor, after fellow Republican candidate Kevin Faulconer criticized Elder&#x27;s views.

Elder opposes abortion, calling it &quot;murder&quot;. He has argued that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; should be overturned, calling the decision &quot;one of the worst decisions that the Supreme Court ever handed down.&quot; He believes that abortion laws should be decided at the state level.

Elder has made anti-LGBT remarks on Twitter and has repeatedly used male pronouns when referring to transgender women, such as model Ines Rau and fellow gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner.

In 2021, Elder accused California of having a &quot;soft-on-crime ethos&quot;; he opposes a California law that banned police from using certain chokeholds. Elder opposes 2014 California Proposition 47, which reclassified as misdemeanors many lower-level drug and property crimes that had formerly been felonies, and said that if elected governor he would press for the proposition to be repealed.

===Science, environment, and the COVID-19 pandemic===
During his media career, Elder published and gave airtime to misinformation and fringe views on scientific topics, such as secondhand tobacco smoke, climate change, and COVID-19 treatments.

In a 2000 book, Elder suggested that the health hazards of secondhand tobacco smoke had been exaggerated, rejecting the scientific consensus that secondhand smoke is a serious threat that caused 2.5 million deaths in the half-century before 2014.

Elder&#x27;s website once described climate change as a &quot;myth&quot;; in a 2008 interview, he called climate change a &quot;crock&quot;, disparaged Republicans such as John McCain and George W. Bush, who acknowledged climate change, and said that global warming is not a &quot;big peril&quot; to planet Earth. In 2021, Elder acknowledged that the climate is warming, but rejected the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary contributor, calling concern over climate change &quot;alarmism&quot;.

In 2021, Elder pledged to remove current statewide public health mandates for state government workers in California, such as COVID-19 vaccine requirements, face mask requirements, or regular COVID-19 testing. Elder encouraged &quot;people in high-risk categories, people who are older&quot; to be vaccinated but said that &quot;young people&quot; do not need to be vaccinated. In 2021, Elder did not challenge a call-in listener to his radio show who espoused COVID-19 misinformation suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines were dangerous and part of a Bill Gates-orchestrated plot, and a page on Elder&#x27;s website promoted the call-in listener&#x27;s comments by saying, &quot;You&#x27;ll want to hear this physician&#x27;s take on the vaccines.&quot;

Elder has proposed suspending or waiving the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, contending that doing so would speed up housing construction.

=== Race relations ===
Elder does not believe in systemic racism, calling it a lie. He is a critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, blaming it for rising crime. As part of his criticism of welfare, he stated that it is more harmful to Black families than slavery ever was. He has proposed school choice as a solution for poor performance of Black children in school.

=== Crime ===
On Elder&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign website, crime is the first issue listed. Elder is a vocal supporter of law enforcement.

Elder blames the Democratic Party and organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for ignoring crime and the &quot;epidemic of fatherlessness&quot; in Black neighborhoods. He says &quot;Black-on-Black urban crime in Democratic-run cities&quot; is a top concern for the Black community, while also saying Democrats such as Biden &quot;manipulate Blacks into seeing themselves as victims.&quot;

==Personal life==
Elder was married for two years to a physician, who was also a long-term friend of his. They divorced in 1994 because she wanted to have children, and he did not. Elder later dated Patricia Stewart from 1996 to 2012, and they have remained friends since their separation. Elder then dated Alexandra Datig, a longtime former radio producer for him, and was engaged to her from 2013 until 2015.

===Allegations of abuse and sexual harassment===
In 2011 episodes of his radio program, Elder disclosed that he had twice been accused of sexual harassment and denied both allegations. In one case, Elder defended himself by implying that the woman was too unattractive for him to sexually harass, saying, &quot;If you had seen her, you would know that the picture would be a complete defense. I&#x27;m just saying.&quot;

In 2021, Elder&#x27;s former fiancée Alexandra Datig accused him of abuse. Datig said that Elder had demanded she show devotion by having &quot;Larry&#x27;s Girl&quot; tattooed on herself and, during an argument, brandished a gun threateningly at her while &quot;high&quot; on cannabis. After Datig&#x27;s allegations became public, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; editorial board and fellow candidates Kevin Faulconer and Caitlyn Jenner called for Elder to withdraw from the race. Elder denied Datig&#x27;s accusations and called them &quot;salacious allegations&quot;.

<doc id="442798" wikidata="Q155608" url="?curid=442798" title="Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg">
<text>Charlotte (&quot;Charlotte Adelgonde Elisabeth Marie Wilhelmine&quot;; 23 January 1896 – 9 July 1985) was Grand Duchess of Luxembourg from 14 January 1919 until her abdication on 12 November 1964. Her reign is the longest of any Luxembourgish monarch since 1815 when the country was elevated to a Grand Duchy.

She acceded to the throne on 14 January 1919 following the abdication of her sister, Marie-Adélaïde, due to political pressure over Marie-Adélaïde&#x27;s role during the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I. A referendum retained the monarchy with Charlotte as Grand Duchess regnant.

She married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma on 6 November 1919. They had six children. Following the 1940 German invasion of Luxembourg during World War II, Charlotte went into exile: first in France, then Portugal, Great Britain, and North America. While in Britain, she made broadcasts to the people of Luxembourg. She returned to Luxembourg in April 1945.

She abdicated in 1964, and was succeeded by her son, Jean, later dying from cancer on 9 July 1985. She was the last agnatic member of the House of Nassau, and the last personal recipient of the Golden Rose. Since her death, there are no living personal recipients of that honour, which in modern times has been awarded by the Pope only to churches and shrines. She is to date the most recent Grand Duchess of Luxembourg in her own right.

==Early life and tenure as Grand Duchess==

Born in Berg Castle, Charlotte of Nassau-Weilburg, Princess of Luxembourg, was the second daughter of Grand Duke William IV and his wife, Marie Anne of Portugal.

Her older sister, Marie-Adélaide, had succeeded their father. However, Marie-Adélaïde&#x27;s actions had become controversial, and she was seen as sympathetic to the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I. There were calls in parliament for her abdication, and she was forced to abdicate in favour of Charlotte on 14 January 1919.

Luxembourg adopted a new constitution that year. In a referendum on 28 September 1919, 77.8% of the Luxembourgish people voted for the continuation of the monarchy with Grand Duchess Charlotte as head of state. However, in the new constitution, the powers of the monarch were severely restricted, thus codifying actual practices dating from the end of the personal union with the Netherlands in 1890.

==Reign==
By 1935, Charlotte had sold her German properties, the former residential palaces of the Dukes of Nassau, Biebrich Palace and Schloss Weilburg, to the State of Prussia. During World War II the grand ducal family left Luxembourg shortly before the arrival of Nazi troops. Luxembourg&#x27;s neutrality was violated on 9 May 1940, while the Grand Duchess and her family were in residence at Colmar-Berg. That day she called an extraordinary meeting of her leading ministers, and they all decided to place themselves under the protection of France, described by the Grand Duchess as a difficult but necessary decision. Initially the family took up residence at the Château de Montastruc in south-western France, but the rapid advance of the German forces into France followed by French capitulation the next month caused the French government to refuse any guarantee of security to the exiled Luxembourg government. Permission was received to cross Spain provided they did not stop &quot;en route&quot;, and the Grand Duchess with her ministers moved on to Portugal.

The Germans proposed to restore the Grand Duchess to her functions, but Charlotte refused, mindful of her sister&#x27;s experiences of remaining in Luxembourg under German occupation during the First World War. By 29 August 1940 Grand Duchess Charlotte was in London where she began to make supportive broadcasts to her homeland using the BBC. Later she travelled to the United States and to Canada. Her children continued their schooling in Montreal while she had several meetings with President Roosevelt who encouraged her itinerant campaigning across the country in support of his own opposition to isolationism which was a powerful political current until the Pearl Harbor attacks. In the meantime Luxembourg, along with the adjacent French Moselle department, found itself integrated into an expanded Germany under the name &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot;, which left Luxembourgers required to speak German and liable for conscription into the German army.

In 1943 Grand Duchess Charlotte and the Luxembourg government established themselves in London: her broadcasts became a more regular feature of the BBC schedules, establishing her as a focus for the resistance movements in Luxembourg.

Charlotte&#x27;s younger sister Antonia and brother-in-law Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, were exiled from Germany in 1939. In 1944, living now in Hungary, Crown Princess Antonia was captured when the Germans invaded Hungary and found herself deported to the concentration camp at Dachau, being later transferred to Flossenbürg where she survived torture but only with her health badly impaired. Meanwhile, from 1942 Grand Duchess Charlotte&#x27;s eldest son, Jean, served as a volunteer in the British Army&#x27;s Irish Guards, after the war becoming its Honorary Colonel-in-chief (1984-2000).

In the years after the war, Charlotte showed a lot of public activity which contributed to raising Luxembourg&#x27;s profile on the international stage, by hosting visits from foreign heads of state and other dignitaries, such as Eleanor Roosevelt (1950), Queen Juliana of the Netherlands (1951), René Coty (1957), King Baudouin of Belgium (1959), King Bhumibol of Thailand (1961), and King Olav V of Norway (1964). Likewise, she visited Pope Pius XII (1950), Charles de Gaulle (1961), and John F. Kennedy (1963). Together with her husband and their children Jean and Elisabeth, she took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

In 1951 Charlotte and her prime minister Pierre Dupong admitted by decree three Swedish relatives into the nobility of Luxembourg who were not allowed to use their birth titles in Sweden. They were then named as Sigvard Prince Bernadotte, Carl Johan Prince Bernadotte and Lennart Prince Bernadotte and also, with their legitimate descendants, were given the hereditary titles of Counts and Countesses of Wisborg there.

==Abdication and later life==
On 12 November 1964, she abdicated in favour of her son Jean, who then reigned until his abdication in 2000.

Charlotte died at Schloss Fischbach on 9 July 1985, from cancer. She was interred in the Ducal Crypt of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in the city of Luxembourg.

A statue of the Grand Duchess is in Place Clarefontaine in the city of Luxembourg.

==Marriage and children==
On 6 November 1919 in Luxembourg, she married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, a first cousin on her mother&#x27;s side. (Both Charlotte and Felix were grandchildren of King Miguel of Portugal, through his daughters Maria Anna and Maria Antonia, respectively). With the marriage, their lineal descent was raised in style from Grand Ducal Highness to Royal Highness.

The couple had six children: 
* Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (1921–2019), who married HRH Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium (1927–2005) and had issue. 
* Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg (1922–2011), who married HSH Franz, Duke of Hohenberg (1927–1977) and had issue. 
* Princess Marie Adelaide of Luxembourg (1924–2007), who married Count Karl Josef Henckel von Donnersmarck (1928–2008) and had issue. 
* Princess Marie Gabrielle of Luxembourg (1925–2023), who married Knud Johan, Count of Holstein-Ledreborg (1919–2001) and had issue. 
* Prince Charles of Luxembourg (1927–1977), who married Joan Douglas Dillon (born 1935), the former wife of James Brady Moseley, and had issue. 
* Princess Alix of Luxembourg (1929–2019), who married HH Antoine, 13th Prince of Ligne (1925–2005), and had issue.

<text>Adobe Audition is a digital audio workstation developed by Adobe Inc. featuring both a multitrack, non-destructive mix/edit environment and a destructive-approach waveform editing view.

==Origins==
Syntrillium Software was founded in the early 1990s by Robert Ellison and David Johnston, both former Microsoft employees. , an audio editing program distributed as crippleware for Windows computers, was among Syntrillium&#x27;s early offerings. By 1999, the program had matured into its final two versions: Cool Edit 2000, for ordinary users, and Cool Edit Pro, for audio editing professionals. Both drew very positive reviews.

 offered the capability to work with multiple tracks as well as other features. Audio processing, however, was done in a destructive manner. (At the time, few computers had sufficient processor power and memory capacity to perform non-destructive operations in real time.) Cool Edit Pro v2 added support for real-time non-destructive processing, and v2.1 added support for surround sound mixing and unlimited simultaneous tracks (up to the limit imposed by the computer hardware). Cool Edit 2000 and Pro also included plugins such as noise reduction and FFT equalization.

From the beginning, consumer and professional versions of Cool Edit supported numerous import/export codecs for various audio file formats. When MP3 became popular, Cool Edit licensed and integrated the original Fraunhofer MP3 encoder. The software had an SDK and supported codec plugins (FLT filters). The developer community wrote a wide range of import/export format plugins to open and save in a number of audio compression formats. Popular audio formats and containers supported by Cool Edit with built-in codecs or plugins included Fraunhofer MP3, LAME MP3, Dolby AC3, DTS, ACM Waveform, PCM waveform, AIFF, AU, CDA, MPEG-1 Audio, MPEG-2 Audio, AAC, HE-AAC, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, True Audio, WavPack, QuickTime MOV and MP4 (import only), ADPCM, RealMedia, WMA Standard, WMA Professional, WMA Lossless and WMA Multichannel.

Adobe purchased Syntrillium&#x27;s technology assets, including Cool Edit, in May 2003 for $16.5 million, as well as a large loop library called &quot;Loopology.&quot; Adobe then renamed Cool Edit Pro to &quot;Adobe Audition&quot; and terminated Cool Edit 2000.

==Version==

===Version 1===
Adobe Audition was released on August 18, 2003. It had bug fixes but no new features and was essentially a more polished Cool Edit Pro 2.1 under a different name. Adobe then released Audition v1.5 in May 2004; major improvements over v1 included pitch correction, frequency space editing, a CD project view, basic video editing and integration with Adobe Premiere, as well as several other enhancements.

===Version 2===
Adobe Audition 2 was released on January 17, 2006. With this release, Audition (which the music recording industry had once seen as a value-oriented home studio application, although it has long been used for editing by radio stations) entered the professional digital audio workstation market. The current version included two sections. Multitrack View supported up to 128 digital audio mono or stereo tracks at up to 32-bit resolution. In the track controls section one could select the input and output for each track (the program supported multiple multi-channel sound cards), select &quot;record&quot;, &quot;solo&quot;, and &quot;mute&quot;, and access the effects rack. New features included Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) support, VST (Virtual Studio Technology) support, new mastering tools (many provided by iZotope), and a redesigned UI. Adobe also included Audition 2.0 as part of its Adobe Production Studio bundle.

===Version 3===
Adobe Audition 3 was released on November 8, 2007. New features included VSTi (virtual instrument) support, enhanced spectral editing, a redesigned multi-track interface, new effects, and a collection of royalty-free loops.

CS2 activation servers&#x27; shutdown: Adobe Audition 3, with some other CS2 products, was released with an official serial number, due to the technical glitch in Adobe&#x27;s CS2 activation servers (see Creative Suite 1 &amp; 2).

===Version 4 (CS5.5)===
Audition 4, also known as Audition CS5.5, was released on April 11, 2011, as part of Adobe Creative Suite. Audition 4 was shipped as part of the Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Master Collection and Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Production Premium, replacing the discontinued Adobe Soundbooth. Audition 4 was also made available as a standalone product. Enhanced integration with Adobe Premiere Pro allowed editing of multitrack Premiere projects, and users of third-party software were served by the introduction of OMF- and XML-based import-export functions. Other new features included improved 5.1 multichannel support, new effects (DeHummer, DeEsser, Speech Volume Leveler, and Surround Reverb), a history panel, faster and fully supported real-time FFT analysis, and a new audio engine (more reliable and faster) for non-ASIO devices.

According to Adobe, Audition CS5.5 was rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of parallel/batch processing for performance and make it a platform-agnostic product. Audition CS5.5 now works on Windows and Mac platforms. Over 15 years of C++ code was analyzed, and many features of the previous Audition 3 were ported or enhanced. Notable features that were present in Audition 3, but removed for CS5.5, include VSTi support and MIDI sequencing. Unlike all the previous versions, this is the first release to be available as a Mac version as well as a Windows version. Many other features from previous Windows versions of Adobe Audition, such as FLT filters, DirectX effects, clip grouping, many effects (Dynamic EQ, Stereo Expander, Echo Chamber, Convolution, Scientific filters, etc.) were removed as the product was rewritten to have identical cross-platform features for Windows and macOS. Some of the features were later restored in Audition CS6 but the wide range of audio codec compression/decoding filters for import/export of various audio file formats were discontinued.

===Version 5 (CS6)===
Adobe showed a sneak preview of Audition CS6 in March 2012 highlighting clip grouping and automatic speech alignment (which had its technology previewed in September 2011).
Audition CS6 was released on April 23, 2012, as part of both Creative Suite 6 Master Collection and Creative Suite 6 Production Premium. It included faster and more precise editing, real-time clip stretching, automatic speech alignment, EUCON and Mackie control surface support, parameter automation, more powerful pitch correction, HD video playback, new effects, and more features.

===Version 6 (CC)===
Adobe Audition 6, also more commonly known as Audition CC, was released on June 17, 2013. It is the first in the Audition line to be part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. Also, Audition CC is now the first 64-bit application in the Audition line. This can provide faster processing time when compared to Audition CS6. New features include sound remover, preview editor, and pitch bender.

<doc id="442806" wikidata="Q568755" url="?curid=442806" title="Osmeriformes">
<text>The Osmeriformes are an order of ray-finned fish that includes the true or freshwater smelts and allies, such as the galaxiids and noodlefishes; they are also collectively called osmeriforms. They belong to the teleost superorder Protacanthopterygii, which also includes pike and salmon, among others. The order&#x27;s name means &quot;smelt-shaped&quot;, from &quot;Osmerus&quot; (the type genus) + the standard fish order suffix &quot;-formes&quot;. It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek &quot;osmé&quot; (ὀσμή, &quot;pungent smell&quot;) + Latin &quot;forma&quot; (&quot;external form&quot;), the former in reference to the characteristic aroma of the flesh of &quot;Osmerus&quot;.

In the classification used here, the order Osmeriformes contains two suborders, six families, some 20 genera, and about 93 species. Other authors choose a slightly different arrangement, but whether treated as suborders (Galaxoidei and Osmeroidei) or superfamilies (Galaxoidea and Osmeroidea), the division in two lineages is generally maintained.

The &quot;marine&quot; smelts and allies (e.g. the odd-looking barreleyes) were formerly included here as suborder Argentinoidei; they are now usually considered more distantly related than it was believed and treated as order Argentiniformes. When the marine smelts were included here, the subdivisions of the Osmeriformes were down-ranked by one.

==Description and ecology==
Osmeriformes are small to mid-sized slender fish. Their maxilla is usually included in the mouth&#x27;s gape, and most of them have an adipose fin as is often found in the Protacanthopterygii. Their [pterosphenoid] usually has a ventral flange, and the vomer has a short posterior shaft. They have reduced or even missing articular and mesopterygoid teeth, and the basisphenoid and orbitosphenoid bones are entirely absent. Their scales lack radii.

Despite the term &quot;freshwater smelts&quot;, the members of the Osmeriformes are generally marine, or amphidromous or anadromous migrants. Even the sedentary freshwater species in this family are usually tolerant of considerable changes in salinity. Almost all osmeriforms spawn in fresh water, thus the marine species are generally anadromous. They are found in temperate oceans worldwide and in temperate freshwater of the Holarctic and around the South Pacific region; only a handful of species occur in tropical waters. The eggs are surrounded by an adhesive membrane.

==Systematics==
With the Argentiniformes separated as a distinct order, the remaining Osmeriformes appear to be a monophyletic group. Their placement in the Protacanthopterygii is not entirely clear, but may well be the closest living relatives of the Esociformes (pikes and mudminnows). Others consider them closer to the Salmoniformes (trouts, salmons and relatives). A closer relationship to the Stomiiformes than previously assumed is supported by anatomical and DNA sequence data. But this can be simply taken to suggest that the superorder &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; ought to be included in the Protacanthopterygii, rather than a particularly close relationship between the two orders.
The classification of the Osmeriformes as approached here is:
* Family †Spaniodontidae 
* Suborder Retropinnoidei
** Family Retropinnidae (Australian-New Zealand smelts and graylings)
* Suborder Osmeroidei
** Family Osmeridae (freshwater smelts, typical smelts)
** Family Plecoglossidae (Ayu)
** Family Salangidae (noodlefishes, &quot;icefish&quot;)

A possible fossil osmeriform is &quot;Spaniodon&quot;, a piscivore from Late Cretaceous seas. The group originated probably somewhat earlier, but a Cretaceous age maybe about 110 million years ago or so is likely. The oldest definite osmeriform is &quot;Speirsaenigma&quot; from the Paleocene of Alberta, Canada, which was a relative of the modern ayu fish and appears to have been a freshwater species. The families Galaxiidae and Lepidogalaxiidae were at one time placed together with Retropinnidae in the sub order Galaxoidei, however with new molecular studies they have been elevated to the ordinal level.

<text>&quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers (also known as the DDG 280 class or ambiguously as the Tribal class) were a class of four helicopter-carrying, guided missile destroyers of the Royal Canadian Navy. The ships were named to honour the First Nations of Canada.

The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class are notable as the first all-gas turbine powered ships of this type. Launched in the 1970s, they were originally fitted out for anti-submarine warfare, using two CH-124 Sea King helicopters and other weapons, while their Mk III RIM-7 Sea Sparrow anti-air missiles were sufficient only for point defense. A major upgrade programme in the 1990s overhauled them for area-wide anti-aircraft warfare with the installation of a vertical launch system for Standard SM-2MR Block IIIA missiles.

Due to their extended service lives, the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers were used in a variety of operational roles. They served as flagships for NATO&#x27;s maritime force, deployed as part of United Nations and NATO forces in the Adriatic, Arabian and Caribbean seas and Atlantic and Indian oceans. The destroyers also performed coastal security patrols and search and rescue missions nearer to Canada.

One was sunk in a live-fire exercise in 2007, two more were decommissioned in 2015 and the last in 2017.

==Background==
With the disbandment of Banshee fighter aircraft squadrons and the retirement of the Second World War-vintage destroyers in the early 1960s, the Royal Canadian Navy no longer had air cover nor fire support capabilities. The Royal Canadian Navy sought to fulfill both these capabilities with the General Purpose Frigate (GPF) design. However, due to rising costs and an ambitious Defence Minister, Paul Hellyer, who had his own ideas as to where the Royal Canadian Navy should spend its money, the GPF program was cancelled on 24 October 1963.

After the cancellation of the GPF program, the Royal Canadian Navy continued to design a vessel able to fulfill the lost capabilities. Several designs were drawn up, one of which was an improved version of the GPF with a better missile system, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) rocket and large calibre gun. In September 1964, Hellyer ordered an ASW design. The Royal Canadian Navy submitted a design that matched what Hellyer required that used steam turbines instead of gas and had a planned cost of $35 million, similar to the most recent ships constructed based on the .

On 22 December 1964, Hellyer announced the planned construction of four new helicopter-carrying destroyer escorts as part of a larger package of procurement for the navy. Though the Royal Canadian Navy had submitted an ASW design, it took a further four years to settle on a final one. This was due in large part to the need for the accommodation of large helicopters, variable depth sonar and the requirement to spread the industrial benefits around the country. In the end the design improved over the GPF in several ways. Instead of the twin semi-automatic gun mount, the new design had a single fully automatic 5-inch gun. The GPF was intended to be armed with the RIM-24 Tartar missile system. The new design ended up with the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile system which was capable of taking on both missiles and aircraft. Personnel for the new class were to come from the discarded aircraft carrier which had been taken out of service after the government reduced force levels. In December 1967, four new helicopter-carrying destroyers were announced as part of the five-year equipment program.

In 1968, contracts were awarded to Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec and Marine Industries at Sorel, Quebec. However, the final drawings were not finished when all four ships were laid down in 1969. The entire program ended up costing $252 million. In 1970, the program was almost cancelled despite the fact that the ships were in production. This was due to the poor management of the program costs by the departments that governed the project. This eventually led to a significant reshuffling of senior positions at National Defence Headquarters. Commissioned in 1972–73, the ships perpetuated the names of Second World War-era destroyers, which led to the new class being referred to as the Tribal class.

With the arrival of the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers, a special service centre was created ashore with the same computer system, which was far more advanced at the time compared to anything else in the navy.

==Description==
The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class were ordered in 1968 as a revised design of the GPF. Designed with enclosed citadel, bridge and machinery spaces, the sources disagree about the general description of the &quot;Iroquois&quot; class. Gardiner and Chumbley state that as designed the ships had a displacement of fully loaded. The destroyers were long overall and long at the waterline with a beam of and a draught of . They had a complement of 258 and 30 aircrew attached to the ship&#x27;s company.

Macpherson and Barrie claim that the class displaced , was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . They state the vessels had a maximum speed of and had a complement of 244.

The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class used a two shaft COGOG system that was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney FT4A2 gas turbines creating and two Pratt &amp; Whitney FT12AH3 cruising gas turbines creating . This gave the destroyers a maximum speed of and a range of at .

The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class was also designed with the ability to carry two Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King helicopters to be used primarily for ASW. These two helicopters enhanced their ASW capability and the &quot;Iroquois&quot; class were considered excellent ASW ships due to it. The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class had a landing platform with a double hauldown and Beartrap hauldown device. The platform was large enough for a Mil Mi-14 helicopter, as it was proved during exercises in 1999 in the Baltic Sea. American and British destroyers and frigates at the time each carried a single small helicopter which was incapable of operating independently of the ship&#x27;s sensors, and were effectively a system for extending the range of the weapons by carrying them away from the ship before launch. In contrast, the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers&#x27; much larger Sea Kings were able to carry a complete sensor suite and operate at much longer ranges independently of the launch ship. This allowed a single &quot;Iroquois&quot; to control a much larger area of the ocean, using both its own sensors and those of its helicopters, combining to scan larger areas.

===Armament===
The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class was originally equipped with one OTO Melara /54 calibre gun that was capable of firing 40 rounds per minute.

For anti-air defense the ship was originally armed with one Mk III RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile system. The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class had two Sea Sparrow launchers installed, each with four missiles which allowed the ship to launch eight missiles at a time for point defense. The ships carried a total of 32 missiles. The launchers were located at the forward end of the superstructure and retracted into the deckhouse. The missile system was guided by the Hollandse Signaal Mk 22 Weapon Control System. The system was criticised for the time it took to deploy from the housing, which took several minutes in order to warm-up the guidance system, as well as the reload time, which could be up to almost ten minutes. Another reason for criticism was that the fire control system was Dutch, and the mix of the Dutch fire control and the US missile system rarely worked as intended. The missiles were also ineffective against sea-skimming anti-ship missiles, such as the Exocet.

The &quot;Iroquois&quot; class was also equipped with one Mk 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortar for ASW purposes along with two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes in trainable mounts. The Mk 32 tubes were used to fire Mark 46 torpedoes.

===Systems and sensors===
The class was equipped with the Hollandse Signaal Mk 22 Weapon Control System for its missiles, and a tactical air navigation system (TACAN). The CCS 280 by Litton, which was a compressed version of the Automatic Data Link Plotting System (ADLIPS) electronic tactical system, was also installed aboard the class. &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers were equipped with an LW-03 long range warning radar antenna and SPS-501 long range warning radar. They were also equipped with SPQ-2D low level air search, surface search and navigation and M22 fire control radars. The destroyers had SQS-501 bottom target classification sonar and a hull-mounted SQS-505 sonar inside a dome. They also had the SQS-505 towed variable depth sonar.

==TRUMP refit==
In the 1980s, with the planned arrival of the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, the Canadian Forces intended to convert the &quot;Iroquois&quot; class from primarily ASW ships to anti-air warfare (AAW) vessels as a core element of the modernisation of the fleet. Named the Tribal Refit and Update Modernisation Program (TRUMP), the design contract was awarded to Litton Systems Canada Ltd. and required a total reconstruction of the superstructure, new propulsion, weaponry and electronics. In addition to their conversion to AAW vessels, the Canadian Forces sought to improve their command, control and communications capabilities in order to make them task group leaders.

The shipyard contracts were handed out to Quebec shipyards by the Cabinet as a way to placate the Quebec caucus following the decision to award the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project to a New Brunswick shipyard. The total cost of the program was $1.5 billion.

During the Gulf War, before &quot;Athabaskan&quot; had been able to undergo her TRUMP refit, she was given a Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapons system (CIWS) on her quarterdeck as part of the upgrades given to ships deploying to the Persian Gulf.

===Alterations to initial design===
The displacement of the ships increased to at deep load after all the changes. The propulsion was overhauled also, with two GM Allison 570-KF cruising turbines being installed in place of the Pratt &amp; Whitney FT12AH3 models which created . The funnels were reconstructed replacing the twin outward-angled funnels with one large square funnel. This required the two uptakes being brought together and encased in a forced-air cooling system. This was done to reduce the infrared signature.

As part of the TRUMP refit, the entire armament was overhauled. The OTO Melara 5-inch gun was removed and replaced by a 29-cell Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the SM-2 Block 2 surface-to-air missile. The Mk 41 VLS system was placed in the reconstructed forecastle deck. In &#x27;B&#x27; position an OTO Melara Super Rapid gun was installed in the space vacated by the removal of the Sea Sparrow launchers. A Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS was placed abaft the remodeled funnel. The ships also received new radar and sonar, with new shield decoy launchers, the SLQ-504 Canadian Electronic Warfare System (CANEWS) and ULQ-6 electronic countermeasures.

==Ships in class==
==Service history==
All of the &quot;Iroquois&quot; class was laid down in 1969, &quot;Iroquois&quot; on 15 January, &quot;Huron&quot; and &quot;Athabaskan&quot; on 1 June and &quot;Algonquin&quot; on 1 September. Their names were chosen both to honour the First Nations of Canada, but also to perpetuate the names of destroyers that served during the Second World War. &quot;Iroquois&quot; was the first to commission, on 29 July 1972, followed by &quot;Athabaskan&quot; on 30 September, &quot;Huron&quot; on 16 December and &quot;Algonquin&quot; on 3 November 1973.

By the early 1980s, the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class were the only surface vessels in the Canadian navy that were capable of fighting a modern war. The destroyers underwent the TRUMP modifications beginning in 1987, with &quot;Algonquin&quot; being taken in hand on 26 October to 11 October 1991; &quot;Iroquois&quot;, 1 November 1989 to 3 July 1992; &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, from October 1991 to 3 August 1994; and &quot;Huron&quot;, from July 1993 and 25 November 1994.

From the onset of their careers, the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class ships were deployed to NATO naval missions such as STANAVFORLANT, performing search and rescue missions, such as &quot;Algonquin&quot; rescuing the crew from the fishing vessel &quot;Paul &amp; Maria&quot; in 1974 or &quot;Athabaskan&quot; in 1981 when she sailed to rescue the crew of . They also participated in many major naval exercises.

&quot;Iroquois&quot;, &quot;Huron&quot; and &quot;Algonquin&quot; were all flagships of STANAVFORLANT in 1978–79. In 1986, &quot;Algonquin&quot; captured the renegade fishing vessel &quot;Peonia 7&quot; which had made off with personnel from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. &quot;Peonia 7&quot; had been caught illegally fishing in Canada&#x27;s exclusive economic zone and had been boarded by Fisheries personnel for inspection. In 1987, &quot;Huron&quot; became the first member of the class to transfer to the west coast of Canada. In 1988, while attempting to assist the Belgian frigate &quot;Westhinder&quot; which had already grounded, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; herself went aground in Vestfjord, Norway.

On 24 August 1990, &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, after a refit to add several advanced weapons including a close-in weapon system (CIWS), sailed to the Arabian Sea as flagship of the naval component of Operation Friction, the Canadian contribution to the Gulf War. The task group served in the central Persian Gulf, with other coalition naval forces, through the fall of 1990. After Operation Desert Storm began in January 1991, the task group undertook escort duties for hospital ships and other vulnerable naval vessels of the coalition. When the detonated two Iraqi bottom-moored influence mines (MANTAs) at the north end of the Persian Gulf and was seriously damaged, her commanding officer specifically requested the assistance of &quot;Athabaskan&quot;. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; could simultaneously operate two CH-124 Sea King helicopters, originally for anti-submarine warfare, which proved useful in searching out mines for long periods until a U.S. Navy minesweeper arrived. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; returned to her task group and remained on station in the Persian Gulf until after the war ended. After the hostilities were complete she was relieved by her sister ship &quot;Huron&quot;.

In 1993 &quot;Algonquin&quot; was flagship of the force sent to the Adriatic Sea to enforce the blockade on Yugoslavia. &quot;Iroquois&quot; deployed in September 1993 to the Adriatic to take part in the blockade, returning in April 1994. In August 1994, &quot;Algonquin&quot; transferred to the west coast.

In September 1999, &quot;Huron&quot;, carrying Canadian immigration officials, intercepted a ship trafficking 146 Chinese migrants. Royal Canadian Mounted Police boarded the vessel from &quot;Huron&quot; while the destroyer escorting the vessel into Nootka Sound. On 3 August 2000, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; sent her helicopter to board &quot;GTS Katie&quot;, a cargo vessel carrying Canadian military equipment whose charterer refused to deliver them.

On 17 October 2001, as part of Operation Apollo, &quot;Iroquois&quot; led the Canadian Task Group to the Arabian Sea. Eventually, &quot;Algonquin&quot; and &quot;Athabaskan&quot; also took part in the War in Afghanistan. In 2003, while readying for deployment to Operation Apollo, &quot;Iroquois&quot;″s Sea King crashed on deck and the ship was forced to return to Halifax.

In September 2005, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was among the Canadian ships sent to Louisiana to aid in the recovery efforts following the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. In 2008 &quot;Iroquois&quot; was among the Canadian warships deployed to the waters off Somalia as part of CTF 150, the multi-national task force that concerned itself with drug and people smuggling and piracy in the region.

In 2010, after Haiti was hit by a major earthquake followed by at least twelve significant aftershocks, Canada sent &quot;Athabaskan&quot; and the frigate to Haiti as part of Operation Hestia. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was sent to Leogane. In 2011, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; and &quot;Algonquin&quot; deployed to the Caribbean Sea as part of Operation Caribbe, a counter-narcotics smuggling operation. &quot;Iroquois&quot; deployed in 2012, with &quot;Athabaskan&quot; returning in 2014 and 2015.

===Retirement===
Despite &quot;Huron&quot; being the most recently refitted &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyer, she was placed in mothballed status in 2000, due to a personnel shortage following defence cutbacks during the late 1990s. &quot;Huron&quot; was paid off in 2005, and sunk in a live-fire exercise in 2007 by her sister ship &quot;Algonquin&quot;.

In August 2013, &quot;Algonquin&quot; was involved in a collision with the auxiliary vessel during a naval exercise. &quot;Algonquin&quot; suffered significant damage along her port side hangar. The vessel was laid up following the collision. In May 2014, while visiting Boston, Massachusetts, severe cracks were discovered in the hull of &quot;Iroquois&quot; requiring her immediate return to Canada and lay up for inspection. The inspection determined the hull was compromised and would require the ship to be laid up indefinitely. On 19 September 2014, the Royal Canadian Navy announced that these two ships were to be paid off along with the , leaving only &quot;Athabaskan&quot; active.

On 27 November 2015, &quot;Algonquin&quot;, along with &quot;Protecteur&quot;, was sold to be broken up for scrap to R.J. MacIsaac Ltd. of Antigonish, Nova Scotia. They were towed to Liverpool, Nova Scotia where the work will be done. On 10 March 2017 &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, the last active ship in the class, was decommissioned.

==Replacement==
In 2008 the Single Class Surface Combatant Project which was included in the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy was announced as the replacement for the &quot;Iroquois&quot; class. The new vessels will eventually replace the &quot;Halifax&quot; class, as well as the capabilities previously provided by the &quot;Iroquois&quot; class, beginning in about the mid-2020s. In October 2018, a group led by BAE Systems along with its partners Lockheed Martin Canada, CAE Inc., L3 Technologies, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates and Ultra Electronics, were selected as the preferred design. On 8 February 2019, Canada signed an agreement with Lockheed Martin Canada, BAE Systems, Inc. and Irving Shipbuilding to design and construct the $60 billion Canadian Surface Combatant project.

<doc id="442816" wikidata="Q82575" url="?curid=442816" title="Integrated Taxonomic Information System">
<text>The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) is an American partnership of federal agencies designed to provide consistent and reliable information on the taxonomy of biological species. ITIS was originally formed in 1996 as an interagency group within the US federal government, involving several US federal agencies, and has now become an international body, with Canadian and Mexican government agencies participating. The database draws from a large community of taxonomic experts. Primary content staff are housed at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and IT services are provided by a US Geological Survey facility in Denver. The primary focus of ITIS is North American species, but many biological groups exist worldwide and ITIS collaborates with other agencies to increase its global coverage.

==Reference database==
ITIS provides an automated reference database of scientific and common names for species. it contains over 839,000 scientific names, synonyms, and common names for terrestrial, marine, and freshwater taxa from all biological kingdoms (animals, plants, fungi, and microbes). While the system does focus on North American species at minimum, it also includes many species not found in North America, especially among birds, fishes, amphibians, mammals, bacteria, many reptiles, several plant groups, and many invertebrate animal groups. Data presented in ITIS are considered public information, and may be freely distributed and copied, though appropriate citation is requested. ITIS is frequently used as the &quot;de facto&quot; source of taxonomic data in biodiversity informatics projects.

ITIS couples each scientific name with a stable and unique taxonomic serial number (TSN) as the &quot;common denominator&quot; for accessing information on such issues as invasive species, declining amphibians, migratory birds, fishery stocks, pollinators, agricultural pests, and emerging diseases. It presents the names in a standard classification that contains author, date, distributional, and bibliographic information related to the names. In addition, common names are available through ITIS in the major official languages of the Americas (English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese).

==Catalogue of Life==
ITIS and its international partner, Species 2000, cooperate to annually produce the Catalogue of Life, a checklist and index of the world&#x27;s species. The Catalogue of Life&#x27;s goal was to complete the global checklist of 1.9 million species by 2011. As of May 2012, the Catalogue of Life has reached 1.4 million species—a major milestone in its quest to complete the first up-to-date comprehensive catalogue of all living organisms.

ITIS and the Catalogue of Life are core to the Encyclopedia of Life initiative announced May 2007. EOL will be built largely on various Creative Commons licenses.

==Legacy database==
Of the ~714,000 (May 2016) scientific names in the current database, approximately 210,000 were inherited from the database formerly maintained by the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The newer material has been checked to higher standards of taxonomic credibility, and over half of the original material has been checked and improved to the same standard.

Building on efforts by Richard Swartz, Marvin Wass, and Donald Boesch in 1972 to establish an &quot;intelligent&quot; numeric coding system for taxonomy, the first edition of the NODC Taxonomic Code was published in 1977. Hard copy editions were published until 1984. Subsequent editions were published digitally until 1996. 1996 marked the release of NODC version 8, which served as a bridge to ITIS, which abandoned &quot;intelligent&quot; numeric codes in favor of more stable, but &quot;un-intelligent&quot; Taxonomic Serial Numbers.

==Standards==
Biological taxonomy is not fixed, and opinions about the correct status of taxa at all levels, and their correct placement, are constantly revised as a result of new research. Many aspects of classification remain a matter of scientific judgment. The ITIS database is updated to take account of new research as it becomes available.

Records within ITIS include information about how far it has been possible to check and verify them. Its information should be checked against other sources where these are available, and against the primary research scientific literature where possible.

<doc id="442828" wikidata="Q19793" url="?curid=442828" title="Seesaw">
<text>A seesaw (also known as a teeter-totter) is a long, narrow board supported by a single pivot point, most commonly located at the midpoint between both ends; as one end goes up, the other goes down. These are most commonly found at parks and school playgrounds.

==Mechanics==

Mechanically, a seesaw is a lever which consists of a beam and fulcrum with the effort and load on either side.

==Varieties==
The most common playground design of seesaw features a board balanced in the center. A person sits on each end, and they take turns pushing their feet against the ground to lift their side into the air. Playground seesaws usually have handles for the riders to grip as they sit facing each other. One problem with the seesaw&#x27;s design is that if a child allows himself/herself to hit the ground suddenly after jumping, or exits the seesaw at the bottom, the other child may fall and be injured. For this reason, seesaws are often mounted above a soft surface such as foam, wood chips, or sand.
Seesaws are also manufactured in shapes designed to look like other things, such as airplanes, helicopters, and animals.
Seesaws, and the eagerness of children to play with them, are sometimes used to aid in mechanical processes. For example, at the Gaviotas community in Colombia, a children&#x27;s seesaw is connected to a water pump.

In 2019, a set of seesaws were installed spanning the US-Mexico border fence between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez.

==Name origin and variations==

Seesaws go by several different names around the world. &quot;Seesaw&quot;, or its variant &quot;see-saw&quot;, is a direct Anglicisation of the French &quot;ci-ça&quot;, meaning literally, &quot;this-that&quot;, seemingly attributable to the back-and-forth motion for which a seesaw is known.

The term may also be attributable to the repetitive motion of a saw. It may have its origins in a combination of &quot;scie&quot; – the French word for &quot;saw&quot; with the Anglo-Saxon term &quot;saw&quot;. Thus &quot;scie-saw&quot; became &quot;see-saw&quot;. Another possibility is the situation of the apparent appearance, disappearance, and re-emergence of the person, seated opposite one&#x27;s position, as they, seemingly, &quot;rise&quot; and &quot;fall&quot;, against a changing, oscillating background - therefore: &quot;I see you&quot;, followed by, &quot;I saw you&quot;.

In the northern inland and westernmost region of the United States, a seesaw is also called a &quot;teeter-totter.&quot; According to linguist Peter Trudgill, the term originates from the Norfolk dialect word &quot;tittermatorter&quot;. A &quot;teeter-totter&quot; may also refer to a two-person swing on a swing seat, on which two children sit facing each other and the teeter-totter swings back and forth in a pendulum motion.

Both &quot;teeter-totter&quot; (from &quot;teeter&quot;, as in &quot;to teeter on the edge&quot;) and &quot;seesaw&quot; (from the verb &quot;saw&quot;) demonstrate the linguistic process called reduplication, where a word or syllable is doubled, often with a different vowel. Reduplication is typical of words that indicate repeated activity, such as riding up and down on a seesaw.

In the southeastern New England region of the United States, it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;tilt&quot; or a &quot;tilting board&quot;.

According to Michael Drout, &quot;There are almost no &#x27;Teeter-&#x27; forms in Pennsylvania, and if you go to western West Virginia and down into western North Carolina there is a band of &#x27;Ridey-Horse&#x27; that heads almost straight south. This pattern suggests a New England term that spread down the coast and a separate, Scots-Irish development in Appalachia. &#x27;Hickey-horse&#x27; in the coastal regions of North Carolina is consistent with other linguistic and ethnic variations.&quot;

== Popularity ==
In the early 2000s, seesaws were removed from many playgrounds in the United States, citing safety concerns. However, some people have questioned whether or not the seesaws should have been removed, indicating the fun provided by seesaws may outweigh the safety risk posed using them.

<doc id="442831" wikidata="Q657570" url="?curid=442831" title="Stomiiformes">
<text>Stomiiformes is an order of deep-sea ray-finned fishes of very diverse morphology. It includes, for example, dragonfishes, lightfishes (Gonostomatidae and Phosichthyidae), loosejaws, marine hatchetfishes and viperfishes. The order contains 4 families (5 according to some authors) with more than 50 genera and at least 410 species. As usual for deep-sea fishes, there are few common names for species of the order, but the Stomiiformes as a whole are often called dragonfishes and allies or simply stomiiforms.

The scientific name means &quot;&quot;Stomias&quot;-shaped&quot;, from &quot;Stomias&quot; (the type genus) + the standard fish order suffix &quot;-formes&quot;. It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek &quot;stóma&quot; (στόμᾶ, &quot;mouth&quot;) + Latin &quot;forma&quot; (&quot;external form&quot;), the former in reference to the huge mouth opening of these fishes.

The earliest stomiiform is &quot;Paravinciguerria&quot; from the Cenomanian of Morocco and Italy.

==Description and ecology==
Members of this order are mostly pelagic fishes living in deep oceanic waters. Their distribution around the world&#x27;s oceans is very wide, ranging from subtropical and temperate waters up to subarctic or even Antarctic ones.
The smallest species of this order is the bristlemouth &quot;Cyclothone pygmaea&quot;. Native to the Mediterranean Sea, it reaches just 1.5 cm (0.6 in) as an adult. The largest species is the barbeled dragonfish &quot;Opostomias micripnus&quot;, widely found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and measuring about in adult length.

These fish have a highly unusual and often almost nightmarish appearance. They all have teeth on the premaxilla and maxilla. Their maxillary ligaments, as well as some muscles and certain bones in the branchial cavity, are specialized in a distinctive way. Most have large mouths extending back past the eyes. Some also have a chin barbel. The dorsal and/or pectoral fins are missing in some, but others have an adipose fin. The pelvic fin has 4–9 rays, and the stomiiformes possess 5–24 branchiostegal rays. Their scales are cycloid, delicate and easily sloughed off; some are scaleless. The coloration is typically dark brown or black; a few (mostly Gonostomatoidei) are silver, and photophores (light-producing organs) are common in this order.

The teeth of stomiiformes are often transparent and non-reflective so that prey will be unlikely to see them in the light generated by bioluminescence. Research has revealed that the transparency of the teeth of &quot;Aristostomias scintillans&quot; is due to nanoscale structures composed hydroxyapatite and collagen and a lack dentin tubules, however a study from a decade prior had shown the teeth of &quot;Chauliodus sloani&quot; (which are also transparent) have dentin tubules. The reason behind difference in presence of dentin tubules in two species of the same family (Stomiidae) has yet to be addressed.

As common for deep-sea creatures, all members of Stomiiformes (except one) have photophores, whose structure is characteristic of the order. The light emitted can be more or less strong and its color can be light yellow, white, violet or red. The light coming from these fish is generally invisible to their prey. The lighting mechanism can be very simple – consisting of small gleaming points on the fish body – or very elaborate, involving lenses and refractors.

The most common arrangement is one or two rows of photophores on the ventral aspect of the body. The rows run from the head down to the tip of the tail. Photophores are also present in chin barbels of the family Stomiidae. The light produced in these glandular organs is the product of an enzymatic reaction, a catylization of coelenterazine by calcium ions.

===Daily migration===
During the day, Stomiiformes stay in deep waters. When the sun sets, most of them follow the dimming sunlight up to near-surface waters, which are richer in animal life such as small fishes and planktonic invertebrates. During the night, these Stomiiformes hunt and feed on such organisms, swimming back to deeper waters when the sun rises. They apparently are able to measure the intensity of the sunlight that reaches them. They will thus move to stay always in the zone where light intensity is very low, though it is not entirely dark.

This daily migration is well observed in quite a few species of stomiiforms. However, it is also performed by other fishes, while some larger Stomiiformes – among them the largest predators of the deep sea – stay in their habitat all the time and feed on smaller migrating fish that return from the surface.

===Reproduction===
Stomiiforms spawn generally in deep seas, but the eggs are light and float towards the ocean surface. They hatch in surface waters. When the larvae have completed their metamorphosis and look like adults, they descend to join the main population.

Like many benthic fish species, certain members of the order – especially in the genera &quot;Cyclothone&quot; and &quot;Gonostoma&quot; – change their sex during their life. When they become sexually mature, they are males; later on they transform into females.

==Systematics==
The Stomiiformes are often placed in the teleost superorder Stenopterygii, usually together with the Ateleopodiformes (jellynoses), but sometimes on their own. Whether it is indeed justified to accept such a small group is doubtful; it may well be that the closest living relatives of the &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; are found among the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and that the former would need to be merged in the latter. In some classifications, the &quot;Stenopterygii&quot; are kept separate but included with the Protacanthopterygii and the monotypic superorder Cyclosquamata in an unranked clade called Euteleostei. That would probably require splitting two additional monotypic superorders out of the Protacanthopterygii, and thus result in a profusion of very small taxa.

The Stomiiformes have also been considered close relatives of the Aulopiformes. The latter are otherwise placed in a monotypic superorder &quot;Cyclosquamata&quot; but also appear to be quite close to the Protacanthopterygii indeed. The relationships of these – and the Lampriformes or Myctophiformes, which are also usually treated as monotypic superorders – to the taxa mentioned before is still not well resolved at all, and regardless whether one calls them Protacanthopterygii &quot;sensu lato&quot; or Euteleostei, the phylogeny of this group of moderately-advanced Teleostei is in need of further study.

The ancestral Stomiiformes probably had thin brownish bodies, rows of egg-shaped photophores adorning the lower body parts, and mouths with numerous teeth. From these, two lineages evolved, probably some time during the Late Cretaceous: Among the modern Stomiiformes, the Gonostomatidae and Phosichthyidae are phenetically very similar, but this is due to their being very plesiomorphic and retaining many traits of the original stomiiforms. Each of the two has characteristic synapomorphies with one of the more advanced stomiiform families – the Sternoptychidae and the Stomiidae, respectively. These two, in turn, are highly autapomorphic, and at a casual glance do not look as if they were as closely related to the other stomiiforms as they actually are.

Thus, the classification of the suborders and families of the Stomiiformes is:
* Suborder Gonostomatoidei
** Family Gonostomatidae – bristlemouths, anglemouths, &quot;lightfishes&quot; (including Diplophidae)
** Family Sternoptychidae – marine hatchetfishes, bottlelights, constellationfishes, pearlsides
* Suborder Stomioidei
** Family Phosichthyidae – lightfishes
** Family Stomiidae – barbeled dragonfishes, loosejaws, stareaters

<doc id="442836" wikidata="Q6942035" url="?curid=442836" title="Music of Canada's Prairie Provinces">
<text>The music of the Canadian Prairies includes the music of the Prairie Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

The city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, is considered a musical center of this region, having produced artists like Neil Young, The Guess Who, Bachman–Turner Overdrive, Crash Test Dummies, and many others. Country music is also popular in all three provinces. The Western Canadian Music Awards have been created to showcase artists from these provinces (along with British Columbia, Yukon Territory, and Northwest Territories). 

==Popular music==
Singer-songwriters from the region include Bob Nolan, Daniel Lavoie, Jann Arden, Ruth B., Tom Cochrane, Burton Cummings, Mac DeMarco, Feist, Carolyn Dawn Johnson, Chantal Kreviazuk, Connie Kaldor, k.d. lang, Tate McRae, Joni Mitchell, Tegan and Sara, Ian Tyson, William Prince, Fred Penner, Colter Wall, and Neil Young.

Rock groups include The Guess Who, Bachman Turner Overdrive, The Stampeders, Loverboy, Nickelback, Crash Test Dummies, The Sheepdogs, The Watchmen, The Weakerthans, and Wide Mouth Mason.

==Classical music==

Active orchestras include the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, Red Deer Symphony, Regina Symphony Orchestra, Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra, Saskatoon Youth Orchestra, and Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. The CBC Winnipeg Orchestra was active from 1947 until 1984. The region is also home to opera and ballet companies including the notable Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Canada&#x27;s oldest.

==Jazz==

Canada&#x27;s first jazz concert was in 1914 at the Pantages Playhouse Theatre in Winnipeg. Notable jazz musicians from the Prairie provinces include Manitoba&#x27;s Fraser MacPherson, Lenny Breau and Ed Bickert and Alberta&#x27;s Eleanor Collins.

==Folk and regional music==

The &quot;Rough Guide to World Music&quot; notes that in the Prairie Provinces, &quot;no Ukrainian wedding band is complete without a tsymbaly, and a small local recording industry there continues to produce cassettes of hybrid &quot;troista-country&quot; bands&quot; (emphasis in original). Ukrainian influences on the music can be seen in modern English-language polka numbers like &quot;Giants of the Prairies&quot; by the Kubasonics.

Folk performers include Oscar Brand, Don Freed, Hart-Rouge, Andrea Menard, and The Wailin&#x27; Jennys.

<text>Gloucester ( ) is a former municipality and now geographic area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Located east of Ottawa&#x27;s inner core, it was an independent city until amalgamated with the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton in 2001 to become the new city of Ottawa. The population of Gloucester is about 150,012 people (2021 Census).

==History==
Gloucester, originally known as Township B, was established in 1792. The first settler in the township was Braddish Billings in what is now the Billings Bridge area of Ottawa. In 1800, the township became part of Russell County, and later Carleton County in 1838. In 1850, the area was incorporated as Gloucester Township, named after Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh. Over the years, parts of Gloucester Township were annexed by the expanding city of Ottawa. Gloucester was incorporated as a city in 1981 and became part of the amalgamated city of Ottawa in 2001.

===Town Halls===
1872–1962: Bank Street in Billings Bridge&lt;br&gt;1962–1996: Bank Street in Leitrim&lt;br&gt;1996–2001: Telesat Court in Pineview

==Education==
Anglophone secular public schools are operated by the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. Anglophone Catholic public schools are operated by the Ottawa Catholic School Board. French secular public schools are operated by the &quot;Conseil des écoles publiques de l&#x27;Est de l&#x27;Ontario&quot; (CÉPEO). The &quot;Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est&quot; (CECCE), formerly known as the &quot;Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française du Centre-Est&quot; (CECLFCE), operates the French Catholic public schools.

The CECCE has its headquarters in Gloucester. The predecessor school district, the &quot;Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française de la région d&#x27;Ottawa-Carleton&quot; (CECLF), had its headquarters in the current CECCE headquarters.

Collège La Cité is the only post-secondary institution in Gloucester.

<doc id="442848" wikidata="Q3642413" url="?curid=442848" title="Border reivers">
<text>Border Reivers were raiders along the Anglo-Scottish border. They included both Scottish and English people, and they raided the entire border country without regard to their victims&#x27; nationality. They operated in a culture of legalised raiding and feuding. Their heyday was in the last hundred years of their existence, during the time of the House of Stuart in the Kingdom of Scotland and the House of Tudor in the Kingdom of England.

The term &quot;Border Reiver&quot; is an exonym and anachronistic term used to describe the raiders and bandits who operated along the Anglo-Scottish Border during the late Middle Ages and early modern period. The reivers, as we understand today, emerged in textual and archaeological evidence sometime between 1350 and 1450, with their activities reaching their height in the 16th century during the Tudor period in England and the late Stewart period in Scotland. They were infamous for raiding, eliciting protection money or taking hostages(&#x27;blackmail&#x27;), cattle rustling, and lawlessness, often operating within a framework of legally sanctioned violence. Many crimes, such as theft and feuding, were treated with less severity due to the ancient customs and culture of the Borderlands, which had evolved over centuries to tolerate and even codify such practices.

Although less well-known than Highlanders in Scotland—whom they met and defeated in battle on occasion— the Border Reivers played a significant role in shaping Anglo-Scottish relations. Their activities were a major factor in ongoing tensions between the two kingdoms, and their raids often had international repercussions. There is an emerging historical debate over how great their threat and the extent to which their raids were state-directed rather than purely opportunistic. 

The culture of the Border Reivers—characterised by honour, close family bonds, and self-defence—has been said to influence the culture of the Upland South in the United States. Many Borderers migrated as families to America, where their values are thought to have contributed significantly to the region&#x27;s social structure and political ideologies, with echoes of their influence persisting even today.

==The etymology of &quot;Border Reiver&quot;==
&quot;Reive&quot;, a noun meaning raid, comes from the Middle English (Scots) &quot;reifen.&quot; The verb &quot;reave&quot; meaning &quot;plunder, rob&quot;, a closely related word, comes from the Middle English &quot;reven&quot;. There also exists a Northumbrian and Scots verb &quot;reifen&quot;. All three derive from Old English &quot;rēafian&quot; which means &quot;to rob, plunder, pillage&quot;. Variants of these words were used in the Borders in the later Middle Ages. The corresponding verb in Dutch is &quot;(be)roven&quot;, and &quot;(be)rauben&quot; in German.

The earliest use of the combined term &quot;border reiver&quot; appears to be by Sir Walter Scott in his anthology &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;. George Ridpath (1716?–1772), the author of posthumously published &quot;The Border-History of England and Scotland, deduced from the earliest times to the union of the two crowns&quot; (London, 1776), referred not to &#x27;border reivers&#x27; but only to &quot;banditti&quot;.

==Background==
===Governance, culture and territorality of the Anglo-Scottish frontier===

The Anglo-Scottish borders were shaped by centuries of territorial disputes, cultural integration, and overlapping systems of governance, resulting in one of the most administratively complex regions of medieval Britain. 

The traditional narrative places the Battle of Carham in 1018 as a pivotal moment when Scottish forces secured control over Lothian, marking a fundamental shift in the northern boundary of England. However, this interpretation is subject to debate. Some historians question whether the &#x27;loss&#x27; of Lothian to Scotland can be definitively dated to 1018, with a range of alternative timelines proposed.

Contemporary evidence suggests the gradual establishment of Scottish authority over the Borders, marked by the consolidation of continuous royal control around the same time as the Norman Conquest, West Lothian and Midlothian likely dates between Máel Coluim III’s accession in 1058 and the death of his son Edgar in 1107. East Lothian saw consolidation under Máel Coluim III by 1093, with Edgar firmly establishing authority by 1107. Berwickshire (Merse) was under Máel Coluim III’s rule, with Edgar solidifying control around 1100. Teviotdale (Roxburghshire) and Tweeddale fell under continuous Scottish control from 1113 during David I’s tenure. Annandale came under Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale between 1113 and 1124 as a vassal of David I, having been conferred upon him by Henry I of England.

Further enterprising and independent Norman lordships lay in South West Scotland at the freyed western end of the Borders. This period also saw the Normanisation of the Scottish nobility, as Norman lords, brought in by David I of Scotland, introduced new complexities of Anglo-French colonisation in the Borderlands. Many of these lords held land in England and brought in Anglo-Saxon tenants from their estates south of the border.

Concurrently, south of the Tweed, including parts of Tweeddale, it is not entirely clear when the former territories of the Earldom of Bamburgh fell following William I’s successful invasion of England. However, there are strong indications that the area north of the Tyne remained outside effective Norman control until at least 1090s,with evidence suggesting the persistence of an independent Anglian polity or organised resistance until the early 12th century.

Following the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Scottish border in the west remained ambiguous. William Rufus in 1090 expelled Dolfin of Carlisle, a possible descendant of the Anglo-Saxon Earls of Northumbria, from Cumberland and fortified Carlisle to secure the region. It is also suggested that Dolfin may have been installed by Máel Coluim III.

However, during the period of civil war known as The Anarchy (1135–1153), David I of Scotland exploited the instability and advanced southward into northern England. In the Second Treaty of Durham (1139), King Stephen granted the Earldom of Northumbria—encompassing Carlisle, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire north of the Ribble—to David&#x27;s son, Prince Henry. These territories were later reclaimed, and David&#x27;s successor, Malcolm IV, was forced to cede them. Since then, the Anglo-Scottish border has remained largely unchanged, with only minor adjustments. 

The Anglo-Scottish Border only began to formalise by 1237 in the Treaty of York.

====Complex and dual identities====
Land ownership and governance in the Anglo-Scottish border region during the 12th and 13th centuries were shaped by a highly mixed population, but the ruling elite was predominantly composed of Norman, Flemish, and Breton incomers. 

These newcomers were granted lands and titles as knights or lords, establishing castles and controlling large demesnes. Some of these demesnes crossed the unclear boundary between England and Scotland during the War of Scottish Independence, and this later contributed to tensions and disputes over land ownership and jurisdiction. The Borderlands were home to a diverse mix of peoples and languages, with Early Scots and Northumbrians in the east, Norse settlers in Cumbria, Brythonic-speaking communities in the west until the 12th century, and Gaelic speakers in the far southwest of Scotland. Despite this cultural and linguistic variety, governance was largely in the hands of a newly established ruling class. 

The integration of these groups under predominantly Norman, Flemish, and Breton lords across the border introduced a dual identity and a new layer of governance that often clashed with local traditions, further complicating loyalties and creating a fragmented political landscape. The unique March Law can be seen as an example of a distinct regional culture, different from both England and Scotland. This dual identity was further evident in the case of groups like the Armstrongs of Liddesdale, a Scottish clan who had settled in the region from England during the 13th and 14th centuries. Known for their independent and often lawless ways, they were referred to as &quot;Evil Inglis&quot; well into the 16th century, reflecting both their English origins and their feared reputation in Scottish border society.

Alexander Mason&#x27;s case exemplifies the complexities of nationality and jurisdiction in the Anglo-Scottish borderlands. In 1441, Mason—a Scot who sometimes resided in Northumberland—was accused of murdering Lawrence Grey in England. His dual identity led to prolonged legal complications, and in 1449 he ultimately secured a royal pardon by swearing allegiance to the English crown. 

The Wars of Scottish Independence played a key role in this transformation of the Borders, fostering and forcing a growing sense of national belonging that extended across social, cultural and linguistic groups. However, alongside this burgeoning national identity, a shared border identity also emerged, rooted in the unique cultural and legal practices of the region. This shared identity coexisted with a lingering sense of Otherness, as the borders remained distinct from the centralised identities of both nations, shaped by their unique history and violent reputation, and the persistent influence of local loyalties. This shared Border identity and feelings of Otherness persisted throughout the 16th century. According to late Tudor estimates, Scots comprised a third of those living within ten miles of the frontier.

====Disputed territory====
Efforts to define the Anglo-Scottish border often proved contentious and inconclusive. By 1245, territorial disputes remained unresolved, as demonstrated in a case involving Hugh de Bolbec, a Northumbrian knight. A meeting near Carham on the Tweed attempted to establish &quot;the true and ancient marches between the two kingdoms&quot;. Six knights from each side were appointed to walk the border line, but the Scottish and English representatives disagreed at every step. A second attempt expanded the parties to twelve knights per side, with additional servants and men-at-arms processing through the Tweed Valley, but it too ended without agreement.

A third effort involved 48 knights, who swore an oath to trace the border. The English knights proposed a line running from the confluence of Reddenburn and the Tweed, south to Tres Karras and Hopperichlawe (now lost), and then to Whitelaw Hill in the Cheviot Hills. However, the Scottish knights opposed this perambulation with threats, and tensions escalated. Lacking further resources to continue, the English knights unilaterally declared the defined line to be &quot;the true and ancient marches and divisions&quot;, despite the lack of mutual agreement.

Throughout the period, various territories remained disputed due to unresolved claims, particularly lands referred to as &quot;threiplands&quot; (Scots for &quot;disputed lands&quot;). While many of these areas were smaller tracts of contested ground, some, like the Debatable Lands, were far more significant. This expansive area, which lay between the rivers Esk and Sark, was the subject of contention until 1552, when its status was finally settled. Originally referred to as the &quot;Batable Land&quot;—a term derived from its use as fertile grazing ground—the territory was notable for an agreement allowing both English and Scottish borderers to graze cattle during the day, despite prohibitions on permanent settlement.

Berwick-upon-Tweed, a strategically important town on the Anglo-Scottish border, changed hands multiple times during the medieval period, reflecting its contested status between England and Scotland. The town was alternately controlled by each kingdom, with significant captures in 1174, 1296, and 1318, among others. Its turbulent history culminated in 1482 when it was seized by Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III), and thereafter remained under English administration. Berwick&#x27;s frequent exchanges highlight its role as both a prize of war and a continued focal point of Anglo-Scottish tensions.

The Anglo-Scottish border was not fully demarcated until the mid-19th century, when the Ordnance Survey mapped the area in detail. Even as late as this period, some lands, such as Kirkholm Common, were still considered by locals to be threipland. Locals regarded it as shared communal ground, with its historical status as contested land lingering in local tradition.

Other disputed areas were resolved through less formal means. The Ba Green (or Ba&#x27; Green or Ball Green) near Wark and Coldstream, a Scottish tract of land that curiously lies on the English side of the River Tweed, is one such example. This threipland became the subject of an annual game of football, whose result determined temporary control of the land. Over time, Coldstream&#x27;s growing population allowed it to field far more players than Wark, leading to the land being informally absorbed into Scotland.

==== Overlapping powers: judicial, religious, and secular authority ====

The Anglo-Scottish Borders were marked by overlapping systems of administration and law, creating a patchwork of competing jurisdictions. On the English side, noble families, ecclesiastical authorities, and state officials held varying degrees of power, often clashing over jurisdiction. Secular liberties like Tynedale and Redesdale operated semi-independently, granting local lords significant autonomy to enforce laws and defend their territories. Robert de Umfraville, also known as &quot;Robert with the Beard,&quot; was granted the newly established Liberty of Redesdale in 1075, replacing the former Anglian lord, Mildraed. The Liberty of Tynedale, created in 1157, was governed by the monarch of Scotland as a fief of England until death of Alexander III, when it reverted to English rule. 

To note, Liddesdale, established in the late 12th century, was a rarity on the Scottish side, functioning effectively as a secular liberty, with its own keeper who, &quot;ex officio&quot;, also held the position of Captain of Hermitage Castle. 

Religious influence was prominent in Hexhamshire, governed by the Archbishops of York, and in the County Palatine of Durham (which included the exclaves of Norhamshire and Islandshire on the frontier), ruled by the Prince Bishops, who held powers comparable to those of a king, including raising armies and collecting taxes. The Earls of Northumberland, based in Alnwick, were another major force, holding substantial military and administrative influence over northern England. The legal framework of the region was equally fragmented, with March law addressing cross-border disputes and raids, while state law and ecclesiastical law functioned in parallel. The Liberties, both religious and secular, were repeatedly accused of being havens for outlaws. Disputes often arose between Wardens of the Marches, Keepers of the liberties, and local sheriffs, reflecting the constant struggle to impose order in this turbulent region.

While both England and Scotland had overlapping jurisdictions, Scottish regalities generally lacked the level of autonomy seen in English liberties. This difference arose because England had a more centralised system of governance, whereas Scotland&#x27;s rule was more fragmented, with local polities retaining greater independence. Despite these differences, both nations faced persistent challenges in governing the borderlands, where local power dynamics frequently overruled central authority.

==Antecedents on the Anglo-Scottish frontier==
===Hen Ogledd===
The pervasive tradition of cattle raiding and endemic violence in the Border region appears to have roots that extend deep into its history, suggesting that such practices have long been an intrinsic part of the area&#x27;s cultural and social fabric. The earliest references to such behaviour appear in the Old Welsh (Hen Ogledd) poems attributed to bards such as Taliesin, Aneirin, and Llywarch Hen, which describe battles and raids in the early medieval period of what is now the Anglo-Scottish Borders. These poetic accounts hint at a long-standing culture of raiding and conflict in the northern British territories.

&quot;I roared, my breast full of tumult,&lt;br&gt;Lance on my shoulder, shield in my hand,&lt;br&gt;When Goddeu and Rheged were ranged for war,&lt;br&gt;I saw a man who was raiding cattle -&lt;br&gt;Famous dragon, unique trampler.&quot;

Modern genetic studies support the idea of continuity in the Borders region, showing that its population clusters separately from both broader Scottish and English genetic groups. This distinction aligns with the historical role of the Borders as a cultural and geographical transitional zone and is consistent with the region&#x27;s heritage, tracing back to the Brythonic-speaking kingdoms of Gododdin and Rheged.

===&#x27;The ancient laws and customs of the land&#x27;===
Laws of the Marches, or &quot;Leges Marchiarum&quot;, first formally codified in 1249, offers a significant insight into the long-standing legal and social structures designed to manage the unique challenges of the Anglo-Scottish Border. This legal framework addressed not only diplomatic relations between England and Scotland but also sought to regulate banditry, cross-border smuggling, and feuding. Its provisions included the return of fugitives, the recovery of debts, and the production of accused parties at designated trysting places along the border, such as Reddenburn near Kelso. These trysting places served as neutral meeting points for resolving disputes under the framework of March law.

The formulation of March law followed a meeting in 1248 between six English knights and six Scottish knights, and the resulting code was formally promulgated the following year. Between 1249 and 1596, the laws of the marches were reviewed and recodified on at least eight occasions, reflecting their enduring importance in managing Border relations. The legal traditions referenced in these codes draw upon &quot;the ancient laws and customs of the land,&quot; and some of the language, such as &quot;handwasil&quot; and &quot;manbote,&quot; suggests Anglo-Saxon origins. The document itself refers to the laws as originating &quot;from a time which memory does not exist,&quot; implying that aspects of March law may predate the Norman Conquest. However, the extent to which these laws derive from pre-Norman customs remains a topic of scholarly debate.

===Schavaldours===
An earlier rendition of banditry may have been the bands of armed men who first appeared on the Borders in the early 14th century, then known as the Schavaldours (also spelled shavaldour, shavaldor, or shavaldor) during the unstable rule of Edward II of England. The term was first recorded in 1313, when Richard de Kellawe, then Bishop of Durham, requested to be excused from levying any money from the goods of the parson of Whickham, citing the damage caused by &quot;Schavadours and plunderers.&quot; The Schavaldours, like the later (and anachronistically named) Border reivers, were often pressed into service during cross-border wars, such as those in 1350. 

The problem of banditry grew worse following Edward II&#x27;s loss at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and appeared to further worsen after a severe famine in 1315–1317 and a failed campaign in 1322. The anarchy that followed created conditions where both organised and independent bands of Scottish armed men, along with opportunistic English bands, raided as far as Yorkshire, devastating the land not only through plunder but also widespread burning.

While the term &#x27;Schalvadours&#x27; disappears from records by the late 14th century, the violence and lawlessness that characterised the Border region continued for centuries.

==The emergence of surnames==
The emergence of what we now understand as &#x27;Border reivers&#x27; can be traced to sometime between the end of the First War of Scottish Independence and around the end of the Wars of the Roses, though the development of fortified self-defence measures appears to have commenced earlier in England during the 14th century, particularly at the height of the Wars of Independence.

Elaborate nicknames, for which the border reivers were known, emerged early: the earliest known example is &quot;Out with the sword&quot; John Turnbull, who flourished around the turn of the 15th century. He was a member of the powerful Turnbull family in Minto in the borders, and he earned his nickname for his reputation of being quick to escalate arguments into violence. Remarkably, John Turnbull&#x27;s nickname is perhaps the only surviving example of an early 15th-century border reiver nickname.

Around the same time, the liberties of Tynedale and Redesdale were undergoing significant changes that would shape the emergence of surnames as a defining feature of border society. During Edward III&#x27;s reign, the men of these liberties were granted immunity from land confiscation. This was not a continuation of earlier practices like March law, but a deliberate concession by Edward III, designed to secure their loyalty and military support during his campaigns in Scotland. At the same time, there were longstanding complaints to the Keepers of the Liberties about their failure to hand over criminals to the courts, as the liberties often provided sanctuary for raiders and fugitives. What had long operated as a &quot;de facto&quot; arrangement of protection for certain individuals appears to have been formalised into a &quot;de jure&quot; status through Edward II&#x27;s policy.

The Wars of Independence had a profound impact on the Borders, leading to the displacement and decline of numerous local gentry families. Many dynasties and minor landed families disappeared, some due to the violence, instability, and lawlessness that plagued the Anglo-Scottish border during this period. Others may have abandoned their holdings in search of security in more tranquil areas further south.

This process was exacerbated in the aftermath of key events such as the Battle of Bannockburn (1314), when the English crown, weakened by internal instability, could no longer effectively defend northern England. Orders for a scorched earth retreat, leaving large tracts of land as wasteland, were issued to deny the advancing Scots critical resources and to slow their progress. This was ignored by many Surnames who then joined in the plunder. The border regions, distant from the central government and often regarded as peripheral, were effectively abandoned, reflecting both the strategic necessity of withdrawal and the indifference of southern authorities to the region’s fate.

A similar pattern occurred on the Scottish side of the border, where the landed gentry also experienced significant decline. The shared history of upheaval on both sides of the border underscores the profound destabilization caused by these prolonged conflicts.

The widespread banditry and raiding during the Wars of Independence, along with the decline of local gentry, may have necessitated the rise of an unofficial aristocracy. Heidsmen—heads of surnames—emerged to fill the void, providing leadership, direction, and defence in a region plagued by instability and conflict.

A lack of enforcement allowed the raiding culture to flourish, entrenching the fragmented and combative nature of the borderlands during the years leading to the emergence of the infamous Tudor surnames.

Following the defeat of Edward Balliol at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, the Kingdom of England expanded its territory to include much of southern Scotland, and deprioritised the governance and defence of the traditional Anglo-Scottish Border region. The assumption was that the &quot;new&quot; border further north, as dictated by the Treaty of Newcastle (1334), would eliminate the need to maintain the old border systems, such as March law and its associated offices. However, this miscalculation left the original border region increasingly lawless, as local governance systems were abandoned, and the territory to the north remained &quot;de facto&quot; under Scottish resistance and control. This vacuum of authority contributed to the instability and lawlessness of the borderlands.

David II&#x27;s reign was marked by continued conflict with England during the Second War of Scottish Independence. In 1346, David II was captured by English forces at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross and held prisoner in England for 11 years. 

David II release was secured in 1357 through an agreement made in Berwick, which required Scotland to pay a massive ransom of 90,000 marks. David’s return to Scotland was marked by internal strife, financial woes, and sporadic conflict with England. While the Treaty of Berwick ended the Wars of Scottish Independence, border raiding persisted as an entrenched way of life.

==The Years of Truces==
===From 1357 to the Wars of the Roses===
Between the end of the Wars of Scottish Independence (1357) and the Battle of Flodden (1513) there were intermittent peace agreements and an uneasy balance of power between England and Scotland. While no major wars erupted, the Anglo-Scottish border remained a hotspot for raiding, feuding, and political tensions. Barely had ink dried in 1357 before the Warden of the West March Thomas de Lucy was accused on one occasion of imprisoning Scots for the purpose of ransom. And on another occasion, with collusion with the men of Eskdale, there was a theft of several thousand animals and £20, in excess of £16,792 today. 

The 1370s on the Borders are recorded as particularly lawless and violent, with raiders sacking and burning houses, farms, and monasteries, while the people were either carried away or slaughtered.

Although there were long-term truces after the Wars of Scottish Independence and relatively few official cross-border raids, the proliferation of more humble fortified structures such as bastle houses and pele towers across the Anglo-Scottish borderland underscores the enduring instability of the region; they responded to persistent threats of raiding and violence, which continued even during periods of nominal peace.

Raiding continued as a persistent feature of the borderlands, punctuating periods of truce. These ranged from smaller skirmishes to occasional large-scale raids, such as the Battle of Otterburn (1388) and Homildon Hill (1402), which occasionally escalated into significant but localised conflicts. Both kingdoms sought to maintain periods of relative calm through truce agreements and diplomatic efforts, though these efforts were often fragile and difficult to enforce in the contested border regions.

It was during this time we see the emergence of English border magnates like the Nevilles, Cliffords, and Dacres, as well as an emergent lower gentry such as the Musgraves, Herons, Scropes, and later still, the Eures, Mitfords, Ogles, and Moresbys, who would come to fill key positions along the English Borders, including Sheriff, Justice of the Peace, March Wardens, Keepers of Tynedale and Redesdale, Captains of Berwick and Carlisle, and other vital military and administrative roles responsible for the defence and governance of this volatile frontier region. It&#x27;s important to note the Border gentry were few in number and much poorer compared with other parts of England.

The Percy family, Earls of Northumberland, played a significant role in the conflicts that destabilised England. The Percys first rebelled against King Henry IV during the early 15th century, joining forces with Owain Glyndŵr and Edmund Mortimer in the Tripartite Indenture, a plan to divide England and Wales between them. Led by Sir Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, the rebellion culminated in the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403), where Hotspur was killed.

Despite two further rebellions, the 2nd Earl of Northumberland was restored as Warden of the Marches by Henry V. During this period, the Percy family consolidated their power in the north, notably absorbing the liberty of Redesdale from the Umfraville to Tailboys vassals in 1436, following the extinction of the Umfraville line. Despite this growing authority and the responsibilities of the Wardenship, reports of &quot;numerous robbers and felons called Intakers [receivers of stolen goods] and Outputters [smugglers]&quot; continued to trouble the region.

===The Wars of the Roses===
During the Wars of the Roses, the Percy family expanded their influence in the eastern regions, while the Neville family grew in power in Cumbria, fostering a bitter rivalry. The two families supported opposing factions in the conflict, with the Nevilles aligning more successfully with the Yorkist cause. This strategic advantage allowed the Nevilles to claim the Percy earldom in 1463 following the Percys’ poor choice of allegiance.

During the Wars of the Roses, southern English communities viewed northern Borderers as a constant threat. The campaigns of 1460–61 were seen by figures like Abbot Whethamstede as a northern rebellion, with chroniclers describing northerners as a “plague of locusts” feared for robbery and devastation, particularly in London. This perception of the north as a militarized and hostile frontier region reinforced southern anxieties about the Borderers.

Despite the ongoing civil war between the houses of Lancaster and York, truces with Scotland were maintained and periodically renewed. A 40-year truce was agreed upon in 1479.

However, despite the agreement, raiding resumed the following year. During the so-called &#x27;Gloucester&#x27;s War&#x27;, The Earl of Angus led a deep raid into the East March, prompting a retaliatory campaign by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who launched a raid into Scotland. This outbreak of violence was short-lived, concluding by 1484. 

This brief conflict was significant for one key reason: it marked the final time Berwick-upon-Tweed changed hands, solidifying English control over the strategic town. Additionally, it saw the Duke of Albany cede control over much of South West Scotland, although this concession proved short-lived, with the territory returning to Scottish hands not long after.

==The Later Border Wars Period==
The last hundred years is often regarded as the heyday of the Border reivers, characterised by persistent raiding, feuding, and lawlessness perhaps the worst the Borders had seen. However, while this period—especially its later decades—is the best recorded, with the most surviving sources, this does not necessarily mean it was the most severe. 

It was the period we see the end of the liberties of Redesdale and Tynedale and the end of the Debatable Land. The era also saw the end of the militarised border. The Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne as James I, marked the end of centuries of conflict between the two kingdoms.

===Henry VII and James IV===
Henry VII and James IV were initially cordial, encouraged the Border courts and reminded the Border magnates of their obligation to maintain truce.

However, despite this initial cordiality and relative peace along the Borders, the period soon saw growing tensions and rivalry between the two monarchs and an increase in banditry, as the fragile truces often proved difficult to enforce.

In 1495, the pretender to the English crown, Perkin Warbeck became a guest of James IV and raids resumed on both sides of the Border with renewed intensity, disrupting the fragile peace established earlier. In the following year, Perkin Warbeck led a small-scale invasion of England, attempting to capitalise on the ongoing tensions between England and Scotland. The invasion, however, was poorly supported and ultimately failed to achieve any significant objectives.

In the same year as Perkin Warbeck&#x27;s raid, Henry VII revoked Tynedale’s liberty status and incorporated it into the county of Northumberland.

Seven years later, Hob the King (Halbert Elliot) and Dand the Man (Andrew Elliot) rode out from Liddesdale and brazenly stole 180 sheep from the Lammermuir Hills—well within sight of the city of Edinburgh—demonstrating that Borderers had little hesitation in raiding their own countrymen when it suited them.

A particularly notable intra-national warfare episode occurred during just preceding the death of Henry VII in 1509, when a dispute over harbour dues between the municipality of Newcastle and the Prior of Tynemouth escalated into outright violence. The Prior, assembling a company of 500 armed men from liberties of Tynedale and Redesdale - equipped with spears, swords, bows, and arrows - ordered them to attack Newcastle. Over the course of six days, the raiders killed around 100 inhabitants and effectively laid siege to the city. The inhabitants of Newcastle, fearing for their lives, were forced to remain within the city walls, unable to retaliate. 

===Henry VIII, James IV, and the Battle of Flodden===
The marriage of Margaret Tudor, Henry VIII&#x27;s elder sister, to James IV of Scotland in 1503 was a pivotal moment in Anglo-Scottish relations, formalised under the Treaty of Perpetual Peace. Intended to secure lasting harmony between the two kingdoms, the treaty was undermined by tensions over England&#x27;s perceived overlordship, with Henry VIII repeatedly antagonising his brother-in-law, James IV. Notably, Henry refused to pay Margaret&#x27;s dowry, a slight that James saw as deeply disrespectful.

====The Killing of Robert Ker====
Sometime between 1500, 1501, 1503, 1508, 1509or 1511, John &quot;the Bastard&quot; Heron, the illegitimate son of a minor Border lord, murdered Robert Ker of Caverton (of the Cessford branch), Warden of the Middle March, a prominent Scottish noble and close ally of King James IV. This murder was likely part of an ongoing feud between the prominent Border families of Ker and Heron, reflecting the endemic violence and rivalries of the Anglo-Scottish Border region. Such an act of violence during a March Day - a formal meeting intended to resolve cross-border disputes - was exceptionally rare, if not unprecedented, in the later medieval period. Assisted by his co-conspirators Lilburn and Starhed, Heron escalated the volatile feud. Lilburn was killed on the spot during the incident, while Starhed fled but was later tracked to the city of York and murdered in apparent retaliation.

This murder became a long-standing grievance for James IV, who regarded it as an egregious insult to both his authority and the peace between England and Scotland that John &quot;the Bastard&quot; Heron had not only murdered a warden but was currently free in England. It was directly referenced in a letter of complaint sent by James to Henry VIII, received around 11th August 1513 while Henry was at camp before the Battle of the Spurs. This unresolved grievance, alongside other provocations, compounded the already fraught Anglo-Scottish tensions, contributing to the outbreak of war and culminating in the Battle of Flodden.

===Flodden and the Borders===
The defeat of the Scottish forces at the Battle of Flodden, on 9 September 1513, is often regarded as a pivotal moment in the late history of the Anglo-Scottish Borders. Among the fallen were James IV and a significant portion of Scotland&#x27;s nobility and clergy, an Archbishop, a bishop, 21 earls, 14 lords, and at least 300 of the lower gentry. In total, perhaps as many as 8,000 Scottish troops perished, including several French captains who had joined the campaign in support of the Auld Alliance. The impact was devastating, leaving Scotland bereft of much of its leadership and military strength, a loss later immortalized in the lament &quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot;, which mourns the fallen at Flodden. 

It marks the beginning of the best-known period of Border Reiver activity. While raiding and feuding had long been part of life in the region, the 16th century is frequently the starting point for many accounts of their history, reflecting its prominence in popular narratives.

====The Ill Raid====
On the 9th August 1513, Alexander, Third Lord Home, conducted a substantial raid into England with a force estimated at 4,000 to 7,000 men. Known as the &quot;Ill Raid,&quot; this incursion succeeded in securing significant plunder. Whilst returning the Scottish forces were ambushed by 1,000 longbowmen led by Sir William Bulmer, who had mobilized from the Palatine of Durham&#x27;s Norhamshire exclave. In the ensuing confrontation, 500 Scots were killed, and another 400 were captured, including Lord Home&#x27;s own brother.

====Border reivers and the Battle of Flodden====
On the 18th August, Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England, signed an official pardon for John &quot;the Bastard&quot; Heron, for his murder of Robert Ker of Cessford, a Scottish Warden of the Middle March. Heron later played a crucial role in the battle, guiding the English army under the Earl of Surrey to a strategic position north of the Scottish forces and reportedly witnessing the burning of his family’s castle en route.

On the English left, Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre, then Lord Warden of the Marches, commanded a force of light horsemen, which included contingents from Tynemouthshire and Bamburghshire. These groups were reportedly feuding throughout the march to the battlefield. Among Dacre’s forces was also a band of fifty outlaws led by John Heron.

During the battle, the forces of Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home on the Scottish right, composed of both Highlanders, Border infantry and Border light horse—including Giles Musgrave, an English outlaw and traitor—nearly broke through the English line. Home’s troops exploited a breakdown in cohesion among men from Cheshire, who, under sustained pressure—including heavy cannon fire—panicked and began to retreat. 

This retreat left Lord Howard isolated and surrounded, with the collapse of the English left appearing imminent. At this critical moment, John Heron and his band of outlaws launched a decisive counterattack that rescued Howard and stabilized the position, preventing a total collapse. Later stories say that neither Border reivers on each side never made any real attempt to fight. Home’s forces subsequently withdrew, critically weakening the Scottish effort. Some accounts suggest that Home’s withdrawal may have been influenced by an agreement or coercion involving Dacre, as Home’s brother was being held captive by the English or he may have chosen to save himself. Late that evening, Hume attempted to recapture the Scottish guns with his Border light horse. The guns had been seized during the English triumph at Flodden, but his efforts ultimately failed.

An example of the mercurial and opportunistic nature of Border society occurred during the Battle of Flodden. While the armies clashed, men from Teviotdale in Scotland and Tynedale in England collaborated to raid and despoil the English wagon train. The Bishop of Durham at the time accused the English Borderers of assisting Scottish army, including taking prisoners on both sides. The accusations of theft against the English Borderers were denied by Lord Dacre.

By the late evening of 9 September 1513, many of Scotland’s leading men lay dead on English soil, their loss devastating the kingdom’s leadership. Among the few surviving magnates were aforementioned Home. The body of King James IV was discovered on the battlefield and later sent south by Dacre as proof of the catastrophic defeat.

== The heyday of the &#x27;Border reivers&#x27; (1513-1603) ==
The heyday of the Border Reivers began in the aftermath of the Battle of Flodden in 1513, as the devastation of Scotland’s leadership and the instability of the Anglo-Scottish Borderlands led to an era of intensified raiding and lawlessness. This period saw significant events, such as the division of the Debatable Land and the ultimate suppression of banditry with the Union of the Crowns in 1603. 

===After Flodden===
Almost immediately after the Battle of Flodden, riders from Scotland launched raids, burning four towns in England. In response, Dacre led punitive judicial raids, devastating towns such as Annan and razing villages and buildings across Teviotdale, Liddesdale, and Ewesdale, while seizing 4,000 head of cattle. 

Dacre, reportedly acting under the direction of Cardinal Wolsey and King Henry VIII, paid Scottish surnames to conduct raids into Scotland while simultaneously entertaining factions opposed to the Angus regency. Far from attempting to control the Borders, Dacre was orchestrating chaos to undermine Scottish stability. Ironically, a joint Maxwell-Irvine force of 400 men raided the Debatable Land and lifted 700 cattle from his tenants. When Dacre lodged a complaint, the Maxwell heidsman reportedly replied that the cattle had been taken &quot;orderly, according to the customs of the Borders.&quot;

===Settling the Debatable Land===
About the same time, the Armstrongs and Grahams broke with generations of Border customs by settling the Debatable Land, a territory long regarded as neutral and lawless. This encroachment was first tacitly acknowledged by the Scottish government in 1517 or 1518. Around the same time, Thomas, Lord Dacre permitted loyal Scottish Grahams to establish themselves in the southern end of the Debatable Land, further eroding its status as a no-man&#x27;s-land between the two kingdoms. Another source says it was the Grahams were the first to settle in the Debateable Lands in 1516 after being banished from Scotland. Two years later, in 1518, the Armstrongs followed, reportedly with the agreement of Lord Dacre

This policy of tolerating settlement in the Debatable Land had no remedial effect on banditry in the Anglo-Scottish borderlands, where criminality persisted unabated. The Armstrongs only increased in danger, their activities posing an even greater threat to the borderlands.

===&#x27;Heyday South of the Border&#x27;===
Throughout the 1520s, perhaps due to ongoing famine and outbreaks of rinderpest, large bands of men continued to plunder and rob across both England and Scotland. These groups sometimes formed confederacies of outlawed Surnames, led by gentlemen such as Sir Nicholas Ridley in the early 1520s and later Sir William Lisle of Felton mid-to-late 1520s, Lisle was hung, drawn and quartered as a rebel rather than treated to the March Day court. Both had previously served as lawmen, but in a reversal of the formula all-too-common on the Border, the gamekeepers became poachers. Some, like the then Warden and former Keeper of Redesdale, Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre, got perilously close to being outlawed for associating too closely with known thieves.

North of the border, Lord Dacre launched two massive raids against the Armstrongs of Liddesdale and the Debatable Land. In retaliation, the Armstrongs mounted raids into Cumbria. Dacre, in turn, responded again, but this time he retaliated by burning the towers of the sons of the infamous Johnny Armstrong. It is important to note that while the Armstrong-Dacre feud raged on, it was only one of many such raids and counter-raids along the border.

In 1525, the Archbishop of Glasgow, Gavin Dunbar, issued the extraordinary fifteen-hundred word Monition of Cursing, damning all who dwelled in the Borders to hell.

This period was bookended im 1530 by the coming of age of James V, who sought to assert royal authority over the Borders by imprisoning, and in some cases executing, leading figures he perceived as threats to his kingdom. Among those captured was the aforemnentioned Johnny Armstrong and 35 of his followers. Johnny&#x27;s capture and execution was later romanticised in the ballad &quot;Johnnie Armstrong&quot;. Despite James V best efforts to surpress banditry, by imprisoning and mass hangings, there was seemingly little change.

In 1536, Henry VIII abolished Redesdale’s liberty status and fully integrated it into the county of Northumberland.

====Pilgrimage of the Grace====
The Pilgrimage of Grace was a large-scale rebellion in 1536 against Henry VIII&#x27;s religious and political reforms, particularly the dissolution of the monasteries, drawing support from across Northern England.

The Pilgrimage of Grace had notable connections to the Border Reivers, particularly through the Percy family and their alliances in Tynedale and Redesdale. Sir Thomas Percy, brother of Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, played a leading role in the rebellion and sought the support of prominent Border surnames. Representatives from Tynedale and Redesdale, including Edward and Cuthbert Charlton of Bellingham and John Hall of Otterburn, were present at the Pontefract meeting with the Duke of Norfolk.

Their involvement was likely facilitated by ‘Little’ John Heron of Chipchase, a key Percy ally with strong ties to the Charltons. Heron leveraged these connections to rally Border support, including resistance to the dissolution of Hexham Priory, with the Charltons and their followers pledging their loyalty in exchange for payment. The reivers&#x27; participation extended beyond the rebellion itself, as seen in their role in the occupation of Ford Castle and the assassination of Roger Fenwick, the newly appointed Keeper of Tynedale, in early 1537. 

Lawlessness increased with the downfall of the Dacre in the West and the disgrace of the Percies in the East, as no Border lord could unite the Surnames under a single banner.

===The Borders during the &#x27;Rough Wooing&#x27;===
History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme: Like his father, James IV, who died on the battlefield at Flodden, James V was also defeated, this time at the Battle of Solway Moss in 1542. However, unlike his father, James V did not die on the battlefield but succumbed to illness shortly thereafter. Like his father, he left behind a baby to inherit the crown—though this time, it was a baby girl, Mary. Once again, Scotland was plagued by infighting among its leading men, who vied for the position of Regent. Meanwhile, Henry VIII seized the opportunity to interfere in Scottish politics, with the added tension of the Reformation.

The conflict known as the Rough Wooing — lasting from 1542 to 1551 — refers to Henry VIII&#x27;s military and diplomatic campaign aimed at coercing the leading Scottish nobility into agreeing to a marriage between his infant son Edward and the young Mary, Queen of Scots. This led to the destruction of 192 towns, towers, and bastle-houses, as well as the capture of 20,000 cattle. This devastation only made the Borders more dangerous and lawless, with English and Scottish borderers — and even the local Scottish aristocracy — joining in the depredation.

During this period, Henry VIII and his appointed man on the Borders, Sir Richard Wharton, actively encouraged Scottish raiding. A notable instance occurred in 1543, when the Liddesdale Armstrongs were urged to raid and burn the lands and property of the Kerrs and Scotts. Despite this support, the Liddesdale Armstrongs carried out an attack on Hexham in the same year. Included among the Scottish Surnames most actively fighting alongside the English Borderers, southern English troops and foreign mercernaries were the Olivers, Davidsons, Pringles, Taits, Youngs, Turnballs, Elliots, Crosers, Nixons, Armstrongs and Rutherfords. The principle target of these raids were the Surnames Maxwell and Kerr. In 1552, the long-standing feud between the Scotts and the Kerrs spilled into Edinburgh, where Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch was assassinated by members of the Kerr family.

===The Borders in the Age of Queens===
With the accession of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Queen Mary I of England—both Catholic monarchs—peace should have returned to the Border. However, with decades, perhaps centuries, of ongoing antagonism between the two states and a deeply entrenched culture of raiding, this did not happen. 

====The End of the Debatable Land====
At the Treaty of Norham officially ending &#x27;the Rough Wooing&#x27;, the Debatable Land was finally divided between Scotland and England. The division was decided in 1552 by a French ambassador, who drew a simple straight line to evenly split the territory between the two nations. However, this seemingly simple tale took a turn, as a slightly different boundary was ultimately chosen—one that now forms the present-day border, known as Scots Dyke.

Despite the division, the March Day courts were overwhelmed, with a five-hundred bills of complaint recorded in a single session, while an official attempt to suppress banditry in Liddesdale was forcefully repulsed.

====Accession of Elizabeth I====
With the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, England saw its last monarch to rule before the end of the Border as a lawless frontier. Nevertheless, the Border remained very much alive on both sides. Queen Mary&#x27;s half-brother, James Stewart, led a foray into the region, capturing between twenty and thirty reivers, before seizing another forty.

====The Scottish Reformation, the Borders, and Mary&#x27;s Downfall====
In 1564, a feud erupted between the Elliots and the Scotts, marked by cycles of raids and retaliation. As tensions escalated, this conflict became entangled with the broader political and religious instability of the Scottish Reformation, where both the English and Scottish crowns vied for influence in the Borderlands. The Protestant Lord Moray, James Stewart, sought to weaken the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, further exacerbating the turbulence. Queen Mary&#x27;s half-brother, James Stewart, led a foray into the region, capturing between twenty and thirty reivers, before seizing another forty. Amidst this unrest, James, Earl of Bothwell was involved in Border feuds, and after surviving an attack by Jock of Park, an Elliot, his political influence grew.

By 1566, Mary visited Bothwell at Hermitage Castle while he recovered from the wounds inflicted during a raid. This visit marked the beginning of a closer relationship between Mary and Bothwell, which soon became intertwined with the scandal surrounding the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley, in 1567. Bothwell was widely suspected of orchestrating Darnley’s murder, and shortly after, he married Mary, sparking a political crisis. Their union, controversial due to the circumstances of Darnley’s death, led to rebellion and ultimately Mary&#x27;s abdication in 1567.

====Rising of the North====
After the rebellion, Mary fled south to England in 1568, seeking Elizabeth’s protection. However, Elizabeth regarded Mary as a political threat due to her Catholic claim to the English throne, setting the stage for further unrest. In 1569, major northern Catholic magnates—such as Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland (recently removed from his position March Warden of the East and Middle March) and Charles Neville, Earl of Westmorland—led the Rising of the North in an attempt to restore Catholic rule and potentially install Mary on the throne. They were later joined by Leonard Dacre, a nephew of the Dacres of Gilsland (a family line that had fallen into abeyance), who felt aggrieved by Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s land allocation decisions.

The failure of the Rising of the North forced the Percies and Nevilles to flee to Scotland, leaving them with no refuge but the infamous Liddesdale, where they were compelled to make peace with the many thieves and outlaws who resided there. There, in Liddesdale, the fugitive earls were received by the notorious Black Ormiston and Jock-of-the-Side, who was reportedly involved in the killing of Lord Darnley. In the chaos of their flight, the fugitives not only had to contend with a superior royal army but also suffered the theft of horses and clothing at the hands of local outlaws. Another notorious Borderer, Hector of Harelaw, captured the Earl of Northumberland and handed him over to the Regent of Scotland. Reprisals were swift and brutal—scores of impoverished Borderers were summarily executed without trial.

====After the Rising====
The downfall of the leading magnates on the English frontier created greater opportunities for banditry. In one raid in the English Middle Marches alone, 140 captives were taken from one township. Following this, English Wardens of the March rode across burning and destroying property of those who had supported the Rising of the North and outlaws.

==Nature==
Borderers who dwelled in the highlands led a transhumance existence, moving their herds with the seasons—driving them up to the highland pastures in summer for lush grazing, and returning to the lowlands in winter for shelter and fodder. A system of partible inheritance is evident in some parts of the English side of the Borders in the sixteenth century. By contrast to primogeniture, this meant that land was divided equally among all sons following a father&#x27;s death; it could mean that the inheriting generation held insufficient land on which to survive. It was not uncommon for tenancy agreements to stipulate that, rather than providing labor or agricultural produce, tenants were required to contribute military service, offering their fighting strength in lieu of traditional rents.

The reivers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day&#x27;s ride of the border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. Borderers were reported to have raided as far north as the outskirts of Edinburgh, while incursions reached as far south as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders. Although criminal activity was widespread, highway robbery was exceptional and often noted when it occurred..Those who didn&#x27;t keep their word were ritually humiliated in a practice called &#x27;baunchling,&#x27; where the man&#x27;s glove or image was held aloft on the end of a lance.

When raiding, or riding, as it was termed, the reivers rode light on hardy nags or ponies renowned for the ability to pick their way over the boggy moss lands (see: Galloway pony, Hobelar). The Borderers had an extensive knowledge of the terrain, including hidden routes and river fords, which allowed them to navigate the region efficiently and evade pursuit even in rough weather.

The original dress of a shepherd&#x27;s plaid was later replaced by light armour such as brigandines or jacks of plate (a type of sleeveless doublet into which small plates of steel were stitched), and metal helmets such as burgonets or morions; hence their nickname of the &quot;steel bonnets&quot;. They were armed with light lances and small shields, and sometimes also with longbows, or light crossbows, known as &quot;latches&quot;, or later on in their history with one or more pistols. They invariably also carried swords and dirks.

==Borderers as soldiers==
Border reivers were sometimes in demand as mercenary soldiers, owing to their recognised skills as light cavalry. So impressed with the reputation of the quality of Borderers, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor reportedly created a whole unit fashioned upon the Scottish Reivers. Reivers sometimes served in English or Scottish armies in the Low Countries and in Ireland, often to avoid having harsher penalties enacted upon themselves and their families. Reivers fighting as levied soldiers played important roles in the battles at Flodden and Solway Moss. After meeting one reiver (the &quot;Bold Buccleugh&quot;), Queen Elizabeth I is quoted as having said that &quot;with ten thousand such men, James VI could shake any throne in Europe.&quot;

These borderers proved difficult to control, however, within larger national armies. They were already in the habit of claiming any nationality or none, depending on who was asking and where they perceived the individual advantage to be. Many had relatives on both sides of Scottish-English conflicts despite prevailing laws against international marriage. They could be badly behaved in camp, seeing fellow soldiers as sources of plunder. As warriors more loyal to clans than to nations, their commitment to the work was always in doubt. At battles such as Ancrum Moor in Scotland in 1545, borderers changed sides in mid-combat to curry favour with the likely victors. At the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547, an observer (William Patten) noticed Scottish and English borderers chatting with each other, then putting on a spirited show of combat once they knew they had been spotted.

==Dwellings and fortifications==
The inhabitants of the Borders had to live in a state of constant alert, and for self-protection, they built fortified tower houses.

In the very worst periods of warfare, people were unable to construct more than crude turf cabins, the destruction of which would be little loss. When times allowed, however, they built houses designed as much for defence as shelter. The bastle house was a stout two-storeyed building. The lower floor was used to keep the most valuable livestock and horses. The upper storey housed the people, and often could be reached only by an external ladder which was pulled up at night or if danger threatened. The stone walls were up to thick, and the roof was of slate or stone tiles. Only narrow arrow slits provided light and ventilation. Such dwellings could not be set on fire, and while they could be captured, for example by smoking out the defenders with fires of damp straw or using scaling ladders to reach the roof, they were usually not worth the time and effort.

Peel towers (also spelled pele towers) were usually three-storeyed buildings, constructed specifically for defensive purposes by the authorities, or for prestigious individuals such as the heads of clans. Smailholm Tower is one of many surviving peel towers. Like bastle houses, they were very strongly constructed for defence. If necessary, they could be temporarily abandoned and stuffed full of smouldering turf to prevent an enemy (such as a government army) destroying them with gunpowder.

Peel towers and bastle houses were often surrounded by a stone wall known as a barmkin, inside which cattle and other livestock were kept overnight.

==Law and order==

A special body of law, known as March law or Border law, developed in the region. Under border law, a person who had been raided had the right to mount a counter-raid within six days, even across the border, to recover his goods. This &quot;hot trod&quot; had to proceed with &quot;hound and horne, hew and cry&quot;, making a racket and carrying a piece of burning turf on a spear point to openly announce their purpose, to distinguish themselves from unlawful raiders proceeding covertly. They might use a sleuth hound (also known as a &quot;slew dogge&quot;) to follow raiders&#x27; tracks. These dogs were valuable, and part of the established forces (on the English side of the border, at least). Any person meeting this counter-raid was required to ride along and offer such help as he could, on pain of being considered complicit with the raiders. The &quot;cold trod&quot; mounted after six days required official sanction. Officers such as the Deputy Warden of the English West March had the specific duty of &quot;following the trod&quot;.

Both sides of the border were divided into Marches, each under a march warden. The march wardens&#x27; various duties included the maintenance of patrols, watches and garrisons to deter raiding from the other kingdom. This was very much reliant on the ability of the warden&#x27;s personal strength in men or &quot;manraed&quot;, loyalty of local gentry and personal wealth. On occasion, march wardens could make &quot;warden roades&quot; to recover loot, and to make a point to raiders and officials. A degree of reiving and banditry among the gentry was tolerated in return for their service on the frontier. Summary executions, referred to in the Borderlands as &#x27;Jeddart Justice,&#x27; were occasionally employed for suspected thieves and murderers.

The march wardens also had the duty of maintaining such justice and equity as was possible. The respective kingdoms&#x27; march wardens would meet at appointed times along the border itself to settle claims against people on their side of the border by people from the other kingdom. These occasions, known as &quot;Days of Truce&quot;, were much like fairs, with entertainment and much socialising. For reivers it was an opportunity to meet (lawfully) with relatives or friends normally separated by the border. It was not unknown for violence to break out even at such truce days. It was not until the 1450s that the March Day courts were formalised in a manner resembling their operation in the Tudor period.

March wardens (and the lesser officers such as keepers of fortified places) were rarely effective at maintaining the law. The Scottish wardens were usually borderers themselves, and were complicit in raiding. They almost invariably showed favour to their own kindred, which caused jealousy and even hatred among other Scottish border families. Many English officers were from southern counties in England and often could not command the loyalty or respect of their locally recruited subordinates or the local population. Local officers such as Sir John Forster, who was Warden of the Middle March for almost 35 years, became quite as well known for venality as his most notorious Scottish counterparts.

By the death of Elizabeth I of England, things had come to such a pitch along the border that the English government considered re-fortifying and rebuilding Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. When Elizabeth died, there was an especially violent outbreak of raiding known as &quot;Ill Week&quot;, resulting from the convenient belief that the laws of a kingdom were suspended between the death of a sovereign and the proclamation of the successor. Upon his accession to the English throne, James VI of Scotland (who became James I of England) moved hard against the reivers, abolishing border law and the very term &quot;Borders&quot; in favour of &quot;Middle Shires&quot;, and dealing out stern justice to reivers.

===Legislation===
In 1606 an act (4 Jas. 1. c. 1) to assist the recent Union of the Crowns was enacted; it was long titled &quot;An act for the utter abolition of all memory of hostility, and the dependence thereof, between England and Scotland, and for repressing of occasions of disorders, and disorders in time to come&quot;. The act repealed nine English laws enacted over the previous centuries and considered hostile to Scotland; the repeal became effective when 13 Scottish laws considered hostile to England had been repealed. Three years later an act (7 Jas. 1. c. 1) dealing with criminal law in the border region was enacted; it was long titled &quot;An act for the better execution of justice, and suppressing of criminal offenders, in the north parts of the kingdom of England.&quot; To deal with cross-border flight, the act allowed the trial of an Englishman in Scotland if the felony was committed there, and he was later arrested in England; it became effective after a similar act had been passed in Scotland.

Following the Restoration and long-running lawlessness by Moss troopers nearly six decades later, parliament passed the Moss Troopers Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 22) for the border area; it was long titled &quot;An Act for preventing of Theft and Rapine upon the Northern Borders of England.&quot; Section seven of the act revives both previous acts passed under James I. With the 1662 act about to expire, the sixth session of Cavalier Parliament passed the Moss Troopers Act 1666 (18 &amp; 19 Cha. 2. c. 3), long titled &quot;An Act to continue a former Act for preventing of Thefte and Rapine upon the Northerne Borders of England.&quot; Under section two of the act, the benefit of clergy was taken away from those convicted (generally meaning a death sentence), or otherwise, the notorious thieves and spoil-takers in Northumberland or Cumberland were to be transported to America, &quot;there to remaine and not to returne&quot;.

Generally associated with several historic events of the period, as well as continuing lawlessness, or the consideration of insufficient government control to prevent &quot;theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England&quot;, these acts were repeatedly continued over the next 80 years. The initial acts include the Moss Trooper Act 1677 (29 &amp; 30 Cha. 2. c. 2), the Moss Trooper Act 1685 (1 Ja. 2. c. 14), the Moss Trooper Act 1695 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 17), the Moss Trooper Act 1700 (12 &amp; 13 Will. 3. c. 6), and the Moss Trooper Act 1712 (12 Ann. c. 10). Starting in 1732, although the &#x27;Moss trooper&#x27; short title was dropped, the enforcement acts were continued by other variously named acts, most of which continued the established descriptive phrase &quot;for preventing theft and rapine upon the northern borders of England&quot;, as the first item included. These later acts include the Perpetuation of Various Laws Act 1732 (6 Geo. 2. c. 37), the Universities (Wine Licences) Act 1743 (17 Geo. 2. c. 40), and the Continuance of Laws Act 1750 (24 Geo. 2. c. 57), which continued previous acts until 1 September 1757 &quot;and from thence to the end of the then next session of parliament&quot;.

==Border surnames and clans==
It wasn&#x27;t recorded until 1498 in a royal precept issued to the sheriff of Northumberland that the term &quot;surnames&quot; was used to describe certain families inhabiting Tynedale and Redesdale.

A variety of terms describe the Border families, such as the &quot;Riding Surnames&quot; and the &quot;Graynes&quot; thereof. This can be equated to the system of the Highland Clans and their septs. e.g. Clan Donald and Clan MacDonald of Sleat, can be compared with the Scotts of Buccleuch and the Scotts of Harden and elsewhere. Both Border Graynes and Highland septs, however, had the essential feature of patriarchal leadership by the chief of the name, known as &#x27;Heidsman&#x27; in the Borders and had territories in which most of their kindred lived.

In an Act of the Scottish Parliament of 1587 there is the description of the &quot;&quot; – thus using the words &#x27;clan&#x27; and &#x27;chief&#x27; to describe both Highland and Lowland families. The act goes on to list the various Border clans. Later, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General), writing in 1680 said &quot;By the term &#x27;chief&#x27; we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the Irish (Gaelic) with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan&quot;. Thus, the words chief or head, and clan or family, are interchangeable. It is therefore possible to talk of the MacDonald family or the Maxwell clan. The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders are listed as families originated as a 19th-century convention.

===Surnames in the Marches of Scotland (1587)===

In 1587 the Parliament of Scotland passed a statute: &quot;For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subjectis inhabitantis of the borders hielands and Ilis.&quot; Attached to the statute was a Roll of surnames from both the Borders and Highlands. The Borders portion listed 17 &quot; with a Chief and their associated Marches:

Middle March
* Elliot, Armstrong, Nixon, Crozier
West March
* Scott, Bates, Little, Thomsons, Glendenning, Irving, Bell, Carruthers, Graham, Johnstone, Jardine, Moffat, and Latimer.

Of the Border Clans or Graynes listed on this roll, Elliot, Carruthers, Scott, Irvine, Graham, Johnstone, Jardine and Moffat are registered with the Court of Lord Lyon in Edinburgh as Scottish Clans (with a Chief), others such as Armstrong, Little and Bell are armigerous clans with no Chief, while such as Clan Blackadder, also an armigerous clan in the Middle Ages, later died out or lost their lands, and are unregistered with the Lyon Court.

The historic riding surnames recorded by George MacDonald Fraser in The Steel Bonnets (London: Harvill, 1989) are:

East March
* Scotland: Hume, Trotter, Dixon, Bromfield, Craw, Cranston.
* England: Forster, Selby, Gray, Dunn.
Middle March
* Scotland: Burns, Kerr, Young, Pringle, Davison, Gilchrist, Tait of East Teviotdale. Scott, Oliver, Turnbull, Rutherford of West Teviotdale. Armstrong, Croser, Elliot, Nixon, Douglas, Laidlaw, Routledge, Turner, Henderson of Liddesdale.
* England: Anderson, Potts, Reed, Hall, Hedley of Redesdale. Charlton, Robson, Dodd, Dodds, Milburn, Yarrow, Stapleton of Tynedale. Also Fenwick, Ogle, Heron, Witherington, Medford (later Mitford), Collingwood, Carnaby, Shaftoe, Ridley, Stokoe, Stamper, Wilkinson, Hunter, Huntley, Thomson, Jamieson.
West March
* Scotland: Bell, Irvine, Irving, Johnstone, Maxwell, Carlisle, Beattie, Little, Carruthers, Glendenning, Routledge, Moffat.
* England: Graham, Hetherington, Musgrave, Storey, Lowther, Curwen, Salkeld, Dacre, Harden, Hodgson, Routledge, Tailor, Noble.

Relationships between the Border clans varied from uneasy alliance to open, deadly feud. It took little to start a feud; a chance quarrel or misuse of office was sufficient. Feuds might continue for years until patched up in the face of invasion from the other kingdoms or when the outbreak of other feuds caused alliances to shift. The border was easily destabilised if Graynes from opposite sides of the border were at feud. Feuds also provided ready excuse for particularly murderous raids or pursuits.

Riders did not wear identifying tartans. The tradition of family tartans dates from the Victorian era and was inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott. The typical dress of reivers included Jack of plate, steel bonnets (helmets), and riding boots.

== Elaborate nicknames ==
The Border reivers are well-known for their distinctive and often colourful nicknames, which likely emerged due to the widespread use of common surnames and first names such as John, Jock, or Will among the Border clans. These nicknames served as a practical means to distinguish individuals in a society where shared names were prevalent.

These monikers often reflected a strong emphasis on lineage and close kinship, adhering to patterns of patrilineal descent, such as Dick&#x27;s Davy, Rowy&#x27;s Will and Will’s Jock Graham. Sometimes this was extended to three names Gibb&#x27;s Geordie&#x27;s Francis could be matrilineal like Bessie&#x27;s Andrew.

Physical traits or injuries inspired other nicknames, such as Jock &quot;Half-Lugs&quot; (Half-ears) Elliot, &quot;Sweet Milk&quot; (beautiful),&quot;Fingerless&quot; Will Nixon, &quot;Nebless&quot; (Noseless) Clem Crozieror &quot;Gleed John&quot; (gleed meaning blind or partially blind) or &quot;Wynking Will.&quot;

Nicknames like Jock &quot;a God&#x27;s Name&quot; Elliot, &quot;Skinabake&quot;, &quot;As-it-Looks&quot; or Archie &quot;Fire-the-Brays,&quot; or &quot;Hodde&quot; Hall cannot be easily be explained.

At times, a nickname could be applied multiple times to different individuals, creating confusion or ambiguity. For instance, the moniker Black Jock was used for two different men named Johnny Armstrong, while Black Ormiston referred to two possible distinct Ormistons.

Others, like &quot;Buggerback,&quot; &quot;The Lady Elliot,&quot; &quot;The Lady Scott,&quot; &quot;The Lady Kerr,&quot; &quot;Bang-tail,&quot; and &quot;Sym &#x27;the Lady&#x27;,&quot; remain subjects of speculation. These names may have reflected an alternative sexuality - as we understand it today or held layered meanings tied to identity, humor, or camaraderie within the close-knit, often male-dominated culture of the Border Reivers.

== In literature ==

The reivers were romanticised by writers such as Sir Walter Scott (&quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;), although he also used the term Moss-trooper, which refers to seventeenth-century borderland brigands. Scott was himself a native of the borders, writing down histories which had been passed on in folk tradition or ballad.

English poet William Wordsworth&#x27;s verse play &quot;The Borderers&quot; features border reivers (but does not use this term).

The stories of legendary border reivers like Kinmont Willie Armstrong were often retold in folk-song as Border ballads. There are also local legends, such as the &quot;Dish of Spurs&quot; which would be served to a border chieftain of the Charltons to remind him that the larder was empty and it was time to raid again. Scottish author Nigel Tranter revisited these themes in his historical and contemporary novels. Scottish Border poet, and Australian bush balladeer, Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) wrote several poems about the reivers, including &quot;The reiver&#x27;s heart&quot; (1903), &quot;The raiders&quot; (1904), &quot;Whaup o&#x27; the rede: a ballad of the border raiders&quot; (1909), &quot;Kirkhope Tower&quot; (1913), and &quot;Ho! for the blades of Harden&quot;. &quot;The Steel Bonnets&quot; (1971) by George MacDonald Fraser (1925–2008) describes life in the Anglo-Scottish border marches in the heyday of the border reivers.

== In modern times ==
The names of the Reiver families are still very much apparent among the inhabitants of the Scottish Borders, Northumbria and Cumbria today. Reiving families (particularly those large or brutal enough to carry significant influence) have left the local population passionate about their territory on both sides of the Border. Newspapers have described the local cross-border rugby fixtures as &#x27;annual re-runs of the bloody Battle of Otterburn&#x27;. Despite this there has been much cross-border migration since the Pacification of the Borders, and families that were once Scots now identify themselves as English and vice versa.

Hawick in Scotland holds an annual Reivers&#x27; festival as do the Schomberg Society in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland (the two often co-operate). The summer festival in the Borders town of Duns is headed by the &quot;Reiver&quot; and &quot;Reiver&#x27;s Lass&quot;, a young man and young woman elected from the inhabitants of the town and surrounding area. The Ulster-Scots Agency&#x27;s first two leaflets from the &#x27;Scots Legacy&#x27; series feature the story of the historic Ulster tartan and the origins of the kilt and the Border Reivers.

Borderers (particularly those banished by James VI of Scotland) took part in the plantation of Ulster, becoming the people known as Ulster-Scots (Scotch-Irish in America). Reiver descendants can be found throughout Ulster.

Border surnames can also be found throughout the major areas of Scotch-Irish settlement in the United States, and particularly in the Appalachian region. The historian David Hackett Fischer (1989) has shown in detail how the Anglo-Scottish border culture became rooted in parts of the United States, especially the Upland South. Author George MacDonald Fraser wryly observed or imagined Border traits and names among controversial people in modern American history: Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, among others. It is also noted that, in 1969, a descendant of the Borderers, Neil Armstrong, was the first person to set foot on the Moon. In 1972 Armstrong was made a freeman of the town of Langholm in Scotland, the home of his ancestors.

The artist Gordon Young created a public art work in Carlisle: &quot;Cursing Stone and Reiver Pavement&quot;, a nod to Gavin Dunbar, the Archbishop of Glasgow&#x27;s 1525 &quot;Monition of Cursing&quot;. Names of Reiver families are set into the paving of a walkway which connects Tullie House Museum to Carlisle Castle under a main road, and part of the bishop&#x27;s curse is displayed on a 14-ton granite boulder.

<text>Uncle Dynamite is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 22 October 1948 by Herbert Jenkins, London and in the United States on 29 November 1948 by Didier &amp; Co., New York. It features the mischievous Uncle Fred, who had previously appeared in &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot; (1939).

== Plot ==
Frederick Altamont Cornwallis Twistleton, fifth Earl of Ickenham, known to all as Uncle Fred, is on the loose once again (Lady Ickenham having decamped for a wedding in Trinidad), and Reginald (&quot;Pongo&quot;) Twistleton, his long-suffering nephew, has every right to be petrified.

Uncle Fred has just arrived at Ashenden Manor, Ashenden Oakshott, Hampshire. Ashenden Manor is the home of Sir Aylmer Bostock, Pongo&#x27;s future father-in-law. Pongo is already in residence and has committed two rank floaters: accidentally smashing a whatnot from Sir Aylmer&#x27;s collection of African curios, and (in the course of demonstrating how Brazilian natives kill birds with rude slings) smashing a coveted bust of his host.

Pongo&#x27;s solution is to replace the busted bust with another one, abstracted from Ickenham Hall. But unknown to him, the replacement bust was fashioned by his former fiancée Sally Painter, and conceals valuable jewellery that a friend of hers was planning to smuggle through New York Customs.

Sally tries to replace the bust with another of Sir Aylmer she sculpted (but had had returned to her, after an unfortunate incident relating to her brother Otis&#x27; publication of Sir Aylmer&#x27;s memoirs), but this comes to naught, and both busts end up in Sir Aylmer&#x27;s collection room.

Uncle Fred is unruffled by this setback and decides to infiltrate the house as an impostor. Having met Bill Oakshott (an unassuming young man who is the actual owner of Ashenden Manor, but who shrinks from confronting and displacing his bombastic, overbearing uncle Sir Aylmer) on the train, Uncle Fred contrives to get invited to the house—under the name of Major Brabazon-Plank. Unfortunately, the local Constable, Harold Potter, happens to have grown up with Major Plank (and also happens to remember arresting Uncle Fred and Pongo at the dog races under the names of Edwin Smith and George Robinson). Potter, intimately tied to the household through his fiancée, the housemaid Elsie Bean, becomes suspicious, and watches the house.

Uncle Fred&#x27;s tasks are: to snatch the bust for Sally Painter; get Sir Aylmer to drop his suit against Otis, so that Sally will not lose the money she invested in his firm; convince Pongo that Hermione Bostock is not the proper wife for him and that Sally is; restore Bill Oakshott to his place as head of his family home and unite him with Hermione, whom he has loved for years; and convince Constable Potter not only to not arrest him, but indeed to quit the force so he and Elsie Bean may live happily ever after. Complications arise, including the arrival of the real Major Brabazon-Plank— but his menace is neutralized because of his horror of judging the Bonnie Babies competition at the Ashenden Oakshott Fête, an honor for which Uncle Fred, as the ersatz Major, has volunteered.

Bill Oakshott finds inspiration in the dominant hero of Ethel M. Dell&#x27;s &quot;The Way of an Eagle&quot;.

==Style==

Wodehouse obtains a humorous effect by using patterns of word formation in varied ways, such as when the prefix &quot;de-&quot; is added to a proper name, which occurs when Pongo brings the house-maid Elsie Bean out of a cupboard in chapter 9: &quot;His manner as he de-Beaned the cupboard was somewhat distrait.&quot; In chapter 8, a character separates &quot;hobnob&quot; into its constituent elements: &quot;It all depended on what you meant by the expression [i.e. hobnob]. To offer a housemaid a cigarrette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing.&quot; A non-standard modification to a word occurs in chapter 13, when the word glimp is used as a back-formation of the word &quot;glimpse&quot; by the policeman Harold Potter: &quot;I just caught sight of her for a minute as she legged it away, like as it might have been a glimp.&quot;

Ambiguities in language can lead to comedic cross-talk, such as when confusion is caused by two different meanings of the word &quot;by&quot; in chapter 13:
&quot;I was assaulted by the duck pond.&quot;&quot;By the duck pond?&quot; Sir Aylmer asked, his eyes widening.&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&quot;How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?&quot;Constable Potter saw where the misunderstanding had arisen. The English language is full of these pitfalls.&quot;When I say &#x27;by the duck pond,&#x27; I didn&#x27;t mean &#x27;by the duck pond,&#x27; I meant &#x27;by the duck pond.&#x27; That is to say,&quot; proceeded Constable Potter, speaking just in time, &quot;&#x27;near&#x27; or &#x27;adjacent to&#x27;, in fact &#x27;on the edge of&#x27;.&quot;

Incongruity between descriptions of a particular situation is used for comedic effect, as in chapter 1: &quot;From the penny-in-the-slot machine at the far end to the shed where the porter kept his brooms and buckets the platform was dark with what practically amounted to a sea of humanity. At least forty persons must have been present.&quot; Foreign loan words are fairly frequent in Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, sometimes in incongruous contexts, such as &quot;mésalliance&quot; being used to describe a convict&#x27;s sister marrying a policeman (chapter 3.5).

Formal language is frequently juxtaposed with colloquial expressions in Wodehouse&#x27;s stories. This occurs in chapter 5: &quot;There is an expression in common use which might have been invented to describe the enterprising peer in moments such as this: the expression &#x27;boomps-a-daisy.&#x27; You could look askance at his methods, you could shake your head at him in disapproval and click your tongue in reproof, but you could not deny that he was boomps-a-daisy.&quot; Some of Wodehouse&#x27;s older, more dignified male characters have humorously inappropriate, discourteous nicknames from their years at school, such as Sir Aylmer &quot;Mugsy&quot; Bostock, Major &quot;Bimbo&quot; Brabazon-Plank, and Frederick Altamont Cornwallis &quot;Barmy&quot; Twistleton, Lord Ickenham.

The stylistic device of the &quot;enumeration&quot; is used with a carefully planned anticlimax at the end in chapter 6: &quot;Now slept the crimson petal and the white, and in the silent garden of Ashenden Manor nothing stirred save shy creatures of the night such as owls, mice, rats, gnats, bats and Constable Potter.&quot;

Vivid imagery involving exaggerated similes and metaphors is frequently used in Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, for example in chapter 3: &quot;A sticky moisture had begun to bedew his brow, as if he had entered the hot room of some Turkish bath of the soul.&quot; In chapter 2, an exaggerated synonym is used for comic effect when Lord Ickenham asks &quot;What have you been doing, Bill Oakshott, to merit this reception—nay, this durbar?&quot;

Wodehouse uses clichés out of place or in unusual ways for humorous effect. An example occurs in chapter 6: &quot;Sometimes in our wanderings about the world we meet men of whom it is said that they have passed through the furnace. Of Sir Aylmer it would be more correct to say that he had passed through the frigidaire.&quot; Variations on Shakespearean quotations often appear in Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, as in chapter 6 when Lord Ickenham greets Bill Oakshott with &quot;Well met by moonlight, proud Oakshott.&quot;

==Publication history==
The first UK edition dust jacket was illustrated by Frank Ford. The first US edition dust jacket was illustrated by Hal McIntosh, and illustrations by McIntosh were included throughout the book.

A condensed version of the story was published in one issue of &quot;Liberty&quot; in April 1949, with illustrations by Hal McIntosh. A condensed version was also published in one issue of the Toronto &quot;Star Weekly&quot; on 30 April 1949.

The story was included in the 1983 collection &quot;The World of Uncle Fred&quot;, published by Hutchinson, London.

==Reception==
Wodehouse biographer Richard Usborne calls the book &quot;a brilliantly sustained rattle of word-perfect dialogue and narrative topping a very complicated and well-controlled plot.&quot;

==Adaptations==

&quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot; was adapted for television as a 60-minute episode of the NBC anthology series &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;. The episode first aired on 29 January 1950, and starred Arthur Treacher.

The story was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in six parts in 1994. The events of &quot;Uncle Fred Flits By&quot; were adapted in the first part as an introduction to the novel. The cast included Richard Briers as Uncle Fred, Hugh Grant as Pongo, Paul Eddington as the narrator, Simon Treves as Bill Oakshott, Charles Gray as Sir Aylmer Bostock, Josephine Tewson as Lady Bostock, Chris Emmett as Harold Potter, Teresa Gallagher as Elsie Bean, Susie Brann as Sally, Mary Chater as Hermione Bostock, Toby Longworth as Otis, and Donald Hewlett as Major Brabazon-Plank.

<text>Dixville Notch is an unincorporated community in Dixville township, Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population of the township, all of whom live in Dixville Notch, was 4 as of the 2020 census. The village is known for being the first place to declare its results during the New Hampshire presidential primary. It is located in the northern part of the state, approximately south of the border with the Canadian province of Quebec. The village is situated at about above sea level at the base of mountains.

The village shares its name with Dixville Notch, a mountain pass that lies about southeast of and uphill from the village. The notch is located between Dixville Peak and Sanguinary Mountain, separating the Connecticut River&#x27;s watershed from that of the Androscoggin River. The village is the location of The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, one of a handful of surviving New Hampshire grand hotels, situated on a plot, accommodating golfing in the summer and skiing in the winter.

Dixville Notch is part of the Berlin, NH–VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Neil Tillotson moved to Dixville Notch in 1954, and became the town moderator and owner of The Balsams. He did not like having to drive 45 minutes to the nearest polling station, but learned about midnight voting from an Associated Press reporter. The state legislature approved the town&#x27;s request to become a voting precinct. Tom Tillotson has been the town moderator since 1976. The town has six voters, four Republicans and two independents.

On November 5, 2024, the town residents would vote in the 2024 United States presidential election with 3 votes going to Harris and 3 votes going to Trump.

== Politics ==

===Midnight voting tradition===
Dixville Notch is best known in connection with its longstanding midnight vote in the U.S. presidential election, including during the New Hampshire primary, the first primary election in the U.S. presidential nomination process. In a tradition that started in the 1960 election, all the eligible voters in Dixville Notch gather at midnight in the ballroom of The Balsams. The voters cast their ballots and the polls are officially closed when all of the registered voters have voted – sometimes merely one minute later. The results of the Dixville Notch vote in both the New Hampshire primary and the general election are traditionally broadcast around the country immediately afterwards.

A similar tradition in the town of Hart&#x27;s Location in adjacent Carroll County began in 1948. Theirs was discontinued in the 1960s in light of the abundance of media attention, revived in 1996, and discontinued again in 2024. Informal competition for the distinction of the first town to report election results has been ongoing for several election cycles, among a number of small communities, including:

* Coos County:
** Dixville Notch
** Millsfield (the township to the south of Dixville township)
* Carroll County (to the southeast of Coos County):
** Hart&#x27;s Location
* Grafton County (to the southwest of Coos County):
** Ellsworth
** Waterville Valley

Press accounts occasionally state erroneously that Dixville Notch &quot;votes first&quot; in U.S. presidential elections. However, the village does hold a number of voting records within the United States:

* Longest continuous record of midnight voting
* Highest count of midnight presidential primaries (13 as of 2008, vs. 5 to 9 for Hart&#x27;s Location)
* At least one of the first handful of lawful votes, nationwide, in each presidential campaign&#x27;s binding primaries
* Often first to report its returns

Dixville Notch was granted the authority to conduct its own elections in 1960 and chose to open its polls at midnight. In 1964, the primary election returns were the first in New Hampshire to be reported by UPI and the Associated Press. Since then, Dixville Notch has gained international media attention as the first community to vote in the presidential primary season, since New Hampshire&#x27;s primary is required by state law to be scheduled earlier than any competitor. Dixville Notch also votes at midnight in the general presidential election in November, although this usually attracts less press attention than primary voting.

Although most New Hampshire polling stations open around sunrise and close in the early evening, Dixville Notch takes advantage of a state law that allows a precinct to close if all registered voters in that precinct have cast ballots. Consequently, all registered voters in Dixville Notch gather and are counted before the balloting takes place. The &quot;Ballot Room&quot; of the Balsams Hotel resort served as the polling place until a recent fire. This room featured separate voting booths for each citizen.

The tradition was first organized by prominent Dixville Notch resident Neil Tillotson (1898 – October 17, 2001), who was traditionally the first voter. He would reportedly hold his ballot over the ballot box while watching his wristwatch. At the moment of midnight, Tillotson would drop the ballot into the ballot box and the rest of the town&#x27;s residents would follow suit. Since Tillotson&#x27;s death from pneumonia in 2001 at the age of 102, the first voter has been chosen by random ballot beforehand.

In the presidential election of November 2, 2004, the village had 26 registered voters, roughly half of whom were registered as Republican. The other half were registered &quot;undeclared&quot; or unaffiliated with a party. New Hampshire law allows a voter to declare or change a party affiliation upon arriving at the polling place, meaning that a number of the town&#x27;s independent voters vote in the Democratic party primary.

The votes are counted immediately after all are received. The Dixville Notch results of the primary, and now the Hart&#x27;s Location ones as well, often lead morning news programs on election day. During every election year between 1968 and 2012, the candidate with the plurality of Dixville Notch&#x27;s voters has been the eventual Republican nominee for president. On the Democratic side, the village&#x27;s election results have less often predicted the nominee. In 2000, for example, Bill Bradley won the most votes among Dixville Notch&#x27;s Democratic primary voters, although Al Gore was the party&#x27;s eventual nominee.

The eventual nationwide winners for each contest are indicated in bold.

=== Federal voting results ===

==== Primaries ====
==== Presidential elections ====






In 1992, the Libertarian Party unsuccessfully attempted to capitalize upon Andre Marrou&#x27;s unexpectedly strong showing in Dixville Notch in the general election. In 2004, Democratic candidate Wesley Clark was the only contender to personally visit Dixville Notch. He was on hand when the votes were cast and counted, and he received the majority of Democratic votes cast. Clark placed third and received 13 percent of votes statewide.

In 2008, Senator Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win the community&#x27;s vote in a presidential election since 1968, by a margin of 15 to 6.

In 2012, the Dixville Notch result delivered a tie for the first time in its history, with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney receiving five votes each.

In 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won the community&#x27;s vote, beating Republican candidate Donald Trump, 4 to 2. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received one vote. Mitt Romney received a single write-in vote. Eight people voted in total.

In 2019, the community was at risk of losing its ability to conduct its own election and having to combine with another municipality for voting, as its population had been reduced to four people, one too few to hold all the positions needed to conduct an election in New Hampshire. Dixville Notch received a reprieve before the primary when a fifth person, Les Otten, developer of The Balsams, agreed to move there in time for the election.

When the community&#x27;s five residents convened for the 2020 primary, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg received three votes as a write-in candidate. The other two votes went to Democrats Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.

In 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden won over incumbent Republican Donald Trump, winning the votes of all five of the community&#x27;s voting residents.

In 2024, presidential candidate Nikki Haley won unanimous support of all six voting-age residents over former president Donald Trump during the New Hampshire GOP primary.

In 2024, the presidential election results resulted in a tie for the second time in its history, with three votes to Kamala Harris and three votes to Donald Trump.

== In popular culture ==
The community&#x27;s voting tradition received a nod in the 2002 third-season episode of US television program &quot;The West Wing&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;Hartsfield&#x27;s Landing&quot;, named after a town modeled on either Dixville Notch, or its companion, Hart&#x27;s Location.

<doc id="442856" wikidata="Q15077926" url="?curid=442856" title="Jerry Holkins">
<text>Jerry Holkins (born Parkinson; February 6, 1976) is an American writer. He is the co-creator and writer of the webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; along with its artist Mike Krahulik. Holkins sometimes uses the pseudonym &quot;Tycho Brahe&quot;, which is also the name of a Penny Arcade character based on Holkins.

Holkins is a co-founder of PAX (originally called the Penny Arcade Expo) a series of gaming festivals that began in 2004 and has been held around the world. He is also a co-founder of Child&#x27;s Play, a multimillion-dollar charity which organizes toy drives for children&#x27;s hospitals.

Holkins, along with Krahulik, was included in the Time 100 for 2010.

== Early life ==
Holkins was born in Auburn, Washington and grew up at least partly in Spokane, Washington. He met future collaborator Mike Krahulik at Mead High School, Spokane in 1993 or 1994 through the school newspaper, where they became friends. After graduating high school, Holkins and Krahulik shared an apartment together. Holkins moved to Seattle around 2000.

== Career ==

=== Penny Arcade ===

Holkins created the webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; in 1998 with Mike Krahulik, with Holkins writing and Krahulik illustrating. According to an oral history, the two submitted cartoons to a contest run by a magazine in 1998. The magazine did not accept them but the creators sought other places to publish them, and worked with a site called looneygames.com to create what would become Penny Arcade. The strip initially ran once a week. Around a year later, they created their own website for the strip. In addition to the comic, Holkins wrote accompanying blog posts. Initially, this was partly because the format of their website left blank space. Holkins says that while now the posts are a key part of the site, when they first started he would delete each post to make space for the next one so the early posts are lost. These posts are often computer and video game commentary, but also include personal reflections or rants. 

According to Julia Swan of the Museum of History and Innovation, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was one of the first, if not the first, highly successful webcomics. By 2000, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was profitable enough that Holkins could quit his day job. As of 2010, the strip was running three times a week and had about 3.5 million readers.

Holkins is also the basis for one of the two central characters in &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, &quot;Tycho Brahe&quot;. Holkins and Brahe share similar interests and personalities, though their appearances differ; for example, Tycho has mussed hair and sideburns, while Holkins&#x27;s head is shaven.

=== Child&#x27;s Play ===

Holkins, along with Krahulik and their business manager Robert Khoo, founded the charity Child&#x27;s Play in 2003. Child&#x27;s Play is a charitable organization that donates toys and games to children&#x27;s hospitals worldwide. The charity was founded in part to refute mainstream media&#x27;s perception of gamers as violent and antisocial. As of 2017, Child&#x27;s Play had processed $44,538,978 in donations since its inception.

=== PAX gaming conventions ===

PAX (originally known as Penny Arcade Expo) is a series of gaming culture festivals involving tabletop, arcade, and video gaming. PAX is held annually in Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, and San Antonio in the United States; and Melbourne in Australia.

PAX was originally created in 2004 by Holkins and Krahulik because they wanted to attend a show exclusively for gaming. Defining characteristics of the shows include an opening keynote speech from an industry insider, game-culture inspired concerts, panels on game topics, exhibitor booths from both independent and major game developers and publishers, a LAN party multiplayer, tabletop gaming tournaments, and video game freeplay areas.

=== Other work ===

Holkins and Krahulik played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition in Seattle for a day prior to its release, with Krahulik, Chris Perkins from Wizards of the Coast, Scott Kurtz of &quot;PvP&quot;, and Wil Wheaton. Jerry is also featured in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition and 5th edition podcast, playing a character named Omin Dran, a Cleric of the Goddess Tymora (formerly Avandra), and CEO of an adventuring party named Acquisitions Incorporated. This has expanded into another streamed game entitled Acquisitions Incorporated: The &quot;C&quot; Team. This work has led to official D&amp;D products featuring the Acquisitions Incorporated concept and characters.

Holkins wrote &quot;The Lookouts&quot;, a comic which imagines a Boy Scouts-like group in a fantasy setting. Initial versions were written by Holkins and illustrated by Krahulik, while the final version was also co-written by Ben McCool, with art done by Robb Mommaerts and colors by Rainer Petter. The premise has also been adapted into a short live-action film.

Holkins wrote a book of poetry called &quot;Lexcalibur&quot;, featuring poems about D&amp;D-style adventuring with illustrations by Krahulik.

Holkins created a fictional fantasy series called &quot;Epic Legends of the Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga&quot; as a parody of generic fantasy fiction, and created a wiki for others to make up lore and backstory for the series. It rapidly grew in size as &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; fans joined in expanding the parody to describe the non-existent books, spinoffs, and life of the author.

== Writing style ==
A review of &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; in 1Up.com said of Holkins, &quot;Language itself, whether dirty or clean, is increasingly a focus [of the comic] as Holkins stretches himself to work his favored baroque dialogue and unusual words into the script.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Holkins is married to his wife Brenna. They have two daughters, Samantha and Ronia. In a tweet, Holkins said that his surname &quot;is a combination of Holcomb (hers) and Parkinson (mine).&quot; Old versions of the Penny Arcade site credit the work to &quot;Mike Krahulik and Jerry Parkinson&quot;.

Holkins said in his Penny Arcade Podcast that he sings and plays guitar in the band The Fine Print, and that his band once opened for the band Anal Cunt.

<doc id="442857" wikidata="Q2996249" url="?curid=442857" title="Convention of 1836">
<text>The Convention of 1836 was the meeting of elected delegates in Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas in March 1836. The Texas Revolution had begun five months previously, and the interim government, known as the Consultation, had wavered over whether to declare independence from Mexico or pledge to uphold the repudiated Mexican Constitution of 1824. Unlike those of previous Texas councils, delegates to the Convention of 1836 were younger, more recent arrivals to Texas, and more adamant on the question of independence. As delegates prepared to convene, Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led a large army into Texas to quell the revolt; the vanguard of this army arrived at San Antonio de Bexar on February 23.

The Convention was called to order on March 1, and the following day adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence, written by George Childress. Delegates elected an interim government, led by President David G. Burnet and developed a Texas Constitution, which they based primarily on the Constitution of the United States. On March 6 they received a missive from the Texan soldiers besieged at the Alamo, and delegate and commander-in-chief Sam Houston narrowly persuaded the men to continue their work on the constitution rather than rush to aid the soldiers. After the Alamo fell, Santa Anna&#x27;s army marched towards Washington-on-the-Brazos, prompting the new government to flee.

==Background==

The Texas Revolution began October 2, 1835 with the Battle of Gonzales. The following month, previously elected delegates convened in a body known as the Consultation. These delegates served as a temporary governing body for Texas, as they struggled with the question of whether Texans were fighting for independence from Mexico or the reimplementation of the Mexican Constitution of 1824, which offered greater freedoms than the current dictatorship. Many Consultation members wished to defer independence until the United States was persuaded to support their struggle. The Consultation quickly degenerated into near anarchy, with the interim legislature indicting the interim Governor, who promptly disbanded the legislature.

On December 10, the Council passed a resolution calling for a new convention of delegates, to convene on March 1, 1836. There was no consensus among Council members as to what the new convention should accomplish. Some wanted the convention to form a new government for Texas, and others insisted on the preservation of the Mexican Constitution of 1824. One of the Consultation delegates wrote to Sam Houston that &quot;I sincerely hope the Convention will remedy the existing evils and calm the Public since if not Texas must be lost.&quot;

Over the next few months, the provisional government of Texas essentially collapsed. By February, most Consultation members had returned home or to the army.

By the end of 1835, no Mexican troops remained in Texas. As early as October, however, Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna had been making plans to quell the unrest in Texas. He stepped down from his duties as president to lead what he dubbed the Army of Operations in Texas, which would put an end to the Texas revolt. Personally leading his forces, Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 12. Santa Anna and his advance force arrived in San Antonio de Bexar on February 23 and immediately initiated a siege of the Texas forces garrisoned at the Alamo.

==Delegates==
Elections were scheduled for February 1, 1836. There was much disagreement throughout Texas as to whether voting rights should extend to Tejanos or recent arrivals from the United States who had joined the Army of the People. The Consultation had specified that voting rights would be extended to all Tejanos &quot;opposed to a Central Government&quot; and indicated that army volunteers could only vote by proxy in their home districts. This bill was vetoed by provisional governor Smith, who believed that no Tejanos should be allowed to vote. In an editorial, the &quot;Telegraph and Texas Register&quot; echoed the concerns of many that the newly arrived recruits &quot;cannot be acquainted either with the state of the country or the character and pretensions of the candidates&quot; and advocated a residency requirement. Because the army was concentrated in only two areas, their numbers often overwhelmed those of the local residents.

The Consultation reorganized the voting districts. San Augustine, Harrisburg, and Gonzales each received four fewer delegates than in the past, and Milam received three fewer delegates. With little actual guidance from the Consultation, voting in each municipality was subject to local traditions. In some areas, such as the Jackson district, citizens held a meeting in January to determine if they were for independence or federalism. Once consensus was reached that they wanted independence, only candidates who agreed with that platform were considered. Other areas offered no actual choice; in Mina, the only candidates to run for office were the local &quot;empresario&quot;, Sterling C. Robertson, and his nephew, George C. Childress. For most of the region, however, candidates engaged in lively debate about either the issues or the personalities of their opponents.

The soldiers who had flocked to the army were determined to vote, regardless of how long they had actually been in Texas or whether they intended to stay. In at least one instance, in Matagorda, soldiers who had been discharged from service voted in the election while they were en route to the United States. There was no consistency in how the votes of active volunteers were handled. In Goliad, soldiers held their own election for two delegates. In nearby San Patricio, locals refused to allow the soldiers to vote; their results were later overturned by the Convention. Soldiers turned away in Refugio simply held their own election.

In the Nacogdoches district, soldiers under Sidney Sherman threatened violence after they were turned away from the polling place. Sherman vowed that he &quot;had come to Texas to fight for it and has as soon commence in the town of Nacogdoches as elsewhere.&quot; Anxious to avoid an armed fight, election judges asked the public to vote on whether the troops should be allowed to vote. The soldiers lost by 30 votes, yet refused to back down, insisting that the voting had been rigged. Finally, one of the candidates, Thomas Jefferson Rusk, talked the judges into allowing the soldiers to vote. In the final results in Nacogdoches, Rusk and one other pro-independence candidate, Robert Potter, were named delegates, along with pro-federalist candidates John S. Roberts and Charles S. Taylor.

A similar melee was avoided in Bexar, where army commander James C. Neill worked out a compromise with local civilian authorities. The garrison held their own election to name two delegates, while Bexar citizens - primarily Tejanos - who took an oath of allegiance to the provisional government could elect an additional 4 men. The two men almost unanimously elected by the garrison, Samuel Maverick and Jesse Badgett were staunch supporters of independence. Several soldiers also received votes in the locals&#x27; election, although the final delegates were locals. Soldier Amos Pollard threatened that if the locals did not vote for independence, they might want to rethink the idea of coming home.

This convention differed from the previous Texas councils of 1832, 1833, and the Consultation. Many of the delegates to the 1836 convention were young men who had only recently arrived in Texas, although many of them had participated in one of the battles in 1835. Most of the delegates were members of the War Party and were adamant that Texas must declare its independence from Mexico.

A total of 59 delegates were elected to the Convention, 5 more than were supposed to attend. This was largely due to the extra elections soldiers had conducted. Over one-third of the delegates came from extreme east or west Texas, areas not represented at the Consultation. Five delegates attended from the Red River district, an area disputed between Texas and the United States (and now considered part of Arkansas). The delegates were largely new to politics; only 13 of them had taken part in the Consultation, 7 in the Conventions of 1832 or 1833, and only 8 had held local office during Mexican rule. Fewer than 20% of the delegates had participated in the 1835 Committees of Safety. Neither the governor, Smith, or the acting governor, Robinson, were elected as delegates to the Convention. Notably, a few delegates did have extensive public service experience. Lorenzo de Zavala was a former governor of the State of Mexico., and Jose Antonio Navarro had served in the Mexican legislature. Potter, Childress, Richard Ellis and Samuel Price Carson each had significant political experience in the United States.

The average age of the Convention delegates was 37.4, over a year younger than those elected to the Consultation. They had lived in Texas an average of 4 years, a relatively low length of time considering that this included two men - Jose Francisco Ruiz and Navarro - who had been born in Texas. A full quarter of the delegates had lived in Texas less than a year, and 42% for less than two years.

The army&#x27;s influence was obvious. Forty percent of the delegates (24 men) had served in the army in October–December 1835. Four other delegates were directly related to men serving in the army. These numbers meant the army bloc was just shy of a majority of delegates, ensuring that the army&#x27;s needs would actually be addressed this time.

==Proceedings==

Forty-one delegates arrived in Washington-on-the-Brazos on February 28. By the time the convention concluded, the final number of delegates reached 59 delegates. Notable members of the delegates assembled included future president of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston, and Mexican politician Lorenzo de Zavala. The convention was convened on March 1 with Richard Ellis as president.

The delegates assigned George Childress to lead a committee of five to draft a Declaration of Independence. Childress, the nephew of empresario Sterling C. Robertson, had been elected to the Convention three weeks after his arrival in Texas. The committee submitted its draft within a mere 24 hours, leading historians to speculate that Childress had written much of it before his arrival at the Convention. The declaration was approved on March 2 with no debate. Based primarily on the writings of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, the declaration proclaimed that the Mexican government &quot;ceased to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are derived&quot; and complained about &quot;arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny&quot;. The declaration officially established the Republic of Texas.

Shortly after adopting the declaration of independence, the delegates began to work on a new Constitution. It drew heavily from the United States Constitution and included a declaration of rights (similar to the Bill of Rights) which guaranteed due process, the right of every citizen to bear arms, and freedom of religion, speech, and press. The declaration of rights also outlawed unreasonable search and seizure, debtors&#x27; prison, and cruel or unusual punishments. It omitted the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution and instead explicitly authorized the government to quarter troops in private homes and impress property as needed for the war effort.

In a departure from the traditional Texas justice system, the Constitution called for grand jury indictments and speedy public trials with juries. Unlike the United States Constitution, however, the Texas Constitution codified racism. Free blacks were forbidden permanent residence in Texas without consent of Congress, and citizenship could not be granted to Africans, their descendants, or Native Americans. Furthermore, the Constitution forbade the future Texas Congress from emancipating slaves, and instructed slaveholders not to emancipate their own slaves without Congress&#x27;s consent. Citizenship was granted only to white men. The new Constitution specifically stated that governmental authority derived from the people, who thus had the right to revolt to change their government.

The largest debates centered around land policy, as delegates struggled to balance the competing claims of natives, settlers, army volunteers, and colonizers. Every single proposal for a new land policy was sent back to committee or defeated, until the last day. The new policy benefited settlers and army volunteers, ensuring they would get the land promised when they emigrated. All surveys completed before November 1835 were validated, and any issued since – when the land offices were supposed to be closed – were vacated. All further surveys were banned until the new Congress could establish a land office. Additionally, three controversial land grants were overturned.

On the morning of March 6, the Convention received a letter, dated March 3, from Alamo commander William B. Travis. Travis begged for supplies and reinforcements and described the danger he and his men found themselves in. Unaware that the fort had already fallen, delegate Robert Potter called for the Convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston persuaded the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to finish working on the constitution. Houston then left to take command of the volunteers that Colonel James C. Neill and Major R.M. &quot;Three-Legged Willie&quot; Williamson had been gathering in Gonzales. Shortly after Houston&#x27;s arrival in Gonzales, Alamo survivors Susanna Dickinson and Joe, Travis&#x27;s slave, arrived with news of a Mexican victory. On hearing their news, Houston advised all civilians in the area to evacuate and ordered the army to retreat. This sparked a mass exodus of Texans from the Anglo settlements.

Concerned that the existing army was not large enough, on March 12 the Convention issued a conscription law. All able-bodied white and Tejano men between ages 17 and 50 were subject to military service. Local authorities would assign two-thirds of the men in their district to fight at any one time. Those who refused to serve would lose their citizenship and half of their property. Tejanos would not serve alongside the Anglos, but would instead have a separate corps.
After finishing their constitution, the delegates organized an ad-interim government which would serve until the following October. As president they chose David G. Burnet, who had not been elected to the Convention. Burnet had planned to join the fighting at the Alamo and had stopped at the Convention to recruit others. However, he became so &quot;inspired by their deliberations&quot; that he remained as a visitor. Speaking privately with many of the delegates, Burnet professed that he would be willing to serve as president of a new republic, even if that made him a target of Santa Anna. Among the names most commonly circulated for the presidency were empresario Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston, and 
William H. Wharton. All were absent from the convention, however, so the nominees became Burnet and Samuel Price Carson. Burnet won, on a vote of 29–23, in the early hours of March 17. The delegates chose Lorenzo de Zavala as vice-president, Samuel P. Carson as Secretary of State, and Thomas J. Rusk as Secretary of War. Bailey Hardeman became Secretary of the Treasury, and David Thomas was elected Attorney General.

One of Burnet&#x27;s first acts as president was to transfer the capital of the new state from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Harrisburg, which was located nearer the small Texas Navy at Galveston Island. Harrisburg was also closer to the border with the United States and would allow easier communication with U.S. officials. The move took on a sense of urgency when the convention received word that Santa Anna was within of Washington-on-the-Brazos. Burnet quickly adjourned the proceedings and the government fled. Burnet personally carried the Texas Declaration of Independence in his saddlebags.

<text>The raptor subfamily Perninae includes a number of medium-sized broad-winged species. These are birds of warmer climates, although the &quot;Pernis&quot; species (European honey buzzard and crested honey buzzard) have a more extensive range.

Several of the species in this group eat mainly insects, and the honey-buzzards are specialist feeders on wasp larvae. Reptiles are also taken by several birds in this group.

Several authorities consider Gypaetinae to be within or even synonymous with Perninae.

==Taxonomy==
The cladogram of the Perninae shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae by Therese Catanach and collaborators that was published in 2024.

<text>Puji Temple () is a Buddhist temple located on the island of Putuoshan in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China.

== History ==


===Five dynasties===
In 916, in the 2nd year of Zhenming period (915–921) of the Later Liang dynasty (907–923), when Japanese monk took a statue of Guanyin he invited from Mount Wutai in Shanxi, he was blocked by windstorm in Mount Putuo, which made him think of that Guanyin didn&#x27;t want to go to the east. Hui&#x27;e gone ashore and left the statue to a resident surnamed Zhang to enshrine. He also built the &quot;Unwilling Guanyin Temple&quot; ().

===Song dynasty===
In 1080, during the Song dynasty (960–1279), Emperor Shenzong renamed the temple &quot;Baotuo Guanyin Temple&quot; (). Shenzong donated lands to the temple, and a new monk was ordained every year. (After the temple was renamed, the old name for the temple was still used to refer to a nearby hill, purple bamboo forest (), on which a 20 metre tall Guanyin now stands.) The monks studied Buddhism and the temple slowly prospered.

In 1214, still in the Song dynasty, Emperor Ningzong donated tens of thousands of &quot;min&quot; (lines of cash) to the temple and presented them with a sign reading &quot;Yuantong Hall&quot; ().

===Yuan dynasty===
In 1298 by order of Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Li Ying () repaired the temple, completing the work in 1301. The monks were given over 4000 mu (2.7 km2) of land, and 20 &quot;min&quot; of government funds. In 1299, Yishan Yining, the abbot of the temple, was appointed the director of Buddhist teaching for the region () and was sent as an emissary to Japan by the emperor.

In the winter of 1313, the Emperor Renzong&#x27;s mother sent an envoy to present the temple with 868 metal bars and three qing of land, and to make offerings.

In 1327, Emperor Taiding presented the temple with 1000 metal bars and 2 &quot;qing&quot; 26 &quot;mu&quot; of land.

===Ming dynasty===
In 1386, during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Duke Tang () was asked to come to the mainland to advise the Emperor. He brought with him 30,000 people from 46 islands, including the monks of Putuoshan. At the same time, Duke Tang ordered the burning of 300 temples on Putuoshan. He also moved a large statue of Guanyin to &quot;Xixin Temple&quot; () on the mainland, which was then renamed &quot;Putuo&quot; (). (The temple is now known as Qita Temple. It is located in Ningbo.)

In 1515, the Buddhist community began to recover through donations and alms.

In 1553, the Ming government under the Jiajing Emperor moved the monks and destroyed temples once more.

In 1572, a monk named Zhen Song () came to Putuoshan to help rebuild it to its former glory.

In 1574, a monk named Zhen Biao () wanted to ascend the mountain to locate the site of old Bao Guo Si (), destroyed 200 years earlier, but was not allowed. Despite this, he still ascended the mountain and located the old site of the temple, and managed to rebuild a small monastery, only to have it destroyed by a military commander Xu Jingxing (). Afterwards, Zhou Liangbin (), a Ningbo government official, had Zhen Biao and a group of nuns punished. Fours years later, Zhen Biao was made abbot. He had the Hall of Heavenly Kings () and one other hall built.

In 1605, in the 33rd year of Wanli period (1573–1620), Wanli Emperor named it &quot;Huguo Yongshou Putuo Chan Temple&quot; ().

==Architecture==
Puji Temple is the largest Buddhist temple in Mount Putuo, the temple is also the main temple enshrining Guanyin. It is known as &quot;Front Temple&quot; since it located in the southern foot of Lingjiu Peak. Along the central axis are Shanmen, Four Heavenly Kings Hall, Mahavira Hall, Yuantong Hall, Buddhist Texts Library, etc. There are over 600 halls and rooms on both sides, including Hall of Guru, Hall of Arhat, Dining Hall and Meditation Hall.

===Yuantong Hall===
Yuantong Hall () is the main hall to enshrine Guanyin. It was built in 1214 during the Southern Song dynasty and rebuilt in 1693 during the reign of Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. The hall is high, wide and deep. It is single-layer and double-eave wooden structure and covered with yellow glazed tiles on the roof with solemn and elegant cornices. A statue of Guanyin is enshrined in the hall. He wears heavenly crown which has a statue of Amitabha posing in mudras on it. On the two sides of the hall sit 32 statues of Guanyin, representing his various appearances in the world.

===Multi-Treasure Pagoda===
The Multi-Treasure Pagoda () was built in 1334 during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). It is the earliest existing architecture in Mount Putuo.

===Free Life Pond===
The Free Life Pond in front of Puji Temple is reputed for the five-color twin lotus. The Yongshou Bridge () was built in 1606 in the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

<doc id="442863" wikidata="Q3508729" url="?curid=442863" title="Occipital horn syndrome">
<text>Occipital horn syndrome (OHS), formerly considered a variant of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, is an X-linked recessive mitochondrial and connective tissue disorder. It is caused by a deficiency in the transport of the essential mineral copper, associated with mutations in the ATP7A gene.

Only about 2/3 of children with OHS are thought to have genetically inherited the disorder; the other 1/3 do not have the disease in their family history. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive the disease affects more males. This is because they do not have a second X chromosome, unlike females, so essentially are lacking the &#x27;backup&#x27; copy with proper function. Females are much more likely to be carriers only. For a female to be affected they must carry two defective X chromosomes, not just one.

The disorder is considered a milder variant of Menkes disease.

== Signs and symptoms ==
It is characterized by a deficiency in biliary copper excretion that causes deformations in the skeleton. These include projections on the back of the skull (parasagittal bone exostoses arising from the occipital bone—the so-called &quot;occipital horns&quot;) as well as deformities of the elbow, radial head dislocation, hammer-shaped lateral ends of the clavicles, and abnormalities of the hips and pelvis.
OHS presents in early to middle childhood. Children may present with features such as:
==Causes==
OHS is a milder allelic variant of Menkes disease, having a later age of onset and being associated with far less severe central neurodegeneration. The milder nature of OHS is often attributable to &#x27;leaky&#x27; splice junction mutations that allow 20–30% of ATP7A messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to be correctly processed. As in cases of Menkes disease, individuals with OHS manifest connective tissue abnormalities resulting from deficient activity of lysyl oxidase, a copper-requiring enzyme that normally deaminates lysine and hydroxylysine in the first step of collagen crosslink formation. Such individuals also often endure inconvenient dysautonomic signs and symptoms related to a partial deficiency in dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. DBH, another copper-dependent enzyme, normally converts dopamine to norepinephrine, a crucial neurotransmitter in norepinephrinergic neurons. A natural mouse model of OHS, the so-called mottled blotchy model, recapitulates the connective tissue abnormalities, DBH deficiency and mild CNS damage seen in humans.

==Diagnosis==
The initial diagnosis of Menkes disease (MD) and its milder variants such as Occipital Horn Syndrome is based on the clinical symptoms. Low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels support the clinical suspicion of OHS, but biochemical confirmation in tissue culture is needed. The ultimate diagnostic proof is the demonstration of a molecular defect in ATP7A. Demonstration of the bony protuberances on the occiput will clinch the diagnosis, and these can be palpated in some patients.

==Treatment==
Courses of treatment for children with OHS is dependent upon the severity of their case. Children with OHS often receive physical and occupational therapy. They may require a feeding tube to supplement nourishment if they are not growing enough. In an attempt to improve the neurological condition (seizures) copper histidine or copper chloride injections can be given early in the child&#x27;s life.
However, copper histidine injections have been shown ineffective for treating the connective tissue manifestations of OHS.

== Prognosis ==
The long term natural history of OHS is not known. Some patients have died suddenly as young as 17 years of age, whereas one patient has survived to age 57. Causes of death include respiratory failure, aortic aneurysm, and intracranial hemorrhage.
== Research ==
The NIH and Cyprium Therapeutics are coordinating the joint-development of an Adeno-Associated virus gene therapy named AAV-ATP7A, for Menkes disease and its milder variants such as Occipital Horn Syndrome. In March 2017, Cyprium Therapeutics acquired the World-Wide development and commercial rights to the Menkes program at NIH/NICHD through CRADA and licensing agreements with NICHD. AAV-ATP7A is still in pre-clinical stage, although it has received orphan drug designation from the FDA.

<doc id="442869" wikidata="Q159527" url="?curid=442869" title="Mauser C96">
<text>The Mauser C96 (&quot;Construktion 96&quot;) is a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by German arms manufacturer Mauser from 1896 to 1937. Unlicensed copies of the gun were also manufactured in Spain and China in the first half of the 20th century.

The distinctive characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger, the long barrel, the wooden shoulder stock, which gives it the stability of a short-barreled rifle and doubles as a holster or carrying case, and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom. The grip earned the gun the nickname &quot;broomhandle&quot; in the English-speaking world, and in China the C96 was nicknamed the &quot;box cannon&quot; () because of its rectangular internal magazine and because it could be holstered in its wooden box-like detachable stock.

With its long barrel and high-velocity cartridge, the Mauser C96 had superior range and better penetration than most other pistols of its era; the 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge was the highest-velocity commercially manufactured pistol cartridge until the advent of the .357 Magnum cartridge in 1935.

Mauser manufactured approximately one million C96 pistols, while the number produced in Spain and China is large but unknown due to poor production records.

==History==

Within a year of its introduction in 1896, the C96 had been sold to governments and commercially to civilians and individual military officers. The Mauser C96 pistol was extremely popular with British officers at the time, and many purchased it privately. Mauser supplied the C96 to Westley Richards in the UK for resale. By the onset of World War I, the C96&#x27;s popularity with the British military had waned.

As a military sidearm, the pistols saw service in various wars including the Easter Rising and Irish War of Independence, as well as World War I and the Irish Civil War, when the gun was nicknamed &quot;Peter the Painter&quot;, after the contemporary Latvian anarchist of the same name (so nicknamed by the Metropolitan Police) who was believed to use this gun, and because the pistol grip looked like a brush handle, the Estonian War of Independence, the Spanish Civil War, the Chinese Civil War, and World War II. During the Warlord Era in China, European embargoes on exporting rifles to Chinese warlords meant that the C96 became a mainstay of the period&#x27;s armies, and the basic form of the pistol was extensively copied. The C96 also became a staple of Bolshevik commissars from one side and various warlords and gang leaders from another in the Russian Civil War, known simply as &quot;the Mauser&quot;. Communist revolutionaries Yakov Yurovsky and Peter Ermakov used Mausers to execute the Russian imperial family in July 1918.

Winston Churchill was fond of the Mauser C96 and used one at the 1898 Battle of Omdurman and during the Second Boer War; Lawrence of Arabia carried a Mauser C96 for a period, during his time in the Middle East. Indian revolutionary Ram Prasad Bismil and his partymen used these Mauser pistols in the historic Kakori train robbery in August 1925. Chinese communist general, Zhu De, carried a Mauser C96 during his Nanchang Uprising and later conflicts; his gun (with his name printed on it) is in the Beijing war museum.

Three Mauser C96s were used in the killing of Spanish prime minister Eduardo Dato in 1921, and a Mauser C96 was used in the assassination of the King of Yugoslavia, Alexander I of Yugoslavia, in 1934.

Imported and domestic copies of the C96 were used extensively by the Chinese in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, as well as by the Spanish during the Spanish Civil War and the Germans in World War II.

Besides the standard 7.63×25mm chambering, C96 pistols were also commonly chambered for 9×19mm Parabellum, with a small number also being produced in 9mm Mauser Export. In 1940, Mauser officials proposed using the C-96 as the vehicle for an upgrade to the 9×25mm Mauser Export cartridge to match the ballistics of the .357 Magnum. Lastly, there was a Chinese-manufactured model chambered for .45 ACP. Despite the pistol&#x27;s worldwide popularity and fame, China was the only nation to use the C96 as the primary service pistol of its military and police.

==Contract variants==
===1897 Turkish Army Mauser===
Mauser&#x27;s first military contract was with the Ottoman government in 1897. They ordered 1,000 pistols for the royal palace guards. They had their own range of serial numbers, running from 1 to 1000. They differ in that they use a Farsi number system on the tangent sight and serial number, and the weapon is designated in the Muslim calendar year number system &quot;1314&quot; in place of the year of the Gregorian calendar &quot;1896/1897&quot;. Markings include a six-pointed star on both sides of the chamber and the crest of Sultan Abdul Hamid II (a trophy of crossed Turkish flags, various polearms, and a collection of his royal awards and honours) and the Muslim year &quot;1314&quot; on the square left rear frame panel. Under the sultan&#x27;s rule, there was great concern about potential military coups, and most weapons were locked away in armories, including many of the C96 pistols. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908-1909, these pistols were issued to the army and police for service use. Some were used in combat in World War I, and after the war they were considered obsolete, being put up for sale cheaply to army or police officers. All of this meant that they saw a lot of use and as a result few specimens survive today, many of them in quite harsh conditions.

===1899 Italian Navy Mauser===
In 1899, the Italian government ordered Mauser&#x27;s first major military contract; an order for 5,000 C96 pistols for the Italian Royal Navy. They differ in that their receivers are &quot;slab-sided&quot; (i.e., lacked the milling on the sides found on commercial Mausers). They also have a &quot;ring hammer&quot; (spurless hammer with a hole through its head) instead of the early &quot;cone hammer&quot; (spurless hammer with ribbed cone-like projections on the sides of its head). These guns had their own serial number range, running from 1 to 5000.

===1910 Persian contract Mauser===
The Persian government ordered 1,000 pistols. They have the Persian government&#x27;s &quot;Lion and Sun&quot; insignia on the rectangular milled panel on the left side of the receiver and the serial numbers range from 154000 to 154999. It is often confused with the Turkish contract Mauser.

===M1916 Austrian contract===
Austria-Hungary ordered 50,000 Mausers in the standard 7.63×25mm. A small number were rebarreled to 8mm Gasser (8.11×27mm) for an unknown reason.

===M1916 Prussian &quot;Red 9&quot;===
During World War I, the Imperial German Army contracted with Mauser for 150,000 C96 pistols chambered in 9mm Parabellum to offset the slow production of the standard-issue DWM P.08 pistol. They use the same clip-loaded internal box magazines as the 7.63mm Mauser and also hold ten rounds. This variant of the C96 was named the &quot;Red 9&quot; after a large number &quot;9&quot; burned into the grip panels and painted in red. (This was done to warn the pistols&#x27; users not to incorrectly load them with 7.63mm ammunition.) Because the army delegated the branding to unit armourers, not all 9mm pistols carry the nine. Of the 150,000 pistols commissioned, approximately 137,000 were delivered before the war ended. Original 9mm pistols can be told from 7.63mm-to-9mm conversions because they have 9mm-rated sights (marked &quot;50 m-500 m&quot;) rather than 7.63mm-rated sights (marked &quot;50 m-800 m&quot;).

===M1920 French police contract===
The French government set up an order for 2,000 pistols with barrels for the Gendarmerie Nationale. The pistol has black ebonite grips rather than wooden ones.

===WW2 Luftwaffe contract===
The German government purchased 7,800 commercial M1930 pistols in 1940 for use by the Luftwaffe. They have Wehrmacht proof marks and the Mauser serial numbers come from the early- to mid-1930s. The weapon had ceased production in 1937 but the order was filled from remaining stocks. According to Kersten, Moll and Schmid, these were likely purchased by the high command of the armed forces and issued to motorcycle and flak crews of the Luftwaffe.

==Major variants==
There were many variants of the C96 besides the standard commercial model; the most common are detailed below.

===M1896 &quot;Kavallerie Karabiner&quot;===
One of the experimental ideas was the creation of a pistol-carbine for use by light cavalry. They had &quot;slab-sided&quot; receivers, standard 10-round magazines, permanently affixed wooden stocks and forends, and lengthened (early production) or (late production) barrels. They were dropped from production after 1899 due to poor sales and little military interest.

There was limited sporting interest in the carbine version and, due to small production numbers, it is a highly prized collectable priced at about twice the value of the pistol version. Recently, importers like Navy Arms imported replica Mauser carbines with 16-inch or longer barrels for sale in the US.

===M1896 compact Mauser===
A version of the Mauser pistol with a full-sized grip, six-shot internal magazine, and a barrel. Production was phased out by 1899.

===M1896 officer&#x27;s model===
This is the unofficial term for a variant compact Mauser with a curved wooden or hard-rubber grip, like that of the &quot;Reichsrevolver&quot;. The name comes from the US Army designation of the Mauser pistol sent to participate in their self-loading pistol trials.

===M1898 pistol carbine===
This was the first model to come cut for a combination wooden stock-holster. The stock doubles as a case or holster and attaches to a slot cut in the grip frame.

===M1912 Mauser Export model===
This model was the first to chamber the 9×25mm Mauser Export cartridge. It was designed to appeal to the arms markets in South America and China. Mauser C96 pistols in this caliber usually have an indentation milled into the upper surface of the magazine&#x27;s follower to facilitate feeding of the straight-cased 9×25mm cartridge cases. The rifling in the barrel has a unique 13:8 twist. In addition, the flat surfaces extending around the chamber are longer, to accommodate the higher pressures of the 9×25mm cartridge. Examples of Mauser C96s in this caliber are rare, but are still occasionally found on the private collector&#x27;s market. The 9×25mm Mauser Export calibre receded from the market as the armaments industry reoriented itself towards military manufacture during World War I, but the round enjoyed a resurgence in popularity as a submachine gun calibre in the 1930s.

===M1917 Mauser trench carbine===

This model features an extended stock and barrel similar to the M1896 &quot;Kavallerie Karabiner&quot;. It also possesses a 40-round magazine and is chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. The M1917 Mauser trench carbine was introduced during World War I and was intended to be a cheaper replacement for the expensive Lange &quot;Pistole&quot; 08 in close-quarters combat. However, the Imperial German Army did not believe it was a cost-effective substitute, and the project was shortly abandoned with only a few ever made.

===M1920 Mauser rework===
The Treaty of Versailles (signed in 1919) imposed a number of restrictions on pistol barrel lengths and calibres on German arms manufacturers. Pistols for German government issue or domestic market sales could not have a barrel longer than 4 inches and could not be chambered for 9 mm cartridges.

The Weimar Republic banned the private ownership of military-issue or military-style weapons in an attempt to recover valuable arms from returning soldiers. The confiscated weapons were then used to arm government forces, leaving them with a hodge-podge of military and civilian arms. To meet the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, a major reworking project was begun that set about converting these weapons.

To be compliant, pre-war C.96 models belonging to the Weimar government had to have their barrels cut down to . This meant that their tangent sights had to be replaced with fixed sights. They also had to be converted to the standard 7.63×25mm Mauser round, though a few hybrid Mausers were made with salvaged Navy Luger barrels that were chambered for 7.65mm Parabellum. Compliant confiscated government-issue guns were marked &quot;M1920&quot;. This practice was continued on German service pistols even after the ban was ignored and the conversions had stopped.
===M1921 &quot;Bolo&quot; Mauser===
Mauser began manufacturing a compliant version of the C96 for commercial sale from 1920 to 1921. It featured smaller grips, a shorter barrel, and was chambered for the standard 7.63×25mm Mauser. An experimental 8.15×25.2mm Mauser cartridge (DWM 580) was used to replace the banned 9×19mm Parabellum and 9×25mm Mauser Export cartridges for domestic sales but it never supplanted the 9 mm calibre.

Mass-production of the weapon was from 1921 to 1930. It was sold in quantity to armies in the contested Baltic region and was carried by the Poles, Lithuanians, German &quot;Freikorps&quot; and White Russians. The Bolshevik government (and later the new Red Army) of the embryonic Soviet Union purchased large numbers of this model in the 1920s and also appropriated them from defeated enemies. The distinctive pistol became associated with the Bolsheviks and was thus nicknamed the &quot;Bolo&quot;. The &quot;Bolo&quot; model was also popular elsewhere, as the shorter barrel and smaller overall size made the gun easier to conceal.

There was also a transitional version in 1930 that used the &quot;Bolo&quot; frame but with a longer barrel.

===M1930 Mauser===
Also known as the &quot;M30&quot; by collectors, it was a simplification and improvement of the M1921 Mauser. It simplified production by removing several fine-machining details and reverted to the &quot;pre-war&quot; large grip and long barrel. The early model M30s had a barrel, but later models had the traditional barrel. It was made from 1930 until 1937.

Joseph Nickl designed a selective-fire conversion in 1930. It tended to &quot;cook off&quot; (fire by spontaneous ignition of the propellant when overheated) when fired in long bursts. 4,000 of this model were made between 1930 and 1931.

Since the M1932 / M712 variant was full-auto, the semi-auto M1930 it was derived from was sometimes called the &quot;M711&quot; by war surplus dealers and collectors.

===M1932/M712 &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot;===

The Spanish gunmaking firms of Beistegui Hermanos and Astra began producing detachable magazine-fed, select-fire versions of the C96 in 1927 and 1928 respectively, intended for export to the Far East.

Mauser began production of the &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; (rapid fire), their own select-fire, detachable magazine version of the M30 designed by Karl Westinger. Production started in 1932 and ended in 1936, which has led to its unofficial designation of &quot;M1932&quot; by collectors. An extremely successful design, around 98,000 guns were made overall and they had their own series of serial numbers.

It was largely intended for export to South America and China or to the opposing sides in the later Spanish Civil War. From 1932 to 1935, the Yugoslavian military tested batches of the Schnellfeuer in both 7.63mm and 9mm Parabellum for the purpose of arming mountain troops and special operations units. Improvements requested by the Yugoslavs included a detachable barrel, improved front and rear sights, more durable parts to prevent breakage under sustained fire and lowered position of the shoulder stock to avoid &quot;hammer bite&quot;.

Small numbers of M1932s were supplied to the German Wehrmacht during World War II, who designated it the M712.

The US National Firearms Act of 1934 placed a $200 tax on select-fire weapons (&quot;machine guns&quot;), making exports of the &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; guns to the US impractical since at the time this was roughly half the cost of a new car. After World War II, importers sold a semi-automatic conversion of the detachable magazine &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; that was made for the US surplus market. The versions imported from China were built on new semi-auto-only frames; the ATF treats them under the law as new guns and not under the curio and relic exemption.

===PASAM machine pistol===
The Brazilian government bought five-hundred 7.63mm M1932 &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; machine pistols for the &quot;Policia Militar do Distrito Federal&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Federal District Military Police&quot;) during the mid-1930s. The PASAM (&quot;pistola automática semi-automática Mauser&quot;, or &quot;semi-automatic / automatic Mauser pistol&quot;) used the M1932 as its base but made a few alterations. The controls were the same as the standard model, except the markings were in Portuguese. The selector switch (found on the left side, above the trigger guard) was marked &quot;N&quot; for &quot;normal&quot; (&quot;average&quot;, or semi-automatic) and &quot;R&quot; for &quot;rápido&quot; (&quot;rapid&quot;, or fully automatic). The safety control lever (found to the left of the hammer) was marked &quot;S&quot; for &quot;seguro&quot; (&quot;safe&quot;) and &quot;F&quot; for &quot;fogo&quot; (&quot;fire&#x27;). It was used with Brazilian State Military Police (Polícia Militar) forces in the 1980s. They preferred to use it as a semi-automatic carbine and reserved its full-auto setting for emergencies due to its recoil and muzzle-climb.

In 1970, the &quot;Policia Militar do Rio de Janeiro&quot; (PMRJ) asked the services of Jener Damau Arroyo, a Spanish-born gunsmith, to make modifications on their PASAMs in order to improve their handling. The first modification (PASAM MOD-1), of which 101 were modified, received a metal frame extension welded to the magazine housing. It was fitted with a metal forward grip well ahead of the gun under the muzzle. The original grip was left alone, making it compatible with the wooden holster/stock. The second modification (PASAM MOD-2), involving 89 pistols, featured a similar frame extension, but the forward grip had wooden panels and was of a different shape. The pistol grip frame used thicker rectangular wooden grips and had a &quot;t-bar&quot; metal shoulder stock welded to it. A metal frame attached to the receiver supported a rectangular wooden foregrip, taking pressure off the barrel. In both models the barrel was left free to enable its short recoil during firing. (Two hundred and ninety five PASAMs were left in the original condition). The weapon took standard detachable 10-round box magazines, although they can also take the extended 20- and 40-round magazines.

==Notable copies==
===Chinese C.96 (7.63mm Mauser)===
The most common and popular pistol in China since the beginning of the Republic in 1909, was the Mauser C96, called the &quot;Box Cannon&quot; (盒子炮) in Chinese. It was imported from Germany and Spain (Astra 900 and MM31), but mostly produced locally in various arsenals, the larger being in Hanyang, Shanghai, Gongxian, Shanxi. They were often used with a detachable shoulder stock. Hanyang alone produced around 13,000 copies.

===Shanxi Type 17 (.45 ACP)===
During the Warlord era of Chinese history in the early 20th century, the province of Shanxi was ruled by warlord Yan Xishan, who had established a modern arms factory in his capital city of Taiyuan. Yan was equipping his troops with a locally-produced copy of the Thompson submachine gun, chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge, but was experiencing supply difficulties as his troops&#x27; sidearms were 7.63mm calibre C96 handguns.

Yan&#x27;s solution was to produce a .45 ACP caliber version of the C96, thus standardizing ammunition and making supply logistics easier. Designated &quot;Type 17&quot;, production of the .45 caliber handgun began in 1928 at the Taiyuan Arsenal and ended in 1931. They are inscribed (in Chinese) &quot;Type 17&quot; on the left-hand side of the gun, and &quot;Republic Year Eighteen, Made in Shansi&quot; on the right-hand side. They were issued (along with Thompson SMGs) to railway guards in the province as a defense against bandits and other warlords.

Besides being chambered for a larger cartridge, the Shanxi .45 pistols use a noticeably larger frame than their 7.63mm counterparts, with the 10-round magazine extending below the trigger guard and a 140 mm (5.5 in) barrel. It was loaded using two five-round stripper clips rather than the single 10-round stripper clips of the standard 7.63mm Mauser. Because of the overall increase in size, Type 17 pistols share no interchangeable parts with any other C96 variant.

Most of the Shanxi .45 pistols were melted down after the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, largely due to their odd caliber for Chinese communist standards, but a few examples were exported overseas for sale on the commercial market. Approximately 8,500 Shanxi .45 caliber broomhandle pistols are believed to have been produced by the Taiyuan Arsenal, but there is some debate as to how many of the Shanxi .45 calibre broomhandle pistols currently on the commercial market were actually produced for Yan&#x27;s troops, and how many are more recent productions for the US collectors&#x27; market.

===Type 80 (7.62mm Tokarev)===
===Astra Model 900 / 901 / 902 / 903===
===ETAI / Royal Model H===
Produced by Beistegui Hermanos in Eibar, Spain, this was the first pseudo-Mauser on the market, a relatively crude semi-auto appearing in 1926 and full-auto variants appearing in 1927. Mechanically, it was laid out approximately like the Mauser original, but without the removable lock frame. Internal parts (trigger, hammer, safety lever, etc.) pivoted on pins and screws extending through the frame. The screws also held the frame together. The bolt was of round cross-section, unlike the square Mauser bolt. The weapon was stamped with either &quot;Royal&quot; or &quot;ETAI&quot;.

Clones were made in China.

===Royal MM31 (Model 1)===
Beistigui introduced an improved version of the Model H as the MM31 – the Modelo Military 1931. It included a number of improvements. A 20-round fixed magazine version was quickly introduced, followed by a detachable magazine version, to address the issues inherent to a gun with a 10-round magazine and a 900 rounds per minute rate of fire.

===Royal MM31 (Model 2)===
This was a much closer copy of the Mauser original than the ETAI/Royal model and variants, with the full separate lock frame. It is of much better quality than the earlier gun, though still not at Mauser level. The MM31 was manufactured until 1934. A total of about 10,000 were made, in perhaps four successive variants. These models came in semi-auto and semi-auto/full auto selective fire variants.

===Royal MM34===
This model is much like the MM31, but adds a mechanical rate reducer inside the grip area and a three-position lever to select the firing rate. It also has a ribbed barrel to help prevent overheating during sustained full auto fire. Only a few hundred of these weapons were made and are very rare today.

===Azul and Super Azul===
The Azul and Super Azul pistols were also manufactured by Beistegui Hermanos in Eibar, Spain, but sold by Eulogio Arostegui. The Azul was a copy of the standard C96 while the Super Azul is a semi auto/full auto select fire variant. Each accept detachable box magazines instead of having an internal box magazine.

===Federal Ordnance M713 and M714===
In the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the Federal Ordnance firearms company in South El Monte, California, made reproductions of the Mauser 1917 trench carbine and C96 pistol, named the M713 and M714 respectively.

The M713 came in a standard variant with a fixed stock and magazine, as well as a &quot;deluxe&quot; variant which has a detachable stock and detachable box magazines. The M714 supports detachable box magazines, unlike the original C96, and a &quot;Bolo&quot; variant, with the &quot;Bolo&quot; model having a shorter barrel and grip. All variants of the M713 and M714 were available in 7.63×25mm and 9×19mm ammunition.

==Cultural significance==
The broomhandle Mauser is a popular collector&#x27;s gun. It was popularized in Soviet films as the iconic weapon of the Russian revolution and civil war. The C96 frequently appears as a &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;exotic&quot; pistol in a number of films (such as &quot;The Great Silence&quot;, where Jean-Louis Trintignant&#x27;s use of the C96 intentionally contrasts with the Colt Single Action Army revolvers used by the other characters in the film) and TV shows, owing to its distinctive and instantly recognizable shape.

The gun is depicted as a standard sidearm for Turkish officers in the film, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, and a wounded, disoriented Turkish officer fires one at Lawrence after he de-rails the Turkish train. Author Ian Fleming outfitted agents of SMERSH in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series with Mausers on the advice of firearms expert Geoffrey Boothroyd. The C96 was the inspiration for the Buck Rogers Atomic Pistol in the movie serial and the comic, and a popular toy version was produced in 1934 by the Daisy Manufacturing Company. A C96 was modified to form Han Solo&#x27;s prop blaster pistol for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (under the name BlasTech DL-44 heavy blaster pistol). Han Solo&#x27;s Star Wars blaster was created from a Mauser C96 pistol with a shortened barrel fitted with a MG81 flash hider and a Hensoldt-Wetzlar scope. Reproductions of the blaster became so popular in the cosplay community that gun collectors became aware that fans were buying and altering increasingly rare original Mausers to make blaster replicas. The gun also figures prominently in the films &quot;Sitting Target&quot;, &quot;Brannigan&quot;, and &quot;Joe Kidd&quot;. The Japanese toy maker &quot;Epoch Co.&quot; created a dedicated video game console in 1977, the TV Game System 10, which includes as a light gun a plastic replica of a Mauser C96; the C96 replica was also usable with its next console, the Epoch Cassette Vision, created in 1981. The C96 was used by Vlado Chernozemski to assassinate the Yugoslav king Alexander I in Marseilles in 1934.
